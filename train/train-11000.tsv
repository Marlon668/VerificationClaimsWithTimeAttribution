pomt-06565	"Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare!"	false	/florida/statements/2011/sep/30/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-florida-first-state-require-d/	"Hooray for Florida !!!!" A recent chain e-mail cheers on the Gov. Rick Scott policy that may need it least — drug-testing needy Floridians who apply for cash aid. The new law, signed by the governor May 31, 2011, got a thumbs-up from 71 percent of Floridians in a September 2011 poll, including 90 percent of Republicans. The viral e-mail message lays it on thick, beginning: "Great going, Florida. You set the stage for the other 49 States to join! Kudos to Republican Governor Rick Scott for having the correctness and guts to move forward on this critical issue ! "Hooray for Florida ! ! "I-95 will be jammed for the next month or so........Druggies and deadbeats heading North out of Florida .. "Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare!" Our eyes lit upon the message's first factual claim: "Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare!" Is this true? We asked some experts, but not before doing a quick Web search to see if we might find some of the message's genesis. At least three sentences of the chain e-mail, it turns out, appear to be lifted directly from a June New York Daily News article. But that article doesn't address the claim we're checking, that Florida "is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare." For that, we turned to the Florida Senate's final analysis, the National Conference of State Legislatures and the American Civil Liberties Union. Florida's law deals with part of what used to be known as welfare: It's a cash assistance program funded by federal block grants called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Back in 1996, as part of federal welfare reform, the government told states they could use drug testing as part of eligibility for the block grant programs. (On the other hand, they weren't allowed to add new hurdles for collecting food.) Florida's law requires applicants for cash aid to pay for their own drug tests. If they pass, the cost of the testing is added to their benefits. If they fail, they're disqualified from cash aid for a year, though with drug abuse treatment they can reapply in six months. The caseload is now down 11 percent from September 2010. Was Florida the first to try such testing, more than a decade after welfare reform? The answer is no. Michigan instituted mandatory drug tests for all welfare applicants — in 1999. But that kind of "suspicionless" testing, without any reason to believe people were using drugs in the first place, was struck down in 2003 by a Michigan appeals court. That discouraged other states. So while many have considered more drug-testing since the '90s, very few have passed laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan group that represents state lawmakers. A 2002 survey, for example, showed that a handful of states — such as Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and Wisconsin — tested only people who have been convicted of a drug felony. Still, the proposals, sometimes pitched as a cost-saving measure, are popular. In 2009, more than 20 states proposed requiring drug tests as a condition of eligibility for public assistance, according to NCSL. In 2010, at least 12 did. No laws emerged. But this year, with at least 36 states considering drug-testing proposals, three are now law. In addition to Florida's mandatory suspicionless testing, Arizona and Missouri now screen applicants they have reasonable cause to believe are taking illegal drugs, though Arizona's requirement is temporary. Meanwhile, Florida's law — the first requiring testing regardless of suspicion since Michigan's program was struck down — is under legal challenge. The ACLU has sued Florida to stop what it considers "unreasonable and suspicionless searches" that violate the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Our ruling In 1996, Congress said states could test welfare recipients for illegal drug use. In 1999, Michigan was the first state to require all applicants to take drug tests, regardless of suspicion. But that law was struck down as unconstitutional, discouraging other states from requiring similar testing. This year, Florida became the first state to try mandatory drug screening of all applicants after Michigan's legal loss, while Arizona and Missouri enacted laws to test applicants they suspect might use drugs. A chain e-mail claims, "Florida is the first state requiring drug testing to receive welfare!" It is the first one — since the last one, which was Michigan. Meanwhile, other states also require drug-testing for some applicants. We rule this e-mail's claim False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2011-09-30T15:36:07	2011-09-24	['None']

pomt-14528	Says Hillary Clinton won "health care for 8 million children."	mostly true	/colorado/statements/2016/feb/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-wrong-sanders-claim/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is airing a new TV ad in Colorado that touts her battle-tested preparation for "the toughest job in the world." "The world a president has to grapple with, sometimes you can't even imagine," a narrator says in the 30-second ad, which begins with images of protest in a foreign land, a war zone and a tornado churning near vehicles on a roadway. The ad says the former first lady, senator and secretary of state is "the one who's proven she can get it done," ticking off a string of achievements. We’re focusing on a single claim, that one of the things Clinton got done was "winning health care for 8 million children." Clinton has often cited this achievement. During the 2008 presidential campaign, PolitiFact rated one campaign ad as Half True because it implied she’d single-handedly "stood up for universal health care when almost no one else would." In another instance, we rated her comment True because she qualified her claim, saying she "helped" create the children’s health coverage program -- along with others. Let’s revisit the facts. It's correct that the Children’s Health Insurance Program -- known as CHIP -- provides health care coverage to more than 8 million children, according to Medicaid. Created in 1997, when it was known as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, it promotes health coverage for low-income children by providing federal funding to states. The current ad gives Clinton credit for "winning" legislation that congressional lawmakers passed when she was first lady. Her campaign website has a more nuanced statement: "As first lady, she refused to give up when Congress defeated health care reform. Instead, she worked with Republicans and Democrats to help create the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which now provides health coverage to more than 8 million children. Senator Ted Kennedy said that if not for Hillary, the Children’s Health Insurance Program wouldn’t be in existence today." The late-Sen. Kennedy received much of the credit for CHIP because the Massachusetts Democrat shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch was the lead Republican co-sponsor. Yet, in 2007, Kennedy told the Associated Press that Hillary Clinton played a critical role. "The children's health program wouldn't be in existence today if we didn't have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue," Kennedy said. Nick Littlefield, a senior health adviser to Kennedy at the time, agreed. "She wasn't a legislator, she didn't write the law, and she wasn't the president, so she didn't make the decisions," Littlefield told the Associated Press. "But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it." But the new Clinton ad has no qualifiers, stating "she's the one who's proven she can get it done… winning health care for 8 million children." Our ruling A Clinton campaign ad says one of her accomplishments was "winning health care for 8 million children." That statement is largely accurate. Clinton was key to creating the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage for 8 million children. But the ad leaves out the contributions of others. Because of that caveat, we rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-02-17T15:03:55	2016-02-15	['None']
pomt-00459	Says "former Democrat Kelli Ward attacked President Trump's plans to crack down on illegal immigration, saying Trump was making a mistake."	mostly false	/arizona/statements/2018/aug/16/martha-mcsally/did-kelli-ward-attack-donald-trumps-plans-crack-do/	Rep. Martha McSally told Arizona voters that her top Republican opponent for U.S. Senate is a former liberal who stood in the way of President Donald Trump’s plan to tackle illegal immigration. "Who will stand with President Trump? Former Democrat Kelli Ward attacked President Trump's plans to crack down on illegal immigration, saying Trump was making a mistake. And Ward supports amnesty," said the narrator in an ad launched by McSally’s campaign. The ad claims that contrary to Ward, McSally does stand with Trump, and features a brief clip of Trump calling McSally "the real deal." McSally, former state senator Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio are all vying in the Aug. 28 Republican primary for the seat being vacated by Republican Sen. Jeff Flake. Has Ward attacked Trump, as McSally claimed? The ad misleads. Ward did say Trump was mistaken — but not on his overall plan to combat illegal immigration. Her comment was about Trump’s support of bills backed by McSally. Ward, who supports Trump’s border wall promise and strategy to deter illegal immigration, criticized those bills as granting "amnesty without border security first." Here are the facts. What Ward said about border security Let’s clear whether Ward is a former Democrat, as McSally called her. Ward registered as a Democrat in West Virginia when she was 18 years old, but switched to the Republican Party in her early 20s, said her spokesman Zachery Henry. Ward is now 49. McSally’s claim that Ward attacked Trump’s immigration plan goes back to a July 2018 candidates’ interview with the editorial board of the Arizona Republic. We listened to the audio. In the interview, Ward makes it clear that her criticism is of legislative proposals — not of Trump or his goal of stopping illegal immigration. McSally: "(Ward’s) been attacking me on my leadership on border security issues and attacking the bills that I led on and voted for, those are bills that President Trump supported, so you are attacking President Trump’s supported bills." Ward: "As I said, when President Trump goes down the wrong way, he has to have the right guidance and the right advisers nearby to say, ‘Hey, let's take another look at this,’ not in a way that’s attacking him." McSally: "Ah, so he was mistaken by supporting these bills?" Ward: "Well, I think so, because they were amnesty bills. I don't know how they were presented to him, but I can tell you that in reading the bills they were big amnesty bills, between 69,000 and 2.2 million granted amnesty without border security first. So, those bills should be attacked and they will continue to be attacked because they need to be exposed for what they are." Ward’s spokesman said Ward was referring to two measures: Securing America’s Future Act of 2018 and the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2018. Securing America’s Future Act, cosponsored by McSally and supported by Trump, included a $38 billion trust fund for border security and $18 billion for the wall. The bill came up for a House vote in June as lawmakers attempted to find a solution for "Dreamers," immigrants in the country illegally who came to the United States as children. The bill would have allowed certain Dreamers to get a three-year renewable nonimmigrant status; but immigrant advocates criticized it for not laying out a path toward citizenship, and conservatives said it offered amnesty. The bill failed 193-231. The Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2018 also failed in the House in June, 121-301. It included about $25 billion for border security, a path toward citizenship for Dreamers under a points-based system, proposed keeping children in immigration detention with their parents, and eliminated some avenues of legal immigration, such as the diversity visa program and certain family-based visa categories. Conservative opponents of the bill said it would grant amnesty to millions of immigrants, while immigrant advocates said it did not cover enough Dreamers and allowed indefinite detention of immigrant children. Ward’s opposition to these bills wasn’t about border funding; she believed they provided amnesty to immigrants in the country illegally. McSally's campaign argued that Ward supports amnesty because Ward has said she'd let Dreamers, beneficiaries of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, stay in the United States. In a January 2018 opinion piece, Ward wrote, "Only after the border wall is completed should Congress work on a path to potential legalization of individual DACA recipients, and only current DACA recipients who have been properly vetted." Overall, Ward has campaigned in support of Trump’s border wall and against illegal immigration. Our ruling A McSally campaign ad against Ward said, "Former Democrat Kelli Ward attacked President Trump's plans to crack down on illegal immigration, saying Trump was making a mistake." Ward registered as a Democrat when she was 18 years old but became a Republican in her early 20s. Ward supports Trump’s border wall promise. She opposed bills that included funding for border security, because she believed they provided amnesty, not because they included border security measures. Ward said Trump’s mistake was supporting the bills. McSally’s ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00191	Says "only one other senator from either party over the last 25 years" has "a worse record on bipartisanship" than Ted Cruz.	true	/texas/statements/2018/oct/18/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-says-ted-cruz-has-second-worst-bipart/	Beto O’Rourke of El Paso, the Democratic U.S. House member challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, charged Cruz with setting a crummy course by infrequently teaming with Democrats. In the pair’s second debate, O’Rourke pointed out that Cruz missed many votes while running for president after winning his Senate seat in 2012. O’Rourke said next: "There’s only one other senator from either party over the last 25 years who has a worse record, who has a worse record on bipartisanship. In other words, Ted Cruz has a harder time working with members across the aisle than almost anyone else to get anything done." We wondered about the basis of O'Rourke's historical claim. O’Rourke points to ‘bipartisan index’ By email, Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign told us O'Rourke based his statement on a "bipartisan lifetime index" calculated by the Lugar Center, which is part of Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy. An October 2018 Dallas Morning News profile of Cruz cited the index and said: "From 1993 to 2016, the only senator of either party who worked less often across the aisle was South Carolina’s Jim DeMint, a tea party godfather who recruited and promoted Cruz for the 2012 race in Texas, before moving on to run the conservative Heritage Foundation." Next, we confirmed Cruz’s next-to-worst ranking by reviewing the center’s online post of lifetime bipartisan index scores of senators covering 1993 through 2016. Other current senators scoring poorly, per the index: Mike Lee, R-Utah; Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont; Rand Paul, R-Kentucky; Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin; and Ed Markey, D-Mass. Lowest-Scoring Senators, Bipartisan Index (1993 through 2016) Senator (by score) Rank Name State Party Congresses Score SOURCE: Web page, "The Lugar Center - McCourt School Bipartisan Index (1992-2016)," the Lugar Center, McCourt School of Public Policy, Georgetown University, undated (accessed Oct. 17, 2018) In 2017 alone, Cruz ranked 85th among senators, per the index, outpacing Republican Sens. Luther Strange and Richard Shelby, both of Alabama, as well as 11 Democrats including Sanders, the Senate’s least bipartisan member. Methodology And how is each bipartisanship score reached? According to the center, it reaches its bipartisanship scores based on tallying each senators sponsorships and co-sponsorships. "A bipartisan sponsorship," the center says, "is defined as the introduction of a bill that attracts cosponsors from the opposing party. Similarly, a bipartisan co-sponsorship is the act of a congressional member adding his or her name in support of a bill introduced by a member of the opposing party." Next, each senator’s bipartisan co-sponsorships are divided into his or her total co-sponsorships with a similar ratio calculated for sponsorships. "Attracting a single cosponsor from the opposing party is the most important threshold for bipartisanship," the center says, "but some bills are more bipartisan than others. Bipartisan Intensity rewards members for introducing bills that receive more support from the opposing party, but with diminishing returns." The center’s scores do not consider ceremonial bills or local legislation, such as proposals naming post offices. They also are statistically weighted and standardized for such things as political party, so as not to unfairly disadvantage scores of the current party in power. That’s because minority party members generally can’t move legislation without getting a sponsor from the party in power -- and therefore, they could appear to be more bipartisan. Finer calculations are described here. The center further says on its web page that the index "at its core is quite simple. Members of Congress can increase their score either by actively seeking out agreeable ideas proposed by the opposite party or by drafting legislation that is likely to attract members of the other party. The Index rewards those who prioritize governance over posturing and aims to encourage members of Congress to seek areas of consensus as opposed to simply using legislation to delineate differences." Center analyst: O'Rourke accurately recapped findings When we sought elaboration, the center’s Dan Diller noted by email that the index doesn’t judge whether individual proposals are bipartisan in themselves. "Members succeed and fail on the index according to objective measurements of how often they cross the line to work with the other party at bill introduction. A member's score will go up if they secure opposite party co-sponsors or seek out a good bill to co-sponsor that was introduced by the other side," Diller said. "On that basis, Ted Cruz does have the second worst lifetime score (239th out of 240 Senators) over the period covered by our Index (1993-2016). That is a fact," Diller wrote. Diller elaborated: "We believe compromise is an essential part of the legislative process. But beyond that, 50% of the Bipartisan Index score measures a senator's ability to get broad support for their own ideas (as evidenced by co-sponsors attracted from the other party to their bills). So in essence if a member brags about a low Bipartisan Index score, they are bragging that their own bills have a limited appeal. They are acknowledging that they are offering ‘message bills’ designed to appeal to the base, rather than making a real attempt to address problems through legislation," Diller said. Diller, asked about Cruz’s 2017 ranking not being nearly worst, said the Texan’s negative 1.03 score for the year still should be considered "very poor." Diller said any score below zero "is considered partisan because it is below the historical baseline. Anything below. -.05 is considered poor. Anything below -1.00 is considered very poor. Usually -1.00 will rank in the bottom 20% of any Congress, as it does in this case," Diller wrote. Tallying 2017 cosponsorships with Democrats Wondering how frequently Cruz tried to team with Democrats in 2017, we searched the GovTrack.us website and identified 21 Democratic-authored measures cosponsored by Cruz that year including the Israel Anti-Boycott Act offered by Sen. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md. and the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018 sponsored by Sen. Kamela Harris, D-Calif. Another search showed that the senator with the year’s highest bipartisan index score, Susan Collins, R-Me., co-sponsored 133 Democratic-authored proposals. The other Texas senator, Republican John Cornyn, co-sponsored 33 Democratic-initiated measures, GovTrack.us says. A political scientist’s take We asked Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist specializing in legislative politics and political parties, to comment on the center's bipartisanship scores. By email, Koger called the scoring fair. He further suggested that O’Rourke’s claim is supported by Cruz’s record. "From the day he was sworn in as a U.S. senator, Cruz seemed intent on running for president as the only national politician willing to fight his own party for conservative goals," Koger wrote. "That is, he sought to make every other Republican senator look like a weak sell-out by publicly opposing bipartisan compromise, particularly on the fiscal year 2014 budget. He was the public leader of the Republicans who advocated for a government shutdown in October 2013. This shutdown was bad for the Republican Party's image and for the governance of the country, but Cruz achieved his personal goal of displaying his willingness to blow up bipartisan compromises." After this fact-check published, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that the senator has worked on substantial bipartisan legislation including proposals to combat sexual assault, reauthorize NASA and champion civil rights. Our ruling O’Rourke said that "only one other senator from either party over the last 25 years" has "a worse record on bipartisanship" than Cruz. That conclusion is backed up by an index based on sponsorships and co-sponsorships of substantive legislation computed by the Georgetown University center named after Richard Lugar, the former Indiana senator.

pomt-05772	Claims Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said "she prefers the South African Constitution over the United States Constitution."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/28/rick-santorum/santorum-supreme-court-justice-prefers-south-afric/	A political rally drew Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum to First Redeemer Church in Forsyth County, not Sunday services. So instead of teaching the Bible on Feb. 19, he preached on the U.S. Constitution and what he thinks is an effort by liberals to push it aside. Santorum’s example was U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is widely considered among the most liberal justices. He asked his audience of 3,000 whether they heard what she said the other day, and they erupted into boos and guffaws. "So she prefers the South African Constitution over the United States Constitution. A Supreme Court justice says we should be recommending to the world a South African view," Santorum told them. More boos. Did she really say that? PolitiFact Florida wrote about a similar accusation by that state’s U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican. He said Ginsburg suggested that some U.S. cases will be decided based on South African law. PolitiFact Florida found that Rubio was referring to a recent interview she gave on Egyptian television in which she mentioned the South African Constitution. Our Florida counterparts watched it and found that her point didn’t relate to decisions about U.S. cases at all. Rubio earned a False. Santorum’s claim is somewhat different. He accused Ginsburg of saying that she "prefers" the South African Constitution. We reviewed her statement to see whether Santorum was right. We found she said no such thing. First, some context. After a popular uprising and the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, Egypt is in the midst of writing a new constitution. Ginsburg went to Egypt in January to meet with Egyptian judges and legal experts, and while there gave an interview to Al Hayat TV. Much of the interview, which lasted about 15 minutes, focused on how Ginsburg would advise Egyptians to write their own constitution. Ginsburg’s lengthy, nuanced responses repeatedly praised the values, concepts and language of the U.S. Constitution and called the people who wrote it "some of the most brilliant minds of the day " Ginsburg warned that a constitution means "nothing unless the people are yearning for liberty and freedom." She emphasized the importance of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment and of the separation of powers between Congress, the president and the judiciary that it created. Ginsburg also pointed out that a long time had passed between the passage of the U.S. Constitution and Egypt’s current efforts. "I can’t speak about what the Egyptian experience should be, because I’m operating under a rather old constitution," Ginsburg said early in the interview. "The United States in comparison to Egypt is a very new nation, and yet we have the oldest written constitution still enforced in the world. And it’s a constitution that starts out with three wonderful words: ‘We the people.’ " South Africa came up when Al Hayat asked whether Egypt should incorporate parts of other countries’ constitutions in its draft constitution. "Would your honor’s advice be that a society like ours, with what we call -- what we like to call -- a transition to the second republic, would your honor’s advice be to get part or use other countries’ constitutions? "Maybe the United States or other countries as a model? Or [that] we come up with our own methods and our own draft?" the interviewer asked. Ginsburg replied: "You should certainly be aided by all the constitution writing that has gone on since the end of World War II. I would not look to the U.S. Constitution if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012. I might look at the constitution of South Africa. "That was a deliberate attempt to have a fundamental instrument of government that embraced basic human rights [and] had an independent judiciary. It really is, I think, a great piece of work that was done. "Much more recently than the U.S. Constitution is Canada, [which] has a charter of rights and freedoms [and] dates from 1982. You would almost certainly look at the European Convention on Human Rights. … I'm a very strong believer in listening and learning from others.'' At no point during the interview did Ginsburg say that she prefers the South African Constitution to the U.S. one. Her point was that it’s better for Egypt to base its constitution on more recent ones written after Word War II. Santorum claimed that Ginsburg said she "prefers the South African Constitution over the United States Constitution." She never said that she did. What Ginsburg did do was give a nuanced opinion of what rights and concepts a good constitution should embody. Although Ginsburg said that Egypt should draw from newer constitutions, she made a concerted effort to praise key concepts of the U.S. Constitution, such as an independent judiciary and the ideas embodied by the words "We the people." Santorum’s take on Ginsburg’s comments twisted a handful of words to mean something that they did not. He earns a False.

pomt-10082	"Sen. Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/03/john-mccain/obamas-no-maverick/	(Published Oct. 8, 2008) John McCain has a well-earned reputation for bucking his own party in the Senate, most prominently on campaign finance reform and immigration. So McCain has tried in the campaign to draw a contrast with his Democratic opponent, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, whom McCain says always toes the Democratic party line. McCain made the point again at the second presidential debate in Nashville. "Sen. Obama has never taken on his party leaders on a single major issue," McCain said. Limiting our examination to Obama's four years in the U.S. Senate, it would seem that McCain is on mostly solid ground, even if his claim is one that the Obama campaign hotly disputes. The Obama campaign cites a few examples where Obama crossed up his party, including an Obama-backed effort in the Senate in 2006 and 2007 to create an independent Office of Public Integrity to investigate congressional ethics cases. Most Democrats voted for the new office in 2006, then a small majority opposed it in 2007, so Obama hardly could be seen as one against the crowd. And our view is that the votes Obama cites on the office cannot be called a "major issue" since the ethics office was mostly a secondary point in a much broader fight over ethics reform that most Democrats supported. Ultimately, the Senate passed a broad bill on ethics in 2007 that did not provide for the new office. The Obama campaign also points to a vote in February 2005 in which he sided with Republicans and a narrow minority of his caucus in favor of a bill to give federal courts jurisdiction over some class action cases. The bill was opposed by Democratic allies in the plaintiffs' bar. But this again, was hardly a vote in which Obama stood too far apart from his caucus. Eighteen Democrats supported the bill against 26 opposed. And this wasn't an issue where Obama was particularly outspoken, so it can hardly be argued that he had "taken on his party leaders" on tort reform. Finally, the Obama campaign cites Obama's 2005 vote to confirm Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state, but Senate Democrats overwhelmingly favored her confirmation. The final vote among Democrats was 32 in favor of confirmation, 12 opposed. Congressional Quarterly each year tallies what it considers the key votes that took place in the previous 12 months. Of the 41 Senate votes tallied by CQ between 2005 and 2007, Obama sided with a majority of his caucus on 36 of them. On three, he did not vote. On one, he voted with 21 colleagues against the nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court, a vote that evenly divided the Democratic caucus. And last, there was the 2005 tort reform vote. CQ did not consider the Office of Public Integrity votes to be among the most important of 2006 or 2007. None of the examples the Obama campaign provides could be seen as major issues on which Obama was at odds with his party leadership. Certainly nothing on the scale of McCain's unpopular positions on immigration and campaign finance reform, among others.

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., saying gunmen will lay down their weapons when they see their victims are unarmed is fabricated. The page Principle News shared the quote in a post on Sept. 17. It quotes Feinstein as saying, "When the gunman realizes that nobody else is armed, he will lay down his weapons and turn himself in. That's human nature." This image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The statement on the meme about gunman is a fabricated quote that first appeared February 2013 on the website Palookaville Post. The story appeared after Feinstein proposed a bill that would "ban the sale, transfer, manufacturing or importation of 150 specific firearms." The material from the Palookaville Post article was quoted on several websites. The original website doesn’t operate now, but the full article can be found in the archive of the WayBack Machine. It is bylined by a fake author "Jimmy Olsentwins." The website itself was satirical and mostly active in 2013.

abbc-00254	Finance Minister Mathias Cormann evoked memories of the Cold War when he gave a speech to the Sydney Institute on the evening of August 23, on the subject of "Policies for Opportunity vs Politics of Envy".	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-20/fact-check3a-are-labor27s-policies-socialist3f/8948552	Senator Cormann's claim is sensationalist. There is no settled definition of "socialism" or "socialist policies". Socialism is a collection of ideas that have been subject to vigorous debate since the 19th century. One form of socialism is centred around public (i.e. government) ownership of "the means of production, distribution and exchange". The Australian Labor Party's national platform has long included an objective of "democratic socialism" along these lines "to the extent necessary", but it is not reflected in the party's current policies. Labor is not proposing nationalisation of Australian industries. A broader definition of socialism includes policies that use the taxation system to redistribute income and espouse government intervention in the market economy. On that basis, some of Labor's policies are, strictly speaking, "socialist". The current British Labour Party leadership and US Senator Bernie Sanders argue for similar policies, and openly describe them as socialist. But Senator Cormann goes too far when he talks of the Berlin Wall and the "system of government" that existed in Eastern Europe between 1945 and 1989. That failed totalitarian and oppressive system bears no resemblance to the policies of Australia's Labor Party.

pomt-02370	Says Abraham Lincoln tried to buy slaves' freedom in border states, but the states "all rejected it."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/18/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-lincoln-tried-buy-slaves-free-them/	Buying slaves to set them free is a much better fit with libertarian thinking than the use of force. That’s why in his recent debate with The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart, libertarian pundit Andrew Napolitano argued that Lincoln "could have bought the slaves." "Buying the slaves’ freedom is not as true as you might believe," Stewart rebutted. "He offered them money for their slaves, in the border states -- those are the ones that hadn’t even seceded yet -- and they refused." We’re checking several claims from the debate between Napolitano and Stewart. Here, we’re looking at Stewart’s claim that Abraham Lincoln tried to buy slaves freedom in border states, but the states "all rejected it." We asked Columbia University historian Eric Foner. "During the first two years of the war Lincoln repeatedly offered ‘compensated emancipation’ to the border slave states that remained in the Union and any Confederate states interested," Foner said. "But they all rejected it. Lincoln was willing to pay but Southerners were not willing to give up their slaves, for money or for any other reason." We enlisted the help of historians, and history buffs on reddit, and they pointed us to Lincoln’s request to Congress in 1862 for money to buy the freedom of slaves. Here’s how that proposal began: "Resolved that the United States ought to co-operate with any state which may adopt gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such state pecuniary aid, to be used by such state in its discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences public and private, produced by such change of system." Republicans passed that over the objection of Democrats. Richard Striner, professor of history at Washington College, wrote that this resolution was Lincoln’s second attempt to pay slave owners to free their slaves. A year earlier, he had tried to get Delaware to pass a bill that would have cleared the way for Washington to spend $719,200 to free the state’s entire slave population, about 1,800 at that time. The bill failed in the Delaware Legislature. In one odd case, Lincoln personally offered to buy a slave from an owner in Kentucky. Kentucky was on the Union side but was unwilling to emancipate the slaves that lived there. In late 1862, when an escaped slave found refuge with a Union army regiment, and the Kentucky owner demanded his return, Lincoln wrote to the owner, "I will pay you any sum not to exceed $500." Unusual circumstances surrounded this move by the president. The owner was a former member of Congress and former Kentucky Supreme Court justice. Lincoln had issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation two months earlier and wanted to head off a dispute in Kentucky. As it turned out, the owner refused Lincoln’s offer. The slave was not returned. Our ruling Stewart said Lincoln tried to free slaves in the border states by buying them. The record bears this out. Lincoln tried in Delaware and won congressional approval to apply the principle to all states. But with no slave owners willing to come to the table, the effort failed. The result was the Emancipation Proclamation. We rate the claim True.	None	Jon Stewart	None	None	None	2014-03-18T12:09:16	2014-03-11	['None']
pomt-08318	Lizbeth Benacquisto's supporters "would make (abortion) illegal in all cases, including rape, incest, even to save a woman's life."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/29/kevin-rader/kevin-rader-says-extremist-groups-support-opponent/	In stark, black-and-white montages of tear-streaked female faces, District 27 state senate hopeful Kevin Rader blasts his Republican opponent in a campaign ad for her anti-abortion views. Rader, a Democrat and state House member, accuses Republican Lizbeth Benacquisto of strongly opposing abortion and having ties to extremist conservative groups that would criminally prosecute rape victims for having abortions. "Lizbeth Benacquisto strongly opposes a woman's right of choice," the ad states. "The extremist groups who support her would make these women into criminals. She supported an extreme law to require pregnant women to pay for and view a sonogram before they could exercise their right of choice. Her allies would make choice illegal in all cases, including rape, incest, even to save a woman's life. Vote no on Benacquisto, keep extremism out of our state Senate." The ad enraged Benacquisto, a city councilwoman in Wellington, who responded with her own ad and the revelation that she was raped 23 years ago as a University of Florida freshman. She underscored her support for an exception to abortion for rape victims, saying she would "never stand down when any woman has been abused," and demanded Rader pull the ad. Rader's camp said the only way that will happen is if Benacquisto renounces the support given to her by far-right, conservative right-to-life groups. With such a high emotion level in this campaign, we thought Rader's claim about Benacquisto's supporters was worth a look. Benacquisto is pro-life, and she makes no secret of it on her website and in questionnaires. Same with her support of the ultrasound legislation, though she has noted in various interviews she has concerns about its impact on rape victims. In a candidate questionnaire from the Christian Coalition of Florida, she added, "I consistently support this because I am pro-life." Benacquisto holds support from a handful of conservative, anti-abortion groups. Among those are the Christian Coalition, the Florida Right to Life PAC and the Christian Family Coalition. Though they haven't donated financially, both Florida Right to Life and the former Christian Coalition executive director have offered endorsements, and she headlined at least one event, a breakfast for the Christian Family Coalition on Oct. 16. Florida Right to Life believes life begins at conception and ends at natural death, and all points in between are to be defended. It labels abortion "infanticide," which is a crime. And the Christian Coalition of Florida states, "Although legal in the United States, we believe abortion is no less than murder of an innocent human life." Using this logic, abortion equals murder and murder is a crime. Therefore, those who have abortions would be criminals. The Christian Family Coalition, based in Miami, says it "works to introduce pro-family legislation at the state and local levels of government. It informs and educates citizens on where candidates stand on the issues that affect the traditional family unit." The group’s website includes a link to "abortion," but contains just news articles and press releases in which it is mentioned. Each of those three organizations also closely follows abortion-related legislation. They post opinions on everything from parental notice to making the violent death of any fetus -- viable or otherwise -- cause for a first-degree murder charge. But none appear to flat-out say they would support abortion regardless of whether a woman was raped, abused by a family member or faced with death. They skirt the issue. For example, Florida Right to Life says, "We promote, uphold and support reverence and respect for human life without regard to condition, quality, age, race, religion, color or whether born or unborn." On the National Right to Life page, the only reference to exceptions is a 2005 survey indicating only 0.5 percent of women have abortions due to rape, while 4 percent undergo it for the mother's health. Rader's campaign manager, Michael McCall, said, "The problem with something like that is if you take an organization like Florida Right to Life, their very core is making abortion illegal. They won't list every case in which they support banning abortions, because they support banning abortions in all cases." It's clear that groups supporting Benacquisto have firm stands against abortion, but they're not spelled out precisely. What is clear, though, is that the groups don't offer up any exceptions. So we don't expect Rader's campaign to find any. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Kevin Rader	None	None	None	2010-10-29T19:08:41	2010-10-29	['None']

pomt-08234	Sewer backups into basements caused the "vast majority of the damage to homes and buildings" in Milwaukee’s July floods, but federal flood insurance doesn’t cover them.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/16/jim-bohl/milwaukee-ald-jim-bohl-says-sewer-backups-caused-m/	Three months after Milwaukee’s watery nightmare, federal officials have paid out a whopping $45 million to 31,000 people with damaged residences. A presidential disaster declaration opened the money spigot. But while the floodwaters have long ago receded, controversy hasn’t. Milwaukee Alderman Jim Bohl and two colleagues, Willie Wade and Jim Witkowiak, are airing a new complaint. In a Nov. 3, 2010 news release, they punched the gift horse -- FEMA -- in the mouth for pushing federal flood insurance they say is a bad deal for most of their constituents. "Plain and simple, flood insurance does not cover damage caused by sewer discharge backups in basements, and by far that is exactly what caused the vast majority of damage to homes and buildings in Milwaukee in July," Bohl said in the release. "The fear I have is that many people will buy flood insurance that is of no use to them. I think this is selling false hope, and I think it is just wrong." Strong words. Is Bohl right that the "vast majority of damage to homes and buildings" was due sewer backups, not surface water? And that the federal insurance program is no help? First let’s clarify: That $45 million in disaster claims already paid out by the Federal Emergency Management Agency is separate from payments made by FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program. The insurance comes in handy when floods don’t rise to the level of a presidential disaster declaration. More than 1,400 people in Milwaukee County have federal flood insurance, including some who don’t live anywhere near a river or creek. In the last three decades those Milwaukee County residents paid premiums totaling $990,000 and filed claims totaling $14.4 million, FEMA says. What were those claims for? Well, none were for sewer backups, something FEMA officials acknowledge are not covered under the insurance program. Water entering your house from sewer pipes is not "flooding" under the official federal insurance definition, which starts (we’re not making this up) with: "A flood is an excess of water on land that is normally dry." Even if torrential rains cause water to infiltrate sewer pipes that back up into basements, that doesn’t count as flooding. So Bohl is right on that point. FEMA likes to stress that policies can cost as little as $119 a year, but if you ask they readily acknowledge premiums average $570 a year nationwide. They say the insurance fills in an important gap -- basic private homeowner’s insurance policies exclude flood coverage. They recommend that you use a federal website to decide if the insurance is right. The aldermen say, "buyer beware." But what about the July flooding, which dumped eight inches of rain on parts of Milwaukee. Did most of the damage come from sewer backups? Bohl, who represents a far northwest side district, provided PolitiFact Wisconsin with a log of 1,200 calls from his constituents to the city’s Department of Public Works complaining of what the city calls "backwater." In Wade’s north side district -- the hardest hit in the city -- 1,950 people reported "backwater" problems. To Bohl and Wade, the term "backwater" means water coming up from sewer pipes into a basement. DPW confirmed the number of calls, but disagrees with that interpretation. "Backwater" is just water in the basement -- from any source, including surface flooding through window wells or a basement foundation, said City Engineer Jeffrey Polenske. City public works officials do not track where the waters came from, so there is no city-wide accounting, Polenske said. So we are left with anecdotal evidence -- reports by homeowners who are on the scene of the mess, though many may not have seen exactly where water entered. Bohl, Wade and Alderman Jim Witkowiak’s aide, Michael McGuire, say sewer backups were easily the most frequent complaint at neighborhood meetings they hosted after the floods. DPW’s chief sewer design manager, Tim Thur, called it a "majority" of such complaints based on his department’s visits to those meetings. FEMA has offered no official tally of basement flooding causes. Other communities tracked their flood damage more closely and some reported a different view than that of the three aldermen. The differences reflect geography, condition of infrastructure, as well as differences in interpretation of what happened in July. Both Shorewood and Whitefish Bay said half of flood victims reported rainwater flooding as opposed to sewage flooding. In many cases that meant water invaded through window wells, foundation cracks or doorways, said Whitefish Bay assistant village manager Matt Schuenke. One-fifth or one-fourth blamed sewage, and the rest said it was a mixture. "Overland flooding was a significant factor," Schuenke said. In suburban Wauwatosa, sewage pipe backups into the basement were far more common than overland flooding, said City Engineer Bill Wehrley. But overland or surface water flooding contributes to the overload of the sanitary sewer system. If rain water pours in through a basement window and floods a basement, that water drains back into the sanitary sewer system, overloads it and sends the resulting mix of clear water and sewage up into people’s basements, he said. "You have to look at both," Wehrley said. The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District has no data on basement flooding causes, but spokesman Bill Graffin said the main culprit behind basement backups and sewer overflows is excess water getting into sanitary sewer pipes. Let’s get out of the pool, and rule on this. Bohl makes two related claims. Nobody has a clear answer on whether sewer backups into basements caused the "vast majority" of the damage. The evidence is anecdotal and contradictory, which makes Bohl’s generalization more than a little problematic. It is true that damage from sewer backups is not covered under the federal flood insurance. So Bohl’s not all wet, but he went a bit overboard.

pomt-08848	"There are currently delays of up to six months in the processing of DNA evidence at the state run crime lab."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/09/mike-dewine/gop-challenger-mike-dewine-says-bci-tests-delayed-/	A "tough on crime" reputation plays well on the campaign trail for Ohio attorney general candidates. It worked wonders for former Republican Attorney General Betty Montgomery, who won two terms in the 1990s by talking a big game about the law enforcement functions of the office. So as Democratic Attorney General Richard Cordray and his Republican challenger, Mike DeWine, battle to become Ohio's top lawyer for the next four years, both desire to be seen as the better choice for handling the law enforcement portion of the office. On DeWine's campaign website, the former prosecutor calls safety and crime prevention his top priority should he be elected. And DeWine hammers on Cordray for what he sees as inefficiency in the processing of DNA crime evidence at the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (BCI), a branch of the AG's office. "There are currently delays of up to six months in the processing of DNA evidence at the state run crime lab," DeWine states on his campaign website. We decided to check out DeWine’s statement to see if the BCI lab was really taking "up to" six months to process DNA evidence. Cordray's office told us that many factors play a role in how long it takes for results to come back. Cases where someone has been arrested, will jump ahead of cases where no one has been jailed, pushing back wait times for non-prioritized cases. Also, "case types that involve violence against a person are normally worked ahead of less violent case types," according to an e-mail from Cordray’s office. BCI statistics provided by Cordray’s office show a small portion of DNA cases cases do drag on "up to six months" and even longer. Those records also show, though, that it's far from typical. The average turnaround time in processing DNA evidence has dropped from 100 days in 2009 to 71 days in 2010. The credit goes to increased staffing resulting from filling "several" vacancies in the crime lab as well as increased use of robotics in processing the DNA evidence, according to Cordray's office. They also acknowledge that some of the DNA work is being sent to outside labs when, they say, more advanced and sophisticated testing is needed. (DeWine's campaign agrees that the average DNA evidence turnaround time is dropping in 2010, but it says that more work is being outsourced as a ploy to lower Cordray's statistics.) Sixty-five of 854 current DNA cases -- 7.6 percent -- have gone beyond the "up to" six months mark cited by DeWine. Of those 65 cases, 62 involve work being done by outside laboratories, which Cordray's office argues shouldn't count on their tally. We also asked DeWine's campaign for evidence of "up to" six month delays. They pointed us to a trio of examples detailed in media reports. We tossed out one because the case predated Cordray's time in office by six months. The second was described March 26, 2010, in the Marietta Times. The article describes how the arrest of a suspect in the rape of a college student was delayed for nearly a year because of a backlog at the BCI lab. Acting Chief Jim Weaver of the Marietta College police confirmed that "we got our match right around a year from when we gave the sample." The DNA evidence was sent to BCI on April 3, 2009, and returned to his office on March 16, 2010. Weaver, the lead detective on the case, said BCI officials told him the 50-week delay was because "we didn't have anyone in custody and we didn't need it to keep anyone in jail, so it kept getting pushed back." The third example from a WTOL-TV report May 3, 2010, focused on a lengthy delay in DNA evidence processing in the murder of 91-year-old Grace Kennedy in Bryan, Ohio. Bryan police Capt. Paul Zawodny told us that the crime scene DNA evidence was received by BCI just hours after the Dec. 23, 2009, murder was discovered. The first DNA results came back April 5, 2010, a span of about four and a half months, Zawodny said. The officer said part of the reason for the lag time was that prosecutors had to give the BCI lab permission to use all of a suspect's DNA sample while doing the testing. DeWine's campaign sought to bolster its case by putting us into contact with Union County Prosecutor David Phillips, a Republican, who said that DNA evidence has recently taken longer than six months to be processed by BCI. "On average, we are waiting a long time -- sometimes even over a year for DNA evidence -- and during that time the case is just sitting there," Phillips said. The county prosecutor since 2005, Phillips said "I wouldn't say it's gotten any worse under Cordray's watch, but I wouldn't say it's gotten any better." Phillips said his most recent DNA evidence-based case was a rape case where a suspect had been arrested, triggering a 90-day clock (about three months) under the constitutional provision for a speedy trial. He said he was on the phone "a lot" pressing the BCI lab to meet the 90-day window, which they did by only 10 days causing his office "anxiety" that the deadline would be missed freeing the suspect. We find that DeWine’s statement is accurate when he states that the processing of DNA evidence is currently taking "up to six months," as at least the Marietta example far exceeds that window. Even Cordray's own statistics show that processing of DNA evidence stretches beyond six months in about 7 percent of cases, including at least three cases not shipped to an outside lab. But the BCI statistics Cordray’s office provided show that more than 90 times in 100 the processing time falls somewhat short of "up to" six month mark cited by DeWine. Cordray’s staff also cites records that show that the turnaround time has dropped by about one-third. That's clearly additional contextual information not given by DeWine that tends to undercut the clear inference of his statement -- that DNA cases are dragging on for long stretches of time under Cordray. Therefore, we rate DeWine's statement that DNA evidence is currently taking up to six months to be processed by the BCI crime lab to be Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-12065	"Hurricane Irma could be a Category 6 by the time it hits East Coast."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/06/blog-posting/no-hurricane-irma-cant-be-category-6-storm/	A hurricane with winds in excess of 180 miles per hour is scary enough. But some corners of the Internet are stirring additional panic -- and attracting additional clicks -- by referring to an extreme hurricane category that doesn’t even exist. The web post appeared as Hurricane Irma was powering through the Caribbean, days ahead of an expected landfall somewhere in Florida. The storm was one of the most powerful to form in the Atlantic Ocean in decades, with sustained winds as high as 185 miles per hour. Into this maelstrom came a website posing as an arm of CNN (spoiler, it’s not) posting a page headlined, "HURRICANE IRMA could be a Category 6 by the time it hits East Coast." The advertising-filled page has almost no content of its own -- just an audio recording of a folksy, older-sounding woman rambling, stream-of-consciousness style, about the approach of Irma. At one point, she says, "The wind speeds are way up there into the category 6 territory." A flurry of other questionable websites also played with the idea of Irma becoming a Category 6 storm. There is no such thing. The scale used by the National Hurricane Center only goes as high as 5. Why we use the current scale The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale was developed by Herbert Saffir, an engineer in Coral Gables, Fla., and Robert Simpson, who headed the National Hurricane Center from 1967 to 1973. The scale used wind speeds as a guide to predict the extent of structural damage. "Saffir, an engineer and expert on wind damage who helped write the Dade County, Fla., building code, developed the first version of the scale in 1971 for a United Nations report on construction that could stand up to high winds," wrote Jack Williams the founding weather editor of USA Today and co-author of Hurricane Watch: Forecasting the Deadliest Storms on Earth. As for Simpson, Williams wrote, one of his formative experiences at the National Hurricane Center came with the approach of Hurricane Camille to the Mississippi coast on Aug. 16, 1969. The storm was shaping up to be extremely dangerous, but Simpson grappled with the best way to communicate this to residents in the storm’s path. "Simpson broke the Weather Bureau's rule against using specific wind speed or surge figures in forecasts -- they were supposed to say things such as ‘strong winds and dangerously high water are expected,’ " Williams wrote. "After it was all over, despite the success of the evacuations, Simpson felt he needed a better way to communicate what a storm is capable of doing. He correlated Saffir's wind damage rankings with the surge potential to create the scale used today." While officials at the National Hurricane Center began using Simpson’s new scale internally, it only began releasing it to the public in 1975, amid clamor by the media for an easily understandable metric. Officially, the Saffir-Simpson scale is based on a hurricane's sustained wind speed. "Hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher are considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage," according to the National Hurricane Center. "Category 1 and 2 storms are still dangerous, however, and require preventative measures." The now-familiar scale of 1 to 5 breaks down as follows: Category Sustained winds (mph) Types of damage 1 74-95 Very dangerous winds will produce some damage 2 96-110 Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage 3 111-129 Devastating damage will occur 4 130-156 Catastrophic damage will occur 5 157+ Catastrophic damage will occur The scale has changed in one significant way over the years. In 2010, the federal agency removed references to storm surge from the scale after some surge expectations proved to be off-base. (Storm surge refers to how far open waters reach beyond their normal levels on coastal land.) Instead, the center directs people to more specific forecasts about storm surge. Unlike the Fujita scale for tornadoes, which runs from 0 to 5, the Saffir-Simpson scale uses measurements taken before a storm hits land. The Fujita ratings are assigned after a storm has hit and the damage is investigated. Should there be a Category 6? From time to time, there has been discussion of whether a new category -- Category 6 -- should be added to the scale. That decision would likely fall to the National Hurricane Center after discussions with scientists in the field, said Jill Trepanier, a hurricane specialist in the Louisiana State University department of geography and anthropology. A simple extrapolation from the existing categories would probably set the threshold for a new Category 6 around 180 mph, making Irma a good candidate for that category if it existed, said James B. Elsner, the chair of geography at Florida State University who also runs a business called Climatek that develops software for hurricane and tornado risk models. The idea of creating a Category 6 is often met with skepticism, however. The most frequently cited reason is that Category 6 would add nothing to the understanding of how destructive the storm would be for buildings and other structures. "Almost no structures can withstand sustained winds over 155 mph," said Michael M. Bell, an associate professor in atmospheric science at Colorado State University. "At those wind speeds, significant damage or even total destruction of most buildings is expected. By this definition, adding a Category 6 would not add any new information, since the strongest criteria for expected wind damage has already been met." Bill Read, the former director of the National Hurricane Center, agreed in an email with PolitiFact. And the scale’s co-creator, Simpson, agreed as well, in a 1991 interview. Asked whether the scale should be modified to include categories above 5, he said that above 155 mph, "it's going to cause rupturing damages (to buildings) that are serious no matter how well it's engineered. … That's the reason why we didn't try to go any higher than that anyway." In fact, several scientists said that a more useful change, if one had to be made, would be to focus less on wind speed specifically, either by modifying the Saffir-Simpson scale to include other factors or by giving added attention to other measurements. "I personally believe that we need to work on effectively communicating the other hazards that tropical cyclones bring, including heavy rainfall and storm surge," Bell said. Hurricane Harvey, which hit coastal Texas, "did cause significant wind damage as a Category 4, but much of the devastation in Houston and the surrounding areas was caused by inland flooding from sustained rainfall while Harvey was a tropical storm." Similarly, "much of the damage from Hurricane Katrina was caused by storm surge when the winds were Category 3," Bell said. "These multiple hazards may not be well-correlated with the Saffir-Simpson Category at landfall, and therefore it is an incomplete description of the storm's destructive potential." Trepanier said there’s no reason why a Category 6 is needed to communicate how fearsome Irma is. "Irma is a beast," she said. "It is safe to say the wind speeds are rare, but I see no benefit in calling it a Category 6. It should be considered catastrophic. And that is how people should refer to it." So, as of now, there is no such thing as a Category 6 storm. The web post suggesting that Irma is one rates Pants on Fire.

pomt-06382	"If Rhode Island does a hybrid [retirement] plan we’ll be the first state in the nation to do this.’’	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/nov/02/lincoln-chafee/gov-lincoln-chafee-says-rhode-island-would-be-firs/	If state lawmakers approve the Chafee administration’s plan to overhaul Rhode Island’s ailing public pension system, most state workers, teachers and many municipal employees will be enrolled in a so-called hybrid retirement plan. The hybrid plan that Governor Lincoln Chafee and General Treasurer Gina Raimondo have been touting would combine a smaller guaranteed monthly payout from a traditional pension with a variable payout based on the investment earnings of a 401(k)-style plan. While pitching their pension overhaul legislation to a joint meeting of the Senate and House Finance Committees Oct. 24, Chafee, an Independent, spoke at length about how the plan would address the state’s $9.4-billion pension shortfall. "And also,’’ the governor said, "somebody told me recently that if Rhode Island does a hybrid plan we’ll be the first state in the nation to do this.’’ The first in the nation? Chafee continued: "And I think that’s in all of our interest to show the rest of the country that we can take on this challenge and share the ups and downs of the market with the employer and the employee. Right now, we the state, the employer, takes all the hit when the market goes down. And so I think the country will be looking at us . . . " Rhode Island, of course, isn’t the only state to wrestle with pension problems. So we wondered: Would Rhode Island be the first in the nation to adopt a hybrid retirement plan? The facts A quick search of the Wall Street Journal’s archives turned up a story from July 10, 2010, entitled "States Shift to Hybrid Pensions.’’ The article begins: "State governments, one of the last bastions of guaranteed pensions, are increasingly taking a page from 401(k) plans that dominate the private sector.’’ Utah, Michigan, Oregon and Washington, the article states, all have some form of hybrid plan. Next, we called The National Association of State Retirement Administrators, a nonprofit membership organization whose members are directors of the nation’s public retirement systems. Keith Brainard, the association’s research director, provided us with a table that shows that seven states have some form of hybrid plan for public employees. They are: Georgia, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, Washington and Utah. (Michigan offers the hybrid plan only to school employees.) Their plans, like the one the Chafee administration has proposed for Rhode Island, share two features: a traditional pension with a guaranteed benefit, coupled with a 401(k)-style component that offers a payout tied to investment earnings. We called the governor’s office, and his spokeswoman, Christine Hunsinger, quickly responded that the governor had "made a mistake." Rhode Island, she conceded, would not be the first state to adopt a hybrid plan. OK, so the governor was wrong. Rhode Island didn’t come up with the idea first. But we still wondered what was happening elsewhere in the country. We contacted retirement administrators in other states to find out. At least two states -- Washington and Indiana -- have had hybrid retirement plans since the 1990s. During the 1990s stock-market boom, a legislative pension committee in Washington saw an opportunity to "self-fund" a portion of its retirement plan, said Dave Nelsen, legal and legislative services manager for the Washington State Department of Retirement Systems. The teachers union was the first to endorse the idea, he recalled, and in 1995, a bill "sailed through the legislature" to allow teachers to supplement their traditional pensions with something similar to a 401(k) plan. In 2002, the State of Washington passed its own bill to create a hybrid option for all new public employees. Indiana enacted legislation in 1998 to allow public employees to invest some of their retirement money in selected bonds and money market funds. (The hybrid plan proposed by the Chafee administration is similar to Indiana’s, said Brainard, of the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.) Ohio offered a hybrid plan to new state employees and those with less than five years of service in 2003. Oregon followed in 2004; Georgia in 2009; and Michigan (for school employees only) in 2010. Utah last year replaced its traditional defined benefit pensions with 401(k)-style plans for new state and municipal workers. The Chafee administration’s proposal could, however, set Rhode Island apart from other states in one respect, Brainard said: it would require not just new hires but also most existing employees (except judges, state police, correctional officers and municipal police and firefighters) to participate in the hybrid plan. In fact, Hunsinger told PolitiFact that was actually what the governor had been told would make Rhode Island "the first in the nation." But we’d caution the governor on that statement, too. We found that at least one other state -- Kansas -- has proposed doing the same. The ruling Governor Chafee was clearly wrong when he told state lawmakers that if they approve his administration’s pension reforms, Rhode Island would "be the first state in the nation’’ to adopt a hybrid plan. These types of plans have been widely publicized in the national media and on the National Association of State Retirement Administrator’s web site, and our research found at least seven other states offer hybrid pension plans, some dating back to the 1990s. We rule his statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-04393	Says Bill Nelson voted "98 percent of the time" with Barack Obama.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/17/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-bill-nelson-votes-98-percent-time/	From the first day of his campaign, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack has repeatedly hammered U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson for voting with President Barack Obama. Mack raised ire from Nelson as he hit that note several times during Wednesday night’s Senate debate, when he cast Nelson as more extreme than ever before. "Senator, the people of the state of Florida are tired of you saying one thing to them and then going back to Washington, D.C., and voting with Barack Obama 98 percent of the time. They’re tired of that. They want you to look them in the eye and tell them what you’re going to do to them instead of what you’re going to do for Barack Obama." "Is that the only line that you have memorized?" Nelson shot back about the 98 percent figure. "Are you going to own up to it, Senator?" Mack replied. PolitiFact checked on Nelson’s voting record last year, when Mack, in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, accused Nelson of voting with Democrats 95 percent of the time. PolitiFact found that claim Half True. Now, Mack is criticizing Nelson not just for voting with his party, but for voting with the president. We decided to go in for a fresh fact-check. Mack’s campaign says the claim is based on 2010 and 2011 figures from Congressional Quarterly, a leading provider of congressional news and legislative tracking. The publication found that Nelson voted with Obama 97 percent of the time in 2009, 98 percent in 2010 and 97 percent in 2011, on issues in which the president took a clear position. (Obama doesn't vote, so CQ relied on his public statements to determine his position in favor or against a bill in Congress.) "Nelson has gone left, and his lockstep support of Obama reflects that," Mack spokesman Gary Maloney said. "It’s possible the party has gone even further left than Nelson has." The numbers pan out, but we also checked a few other sources to see if Nelson is, indeed, a lockstep liberal, as Mack suggests. The vote-tracking website OpenCongress, which counts every congressional vote since the beginning of the current 112th session of Congress, suggests Nelson is one of the Senate’s more moderate Democrats. Nelson is the 36th most likely Democratic senator to vote with his or her party, doing so on 371 out of 404 of his votes. He also voted with his party 91.8 percent of the time, the website found. But the OpenCongress website, created by the Participatory Politics Foundation and the Sunlight Foundation, says voting percentages can be misleading because "the vast majority of the hundreds of votes factored in are routine in nature. The result is that even highly independent senators have a seemingly high score on voting with their party." The average Democratic senator votes with his or her party 93.2 percent of the time, according to the website. Other vote-tracking websites referenced in our first fact-check found that Nelson voted with the Democrats 90 to 94 percent of the time. Our ruling Mack claims Nelson votes with Obama 98 percent of the time. The campaign backs that figure up with Congressional Quarterly data from 2010 and 2011. The figure by itself, however, doesn’t tell the entire story. The fact is, most Democrats and Republicans largely vote with their respective party. And the groups that keep score say using the figure in isolation can be misleading. With that context in mind, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-00798	Says he "paid one dollar for" a sweater at Kohl’s.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/03/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-he-bought-sweater-1-kohls/	When Gov. Scott Walker took his presidential ambitions to New Hampshire, he shared a penny-pinching story that would have been right at home in bargain-hunting Wisconsin. At the center of the story: A new sweater, a dollar and Menomonee Falls-based Kohl’s. The department store chain is well known for its deep discounts -- ones so deep that the company has faced legal challenges over its pricing practices in Kansas, Massachusetts and California. At issue in the California case, for instance, was complaints that the retailer listed "normal" prices for products but never sold them for that price. Walker likes to point out that shortly after he was married, his wife, Tonette, was mortified because he didn’t know the drill at Kohl’s. In Concord, N.H., he told the crowd at a March 14, 2015 workshop about a "critical mistake" he made while shopping at a Kohl’s store. "I went to a Kohl's department store and I bought something for the price it was marked at," Walker said, adding that he’s now been "trained well" about how to shop at Kohl’s. So well that he pointed to the brownish-colored sweater he was wearing and declared: "We paid one dollar for it with our Kohl’s Cash." A buck? Now, we grant this is not the most important topic in politics today. But we decided to fact check it for two reasons. First, we heard from readers from around the country who thought it was an unbelievable story -- as in, literally impossible to believe. Second, it goes to what has been a major theme of Walker’s visits to some of the early primary states -- that he is just an average guy. In Wisconsin, voters have long heard about Walker’s brown bag lunches and his ham-and-cheese sandwiches have become a fixture on his Twitter account. At the presidential level, all of this becomes a pointed contrast his far-better heeled GOP rivals, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. When we asked a spokeswoman for Walker’s exploratory campaign group, Our American Revival, about the $1 sweater, we didn’t receive a response. So we did what any Midwesterner would do, and went bargain hunting. Could we score a sweater just like the nifty henley that Walker donned in New Hampshire? And, more importantly, could we do it for next to nothing? Walker indicated on Twitter that he bought the sweater while in the Granite State. He didn’t identify the location, but there is a Kohl’s in Hooksett, about 13 miles from Concord. We called the store, and an employee in menswear said all of the store’s henley sweaters were mixed with other items on clearance racks. Based on photos of Walker in the sweater, it appears to be a "Chaps Twisted Button Mock Sweater" in a color called "walnut twist." We couldn’t find that sweater available on the Kohl’s web site, so we visited the Kohl’s store in Glendale to paw through the clearance racks. There we found plenty of Chaps sweaters marked between 80 and 90 percent off -- an even deeper cut than the 70% Walker cited when describing the deal. Some of the sweaters we found were originally priced at $70 and marked down to $7. Now, that’s not $1. But Walker did say he used his "Kohl’s Cash" -- a coupon of sorts that is generated based on how much a customer purchased in an earlier visit to the store. Thus, he could have easily gotten one for $1 out-of-pocket. We rate the claim True. Now, just ask us how much Walker’s daily ham sandwich costs.

pomt-05522	Says abortion doctors are "flying into this state, performing abortions and flying out."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/apr/12/matthew-hill/matthew-hill-says-abortion-doctors-flying-out-tenn/	During House floor debate on this year’s most prominent abortion bill in the General Assembly, Rep. Matthew Hill declared that one reason enactment is needed is that physicians are currently flying into the state and then flying out, leaving their patients with little recourse should complications arise. The bill (HB3808) requires abortion providers to have hospital admission privileges in the county where the procedure is performed or an adjacent county. Critics contended the bill, titled "The Life Defense Act of 2012," is unnecessary and intended as an impediment to providing abortions in Tennessee. Hill, R-Jonesborough, is vice chairman of the House Health and Human Resources Committee, chairman of the House Health Subcommittee and lead sponsor of the bill. In explaining why passage is needed, he told colleagues in the March 29, 2012, floor debate that, first of all, abortion doctors were traveling across the state to perform abortions and then going back home. That’s not the claim we’re checking; his second reason is what brought forth skepticism from his colleagues. "Number two," Hill said, "we have abortion physicians that are flying into this state and that they are performing abortions." He continued: "They’re flying into this state, performing abortions and flying out. And what happens is when a woman has complications, the doctor who performed that abortion is long gone. So if anything -- and I know it’s true – this legislation will expand critical, possibly life-saving access to care to the woman who has complications from the abortion. That’s why I’m bringing the legislation and that, in all practicality, is what it’ll do." Hill’s assertion about doctors flying in from out of the state was challenged by House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mike Turner of Nashville. Turner first asked, "How many doctors are flying in and performing abortions?" Replied Hill: "I don’t have the exact number. You can probably call Planned Parenthood if you like." Turner pressed the point, asking if "you know any place this is happening." Hill: "I do know of one physician that is driving from Northeast Tennessee across the state of Tennessee to do this." Turner: "But you said out-of-state … You don’t know that for sure?" Hill: "I do not have direct knowledge of that, no, sir." That left hanging the question of whether there actually are abortion doctors flying into the state, performing the procedures, then flying away. We decided to seek the answer. Bill Christian, spokesman for the state Department of Health, said that a physician performing an abortion in Tennessee must be licensed to practice medicine within the state under current law. But that does not mean the physician has to be a Tennessee resident. It would be legal, he said, for a non-resident doctor to fly into Tennessee and perform an abortion – so long as he or she was licensed within the state. Christian said the department has no information on whether any doctors are doing so and no indication of any doctor being prosecuted for performing an abortion without a license in the state. But the statistics collected by the department on abortions would not necessarily cover that information, he said. Hill, asked for his source for the assertion, said he had been told of fly-in doctors by leaders of Tennessee Right to Life, an organization of anti-abortion activists. Brian Harris, president of Tennessee Right to Life, said he believes there are cases of fly-in abortion providers, but declined to provide any specifics because of "circumstances now evolving on another front." "All around the country, I don’t think it’s an unusual practice," said Harris, adding that the practice may increase because the number of abortion providers is declining nationwide. Harris said there is at least one case of the reverse situation – a Tennessee doctor flying out of the state to perform abortions. He cited Dr. Gary Boyle of Blountville, who was arrested in October, 2010, on charges of pointing a gun at anti-abortion protesters outside a clinic in Charleston, S.C. Boyle has pleaded not guilty to the charges and the trial is still pending. And former state Rep. Chris Clem, an attorney in Chattanooga, says there was a lawsuit filed years ago against two Alabama doctors alleging malpractice in an abortion performed at a now-closed Chattanooga clinic. But Clem could not provide the doctors’ names or any details of the case, which he recalls was settled out of court more than a decade ago. On the other hand, leaders with Planned Parenthood in Tennessee say Hill’s claim is blatantly wrong. "That has never happened," said Jeff Teague, CEO and president of Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee. "All the doctors we use (in Planned Parenthood clinics) are from Tennessee and, from conversations with others (who provide abortion services in the state), they have Tennessee physicians, too." Planned Parenthood has two regional offices in Tennessee. Barry Chase of the Greater Memphis office, concurs with Teague: "Rep. Hill needs to find out what the truth is and stick with it in the future." Teague said that Hill’s reference to calling Planned Parenthood during the debate is an example of his organization being "used as a punching bag all of the time." Planned Parenthood has been at pains to point out, for instance, that abortions only account for 3 percent of the services it provides. Said Teague: "They (anti-abortion activists) like to throw out false accusations on a whole lot of levels . . . They just like to make us out as the bad guys, the evil forces, all of the time." Our ruling Hill at first boldly claimed that doctors who perform abortions were flying in and then out of the state, but when challenged by a Democratic colleague acknowledged he had no specific knowledge that it had occurred. The director of Tennessee’s leading anti-abortion would not provide any evidence that the practice has occurred either. Planned Parenthood claims this does not happen. With no evidence to support this claim, we rule it False.	None	Matthew Hill	None	None	None	2012-04-12T06:30:00	2012-03-29	['None']
pomt-05643	Says gas costs $4.50 a gallon.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/mar/22/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-gas-costs-450-gallon/	Ahead of President Barack Obama’s fundraising turn in Texas this month, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, poked at the president by saying that "Texans know three numbers that Obama would like to forget." Dewhurst’s March 8, 2012, email blast said the numbers are: "1. $15.5 trillion in national debt 2. $4.50 per gallon gasoline 3. 1.2 million fewer jobs since Obama took office." The email reflects the current size of the national debt, according to the U.S. Treasury. And one set of employment data by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that more than 1.2 million fewer Americans were employed in February 2012 compared to December 2008, the month before Obama became president. But $4.50-a-gallon gas? We sought backup. By email, Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch told us a Dairy Mart in Lewisville, Texas, was charging $4.50 a gallon. We were unable to verify that. Hirsch also pointed out a Feb. 28, 2012, ABC News online post, headlined "Gas Prices: 25 Most Expensive Cities," quoting figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration indicating that the average price of gasoline nationwide rose to $3.72 a gallon that week -- and had surpassed $4.25 a gallon in a dozen California cities. The post quotes Jason Toews, a co-founder of GasBuddy.com, which tracks prices at gas stations, saying: "California typically has higher gas prices due to the special blend of gas mandated by the state. This blend of gas burns more cleanly for pollution control." GasBuddy.com also listed the 25 highest gas prices nationally, topped by $4.35 a gallon in Santa Barbara, Calif. At No. 25 was Bridgeport, Conn., at nearly $3.96. No Texas cities made the list. So, gas was costing up to $4.35 a gallon in a California city before Dewhurst aired his figure. For broader perspective, we turned to an EIA web page, Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update, which offers weekly average price updates for all kinds of motor fuel. And according to provided historical information, the average U.S. price across six grades and formulations of gas -- regular, mid-grade and premium types -- the week of March 5, 2012, when Dewhurst sent his blast, was $3.85 a gallon, ranging from an average of $3.28 in Denver to $4.46 in Los Angeles. The Texas average was $3.67. Hirsch, Dewhurst’s spokesman, pointed out that certain average gas prices have been $4.50 or more. In the week of March 5, 2012, according to EIA, the average price of mid-grade gas, defined by its mid-level anti-knock or octane rating, of all formulations in Los Angeles was nearly $4.51 a gallon; the average price for the same kind in San Francisco was $4.46. The national average was $3.92 while the Texas average was $3.76. The same week, the average Los Angeles price for reformulated (or less-polluting) premium gas, which has a higher octane rating than mid-grade or regular gas, was $4.57 a gallon, a penny more than the average price for such gas in San Francisco. The average Texas price was $3.92 a gallon. Nationally, the EIA says, the average price of all grades and formulations of gas has been more than $3 a gallon since Dec. 6, 2010. It’s been more than $2 a gallon since March 23, 2009. In Texas, gas of all grades and formulations topped out at an average price of $3.91 a gallon the week of May 12, 2011. Finally, Dewhurst’s statement about gas prices suggests Obama is responsible for increasing gas prices when a president’s impact on those prices is limited. John B. Townsend II, a spokesman for the mid-Atlantic region of the American Automobile Association, told PolitiFact in September 2011 that "other than lip service, there is little any president or member of Congress can do about the price of gas, since 70 percent of the cost of a gallon is determined by the cost of crude oil." Our ruling So, $4.50 a gallon? Sure, you can find that price if you look hard enough -- especially if you’re driving California. But Dewhurst’s comment implies that $4.50 gas is commonplace. That’s an exaggeration. Average gas prices were 15 to 20 percent lower in the week when Dewhurst blasted Obama, who also doesn’t control the price of gas. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-05181	U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson was "the deciding vote for the health care law."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/jun/14/60-plus-association/florida-bill-nelson-deciding-vote-health-care/	A conservative senior citizens group, the 60 Plus Association, launched a $1.1 million ad buy in June attacking U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., for his votes on health care and the stimulus. The ad says: "Times have been tough in Florida. Almost 1 million out of work. Businesses shutting down. Thousands of homeowners facing foreclosure. But in Washington, Bill Nelson supports President Obama’s policies that hurt hardworking taxpayers. He voted for Obama’s failed $800 billion stimulus, but employment still went up, and was the deciding vote for the health care law that cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs. Tell Bill Nelson, protect hardworking taxpayers. Stop the wasteful spending." The ad repeats a number of charges against Obama and Democrats who supported him. For example, PolitiFact has fact-checked the claim by the U.S. Chamber that Nelson voted to cut $500 billion from Medicare and ruled it Mostly False. For this report, we wanted to check if Nelson cast the "deciding vote" for the health care law. The claim has been made before about other Democratic senators. PolitiFact has fact-checked that the "deciding" vote for health care was U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado. How can so many lawmakers cast the deciding vote? The 2009 health care vote For its evidence, the ad cited a health care vote on Dec. 24, 2009. That vote showed 59 Democrats and one independent voting together in favor of the bill, including Nelson. (Sixty votes were needed for a preliminary cloture vote to prevent filibusters.) So couldn’t we argue that any of the 60 cast the deciding vote? As we noted before, there is a long history of senators holding back their votes until their demands are met. Some senators did hold out until the last minute -- but Nelson wasn’t one of them. One of the detailed reports we’ve seen on the final negotiations for the law is from the Los Angeles Times. According to its report, one of the most crucial votes came from Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn. According to the newspaper, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., "knew that he had to keep Lieberman in the tent. And the next night, when Democrats gathered for a special caucus meeting, Reid did not call out the Connecticut senator, focusing instead on the need to unite and move forward." At the meeting, Reid turned to Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., who also "had a long list of demands, including more restrictions on funding abortions and full federal funding to expand Nebraska's Medicaid program. ... Reid was closing in on a deal." Suddenly, another roadblock appeared: Republican opponents of the bill threatened to filibuster -- that is, indefinitely block consideration of -- an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the health care measure. To get around that, Reid had to convince U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis. -- an opponent of the defense bill for substantive reasons -- not to join the Republican blockade. "Reid was unwilling to challenge Feingold on a vote of conscience," the Los Angeles Times article reported. "And when Democrats gathered for yet another special caucus meeting ... Reid was ready to concede defeat. But as dejected senators began to leave, Feingold arose: He would put aside his convictions on the war, he said, and vote with his party. 'I don't think there was a dry eye in the caucus room,' said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md." There was also a concern about whether Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., would physically be unable to reach the chamber because he had been in the hospital with a staph infection but he was brought in in a wheelchair and voted. Bill Nelson’s role In the summer of 2009, Bill Nelson was quiet about health care reform -- angering some Democratic activists. But in September he jumped into the fray -- offering amendments about Medicare Advantage and Medicare drug benefits. Nelson sounded cautiously supportive in news accounts -- saying he had some criticisms but called the bill a "starting point." "There are serious issues to be resolved," Nelson said in a speech on the floor of the Senate in September 2009. "This senator is optimistic, and I believe that we are going to be able to achieve this goal of expanding affordable health care to nearly all Americans." In October 2009, Nelson joined other Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee in voting for the health care plan. Nelson called the package a "good start." In November during public stops in the Tampa Bay area, he predicted the Senate would pass a health care bill and said: "If we don't do something about health care, it's going to run our country into bankruptcy." The Orlando Sentinel described him as an "enthusiastic cheerleader for the emerging legislation." After the December vote, the health care bill still needed changes and another round of approvals. Nelson’s office issued a press release in March 2010 saying that despite the legislation’s "flaws" -- including that it didn’t force drug makers to reduce the costs of prescriptions -- he would support it. "Nelson, who had been considered by some to be a possible swing vote, made his declaration just at the outset of Senate starting its deliberations on changes to the health care signed into law by President Obama yesterday," stated Nelson’s press release. The other Nelson's role When the recent ad from the 60 Plus Association started airing, Nelson pointed to his colleague U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., as the deciding vote. Florida’s Nelson wrote on his Facebook page that the 60 Plus Association "repeats an outrageous claim that I cast the deciding vote on health care reform legislation that cuts Medicare. First off, fact-checkers have found the legislation didn’t cut Medicare. And second, it was BEN NELSON, not me, who cast the deciding vote." Several news articles described Sen. Ben Nelson as the final key for Senate Democrats in 2009. The Nebraska senator announced his support days before the Christmas Eve vote, after he reached a compromise about abortion and federal funding for his state. But in March 2010 the Nebraska senator voted against the final bill. The Nebraska senator told CNN in December 2009: "I couldn’t create the opportunity to be the 60th vote. It happened. … If you think it’s fun having both sides on an issue mad at you when you are trying to do something in good faith, just think it’s like going home and getting bit by the family dog. So who enjoys that?" Sen. Bill Nelson’s Senate spokesman Dan McLaughlin told PolitiFact in an email: "There’s no way every Democratic senator could have cast the ‘deciding vote.’ And there’s no way to say Bill Nelson cast the deciding vote - when he didn’t. Nelson didn’t like the bill. He tried to improve it. Among other things, he offered an amendment against the drug-makers. And, he announced his vote well before the roll call. He played no extraordinary role in the final passage." We asked the 60 Plus Association how it concluded that Sen. Bill Nelson was the deciding vote and forwarded the Florida senator’s Facebook comments about Sen. Ben Nelson. "Seems very odd that (Sen. Bill Nelson) would call out a colleague as a deciding vote for legislation he wholeheartedly supported," said Gerry Scimeca, a spokesman for the 60 Plus Association, in an email. "The fact is, had Nelson voted ‘no’ Obamacare would have died. Without his vote, the law couldn't have passed; he could have stopped it but he didn't." Our ruling The 60 Plus Association says that Florida Sen. Bill Nelson cast the "deciding vote" for health care. The health care law required 60 votes, so Nelson's vote was crucial -- as were the other 59 votes. But describing Nelson as the "deciding vote" suggests he had some extraordinarily powerful role, and that’s not the case. Nelson had cautiously been a supporter for months as he tried to amend the law. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11797	"2 million rounds of ammo that ‘went missing’ under Obama turns up in enemy hands"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/20/world-newsscom/fake-news-2-million-rounds-us-ammo-turns-afghanist/	Millions of rounds of U.S. ammunition hasn’t wound up in enemy hands, despite what a story circulating on Facebook claims. The story says the rounds disappeared during President Barack Obama’s presidency and were recently discovered in Afghanistan. "2 million rounds of ammo that ‘went missing’ under Obama turns up in enemy hands," states the Nov. 13 headline in world-newss.com. One of many signs that the article is fake is that the website misspelled "news." We left a comment on the website and did not hear a reply. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article lists as its source a Nov. 9 article from defense-usa.club, another known peddler of deliberately false news stories. The article attributes the information to "an insider report from the office of the Quartermaster at the Pentagon." It states that the ammunition went missing in 2010 and was recently recovered by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The article quoted Brig. General George Mason’s assistant chief of staff: "This was a huge violation of the public trust, not to mention an incredibly bold theft from the U.S. taxpayer. Sources say the Taliban paid nearly a dollar a round. Someone in Obama’s circle pocketed that money." All of that, however, appears to be made up. We searched news accounts and found no mentions of missing ammunition discovered in Afghanistan. Major Adrian J.T. Rankine-Galloway, a Pentagon spokesman, told PolitiFact that there hasn’t been a recent discovery of 2 million U.S. rounds of ammunition in Afghanistan. To top it off, "We're not aware of a Brigadier General George Mason in any position of responsibility in Afghanistan," Rankine-Galloway said. "There's no such thing as ‘the Quartermaster at the Pentagon.’ " There is no evidence that 2 million rounds of U.S. ammunition went missing and were discovered in Afghanistan.

pomt-02123	The CBO says that if you raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, "half a million people would lose their jobs."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/11/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-minimum-wage-increase-would-cost-500/	Former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., criticized President Barack Obama’s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 on CNN’s State of the Union. Santorum said he could support a smaller minimum wage increase, but not the nearly $3 an hour hike the president and other Democrats have called for. "If you look at the CBO report, half a million people would lose their jobs as a result of the Obama minimum wage increase," Santorum said. "I’m talking more in the range of a dollar, phasing that in." Santorum didn’t respond to our request for comment, but we were able to find the February 2014 Congressional Budget Office report he was speaking about. Santorum is largely quoting the report correctly. Obama’s proposed increase would take place in three steps, with the minimum hourly wage hitting $10.10 in 2016. It currently sits at $7.25, but many states choose to pay a higher minimum wage than federal policy mandates. The CBO concluded if the federal government gradually increased the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for all workers, and tied future increases to inflation, the economy would shed 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016 (all things constant under current law). That’s about 0.3 percent of the workforce. CBO reached its conclusion, figuring: Higher wages increase companies’ production costs. In turn, that lowers the amount of goods and services produced. That means companies need to employ fewer workers. Raising the cost of employing low-wage workers encourages companies to focus more on other, more cost-effective ways of producing goods and services: machines, technology and employing productive higher-wage workers. The one thing that Santorum didn't note is that the 500,000-job estimate is just that, an estimate. Job losses could range from hardly any, all the way up to 1 million. It pegged 500,000 jobs as its "central estimate." That’s not to say the CBO report had only bad news about Obama’s proposal. The report also noted that about 16.5 million workers would see their wages go up. Our ruling Santorum said if the United States raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, "half a million people would lose their jobs." Santorum said "would" but really the 500,000-job figure was the CBO’s best guess. Analysts say job losses could be anywhere from just a few workers to as many as 1 million. Santorum's statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2014-05-11T13:29:25	2014-05-11	['None']

pomt-08731	"Pat Toomey thinks corporations shouldn't pay any taxes."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/01/joe-sestak/joe-sestak-hits-pat-toomey-supporting-zero-corpora/	In their hard-fought race for a Pennsylvania Senate seat, Republican Pat Toomey and Democrat Joe Sestak have attacked each other over tax policy. Last week, we rated a Toomey ad blasting Sestak on the estate tax as Barely True. Now we'll look at a Sestak ad attacking Toomey's position on corporate taxes. The ad, funded by Sestak's campaign, features a clip of Toomey being interviewed on television. Here's the text of the ad: Narrator: "Do you think corporations pay their fair share? Pat Toomey thinks corporations shouldn't pay any taxes." Clip of Toomey: "Lets not tax corporations. ... I think the solution is to eliminate corporate taxes altogether." Narrator: "The middle class is struggling, but Toomey thinks it's oil companies and Wall Street banks who should pay no taxes. Zero. No wonder Toomey has been call Wall Street's congressman." Clip of Toomey: "I think the solution is to eliminate corporate taxes altogether." Narrator: "Pat Toomey. He's for them, not for us." We decided to look at whether Toomey really wants corporations to pay zero taxes. We managed to locate the source of the video clip. It was a July 20, 2007, interview on the business network CNBC. At the time, Toomey, a former congressman from Pennsylvania, was the head of the fiscally conservative Club for Growth. He was paired on the show with Jason Furman, then a scholar at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution and now a member of President Barack Obama's National Economic Council. They appeared during a segment titled, "Is the U.S. corporate tax code hurting America?" Toomey began by arguing that taxes on corporations are passed through to ordinary people, which ends up hurting economic growth. The two guests then sparred a bit over whether corporate taxes in the U.S. are really the second-highest in the world, as Toomey suggested. Furman argued that widespread loopholes and exclusions lower the effective rates on companies well below the official rates. Then Toomey said, "I would disagree with the idea we would want to have a corporate tax burden at all. It just doesn't make sense. ... Let's allow (corporations) to compete most aggressively on the global economy. It is better for our workers and economy and attracts more capital. I think the solution is to eliminate corporate taxes altogether." A bit later, Toomey reiterates the point, saying about taxes, "I’d prefer none on corporations, but much lower would be better." So is that actually Toomey's stance? In an interview, a spokeswoman for Toomey, Nachama Soloveichik, characterized his stance in the CNBC discussion as "an intellectual exercise" that is "not part of his general policy proposal." Soloveichik said that Toomey "unambiguously supports lowering taxes on business" but knows that a zero corporate tax rate is "impractical." Toomey's campaign website backs up the idea that he's not affirmatively pushing for zero corporate taxes as a campaign plan, saying in its tax policy section that the candidate supports "cutting income taxes on American businesses." That wording suggests that business taxes should be reduced, not eliminated. Soloveichik also said that, in a questionnaire Toomey answered for the Pennsylvania Bar Association in July 2010, he wrote that "two things in particular would go a long way towards lowering the country’s tax burden and increasing prosperity and jobs," one of which "is lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate." But the clearest evidence of Toomey's views come from his 2009 book, The Road to Prosperity: How to Grow Our Economy and Revive the American Dream. In the book, Toomey wrote favorably about both the flat tax and the fair tax -- two conservative policy proposals that would scrap the current tax code. The flat tax would impose a single, lower tax rate on income above a fixed amount, without loopholes and specialized taxes. The fair tax, for its part, would eliminate taxes on all kinds of income and instead impose a national sales tax. Under the flat tax Toomey described in his book, businesses would pay a 17 percent tax on income, rather than the current top rate of 35 percent. That's a reduction rather than an elimination. Under the fair tax, businesses wouldn't be taxed at all. This suggests that Toomey isn't settled on one approach to corporate taxation but is open to alternatives. In fact, in the book, Toomey writes that he'd be "thrilled to wake up one morning and discover our current monstrous tax code had been replaced with either of these alternatives." But he added that his "preference lies with the flat tax" -- that is, the one that would levy a 17 percent tax on businesses, not the one that would scrap them entirely. In fact, Toomey later notes that the fair tax is "a hard reform to sell in a political campaign" because "it can easily be mischaracterized by political opponents." We gave the Toomey camp the opportunity to say the candidate opposes zero corporate taxation, but the campaign did not do so. So the evidence suggests that Toomey (1) affirmatively supports lower corporate taxation, (2) is open to zero corporate taxation, and (3) is politically careful enough to settle for lower corporate taxes rather than none at all. We think that Sestak's use of the clip was fair politics, because the clip accurately reflects what Toomey said on the show. And Toomey's book does provide evidence that he'd love to see zero corporate taxation implemented, which justifies the ad's use of the word "thinks." On the other hand, we think a viewer watching the Sestak ad would be led to believe that Toomey is actively pushing zero corporate taxation as a campaign plank, when in fact his campaign website makes no mention of such a policy, and when Toomey has acknowledged in writing that he's wary of pursuing such a proposal because of the potential political fallout. So the ad is generally correct about Toomey's policy preferences but misleading about what he actually advocates as a candidate. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-14113	"The Brady Campaign has given me a 100 percent, not 99, 100 percent rating."	half-true	/california/statements/2016/may/11/loretta-sanchez/loretta-sanchez-dodges-question-about-gun-liabilit/	U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., was asked to explain her 2005 vote to offer gun manufacturers liability protections during a debate in the U.S.Senate race. Sanchez never really directly answered the question but said that the law didn’t give gun manufacturers "blanket immunity." She then pivoted to talk about her support from the nation’s leading gun control group, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. "The Brady Campaign has given me a 100 percent, not 99, 100 percent rating," Sanchez said May 10, 2016. "They say I’m not a lap dog to the gun lobby, and they say I don’t take their money." The Brady Campaign did say that. But they said a lot of other things -- including some not-so-positive comments on Sanchez’s 2005 vote. We’ll walk you through it. Sanchez on gun issues While Sanchez supports several gun-control measures, such as a mandatory waiting period, a ban on high-capacity magazines and universal background checks, she did vote for the 2005 bill that granted gun makers immunity from lawsuits based on the misuse of their products. To many in the gun control community, this is a blemish on her record, and in April, Sanchez wrote an op-ed in the Sacramento Bee defending that vote. She noted that the full package included some gun control measures, but it was her concern for "unintended consequences" that played as large a role. "I voted for it to prevent frivolous lawsuits against manufacturers," Sanchez said. "If someone uses a baseball bat or hammer to assault you, should the manufacturers be held criminally liable? If you said ‘no,’ then you agree with the principle behind the 2005 law." The Brady Campaign wasn’t buying it. Four days after Sanchez’s op-ed, the organization issued a press release. "Loretta Sanchez is dead wrong," said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign. "I find it excruciatingly frustrating that she claimed to have 'fully analyzed unintended consequences' of the law and saw fit to support it nonetheless." Gross said unlike an auto maker who can be sued, the victims of gun violence have no legal recourse. "The choice between a victim's right to justice and the possibility of inconveniencing the multibillion dollar gun industry is not a 'tough decision', nor is it 'complicated'," Gross said. "Loretta Sanchez is standing on the wrong side of this issue." Ratings from the Brady Campaign, NRA Sanchez is correct that she received a 100 percent rating from the Brady Campaign in its most recent rankings, which cover the 2013-14 Congress. This was called the "Lap Dog" scorecard. But, according to votesmart.org, she has been nicked by the group in the past. Her "lifetime score" with the group, which covers only 1991-2009, was 81 percent. On the flip side of the coin, the National Rifle Association has given Sanchez a grade of F in her past two terms, and before that, Ds going back to 2002. "She cannot defend her vote by parroting the gun lobby's misleading talking points and she cannot sweep this problem under the rug by laying claim to decade-old ratings," Gross said in his press release. We did not hear back from Sanchez’s campaign. Our ruling Sanchez said the Brady Campaign has given her a 100 percent rating. They have. But she’s cherry-picking the evidence that puts her in the best light. In reality, the gun-control group just recently wrote a scathing rebuke for Sanchez’s defence of her position on gun maker liability. And she hasn’t always received a 100 percent rating with the group. Sanchez’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-03377	"I’m the only candidate for governor who’s rolled out any policies so far."	false	/virginia/statements/2013/jul/10/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-has-rolled-out-no-polici/	Republican gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli says Terry McAuliffe, his Democratic opponent, has introduced zero policies. "I’m the only candidate for governor who’s rolled out any policies so far," Cuccinelli said on June 11 as he announced his workforce development plan. Cuccinelli made a similar claim during a June 7 radio interview on WMAL in Washington. McAuliffe’s campaign is "being very negative and they haven’t rolled out any policies," he said. No policies? Nada? Nary a one? To check Cuccinelli’s claim, we turned to Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary, which defines policy as "a high-level overall plan embracing the general goals and acceptable procedures especially of a governmental body." So there are two components to policy: a goal and a process to get there. And we’ll add one more ground rule: the proposals should be in writing. Scouring McAuliffe’s website, we came across several proposals that clearly met all of these tests and were released prior to Cucinelli’s June attacks. They are: *An executive order banning gifts over $100 to the governor’s family and barring all gifts to the governor’s household from lobbyists and others who do business with the state. McAuliffe said he would also ask the General Assembly pass the same rules for itself, the lieutenant governor and attorney general, in addition to requiring that gifts of more than $500 to dependent family members be publicly reported. *Creating a bipartisan commission to investigate ethics complaints against state politicians or discrepancies in their disclosure reports and refer violations to the proper disciplinary body. McAuliffe says the panel would have a "small professional staff" and would be funded through lobbyist registration fees. *Giving localities the option of reducing or eliminating the business and professional licensing tax, the machinery and tool tax and the merchants capital tax. McAuliffe would appoint a commission to help localities come up with revenue-neutral ways to end or cut the levies. Cuccinelli, we should note, also has proposed abolishing each of the three taxes. *Appointing a commission to recommend reforms to Standards of Learning tests given to public school students. McAuliffe says the multiple-choice tests are a flawed measure of teaching and learning and the state should also use essay and short-answer questions. So how does Cuccinelli come up with zero? Richard Cullen, communications director for the campaign, sent us an email saying Cuccinelli’s comments do not suggest that McAuliffe has put no proposals on the table. "Ken uses qualifiers that I think are important: ‘substantive,’ ‘nothing in detail,’ zero policy rollouts,’" he wrote. It’s true that when Cuccinelli criticized McAuliffe in late May, he did use the words "zero policy rollouts," and added the caveat that his opponent had offered "nothing in detail" or "substantive." But those last two qualifiers disappeared as Cuccinelli amped up his attack in June, so they are not a factor in this Truth-O-Meter. The term "rollout" remained in Cuccinelli’s comments and deserves consideration. "Ken has outlined comprehensive policy proposals in front of reporters across the Commonwealth and allowed the public to digest and scrutinize his ideas," Cullen said. "At no point has Terry McAuliffe done that." Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary defines rollout as "the widespread public introduction of a new product." McAuliffe has not introduced policy with the verve of Cuccinelli, who called a news conference with the capitol press corps in May to announce his tax cutting plan and answer questions about it. But McAuliffe has publicized his major initiatives in press releases, interviews and speeches around the state. Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for McAuliffe, said the Democrat has put out "lots of policies" and referred us to a 13-page document on the campaign’s website entitled "Putting Jobs First." In general, we found the document to be more of a platform laying out McAuliffe’s broad goals than a policy paper detailing how he would accomplish them. For example, McAuliffe repeatedly calls for greater investment in mass transit and public and higher education, but does not put price tags on his proposals or say how the state would pay for them. Cuccinelli, in contrast, has not issued a platform as broad as McAuliffe’s, but has unveiled some of his policies in greater depth that his opponent. Even so, Cuccinelli has left many major questions unanswered. For example, Cuccinelli has called for cutting the 6 percent corporate income tax rate to 4 percent over four years and reducing the 5.75 individual income tax rate to 5 percent over the same span. The cost of the cuts would be $1.4 billion a year, which Cuccinelli says he would pay for by eliminating tax exemptions and loopholes -- but he won’t say which ones. That work would be assigned to a commission after he was elected. Our ruling At least twice, Cuccinelli has said McAuliffe hasn’t "rolled out any policies." McAuliffe has rolled out a number of detailed steps for ethics reforms in state government. His proposals to improve standardized testing in public schools and give localities options to end some taxes, while relying on commissions to make the hard decisions, both set goals and a route for achieving them. We’re not conferring wonk status on McAuliffe or anything close to it. But Cuccinelli’s statement is an obvious stretch and we rate it False.

pomt-07649	The American Academy of Pediatrics "supports banning guns."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/14/marion-hammer/gun-lobbyist-says-doctors-play-politics-gun-questi/	One of the more intriguing subplots so far during the 2011 Florida legislative session has been a fight between two powerful Tallahassee special interests -- the gun lobby and doctors. The bills at issue are SB 432 and its companion HB 155. The measures, being pushed by gun interests, would prohibit doctors from asking their patients, or their patients' families, if they keep a gun at home. An original version of the bill made it a felony punishable with up to a $5 million fine for asking whether a patient owned a firearm. An amended version lowered the penalty to a non-criminal violation with a $500 fine (which could grow if the doctor willfully broke the law or was a repeat offender). The American Academy of Pediatrics currently encourages physicians to counsel parents on creating a safe home environment and offers advice to avoid preventable accidents. The long list of recommendations includes mainly innocuous tips like "Keep plastic bags and balloons away from your children," and "NEVER place an infant in front of an air bag." But physicians also are told to tell parents to remove guns from places where children live and play. Previously, we've looked into a claim by state Rep. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, that part of the reasoning behind the bill he sponsored is to keep gun ownership information from being recorded and collected by the federal government and insurance companies as part of the federal health care law. We rated that claim False, noting that the federal health care law specifically prohibits doctors and insurance companies from collecting gun information. Marion Hammer, a longtime lobbyist for the Unified Sportsmen of Florida and a former president of the National Rifle Association, offered another reason to support the gun legislation. Doctors are playing politics in the exam room by asking a question they don't need to know the answer to. "Doctors are pushing gun-ban politics on their patients," Hammer told a Senate committee on Feb. 22, 2011. Hammer made similar comments to a House committee on March 8, as well as in this e-mail to gun-rights supporters. "They have been pushing a gun-ban agenda and have been bringing their gun-ban politics into examining rooms. "The American Academy of Pediatrics supports banning guns," she said. "It's blatant, and it's there on their website. All you have to do is log on and see it." So log on to the academy's website we did, at www.aap.org. Sure enough, we quickly found a long list of policy statements, including a policy paper called "Firearm-Related Injuries Affecting the Pediatric Population." The academy says its policy on firearm-related injuries was first set in 1992 and reaffirmed in 2004. The policy paper says that in 1997, 32,436 firearm-related deaths occurred in the United States, and 4,223 of the victims were children and teenagers under 20. The paper also says that in 1997, 306 children and teens under 20 were killed by firearms as a result of unintentional firearm-related injuries. The academy then makes several recommendations to reduce firearm-related injuries. The first recommendation is that "the most effective measure to prevent firearm-related injuries to children and adolescents is the absence of guns from homes and communities," the academy writes. "Firearm regulation, to include bans of handguns and assault weapons, is the most effective way to reduce firearm-related injuries." Other recommendations include urging pediatricians to inform parents about the danger of guns, advocating for trigger locks and other safety mechanisms, and supporting the development of nonviolent, gun-free television programs and video games. The policy paper clearly supports banning handguns and assault weapons, but it does not explicitly advocate a complete ban on guns, which likely would require an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It addresses legal concerns by saying the federal government could ban "whole categories of firearms." The academy notably also supported Chicago's handgun ban in a case that came before the U.S. Supreme Court. "The best way to truly protect children from firearm injuries is to get guns out of their homes, their neighborhoods and where they play," said AAP President Judith S. Palfrey. "If we don't, too many children will continue to be hurt or die needlessly." And Hammer pointed us toward another position statement that she said had been on a second AAP website, www.healthychildren.org. "The most effective way to prevent firearm-related injury to children is to keep guns out of homes and communities. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports gun-control legislation. We believe that handguns, deadly air guns and assault weapons should be banned." That statement appears to have been replaced on the website. The statement on "where we stand" now reads: "The safest home for a child is a home without a gun. However, if a gun is present in the home of a child, the gun should be stored unloaded and locked, with the ammunition locked separately, so that a child cannot access the gun." Interestingly, some gun-control groups have realized the use of the word "ban" is a red flag and have tried to avoid it. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, for instance, says it is not a "gun-ban" organization and that "a safer America can be achieved without banning guns." Brady does say certain types of guns, such as military-style assault weapons like Uzis and AK-47s, should be "out of bounds for private ownership." Debbie Linchesky, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, referred comment on the issue to Louis St. Petery, a Leon County pediatrician and member of the academy's Florida chapter. St. Petery said Hammer is distorting the position of doctors. "It's certainly a mischaracterization of where we are on things," St. Petery said. "Forty percent of folks in this country own guns. We (my family) own a gun. "It's not that we feel that guns need to be eliminated from the face of the Earth, which is what Ms. Hammer would suggest," he said. St. Petery said doctors aren't pushing a political agenda; rather, they're trying to keep children safe. If doctors know someone owns a pool, they want to use their limited time with a patient discussing pool safety. If doctors know someone owns a gun, they want to discuss gun safety, he said. "We are trying to do the best job we can to protect children," St. Petery said. "We feel that's our job, prevention is what it's about." That brings us back to Hammer's claim. In making her case to support a bill that would make it illegal for doctors to ask patients about guns, Hammer says doctors -- particularly pediatricians -- are bringing politics into the exam rooms. We cannot make a judgment on that, but we can assess her claim that the American Academy of Pediatrics "supports banning guns." We found no evidence that the academy supports an outright ban on all guns. But the academy does say that "firearm regulation, to include bans of handguns and assault weapons, is the most effective way to reduce firearm-related injuries." It also voiced support for Chicago's handgun-ban law. We think Hammer could have been slightly more clear in making her case to the Legislature. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-09325	John Paul Stevens is the only Protestant on the U.S. Supreme Court.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/14/stephen-colbert/colbert-claims-justice-john-paul-stevens-last-prot/	And then there were none. On the April 12, 2010, episode of The Colbert Report, host Stephen Colbert pointed out that "the departure of Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens will leave an unsual void." "Stevens is the last Protestant," Colbert said to his guest, legal expert Jeffrey Toobin. "When he's gone, who will speak for the people in Bermuda shorts?" In fact, much has been made of Stevens' religion since he announced his retirement on April 9. Once he steps down -- and unless President Barack Obama appoints another Protestant to take his place -- there will be no more Protestants on the bench. Justice David Souter, who left the court in 2009, is Episcopalian, a religion that combines both Protestant and Catholic traditions. He was replaced by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is Catholic. In addition to Sotomayor, five of the justices are Catholic, including Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsberg are Jewish. So, why all this discussion of Stevens' religious affiliation? If anything, it says a lot about how the demographics of the court have changed over the years. Historically speaking, the religious affiliations of the current court are quite unusual, according to a report and study done by NPR's Nina Totenberg. For decades, the court was majority Protestant, she reports. It was Catholics and Jews who were the anomaly. That shift is even more pronounced when you look at the nation's religious affiliations. According to the CIA World Factbook, a little more 50 percent of Americans identify as Protestant. Catholics make up about 24 percent of the population, while Jews represent about 1.7 percent of the population. So, back to Colbert's claim. He's correct that Stevens is a Protestant and he's the last one on the Supreme Court bench. Colbert's first statement on the Truth-O-Meter gets a True.

pomt-04200	Says food stamp growth, while high, lagged the rise in unemployment.	true	/ohio/statements/2012/dec/06/anne-goodman/cleveland-food-bank-executive-anne-goodman-says-fo/	Mention food stamps in a mixed political crowd and you’ll get a full buffet of opinions -- starchy, sugary, wilted and done to a turn -- about the people who use them. Exhibit A is the array of reader comments on Cleveland.com after a story there, and in The Plain Dealer on Dec. 3, described efforts in Congress to cut the federal food safety net. Sorry, but you’ll get no dish here about the habits or consumption patterns of Americans using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP (now delivered in the form of an electronic card rather than with stamps or coupons). Instead, PolitiFact Ohio is using this as an opportunity to revisit a claim from the food stamp story, made by Anne Goodman, president and CEO of the Cleveland Foodbank. The food bank provides food for 450 meal sites, shelters and pantries, whose clients include Ohioans on SNAP whose food budgets run out before the end of each month. Goodman said that while national SNAP enrollment grew by 70 percent between 2007 and 2011, unemployment jumped by a much higher rate, 94 percent. That shows, she said, "that SNAP is working as it was intended. It was designed to ensure that families have food when they need a helping hand." PolitiFact Ohio was curious about those figures. Did food stamp growth really lag unemployment as the economy turned sour. A cursory look at labor statistics showed she was in the ballpark. But the data, and thus the rhetoric, can change depending on the months reported or even the dates when the data is released, so we asked for more. Goodman provided three sources of information. The first was the latest SNAP Annual Summary from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which runs SNAP. The summary provided data from 2007 to 2011, a five year window that includes pre-recession data for a baseline and carries into recovery. 2011 also is the most current year for which statistics are available. The summary shows annual participation, measured in fiscal years. In 2007, there were 26.316 million individual SNAP recipients. In 2011, there were 44.709 million. That comes to a growth rate of 69.89 percent. With almost no rounding, that’s the same as 70 percent. So Goodman was accurate on that figure. We should note that these are annual averages. As the article in The Plain Dealer on food stamps said Dec. 3, participation was as high as 47.1 million at one point, in August, 2011. That figure came from another Agriculture Department set of data, tracking SNAP participation by the month. The second source that Goodman sent us was a set of U.S. Census Bureau data on economic characteristics of Americans. This was from the bureau’s American Community Survey, and it estimated the percentage of individuals on food stamps was 7.7 percent in 2007, and 13 percent in 2011. That’s a 68.8 percent growth rate, or 1 percent lower than the figure from the Agriculture Department. The difference is likely due to a difference in methodology: The census asks questions of households, and the Agriculture Department has actual figures from the food stamp program, since it runs it. With the numbers so close, it makes little difference here. So Goodman’s numbers were good on food stamp growth. But what about unemployment growth? That leads to the third set of data she cited, this from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The bureau, a division of the Labor Department, tracks the number and percentage of people in the workforce who are unemployed. In 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.6 percent. In 2011, it was 8.9 percent. That’s a 93.48 percent rise. Goodman put it at 94 percent -- within a percentage point of the actual figure. We checked BLS data using a different table -- the government agency allows you to use its information in different formats -- and got the same result as Goodman. These, too, were annual averages, and some months were higher, some lower. If you were to pick certain months in those years to find high and low points, you could show an even bigger leap in unemployment -- as high as the 105 percent rise between May 2007 and May 2011. But by using the more conservative annual average, it becomes clear that Goodman did not cherry pick the data to show extremes. Her comments to The Plain Dealer, and an op-ed column on food aid that she wrote for the newspaper on Dec. 2, were not the first time these numbers have been cited. Goodman mentioned them when she appeared before the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee on March 7 to discuss the need for food assistance. And Feeding America, a national charity, has cited them in its materials. Goodman’s figures check out entirely. On the Truth-O-Meter, her claim rates True.

pomt-01718	"What (the Obama administration is) going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/07/shelley-moore-capito/will-epa-regulations-stop-plants-burning-coal-shel/	Is President Barack Obama poised to stop any more coal from burning in the United States? That’s the message from U.S. Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia against Democrat Natalie Tennant. In a campaign ad released July 29, Capito, surrounded by blue-collar workers, warns against Obama’s coal regulations. "The president's come out with rules that say 'no new coal-fired power plants,’" Capito says. "But what he's going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants." We already fact-checked the claim that new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency say "no new coal-fired power plants." We said it was Mostly False. But what about existing power plants? We decided to take a look. What the EPA is doing In June 2014, the EPA, at Obama’s direction, proposed a plan to reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent compared to 2005 base levels over the next 25 years. The plan is now in a 12-month review period before it is finalized. The proposal does not say that existing coal plants must be shut down or can’t burn coal. So in a literal sense, Capito’s claim falls flat. In fact, baked into the EPA’s own estimates is an assumption that 30 percent of the country’s energy will still come from coal in 2030. (In 2013, about 39 percent of U.S. power came from coal.) Here’s what the EPA is actually doing. Under the new rules, the EPA has given each state its own goal for reducing carbon emissions over the next 25 years. While the goal is a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gases nationally, every state has a different threshold it must reach based on feasibility, cost and current pollution levels, among other factors. How are these goals achieved? The EPA basically says it's up to states to decide. There are a variety of options, including proposals for states to create regional cap and trade networks, invest in renewable energy and build smart grid technology. And, yes, they could phase out existing coal plants. But experts we spoke with said that’s far from a certainty or the only option. First, the steps toward reaching these goals will be gradual. So to insinuate that within several months the EPA is going to stop plants from burning coal is just fear mongering. Second, it’s important to keep in mind that many of the coal plants already in existence are quite old — most have been in operation at least 30 years — and were on track to be retired in the next decade anyway. Perhaps these new rules accelerate that process, but it was coming. Another reason many coal plants were set to close is because of existing federal rules against mercury emissions. These rules are much more stringent than the new carbon rules, experts told us. But plants that weren’t scheduled for retirement that can meet the mercury standards have other options to stay open. For example, they can retrofit their facilities with technology that will result in cleaner emissions, such as scrubbers that remove some of the carbon. "In no way does this program say coal can’t live," said Michael Webber, the deputy director of the Energy Institute at The University of Texas at Austin. "What it is is a death blow for outdated, old, vintage coal plants, unless they pay for" technology upgrades. So how does the EPA proposal say "you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants"? We asked Capito’s campaign for evidence. Spokeswoman Amy Graham told us that, "Not a single West Virginia coal plant meets the average standard set for our state in the EPA rule. That doesn't mean that every plant has to close, but because 95 percent of our state's electricity production comes from coal, in order to reduce the state's emissions rate to the required average, coal capacity will have to close." But that’s not remotely close to what Capito said. In fact, the idea that the EPA proposal "doesn’t mean that every plant has to close" seems to entirely contradict Capito’s claim in the ad. What’s next for coal? Some energy companies might find technological upgrades too costly, and will seek alternatives such as natural gas, which is much cheaper right now. But for other facilities, particularly larger ones, the initial upfront costs may be offset by savings from creating more efficient, modern plants, said Dallas Burtraw, associate director of the Resources for the Future Center for Climate and Electricity Policy, an energy think tank funded by government, nonprofits and energy companies. "We’re going to see a shakeout of older and smaller coal plants, the least efficient ones anyway," Burtraw said. "The ones that remain will have a high level of environmental controls and will run relatively efficiently with a high utilization rate." States, too, will influence this process when they create their blueprint for decreasing emissions, said Amy Jaffe, executive director of Energy and Sustainability at the University of California, Davis. "It may be in some places there is nothing you can do other than stop using coal, but there's nothing in the rules that says there can’t be coal," Jaffe said. "States have been given targets based on their existing profiles and will come back to the EPA with state plans for how to meet a target of reduction. Some states that are using coal will continue to burn coal and find other ways to cut emissions." We asked Paul Meier, an associate scientist and director of the University of Wisconsin Energy Institute, to review what impact the rules might have on West Virginia in particular. Coal plants in West Virginia on average emit 2,056 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour. The EPA’s proposed guidelines would require West Virginia coal plants to average 1,748 pounds of carbon per megawatt hour by 2020 and 1,620 pounds per megawatt hour by 2030, a 21 percent decrease that Meier said "requires only a slight reduction in coal reliance." "This can be accomplished by improving the efficiency of the coal plants, or by displacing some of the coal generation with natural gas, nuclear, renewable electricity," Meier said. "States may propose their own plan to accomplish this, and may also receive credit for increasing conservation and efficiency efforts." Our ruling Capito said "What (Obama is) going to come out with in the next several months is you're not even going to be able to burn coal very limitedly in the existing plants." The proposal Capito is referring to is an EPA plan to cut carbon emissions in existing power plants. Those rules do not prohibit current facilities from burning coal, and even Capito’s spokeswoman said the rule "doesn't mean that every plant has to close." Some facilities will close down within the next decade, but many of those plants were scheduled to be retired anyway due to age and other factors. States and power companies have options to continue to utilize coal for energy, and experts said they expect coal to remain part of the national portfolio for years to come.

pomt-00939	"One third of our age group (Millennials) have moved back in with their parents."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/feb/23/joseph-yost/yost-says-one-third-millennials-live-parents/	Del. Joseph Yost, 28, recently told the House of Delegates that his generation is "ready for a serious conversation about the future of our state." But before the dialogue can begin, the Montgomery County Republican told fellow lawmakers, "you have to know what matters most to me and people of my age." Yost spoke of two financial realities that have hurt his generation since the Great Recession: high college tuition and a tight job market. "One-third of our age group have moved back in with their parents," Yost, R-Montgomery, said in a floor speech. No doubt, times have been tough. But we wondered whether so many of Yost’s age peers, after setting out on their own, have returned to their parents’ roosts. Yost, the youngest member of the General Assembly, told us he based his claim on an August 2013 report by the Pew Research Center examining the living arrangements of Millennials -- defined by Pew as adults born after 1980. The report drilled into U.S. Census Bureau data on where people aged 18 through 31 lived in 2012. It found that 36 percent of them were living with their parents -- slightly higher than the one-third Yost proclaimed. Pew said the 36 percent living with parents was "the highest share in at least four decades." But aside from the uptick, figures in the report show the proportion of 18- to 31-year-olds living with their parents has been fairly stable over the last 50 years. In 1968, the first year for which figures are available, 32 percent of the age group lived with their parents. In 1981 it was 31 percent. In 2007 -- on the cusp of the recession -- 32 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds lived with their parents. In other words, about one-third of 18- to 31-year-olds were living with their parents decades before the Great Recession. We should point out that Census data counts college students living in dormitories as residing with their parents. Richard Fry, a senior economist at Pew and author of the report, said some might quibble with categorizing those students as living with their parents. But Fry sees value in including them, saying those students -- who may head home for the summer -- still have "a lot of financial ties to their parents." Pew cited several reasons why the percentage of young adults living at home rose from a pre-recession level of 32 percent in 2007: Declining employment among young adults. An increase in unmarried Millennials who were more likely to live at home. In 1968, 56 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds were married, according to Pew. That fell to 23 percent in 2012. Rising college enrollment, with the students likely to be characterized as living at home. Fry has done an updated examination of the Census figures. They show that in 2014, about 32 percent of Millennials -- now age 18- to 33-years-old -- were living at home. A Gallup poll, released in February 2014 that found 29 percent of people age 18-34 were living with their parents. We should finally note that Yost says he permanently moved out of his parents’ home in 2006, when he graduated from Radford University. Our ruling Yost says one-third of Millennials "have moved back in with their parents." He has the fraction right, but omits an important detail. This issue is not unique to Millennials. The proportion of 18- to 31-year-olds living with parents has been pretty steady over the years; it was 32 percent in 1968 and, after an increase in 2012, returned to 32 percent last year. It should also be made clear that Yost’s statistic refers to the percentage of Millennials living with their parents. Yost, in saying one-third "have moved back in with their parents," suggests that one in three returned to the fold after trying to set out on their own. But some in this group -- the Pew study doesn’t say how many -- never left home to begin with. Because it lacks context, we rate Yost’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-06703	Says that 500,000 federal workers -- one-fourth of the federal workforce -- make more than $100,000 a year.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/03/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-500000-federal-workers-earn-more-/	To bolster their case to reduce the size and cost of government, Republicans often say federal employees are overpaid. During an Aug. 15, 2011, town hall in Litchfield, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney cited salary figures to make the point. "I found it surprising that over a quarter of federal workers make more than $100,000 a year -- 500,000 federal workers make more than $100,000 a year.'' Romney said. To back up the claim, the Romney campaign cited figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that say the total federal civilian work force is 2.2 million federal employees, not including postal workers. The campaign also cited a USA Today report from July 2011 that said there were "nearly" 500,000 workers earning $100,000 or more. We checked with the Office of Personnel Management, which keeps data on federal employees and salaries. According to its Fed Scope database, the total civilian workforce was 2.14 million in June, the most recent month for which information was available. And at that time there were 459,016 federal workers who made at least $100,000 in average base salary each year. That’s a little short of the 500,000 Romney claimed. It accounts for 21.5 percent of government employees, not 25 percent as he said. It's about 22 percent if you just look at "permanent" federal employees, which excludes temporary employees, student interns, the legislative and judicial branches along with the Postal Service and the military. "Governor Romney said over one quarter of federal workers make more than $100,000. He meant to say nearly a quarter,'' said Ryan Williams, a campaign spokesman. Some studies have claimed that government workers earn higher salaries than private-sector workers, but federal officials say that's an apples and oranges comparison. OPM Director John Berry has said the studies fail to recognize that federal jobs require workers who are more educated and need higher skills. John Palguta, vice president with the Partnership for Public Service, a group that encourages people to work in government, said the studies don't prove that federal workers are overpaid. "There is no convincing evidence that a significant percentage of those federal employees who are paid above $100,000 a year are being paid at a level that is above what major private sector employers pay their employees in similar occupations, with similar levels of responsibility, and which require similar knowledge, skills, and abilities,’’ he said. It's worth noting that studies show federal salaries rose significantly under former President George W. Bush, and then by greater amounts under President Obama. Our Ruling Romney was slightly off by saying 25 percent, but the actual number is 21.5 percent, so he was in the ballpark. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-15140	Georgia has the 9th highest rate of adults, ages 18 to 64, without a high school diploma or GED.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/02/melissa-johnson/report-accurate-about-georgias-low-diploma-rate/	With all the expectations placed on workers today, it’s hard to think that hundred of thousands of Georgia adults are lacking what many consider a basic necessity: a high school diploma. But in a recent report, Melissa Johnson, a policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said the Peach State has the ninth highest rate of adults, ages 18 to 64, without a high school diploma or its equivalent, the GED. We’re talking about roughly 866,000 working age Georgians, Johnson said. Disturbing? Yes. Accurate? PolitiFact decided to do some checking. We reached out to Georgia Budget & Policy Institute spokesman John McCosh, who told us the statistics Johnson cited came from the Working Poor Families Project, an initiative funded by the Ford Foundation, Annie Casey Foundation and others. We contacted the project’s Brandon Roberts, who walked us through a report the organization publishes annually and concluded Johnson’s numbers were accurate . The project’s report, Roberts said, is based on an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by the widely recognized Population Reference Bureau. For 2013, it showed that about 865,706 -- or 13.7 percent of Georgians -- ages 18 to 64 -- lacking either a high school diploma or GED. Eight states had fewer working-age high school graduates -- Alabama, Arizona, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas, according to the analysis. California ranked the lowest, with 17 percent of its 18- to 64-year-olds failing to have completed high school or having passed the equivalency test, the data from the Working Poor Families Project showed. College and career readiness has become a key focal point in public education, and with reason. Researchers say the percentage of jobs requiring a high school diploma or less fell from 72 percent in 1973 to 40 percent in 2007. By 2018, it’s expected to be 30 percent, and the people who land those jobs may not be able to sustain a family on their salaries. Gov. Nathan Deal set a goal in 2011 of having an additional 250,000 Georgians with post-secondary school credentials -- an associate’s degree, bachelor’s degree or higher - by 2020. University officials have been making a big push in that direction and still, as evidence of the challenges, there’s talk of the deadline being moved back to 2025. We found other data that make a similar case. For example, the Governor’s Office of Student Achievement reported in 2013 that, as of 2010, 16 percent of Georgia adults -- 984,740 -- lacked a high school diploma or GED. The agency also reported that 5.9 percent of all Georgians -- or 618,820 residents -- had less than a ninth grade education and that 55 percent of Georgia’s inmates (the fifth highest inmate population in the country) did not at that time have either a high school diploma or GED. We also spoke to Dana Rickman and Steve Dolinger at the Georgia Partnership for Excellence in Education. Rickman, the nonprofit’s policy and research director, said she had not made an in-depth review of Johnson’s report but said the ranking of Georgia as ninth from the bottom in percentage of people, 18 to 64, with high school degrees/GEDs, "seems reasonable." Although Georgia’s four-year high school graduation rate has been climbing, up from 68 percent in 2011 to 73 percent in 2014, it’s still among the nation’s lowest, Rickman said. The state has looked better in the past decade or two because it has been a big importer of people with college degrees, especially in the Atlanta area, she said. "We’re importing adult talent, so it makes sense to me that we’d be about ninth," she said. That trend may have slowed a little since the Recession, said Dolinger, the partnership’s president and a former county school superintendent. He and Rickman said multiple initiatives have been launched -- everything from trying to simultaneously raise rigor and graduate rates in high schools to closely tracking college students so they stay in school and focused on completion of a degree or certificate program. "We were part of Complete College America, which we coined Complete College Georgia, and that was helpful," Dolinger said. "Now there are two new pieces, Go Back Move Ahead, to get kids who have some college to go back and complete, and the new legislation, Move on When Ready. Those are to help the kids stay in school or go back." Georgia State University and Chattahoochee Tech are working to be models of how to track and retain students, he said. Part of College Georgia also allows some credits for life skills, an incentive for someone considering returning to college, Rickman said. Dolinger said he believes "the trend is that we’re doing better. "The problem is that the states that are doing better - up in the top 10 -- are sure not waiting on us to catch them," he said. Our conclusion Johnson’s report states that Georgia has the 9th highest rate of adults, ages 18 to 64, without a high school diploma or GED. She based the statement on a report from the Working Poor Families Project, an initiative funded by the Ford Foundation, Annie Casey Foundation and others, and drawn from research that the organization has produced annually based on an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau information. That’s about 865,706 -- or 13.7 percent of Georgians -- ages 18 to 64 -- lacking either a high school diploma or GED. We found slightly different data for different years, but that pointed out Johnson’s overarching point that Georgia has a large problem. We rate Johnson’s statement True.

pomt-04673	Says his budget plan "would cut our deficits by $4 trillion."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/07/barack-obama/obama-says-budget-plan-cut-deficits-4-trillion/	Editor’s note: After we published this item, we were alerted that our description of the position of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget contained incomplete information. We reviewed that description, interviewed the committee’s staff again, made changes, and re-published our report on Sept. 19, 2012. The text of our original report is archived here. The ruling remains Half True. Republicans have used the government’s growing deficits as a cudgel to drive Democrats out of office. The strategy worked well in 2010 and, with the nation’s total debt having hit $16 trillion, they are using it again. Democrats say they, too, are working to reduce the deficits. In his speech at the Democratic convention, Barack Obama said he will put the country on a path to better fiscal health. He spoke of the choice this election offers voters and said "You can choose a future where we reduce our deficit without wrecking our middle class. Independent analysis shows that my plan would cut our deficits by $4 trillion." The president made the same claim in a television ad. We rated it Half True. The independent analysis the Obama campaign relied on back then came from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. Looking at a 10-year horizon, the center estimated that the president’s combination of spending cuts and tax increases would lower deficits by $3.8 trillion over the decade. That total included $1.7 trillion in reductions that the president and Congress agreed to in 2011. According to the center, about 46 percent would come from higher revenues; about 54 percent of the reductions would come through spending cuts. Obama’s plan is detailed and complex. To raise revenues, families making over $250,000 a year would pay more, but he also has an extensive list of tax breaks he would eliminate. They can be arcane. For example: • Repeal last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories • Determine the foreign tax credit on a pooling basis • Repeal lower-of-cost-or-market inventory accounting method • Eliminate special treatment of carried interest On the spending side, the president proposes $580 billion in cuts to a number of programs that range from agricultural subsidies to rental assistance to airport construction. In 2011, Obama proposed some $320 billion in health program cuts. The federal government would pay less to drug makers and nursing homes. In the long run, many states would shoulder a larger share of Medicaid costs. Changing Baselines The Obama campaign claims that over 10 years, it would trim deficits by $4 trillion. Many assumptions lie behind that statement, but the most important question is, compared to what? No budget projection makes sense unless it’s measured against some baseline. A baseline is an analyst’s best guess as to what the deficit would be if things were left to themselves. Changes in tax law, government spending, and economic growth are just some of the major factors that drive baseline estimates. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, looked at the president’s 2013 budget and concluded that it would increase the cumulative deficit by $3.5 trillion over its baseline between now and 2022. That greatly undercuts Obama’s argument that he is saving money. But the CBO baseline assumed that all of the Bush tax cuts and other tax breaks would expire. It assumed that Congress would stick to the spending caps in the deficit reduction law it passed to avoid a government default. Many, if not most, analysts doubt that the CBO baseline is realistic. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction, has its own baseline. Unlike the CBO, it assumes that congress will find a way around the deepest budget cuts and that it will extend the tax cuts to some degree. Using the baseline developed by the committee, the president’s budget plan looks much better. Jason Peuquet, the committee’s research director, says it delivers about $2.4 trillion in new savings. In order to get to $4 trillion, you need to add the savings that stem from spending cuts in 2011, both from the budget deal and earlier in the year. Obama includes those in his tally but they did not originate with his budget proposal. Peuquet warns that all numbers like these "can be gamed." His group thinks the more important goal is to get deficits headed down relative to the size of the economy. On those terms, he says the president’s plan is a good start but does not go far enough. Our ruling Obama says his plan will cut deficits by $4 trillion. On its own, Obama’s plan does not produce the full $4 trillion. Both the source cited by the Obama campaign and a separate group, one that puts a premium on deficit reduction, say the president’s plan will shrink the cumulative gap between spending and revenues by well over $2 trillion over ten years. The remainder comes from the 10-year impact of cuts already approved. To the extent that long term predictions hold up, the president’s big number is accurate, but he takes credit for changes that took place outside of his budget proposal. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-09-07T00:13:35	2012-09-06	['None']

pomt-00814	"Inflation-adjusted defense spending has declined 21 percent since 2010, and even if we discount the drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan, it has still declined by a dangerous 12 percent."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/30/marco-rubio/defense-spending-has-dropped-21-percent-2010-rubio/	Even with combat in Iraq and Afghanistan officially over, potential presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio is calling for a reversal of a shrinking defense budget. On March 24, 2015, Rubio and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., introduced a budget amendment that would raise the Pentagon’s budget despite legislative limitations and an end to two wars. The defense budget already has gone down too much, Rubio said in a speech on the Senate floor. "Inflation-adjusted defense spending has declined 21 percent since 2010, and even if we discount the drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan, it has still declined by a dangerous 12 percent," Rubio said. Those are big numbers in a military budget that is more than $500 billion. We wanted to check his accounting and see what the numbers told us. Sequestration frustration Rubio’s amendment deals largely with the effects of the Budget Control Act, which Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed on Aug. 2, 2011, to end a standoff on the nation’s debt ceiling. That was when Republicans and some Democrats said the White House needed to reduce the nation’s debt in exchange for raising the amount the treasury can borrow, which Congress was required to approve. Had the debt ceiling not been raised, the United States could have defaulted on payments for the first time in history. In response to the showdown, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the nation’s credit rating anyway. Part of the Budget Control Act’s terms was $1.2 trillion in cuts, with a joint House and Senate super-committee responsible to find another $1.2 trillion in cuts by Nov. 23. If they didn’t agree on what to whittle away, across-the-board sequestration cuts would go into effect. Sequestration was essentially a dare that was supposed to threaten Congress into working together to find things to cut. But the super-committee couldn’t agree, and the sequestration began to impose $1.2 trillion in cuts over 10 years -- including $487 billion from defense. Neither the White House nor Congressional Democrats or Republicans like the practice, which (among other things) imposes spending caps on the defense budget. These caps increase a set amount each year, but generally not enough to keep up with inflation. That’s where we get to Rubio’s amendment, which aims to raise the defense budget back to 2012 spending projections without having to comply with the Budget Control Act caps. Drawing down the budget Rubio’s office did not confirm the source of his statistic, but it almost certainly came from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments’ Analysis of the Fiscal Year 2015 Defense Budget, which was released in September 2014. The 2015 defense budget has three main parts: $495.6 billion in base discretionary funding, which is subject to the sequestration cap, and $58.6 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations, which is not capped. The contingency funding started with the name Global War on Terror under President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks. Obama changed the name to Overseas Contingency Operations but still used the fund to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Iraq war officially ended in December 2010, so Afghanistan gets most of the contingency funding now. Also not subject to the cap is the third portion, $6.2 billion in mandatory funding, which includes retirement and pension payments. There are various other appropriations in the defense budget, such as Haiti earthquake relief in 2010 and Hurricane Sandy assistance in 2013. By comparison, fiscal year 2010 had a $527.9 billion base budget and $162.4 billion contingency budget. (The numbers we’re sharing now won’t add up to the exact same percentages as Rubio had them because of inflation adjustments and the range of appropriations included in the report.) Todd Harrison, senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and the report's author, said Rubio correctly used his analysis as adjusted for inflation. But while it’s a matter of interpretation whether defense spending should go up, Rubio is lacking context, Harrison said. Today’s military has a little more than half the troops it had in Korea or Vietnam, and it’s relatively normal for spending to decrease this way as wars end. "If you go back historically, and not even that far, levels now are comparable to 2007," Harrison said. "It’s still above the level of spending during the majority of the Bush years." Other economic and defense policy experts agreed with Harrison’s data-driven conclusions, but were somewhat split on Rubio’s stance. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said even sequestration cuts weren’t making much of a dent in the highest relative defense spending since World War II. "Cherry-picking a historic high to make your point about the level of cuts misrepresents the data, plain and simple," Ellis said. Janine Davidson, senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that even with the end of two wars, the Defense Department still needs to maintain some level of funding that would allow it to retain its status as a global military leader. Equipment needs to be upgraded or replaced, munitions must be restocked and increasingly expensive weapons systems must be replaced, she said. While the number of actual personnel is decreasing, costs are going up and a military presence is required in more and more places, such as backing allies and fighting extremists. "It’s not just about spending more, it is about spending it wisely," she said. Our ruling Rubio said, "Inflation-adjusted defense spending has declined 21 percent since 2010 and even if we discount the drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan it has still declined by a dangerous 12 percent." While Rubio’s office didn’t get back to us, a Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments economist confirmed it was taken from an analysis he wrote about the fiscal year 2015 defense budget. Experts we talked to said while the conclusion is correct, Rubio doesn’t put the decrease in context of the historic high funding from 2010. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-09980	Washing your hands and covering your mouth when you cough "makes a huge difference" in reducing transmission of the flu.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/30/barack-obama/studies-show-hand-washing-reduces-disease/	President Barack Obama was asked about swine flu at a prime-time news conference marking his first 100 days in office. The reporter wanted to know if Obama would consider quarantines or closing the border with Mexico, where the flu appears to have started. Obama said his health advisers were not recommending closing the border. "But the most important thing right now that public health officials have indicated is that we treat this the same way that we would treat other flu outbreaks, just understanding that because this is a new strain, we don't yet know how it will respond to that," Obama said. "So wash your hands when you shake hands. Cover your mouth when you cough. I know it sounds trivial, but it makes a huge difference," Obama said. "If you are sick, stay home. If your child is sick, keep them out of school. If you are feeling certain flu symptoms, don't get on an airplane, don't get on any system of public transportation where you're confined and you could potentially spread the virus." We wondered about hand-washing and covering your mouth when you cough. Have our mothers been right all these years? Indeed, Obama's remarks mirror the advice from the Centers for Disease Control almost perfectly. When it comes to preventing the flu, the CDC recommends the following: • Avoid close contact. • Stay home when you are sick. • Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. • Clean your hands. • Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. • Practice good health habits, like getting lots of sleep, getting exercise, and eating nutritious food. We also found numerous independent scientific studies that found handwashing significantly reduced the transmission of disease, including the MRSA bacteria and the flu. The University of Michigan School of Public Health is in the midst of a two-year study examining whether face masks and handwashing can reduce the transmission of the flu. The study tracked the spread of flu among college students in university dorms, and used a control group to compare outcomes. Initial results indicate that face masks and hand sanitizing reduced the transmission rate of the flu by as much as 50 percent. But knowing you should wash your hands and doing it are two different things. And putting your hands under the faucet for three seconds and then wiping them on your slacks doesn't count. Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, has been trying to raise awareness of the importance of handwashing in hospitals. Studies show that doctors and health care workers wash their hands only about half the time they should before examining patients, said Lisa McGiffert, the director of the group's "Stop Hospital Infections" campaign. "Some people think that this is such a simple thing that it couldn't make a difference. But it does," McGiffert said. "This is what the experts have been trying to get health care workers and doctors to do for decades, and it does make it difference." Hand sanitizers are a good substitute for handwashing, and coughing into your arm is better than coughing into your hand, she said. To make sure you've washed your hands thoroughly, sing Happy Birthday (silently, please). When the song is over, you've washed long enough. And regular soap works just fine. Obama said that handwashing and covering your mouth when you cough can make a huge difference. The scientific consensus on handwashing backs him up. We rate his statement True.

pomt-15153	"African Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/aug/30/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-right-police-do-treat-african-ameri/	U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, is trying to attract black voters to his presidential campaign, despite some opposition from activists in the Black Lives Matter movement. The website for Sanders’ campaign for the Democratic nomination devotes an entire section to "Racial Justice." It kicks off by reciting the names of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and other individuals who have died during encounters with police. "We know their names," it says. "Each of them died unarmed at the hands of police officers or in police custody… We should not fool ourselves into thinking that this violence only affects those whose names have appeared on TV or in the newspaper." Then it says this: "African Americans are twice as likely to be arrested and almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with the police." Further into Sanders’ presentation, the policy statement repeats the same two points. Only this time, these points closely follow some other statistics about blacks being three times as likely to be searched during a traffic stop, a statistic attributed to a U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report. We wondered where Sanders had gotten his information about blacks being twice as likely to be arrested and being almost four times as likely to experience police force. Sanders’ policy advisor, Warren Gunnels, initially referred us to a 2007 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report based on 10-year-old data from 2005. He directed us to the first page, where the federal statisticians had reported that "...black drivers were twice as likely as white drivers to be arrested." This didn’t support the statement that African Americans are twice as likely to be arrested in all cases for all arrests. The report did make a convincing presentation on another page showing that in 4.4 percent of their contacts with police, blacks experienced a use of force in 2005, while whites experienced force in only 1.2 percent of their contacts with police. This did support Sanders’ statement that African Americans are almost four times as likely to experience the use of force during encounters with police. In 2011, the federal statisticians revisited the same issue, examining 2008 statistics. They found that blacks experienced a use of force in 3.4 percent of their contacts with police. The percentage for the whites was still 1.2 percent. So the updated statistics show blacks being just shy of three times as likely — not almost four times as likely — to experience force during an arrest. Is there also more current data on the first part of Sanders’ claim? We got back to Gunnels to follow up on the likelihood of arrest question. Gunnels directed us to a report compiled by The Sentencing Project, a Washington D.C.-based organization that promotes alternatives to imprisonment and also carries out research on criminal justice issues, including racial disparities. A passage in that 2008 report asserted that blacks are arrested at a rate twice their share of the population. Marc Mauer, The Sentencing Project’s director, provided additional analysis based on 2013 arrest statistics from the FBI Uniform Crime Report and data from the U.S. Census. In 2013, blacks represented 28.3 percent of all persons arrested, even though they were only about 13.2 percent of the national population, Mauer said, noting that the 13.2 percent population figure is an estimate that tends to fluctuate. "If all things were equal, you would expect blacks to represent 13.2 percent of all arrests," Mauer said. "But they are not equal. The 28 percent figure is a little more than double the national population figure." By contrast, whites represented about 77.7 percent of the population in 2013, Mauer said, and whites represented about 68.9 percent of all arrests. Does this mean blacks are twice as likely to be arrested as whites? "They are arrested at twice their share of the population," Mauer said. And yes, he said, this also means blacks are twice as likely to be arrested as whites. Our ruling Blacks are twice as likely to be arrested as whites based on a criminologist’s analysis of the 2013 data. But, based on the latest numbers that the federal statisticians could provide regarding use of force, blacks are about three times as likely to experience force during encounters with police. Three times is not "almost four times," but Sanders was 75 percent correct, which is more than a passing score and the rate was close to four times in an older study. For this reason, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2015-08-30T00:00:00	2015-08-12	['None']
pomt-06905	"Most countries have no debt ceiling."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/25/arianna-huffington/arianna-huffington-says-us-debt-ceiling-rules-are-/	On the July 24, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Arianna Huffington, a liberal commentator and founder of the Huffington Post, sought to provide viewers with a bit of historical context on the debt ceiling. The issue was pertinent because Democrats and Republicans have been engaged in high-stakes negotiations over whether and how to raise the limit on how much the federal government can legally borrow. Republicans are using the looming deadline as leverage to cut government outlays, while Democrats say that blocking an increase risks the nation’s creditworthiness, potentially complicating an already delicate economic situation. Huffington focused her comments on how unusual the U.S. rules for debt limits are. "I think this a completely artificial crisis," Huffington said. "Most countries have no debt ceiling. We (established) the debt ceiling in the First World War. It's been raised dozens of times. …" Amanpour pointed out, "But the thing is, it is a crisis now.": Huffington replied, "But it is a crisis because they made it a crisis. It's not a real crisis. We have many, many real crises. We have a job crisis. We have a growth crisis. We have a deficit crisis. We have a human capital crisis. We have an infrastructure crisis. We are not handling these crises now. We are handling a completely artificial crisis." We wondered whether the U.S. system is really as unusual as Huffington suggested. So we looked into it. First, some background. The debt limit, often called a "debt ceiling," sets a cap on how much the U.S. Treasury may borrow from the public and from other governmental agencies. Huffington is correct that the statutory limit on federal debt began in 1917, in a bill that helped finance the U.S. entry into World War I, according to the Congressional Research Service. Once the nation’s outstanding debt nears the debt ceiling, Congress must vote on, and the president must sign, a bill that raises the limit. Huffington is also correct that this has happened repeatedly over the years -- more than 90 times since 1940. If Congress and the president fail to agree to a debt ceiling increase, the government risks defaulting on payments to at least some of its creditors -- a development that independent ratings agencies have already made clear would lead to lowering the U.S. government’s usually top-tier credit rating. Many experts say that a default followed by a lowering of the U.S. credit rating could increase the costs of borrowing for all Americans and harm the fragile economic recovery. So that’s how the U.S. system works. How unusual is it? The first conclusion we drew from our research is that there has been no comprehensive study of how every country manages and limits its government’s debt level. So we have drawn inferences from a handful of studies that are more anecdotal than complete. In a report published last February, the Government Accountability Office, the oversight arm of Congress, described the U.S. system as fairly unusual, since the U.S. debt ceiling process moves independently of the general budgeting process. "The U.S. statutory debt limit is an uncommon attribute not shared by most sovereign debt issuers in that it is not tied to the budgetary process. As a result, when the government adopts a budget, the financing of the expenditures authorized is not automatically assured. While lawmakers in April approved spending appropriations for fiscal year 2011 (after continuing resolutions had allowed the government to operate since the beginning of the fiscal year), about 40 percent of this spending must be funded by borrowing. Borrowing is subject to the debt limit, with the current limit having been approved in February 2010. There is, therefore, no direct connection between the spending levels authorized by Congress and the ability of the government to fund this spending." More common, the GAO said, are systems in which the passage of the annual budget includes provisions to approve borrowing authority. "For example, in Canada, the Ministry of Finance is provided with a fixed amount that it is authorized to borrow for the fiscal year," the GAO wrote. "When necessary, the Ministry of Finance can request increased borrowing authority from the executive branch of government to fund unforeseen borrowing needs. In Sweden, the legislature approves borrowing authority annually; however, it is limited (by) purpose — to finance current deficits, provide loans, and redeem national debt, for example — rather than by amount." In several other countries, including the United Kingdom and New Zealand, treasury officials are provided with broad authority to borrow as needed, the GAO wrote. In a parliamentary system like the U.K., the same party always controls the executive branch and the legislative branch, limiting the kinds of disputes that emerge frequently in a system with checks and balances like that in the U.S. Some countries don’t have a debt ceiling but rather have targets that cap debt based on mathematical formulas. Switzerland, the GAO wrote, has a constitutional "debt brake" that limits expenditures to expected revenue plus adjustments for the state of the business cycle. Meanwhile, Germany has a constitutional amendment that requires that structural deficits not exceed 0.35 percent of Gross Domestic Product. Both have exceptions for economic emergencies -- another difference from the U.S. system. Sweden’s target is a net surplus of 1 percent of GDP over the course of the business cycle. Chile also uses this sort of target. The European Union has set a target of keeping gross government debt to 60 percent of GDP and budget deficits to 3 percent of GDP. But these limits are not binding and have not been thoroughly enforced. The only country examined by the GAO and other analysts that has a system similar to that used in the U.S. is Denmark. However, a Danish official told the GAO that the procedure has inspired a lot less brinksmanship than the U.S. process. "The limit is set high enough that it does not impede debt managers’ ability to issue debt," the official said. Experts we spoke to agreed that the U.S. system is, if not unique, then at least quite unusual. "Restrictions of that general form are very uncommon, and none seem to approach the rigidity of the U.S. provision," said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. So where does this leave us? While other countries -- with the exception of Denmark -- don’t have a debt ceiling mechanism exactly like the U.S. has, most countries that have been studied do use either mathematical targets or require approval of new borrowing authority whenever a budget is passed. So it’s not as if other countries have no debt limits -- they simply limit their debt using different tools. We think there’s validity in Huffington’s underlying point -- that the U.S. system of imposing a debt ceiling is unusual and that it’s more arbitrary than most other systems. So we rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Arianna Huffington	None	None	None	2011-07-25T17:33:01	2011-07-24	['None']

mpws-00009	A key piece of the budget proposal from Republicans in the Minnesota House is a bill to fund health and human services. It cuts more than $1 billion in spending, effectively allowing the GOP to cut taxes by $2 billion. The proposal has been controversial among Democrats, in part because $500 million of the savings come from ending MinnesotaCare, a health insurance program for the working poor. Democrats are also pointing to another cut in the bill that they contend amounts to a budget gimmick. They say the plan’s projected $300 million in savings from eliminating waste and fraud from Medicaid and other public programs would actually yield much less – around $16.5 million –which they say would leave a $283 million hole in the GOP budget for the coming biennium. 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2015/05/poligraph-dfl-correct-about-hhs-budget-hole/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: DFL correct about HHS budget ‘hole’	May 1, 2015, 2:00 PM	None	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Minnesota_Democratic–Farmer–Labor_Party', 'Minnesota_House_of_Representatives']
pomt-05941	"Our jobless rate, our unemployment rate, is the lowest of all of the big cities in New Jersey."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/27/chris-bollwage/elizabeth-mayor-chris-bollwage-claims-his-city-has/	Elizabeth Mayor Chris Bollwage knows what his critics will say during his re-election campaign: he's been in charge too long. But Bollwage, a Democrat whose fifth term ends this year, has a few reasons voters should keep him in office. "And we're moving in the right direction, the city of Elizabeth. We've done a lot of big things, with Ikea, Jersey Gardens, and we have opportunities here in our community. Our jobless rate, our unemployment rate, is the lowest of all of the big cities in New Jersey," Bollwage said during a Jan. 15 speech at the Cuban Club, drawing applause from his audience. "That's a great testament to our community." You may want to hold back your applause, though, because the mayor is wrong. A reader asked PolitiFact New Jersey to check out Bollwage’s claim. We found Elizabeth’s unemployment rate stands at 11.9 percent, according to the most recent data available from the state’s Labor Department. Newark’s and Paterson’s jobless rates are bleaker, at 14.1 percent and 15.4 percent, respectively. But Jersey City -- the second most populous city in the state behind Newark -- has an unemployment rate of 10.2 percent. So, among that group of cities with a population of more than 100,000, Elizabeth is third, not last. City spokesman William Reyes said Bollwage meant to say Elizabeth has one of the lowest, not the lowest, unemployment rates among New Jersey’s most populous cities. In his State of the City address, which Bollwage delivered before he gave the speech at the Cuban Club, the mayor got it right: "Our unemployment rate is among the lowest of New Jersey’s largest cities and we are looking to reduce that even more." A chart Reyes sent us that was shown during the mayor’s address compared the unemployment rates in Elizabeth, Trenton, Newark, Paterson and Camden. Of those cities, Camden has the highest unemployment rate, at 18.8 percent, and Elizabeth had the lowest, at 11.9 percent. Jersey City wasn’t included. Here’s a breakdown of the unemployment rates in New Jersey’s 15 most populous municipalities: Population City Unemployment Rate: Nov. 2011 Unemployment Rate: Nov. 2010 277140 Newark 14.1 14.5 247597 Jersey City 10.2 10.9 146199 Paterson 15.4 14.5 124969 Elizabeth 11.9 11.8 99967 Edison 7 6.8 99585 Woodbridge 7.9 8.6 92843 Lakewood 8.8 9.1 91239 Toms River 9.5 9.2 88464 Hamilton 7.4 7.6 84913 Trenton 12.7 12.5 84136 Clifton 9.5 9.7 77344 Camden 18.8 18.9 75072 Brick 9.4 9.3 71045 Cherry Hill 6.9 6.9 69781 Passaic 12.6 11.6 *Sources: U.S. Census Bureau and New Jersey Labor Department Our ruling The Elizabeth mayor said in an appearance at the Cuban Club that the city has the lowest unemployment rate among New Jersey’s biggest cities.

pomt-05562	"To get out of the (teachers) union, you pay 85 percent of $731. Then you're out of the union, but you've got to pay it every year, also required by statute. That’s called a representation fee."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/05/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-nonmembers-njea-must-pay-85-/	Leave it to Gov. Chris Christie to reference a classic song from the Eagles to make a point about the cost of not joining the New Jersey Education Association. Referring to the 1976 hit "Hotel California," the Republican governor told his audience at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in California on March 23 that after opting out of the teachers union, individuals must still pay 85 percent of the annual dues every year. "To get out of the union, you pay 85 percent of $731. Then you're out of the union, but you've got to pay it every year, also required by statute. That’s called a representation fee," Christie said. "The idea is that you’re benefiting from the representation even if you don’t wanna be in the union. "So, this reminds me, for people of my generation, like the ‘Hotel California,’" the governor continued, before citing the song’s lyrics. "‘You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.’" Christie is right that nonmembers of the NJEA must pay representation fees, but he is slightly off on the charges assessed by the teachers union, PolitiFact New Jersey found. First, let’s explain the state law permitting such fees. Under the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act, nonmembers of public-sector unions could be required to pay as much as 85 percent "of the regular membership dues, fees and assessments." These representation fees are set up through an agreement with the employer or via a petition to the state’s Public Employment Relations Commission. In New Jersey, most public-sector unions have obtained the right to collect representation fees, said Don Horowitz, counsel to the commission’s appeal board. Unless the union no longer represents the employees, representation fees must be paid every year, Horowitz told us. The argument behind such fees -- which are implemented throughout the country -- is that nonmembers are still benefiting from the union’s activities, according to Harry Hutchison, a law professor at George Mason University’s School of Law in Virginia. "The free rider problem is the crux of the argument for requiring nonmembers to pay labor union dues," Hutchison said. The fees are common for both public- and private-sector workers, he said. Now, we’ll turn to the dues and representation fees paid to the NJEA. At the Hoover Institution, Christie claimed the teachers union charges "$731 a year per public school employee." But the annual dues amounts charged by the NJEA vary by membership category. The highest dues is $791 for full-time professional staff, including teachers and administrators. More than 60 percent of the union’s roughly 195,000 members pay the maximum amount, while other members pay lesser amounts, according to NJEA spokesman Steve Wollmer. Wollmer told us 2,041 employees are paying a representation fee in lieu of joining the union. The union conducts an annual audit to determine the expenses chargeable to nonmembers, and the current fee stands at 81.8 percent of NJEA dues, Wollmer said in an e-mail. So, a full-time teacher who has decided against joining the teachers union must still pay $647 in the current school year to the NJEA. "The reasoning is that everyone benefits from the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, which includes salaries and benefits among other things," Wollmer said. "The statute spells out what items are ‘chargeable’ – or needed to negotiate, enforce, and adjudicate legal disputes around the contract – and those charges cannot exceed 85% of NJEA dues." Our ruling At the Hoover Institution, Christie claimed that, under state law, individuals must pay a representation fee worth 85 percent of the $731 in annual dues if they opt against joining the NJEA. Christie’s on target about the state statute, which allows public-sector unions to collect a representation fee of up to 85 percent. But the governor’s slightly off on the charges assessed by the teachers union, which collects a maximum dues amount of $791 and a representation fee of 81.8 percent. Still, Christie’s overall point is solid: not joining the teachers union still costs money. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-09317	"The fact is, in the past year we have had more tax cuts than almost any time in our nation's history."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/16/steve-cohen/obama-administration-has-enacted-many-tax-cuts-rai/	With all the April 15 tax protests around the country and a recent CBS poll finding that 77 percent of the public believes the Obama administration has either increased taxes for most Americans, or kept them the same, an Associated Press quote from Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., piqued our interest. "The fact is, in the past year we have had more tax cuts than almost any time in our nation's history," Cohen said in the April 15, 2010, tax story. "It's something that people don't realize because of the false rhetoric that is spread throughout this Congress." The comment is based on tax cuts included in the economic stimulus bill pushed through Congress by Democrats early last year. The one with the widest reach was the Making Work Pay tax credit ($400 for individuals, $800 for couples) that went to most working Americans. The stimulus also included a number of other tax cuts: an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers; an increase in the earned income tax credit; an expansion of the child tax credit; and a tax credit on a portion of the cost of college tuition. In addition, the stimulus made the first $2,400 of unemployment benefits tax-free and allowed people to deduct state and local taxes paid on a new car. And it extended the patch on the alternative minimum tax. In all, according to an analysis of the budget effects of the stimulus by the government's Joint Committee on Taxation, estimated tax relief to individuals and families in the 2010 fiscal year came to $173 billion. That may or may not be the largest one-year tax cut in American history -- it's hard to make direct comparisons -- but tax experts say it's at least in the conversation. And we note that Cohen hedged his claim some by saying there were more tax cuts in the past year than "almost any time" in our nation's history. However, critics contest Cohen's claim on several grounds. The biggest objection is that while there are tax cuts in the stimulus package, Democrats also recently passed a health care reform bill that includes a number of significant tax increases. Among them are a tax penalty for those who refuse to purchase insurance and a tax on so-called "Cadillac" health care plans. In all, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the cost of the new taxes in the health bill at upwards of $500 billion over the next 10 years. The health care bill is "part of the story of the last year," said Ryan Ellis, tax policy director for Americans for Tax Reform. "You can't ignore it." In addition, President Barack Obama and many Democratic leaders have been saying for some time that they intend to allow the Bush tax cuts to expire at the end of the year for people making over $250,000. Most of the new taxes in the health care bill won't kick in for several years, and Congress has yet to take up the issue of whether to allow the Bush tax cuts to expire. But "just because you haven’t quite gotten them yet doesn't mean it's not relevant to the story," Ellis said. "I'm not sure how he (Cohen) can say that with a straight face." Ellis and a number of other conservatives also take issue with calling the entirety of refundable tax credits "tax cuts." For many with low incomes -- and who end up not owing any income taxes at all -- tax credits come in the form of a check from the government. In government budgets, those are scored as spending. And the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that nearly a third of the tax credits in the stimulus fall under that category over the next 10 years. Ellis said that portion of tax credits amounts to a "welfare subsidy." But for most people, tax credits simply reduce their tax obligation. "They are tax cuts," said William Ahern with the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group. "They just aren't the kind of tax cuts the Tax Foundation supports." Tax credits for targeted purposes like buying a new car or home are too susceptible to special interest lobbying, Ahern said. The Tax Foundation supports income tax rate cuts. And we didn't see any of those this year. Even Church Marr, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center of Budget Policy and Priorities, thinks Cohen may be overstating things when he says tax cuts this year rival any in history. The biggest ticket tax cut in the stimulus, the patch of the alternative minimum tax (accounting for $83 billion of the $173 billion worth of the stimulus tax cuts this year), is really just a continuation of previous policy. "I think you need to back that out," Marr said. Still, Marr said, the Making Work Pay tax credit was "sizable and significant." According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, it reduced taxpayers' burden by a total of $66 billion this year. "Taxes went down for most people," Marr said. "And a lot of people don't really know that." Bob Williams of the Tax Policy Center agrees. "Most Americans will see their taxes going down this year," Williams said. But he warns that tax increases are on their way. The country is running huge, unsustainable deficits, he said. The spending was intended to help pull the country out of an economic recession, he said, but there will be consequences. "Anyone who thinks we won't have to increase taxes is dreaming," Williams said. On that point, there seems to be consensus from tax experts on all sides of of the political spectrum. But back to Cohen's statement: "The fact is, in the past year we have had more tax cuts than almost any time in our nation's history." Cohen has added enough qualifiers to his statement to make it defensible. He limits the window to this past year, and the Making Work Pay tax credit did translate to a significant tax cut for most working people this year. But if you take the AMT patch out of Cohen's equation -- and we think it's wrong to lump that in with the new tax cuts in the stimulus because it simply continued previous policy -- the case for having more tax cuts than any other year in U.S. history becomes a bit shakier. Still, Cohen never said it was the biggest, only one of the biggest. We also think it's likely that many would interpret Cohen's statement to mean that he was talking about all of the tax cuts and hikes enacted by Congress this year. And if that's the case, we think critics make a strong case when they note that health care tax increases, although most don't kick in for several years, were also enacted this year. We think that all shakes out to a Half True.	None	Steve Cohen	None	None	None	2010-04-16T15:48:35	2010-04-15	['None']

During that speech, Biden said, "In the United States alone we lose more than 3,000 people a day to cancer." A few days later, Biden’s office posted the text of that speech on Medium. When we looked into this statistic, we found a discrepancy. In the American Cancer Society’s "Cancer Facts & Figures 2016" report, the group wrote that "about 595,690 Americans are expected to die of cancer in 2016, which translates to about 1,630 people per day." That’s roughly half of what Biden said. When we contacted Biden’s office, spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak said the 3,000 figure refers to the daily number of cancer deaths in the Americas as a whole — not just in the United States — in 2012, the most recent year for which the World Health Organization has full data. We were able to verify that statistic here; officially, the number is 1.3 million annually, or just over 3,000 per day. Biden’s office has changed the text in the Medium article to "more than 1,600" during the course of our reporting. They also inserted the following correction: "*The initial number provided for daily cancer deaths in the United States was 3,000 — which is roughly the number of daily cancer deaths across the broader Americas." Our ruling Biden said in his Vatican speech that "in the United States alone we lose more than 3,000 people a day to cancer." Actually, that’s the number of deaths for the Americas as a whole, not for just the United States. After we contacted Biden’s office, they changed the number listed in the Medium article to the correct number, "more than 1,600." While we laud speedy corrections, it is PolitiFact’s policy to rate statements on the Truth-O-Meter in their initial version, which, in this case, could not be corrected in its original setting, a high-profile international speech.

pomt-04164	"If lawmakers fail to avert the fiscal cliff, 18 percent of the federal money that is sent to the states will be eliminated."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/20/campaign-fix-debt/campaign-fix-debt-says-failure-fiscal-talks-could-/	The Campaign to Fix the Debt, a corporate-backed bipartisan group pressing for federal debt reduction, sounded alarms as President Barack Obama and Republican House Speaker John Boehner negotiated over taxes and spending. "Looming Fiscal Cliff Threatens to Push Wisconsin into Recession," the group declared in a Dec. 17, 2012, news release from its Wisconsin chapter. Similar releases by the group attracted media attention in Colorado, Michigan and Louisiana. "The country is barreling in a dangerous direction and it will take a shared compromise to get it on track," the Wisconsin version of the release said, attributing the quote to former Wisconsin Gov. Tony Earl, co-chair of the Fix the Debt-Wisconsin steering committee. The group laid out this claim to bolster its case: "If lawmakers fail to avert the fiscal cliff, 18 percent of the federal money that is sent to the states will be eliminated. Those cuts will reduce funding for important local programs including education, housing, and low-income initiatives..." Eighteen percent -- that’s nearly 20 cents on a dollar. Would the automatic, across-the-board budget cuts mandated to start in early January 2013 under the Budget Control Act of 2011 take that big a bite out of federal grants to states? In a word: No. Here’s the background. Fix the Debt is supported by CEOs of many major U.S. companies, and has a budget of more than $35 million raised primarily from the business world, according to stories in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Los Angeles Times. The group stresses that many ordinary citizens have joined the effort, which was co-founded nationally by former Republican U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Erskine Bowles, the former Clinton administration official. The pair co-chaired the Obama-created National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. Fix the Debt has attracted a bipartisan roster of supporters from the ranks of elected officials and former officials. The group referred in its news release to the Pew Center on the States, which issued a report on Nov. 15, 2012, "The Impact of the Fiscal Cliff on the States." That report relied on figures from the Federal Funds Information for States. The report did use an 18 percent number in regards to federal grants to states for programs such as Title 1 education grants, special education, Head Start, nutrition for low-income women and children, and public housing. But it was describing the pool of federal funds subject to some level of sequestration cuts. Pew officials said they did not mean that the entire pool comprised of that 18 percent would be eliminated entirely, as Fix the Debt said. In fact, Pew estimated that 7 percent of that pot of money would actually be eliminated, or perhaps slightly higher. Not chump change, but a far cry from all of it. Fix the Debt officials said they made an editing error in preparing the release, and became aware of it when we called. It will be fixed in future releases, they said. A few final notes. The largest federal grants, including Medicaid and major income support programs, are exempt from the automatic cuts, said Anne Stauffer and Kasia Murray of the Pew Center. And Wisconsin is somewhat less vulnerable than other states on the impact of potential non-defense cuts, the Pew report found. Our rating Fix the Debt issued a news release claiming "if lawmakers fail to avert the fiscal cliff, 18 percent of the federal money that is sent to the states will be eliminated." That’s way off. A pool of funds that size would be cut, but perhaps by 7 percent, not wiped out entirely. We rate the group’s claim False.

pomt-03405	"President Obama has the most border patrols and border security deployed at the border of any previous president."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/jul/01/debbie-wasserman-schultz/more-border-security-and-patrols-under-obama-previ/	A few days before the U.S. Senate took a vote in favor of an amendment to expand border patrol and other border security measures, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz defended President Barack Obama’s record on border patrol and security. MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts asked Wasserman Schultz to respond to critics, including House Republicans, who say the bill as amnesty or portray immigrants as "takers." Wasserman Schultz, who also serves as chair of the Democratic National Committee, portrayed Obama as tough on enforcement. "President Obama has the most border patrols and border security deployed at the border of any previous president," said Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. in a June 20 interview on MSNBC. Obama "has cracked down employers -- on employers who are attracting undocumented immigrants and hiring them more than any previous president." PolitiFact has previously examined some similar claims about border patrol during Obama’s presidency. But here we wanted to fact-check Wasserman Schultz’s specific claims that Obama holds a record for border patrol and security. Border patrol The Border Patrol buildup began under President Bill Clinton with Operation Gatekeeper and Safeguards, but expanded dramatically under President George W. Bush, said Katherine Benton-Cohen, a Georgetown history professor. The number of border patrol agents increased dramatically between fiscal years 1993 and Sept. 30, 2012. (So did spending.) Nationwide, the peak year was in 2011 with 21,444 agents -- the number dropped slightly to 21,394 in fiscal year 2012. Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research who has studied immigration issues, previously told PolitiFact that the total number of agents is a record going back to at least 1924. The biggest bump in Border Patrol staffing came under Obama’s predecessor, President George W. Bush. Between 2001 and 2009, the number of agents posted nationally rose from about 9,800 to a little more than 20,000. Border fence In addition to border patrol, Wasserman Schultz also gave credit to Obama for the most "border security deployed" -- a more general term that we took to include fences or other technological or infrastructure improvements. The first fence along the southwestern border was built in 1990 but was comparatively small: Prior to 2005 there were 78 miles of pedestrian fencing and 57 miles of vehicle barriers, according to a paper by the Migration Policy Institute. The Secure Fence Act of 2006, passed by a Republican-led Congress and was signed by Bush. It authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the border with Mexico and called for adding unmanned aerial vehicles, satellites, radar and cameras. The fenced segments totaled roughly 650-700 miles, while the entire U.S.-Mexican border is about 2,000 miles long. Obama, an Illinois senator at the time, voted for the law. The act specified "at least two layers of reinforced fencing," but in 2007 the law was altered to give the Border Patrol leeway to decide the type of fencing. By the time Obama became president in January 2009, much of the fence was completed -- but not of the type originally planned. In February 2011, a GAO report about the border presented a mixed picture of progress. The report states that between fiscal years 2005 and 2010, the number of border miles that had fences increased from about 120 to 649. A preliminary analysis of border miles under control showed 15 percent were "controlled" while the rest were "managed" and left vulnerabilities to illegal activity. For this fact-check, Wasserman Schultz’s spokesman sent us a 2011 White House immigration report that stated "DHS has also completed 649 miles of fencing out of nearly 652 miles planned, including 299 miles of vehicle barriers and 350 miles of pedestrian fence, with the remaining 3 miles scheduled to be completed." Spokesman Jonathan Beeton also pointed to the fact that Obama signed a bill in 2010 in response to increased violence in Mexico that included $600 million in supplemental funds for enhanced border protection. Separately, an additional 1,200 National Guard troops were authorized for the the border. Fencing isn’t the only way the federal government has attempted to manage the border. The Secure Border Initiative launched in 2005 with the intention to combine fencing with technological tools such as cameras, sensors and radar, according to a paper from the Migration Policy Institute. Boeing won a contract and received about $860 million from the federal government. But it quickly ran into technical difficulties, cost overruns and delays, which have been criticized in numerous Government Accountability Office reports. Under the Obama administration, the program was canceled in January 2011, and the Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano ordered that the government should focus on using proven technologies, such as video and mobile surveillance and thermal imaging. Under Obama, border apprehensions have fallen from their high points. Border apprehensions peaked at almost 1.7 million in 2000 under President Clinton, and apprehensions in 2011 were at the lowest level since 1970. The post-2008 declines are due to the recession and loss of jobs which had attracted unauthorized immigrants. Net illegal immigration from Mexico has fallen to zero or even fewer coming than leaving. Expert analysis We sent Wasserman Schultz’s claim to immigration experts. No one disputed the border patrol numbers, but they also pointed to other factors when examining changes in border security that provide a more complex picture. "Yes, the number of Border Patrol agents is at an all-time high," said Rey Koslowski, an expert on the border and an associate professor of political science and public policy at the University at Albany. "Whether that equates to ‘border security’ is another question. As to who should get more credit for border security, the fence was a bipartisan project." Christopher Wilson, an associate with the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute and an expert on border management, noted that border patrol agents don’t precisely equal border security. "In the end, though, you can’t deploy border security, it must be something that is achieved. This gets into one of the major problems with the whole border security debate—the lack of an accepted definition of the term." Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said, "President Obama has the most border patrols and border security deployed at the border of any previous president." She is correct that the highest number of border patrol agents has been under Obama: there were 21,444 in 2011. Wasserman Schultz was careful here and said "most" and didn’t talk about the growth rate. But it’s worth noting that the big growth was during Bush’s tenure: between 2001 and 2009, the number of agents posted nationally rose from about 9,800 to a little more than 20,000. Other border security measures are not as simple to quantify. The key piece of infrastructure -- the fence -- was launched under Bush. Work on the fence and other border security improvements continued under Obama. We rate this claim Mostly True.

A headline on an Oct. 16, 2017, post on the suspiciously named lmaoitsnews.website read, "Hillary caught on tape laughing about Irma ‘wiping out all of those Florida hillbillies’." Facebook users reported the story as being potentially made up, as part of the social media company’s efforts to combat fake news. The post, which we found on several other websites, said that Clinton was shooting an undated interview for The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC when she slammed the Sunshine State and its residents. "To be honest, Rachel, it would probably be good for the country if Irma were to just wipe every Florida hillbilly off the map," the post quoted Clinton. "I mean … they live in trailers by the water, right?" The lmaoitsnews.website story said Maddow was shocked by Clinton’s statement, canceling the interview and agreeing to hide the recording. The post claimed a sound engineer smuggled the recording out to release to the public should he need to "save the country or himself." Clinton didn’t make these remarks, however, because this story is sourced to a post that originally ran Sept. 10 (when Irma swept across Florida) on the website AsAmericanAsApplePie.org. AsAmericanAsApplePie.org appears to be part of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who publishes fabricated stories in an attempt to trick conservative readers.

That means there's 47 states fighting over a very small amount of the type of investment that creates really high quality, long term, durable jobs." Vance said that if more investment can be made in some of these other states it would create more high-quality job growth. Vance is a partner in the Revolution investment firm, which launched a bus tour to shine a spotlight on startups and invest in companies not located in Silicon Valley. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell courted Vance to run against U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, but Vance declined. We wondered about Vance’s statement about how venture capital is divvied up nationwide. We found those three states are the leading homes for venture capital, but Vance's point requires a bit more explanation. Venture capital in the states A spokeswoman for Revolution said that Vance was referring to data by the National Venture Capital Association, a trade association comprised of venture capital firms and corporate venture groups. The association’s annual yearbook compiles data on companies, closed deals and invested capital. In 2016, California had 55 percent of venture capital money, followed by New York at 10.6 percent and Massachusetts at 8.9 percent. In total, the three states accounted for about 75 percent of the capital invested. (Texas came in at fourth place, followed by Florida.) The share of venture capital claimed by these three states was corroborated by another source of data, the PricewaterhouseCoopers/CB Insights MoneyTree Report. Since 2012, the collective share of the top three states has increased from 68.5 percent to a peak of 76.8 percent. in 2015. The outlook is more promising for other states in terms of the number of deals. The same three states claimed about 52 percent of closed deals in 2016, according to the association’s yearbook. That’s still a majority of deals, but it’s "a positive sign for burgeoning entrepreneurial ecosystems in the rest of the country," the yearbook said. The yearbook’s list of the top 10 venture capital deals in terms of the amount of money included Magic Leap, a reality technology company in South Florida, and Domo, a Utah-based company that provides data to businesses. Some states that were not on the venture capital radar a decade or so ago have received more dollars in recent years, experts told us. Some of these states look more impressive, for example, when broken down by invested capital per capita, such as Utah. It’s also possible that as more states invest in innovation ecosystems, they will increase how much venture capital they attract. But California, New York and Massachusetts will continue to build on their success. "Success begets success, leading to more startups in these places, more capital and more opportunities for investment," said Elisabeth B. Reynolds, executive director of the MIT Industrial Performance Center. The hard part for states playing catch-up is attracting money. But there are now hubs of start-ups in Florida, including Gainesville, Orlando and Miami, said University of Florida business professor James Parrino. Our ruling Vance said that "50 percent of venture capital goes to California. Most of the rest of it goes to New York and Massachusetts." Vance is largely correct but doesn't describe the situation with precision. Data from a trade association showed that California received 55 percent of venture capital money followed by New York at 10.6 percent and Massachusetts at 8.9 percent. If we looked at the number of deals closed that year, the three states’ share added up to 52 percent. That left almost half of the deals for the rest of the country.

pomt-07499	"For every one ESD superintendent position, we can pay for three speech pathologists, or three special needs instructors, or three classroom teachers."	false	/oregon/statements/2011/apr/11/mark-hass/sen-hass-says-taxpayers-could-be-getting-three-tea/	Sen. Mark Hass has his sights set on Oregon’s 20 education service districts. For the uninitiated, these districts allow smaller school districts to buy services collectively. As our colleague Kim Melton put it in a recent piece: they use "the buying power of several local districts to get better deals on high-cost services." Hass, however, likes to call them "obscure" and "wasteful" and "administratively bloated." Ouch, ouch and ouch. Hass is championing a bill that would give local school districts the option of taking their share of money out of the regional program. "Most notably," Melton reported, "this bill would reduce the amount of money education service districts get by half over two years, potentially sending an additional $100 million directly to local schools." To help make his case that this legislation is sound, Hass has taken to using a particular (and compelling) statistic: "For every one ESD superintendent position, we can pay for three speech pathologists, or three special needs instructors, or three classroom teachers." That comes straight from a press release sent out by Senate Democrats on March 30, 2011, after the legislation was passed out of the Senate’s finance committee. That’s not the only time he’s said it, though. Here’s what he told Melton: "For every one ESD superintendent position, we can pay for three speech pathologists, three classroom teachers." Repetition generally gets our attention. We went to the senator’s office to see if they had any information to back the claim up. Andy Smith, one of Hass’s legislative aides, sent us a few pieces of information. To start, he gave us the annual salary and annual fringe benefits for the current superintendent of the Northwest Regional Educational Service District -- the district that serves 20 school districts, including Hass’s constituents. Taking into account perks like health insurance, a tax sheltered annuity and a mileage allowance, the superintendent makes roughly $220,000. Then Smith gave us some figures about teachers working in the individual David Douglas School District. According to the district, teachers can make somewhere between $40,000 and $75,000. The monthly fringe benefit for a teacher in that district is $1,425 (for family coverage), which shifts the range to somewhere between $57,000 and $92,000. Using those totals, it does appear that you could cash in the superintendent for just under four teachers at the very low end of the pay scale or 2.5 teachers at the high end. But that doesn’t exactly tell the whole story here. For one, the superintendent of the Northwest Regional cooperative is the highest paid superintendent in the state. Hass isn’t talking about just this district -- he says, very clearly, "every one ESD." Words matter. We needed something a bit more middle-of-the-road. With that in mind, we started collecting data, trying to get an idea of what the average teacher in Oregon makes and what the average ESD superintendent makes. Sounded simple. It was anything but. We started with the Oregon Department of Education. Crystal Greene, the public affairs manager there, pointed us to a chart in the 2009-2010 Statewide Report Card. According to the document, for the 2009-2010 school year, on average, teachers made $55,000 and superintendents made $113,000. The department, however, doesn’t keep track of fringe benefits and they didn’t do an analysis of ESD superintendents specifically. So, we asked Greene for a list of the base salaries of all ESD superintendents. There are currently 20 superintendents for 20 ESDs. That said, not all of those superintendents are full time; there are just 16 full-time equivalents. We calculated the average base salary for one full-time ESD superintendent to be about $113,000. The next step was to find what their average annual fringe benefits (health care, mileage and tax sheltered annuities) came out to. If you look at the example Hass used, it’s about $54,000 -- or 33 percent of the annual salary. We spot-checked six of the highest-paid ESDs. The range was pretty wide -- one made about $18,000 extra (he doesn’t have a travel allowance, but he can use a car if necessary) while another made $46,000. If you take the average of the three highest fringe allowances, you get roughly $46,000. Add that to the annual salary figure and you have a price tag of something like $160,000 for your "average" ESD superintendent. Now for a teacher. This one is even trickier. Some teachers get pension contributions; some don’t. Depending on the district, benefits might be higher for some than others. Then there are all sorts of differences depending on education level and tenure. The list goes on. We asked Lisa Freiley with the Oregon School Boards Association to walk us through a quick calculation. (The OSBA, it should be noted, does not support the bill. Freiley, however, helped us without our saying why we were asking.) When we were done, we had an estimated price tag of about $76,000 for an average Oregon teacher. That average ignored any possible PERS contribution by the district on the teacher’s behalf. The math, however, was a bit more back-of-the-envelope than we like, so we called up the Oregon Education Association. Spokeswoman Becca Uherbelau told us that they generally use $93,000 as their "average" estimate. That includes salary, pension contributions and health insurance. Again, she didn’t know why we were asking and had no reason to inflate the figure. The association doesn’t keep a similar figure for speech pathologists or special education teachers. That said, generally speaking, special education teachers are not paid any differently from other teachers. Speech pathologists might come out a little better compensated than the average teacher given they’re likely coming to the jobs with more advanced degrees per position. Now, if you use Uherbelau’s number, you can’t even buy two teachers for the price of one ESD superintendent. If you use our lower estimate of $74,000, you could buy two teachers and a little change -- but not the three Hass claims. Throughout this process, we kept in touch with the senator’s office. It probably goes without saying, but Hass and his staff don’t much like our math. They argued that the senator was talking only about his district and the ESD that serves his district. But that’s clearly not what he said. Then they pointed out another pitfall: Superintendents come with an entourage. They mentioned assistant superintendents, assistants to the assistant superintendents and other office staff, some of whom make six-figure annual salaries themselves. "It is not just the salary," Hass told us over the phone. "It is the infrastructure that comes with the office. … It's all of the perks that come with the office." It’s probably true that if you figured all of that into the equation, it would change things considerably. But then, that’s not what Hass said. What’s more, parsing can be done for both sides. Milt Dennison, the superintendent of the Clackamas Education Service District, pointed out that he gets paid for 240 contracted days of work. The average speech pathologist is contracted for 190 days. That’s a pattern that seems to hold true, to one degree or another, for the other ESDs as well. In any case, it’s important for us to stick to the original claim that "for every one ESD superintendent position, we can pay for three speech pathologists, or three special needs instructors, or three classroom teachers." It may be true that education service districts are "obscure" and "wasteful" and "administratively bloated." But we’re not here to judge that. We’re here to judge Hass’s claim and we find it False.

pomt-06441	"Romneycare was model for Obamacare."	true	/texas/statements/2011/oct/21/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-romneycare-was-model-obamacare/	While Texas Gov. Rick Perry was debating rivals for the Republican presidential nomination on Oct. 11, his campaign was righting "wrongs" uttered by the other candidates through a Twitter account called "PerryTruthTeam." During the debate, PerryTruthTeam sent out a familiar message: "Romneycare was model for Obamacare." The Perry campaign has hit that idea hard. On Oct. 10, Perry posted an online video linking the health care plan that Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, signed in 2006 for his state (dubbed Romneycare by critics) and the one that President Barack Obama signed in 2010 for the country (dubbed Obamacare by critics). We checked whether the Perry campaign’s five-word tweet was on the mark. Perry’s tweet implies that the White House used the Massachusetts law to build its own national law. We’ll begin our examination by noting that even if you’re just looking at the two laws from the outside, without knowing any behind-the-scenes information, they seem pretty similar. Generally, both laws leave in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance for some workers and their families, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. Also, both laws require people to buy insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the "individual mandate." Both laws also seek to reduce the number of people without health insurance by expanding Medicaid and offering tax breaks to help moderate-income people buy insurance. Finally, companies that don't offer insurance have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business. Some other shared elements: • Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and national plans provide for voluntary "exchanges" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels. • Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, the subsidies flow to adults living at 150 percent to 300 percent of the federal poverty level, depending on their household size. Under the national plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the poverty level. Still, there remain differences between the federal law and the Massachusetts law. Two of the biggest: • Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The federal law makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to private insurance plans offered through Medicare, known as Medicare Advantage plans. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue. • Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and federal law are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the federal law, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drug makers, medical device manufacturers, health insurers and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost health care plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do these things. So, the laws, while not identical, share many core elements. Next, we wondered if the federal law was indeed based on the Massachusetts law. Again, it’s difficult to know what people in Congress and in the White House looked at as they drafted the final health care law. But according to independent reports, they consulted people who worked on the Massachusetts law. On its website, the Perry campaign pointed to an NBC News news story published online Oct. 11, 2011, under the headline "White House used Mitt Romney health-care law as blueprint for federal law." The report refers to White House visitor logs showing that three health care advisers and experts "who helped shape the health care reform law signed by Romney in 2006" had a dozen meetings with senior White House officials in 2009, including one with the president. One of the experts, Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told NBC News that "the White House wanted to lean a lot on what we’d done in Massachusetts." "They really wanted to know how we can take that same approach we used in Massachusetts and turn that into a national model," Gruber said. Gruber received a $380,000 contract from the Obama administration in 2009 to help Congress draft the federal health care law based on the Massachusetts plan, according to the story. He earlier had been hired by the Romney administration to do computer modeling of the costs of various approaches to expanding health-care coverage, the story said. Gruber’s biography on the MIT website says he "was a key architect of Massachusetts’ ambitious health reform effort and in 2006 became an inaugural member of the Health Connector Board, the main implementing body for that effort." Romney, asked at an Oct. 11 news conference about the NBC report that three of his "aides" had advised Obama on health care, disputed that characterization of the experts, saying they were "consultants," not "aides." "I’m sure the president got lots of ideas (on health care reform)," Romney said, "but the one person he should have talked to, that he never talked to, was me." Romney said he would have told Obama that "the plan he was crafting wouldn’t work" because the nation couldn’t afford more federal spending. And he said that if he were elected president, he would push for the repeal of the federal health care law. Romney’s campaign has also played down Gruber’s influence, telling Politico for an Oct. 11 news story that he was not an adviser to Romney and that Romney’s administration hired him only to run econometric models. However, the Politico story also says that "it is well known that Obama’s health care plan was in part modeled after Romney’s 2006 reforms." We also reviewed an article in the June 6, 2011, New Yorker magazine on the development of the Massachusetts and federal health care laws. Like the NBC News piece, the New Yorker article notes that people who worked on the Massachusetts law were also consulted by the White House. One was Jon Kingsdale, a former insurance executive whom Romney had hired to implement the Massachusetts law, according to the article. "The policy in Massachusetts was real," Kingsdale told the New Yorker. "We were very, very influential. I testified a lot. The congressional staffers would constantly ask, ‘Well, how do you handle this? How do you handle that?’ We were the go-to people." The article also describes a meeting in 2008, before Obama had decided to support an individual federal mandate, that was attended by people who would later become "the key brokers" of the final deal on the federal health care law in 2010. Among those organizing the meeting was John McDonough — a Massachusetts advocate for universal health care during Romney’s governorship who had since been hired by U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass. During the development of the Massachusetts law, McDonough "was named by Romney aides as a ‘stakeholder’ to represent consumer interests," according to the NBC News article. At the October 2008 meeting, McDonough laid out three health care policy options that the next president could adopt, one of which he called "Massachusetts Avenue" and was based on Romney’s plan, the New Yorker article says. Fifteen of the 20 people at the meeting — representatives from hospital associations, the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, the labor movement and groups advocating universal health care — backed the "Massachusetts" option, the article says. The following year, Obama health care adviser Nancy-Ann DeParle sent a memo to the president recommending that he support a mandate like the one in Massachusetts, according to the New Yorker article. A few weeks later, Obama told congressional leaders he would back a requirement that every American buy health insurance. Finally, it’s important to note that some of the key ideas in the federal law had been circulating before the Massachusetts law was written. For example, scholars credit Alain C. Enthoven — an emeritus professor at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business who worked in the Defense Department during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations — with popularizing the idea of health insurance exchanges as many as three decades ago. And at least one previous Republican proposal on health care has included an individual mandate, a plan put forward by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., during the Clinton administration’s unsuccessful push for universal coverage in the early 1990s. So, what of Perry’s tweet? Although the federal law isn’t an exact replica of the one in Massachusetts, the plan signed by Romney certainly served as a model. We rate the statement as True.

pomt-09389	"Joe, I keep hearing you every morning talking about the biggest tax increase in history, but you don't mention it's also the biggest tax cut in history.''	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/25/richard-durbin/durbins-tax-reduction-claim-doesnt-cut-it/	Here, we examine a claim that nearly launched Rep. Mike Pence off the back of a treadmill. It came during a back-and-forth on the Morning Joe program on MSNBC on March 24, 2010, between host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, and Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., over the tax effects of the health care reform bill. Let's listen in: "If this fall's election is going to be a referendum on this health care bill," Scarborough said, "What should Democrats do when their opponents say, correctly, this is the largest tax increase in U.S. history? And it was passed at a time when we've got 17 percent real unemployment. And also, it's a further expansion of the federal government at a time when that worries a lot of Americans." "Joe, I keep hearing you every morning talking about the biggest tax increase in history, but you don't mention it's also the biggest tax cut in history," Durbin responded "We have almost $500 billion in tax cuts. And the tax cuts go to small businesses to help pay for health insurance premiums. They're going to go to individuals who can't afford their health insurance premiums. It's really going to make certain everybody has a chance for affordable health insurance." Pence, chairman of the House Republican Conference, later told Scarborough he was watching the exchange live while working out on a treadmill and that when Durbin said the health care bill is also the biggest tax cut in history, "I almost tripped and flew off the back of the thing." We took a two-pronged approach to this exchange, and in a separate item, we examined Scarborough's claim that the bill is "the largest tax increase in U.S. history." In this one, we'll tackle Durbin's claim that the bill is "also the biggest tax cut in history." Is it really treadmill-launching wrong? During the interview, an incredulous Scarborough asked Durbin his source for that claim. "Well, the source is the bill," Durbin said. "And I've read it." The bill may explain provisions, but Durbin gets his numbers that the bill includes $500 billion in tax cuts from a report by the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bulk of that, $464 billion over 10 years, comes from tax credits to subsidize the cost insurance for lower-income people not insured through their employer. In addition, the March 20, 2010, report from the CBO estimates that small companies will get $40 billion worth of tax relief over the next 10 years to help offset the cost of providing health insurance for their employees. Specifically, from 2010 through 2013, qualifying small companies could get a tax credit of up to 35 percent of the company's contribution to employee health coverage. Beginning in 2014, when the insurance exchanges start up, small businesses could qualify for up to 50 percent of the cost. Those small business tax credits are no-doubt-about-it tax cuts. But many Republicans and tax experts contend the subsidies provided to lower-income Americans to help pay for health insurance, even though they come through tax credits, hardly qualify as tax cuts. Here's why: Americans who make a decent living but qualify for some government help on health insurance premiums may have such a large tax burden that the tax credits really are a reduction in taxes, said William Ahern with the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group. But for many -- if not most -- of those getting the tax credits, the subsidies are more than the person would otherwise owe in income taxes. For those people, he said, the tax credits are "just a check from the government," Ahern said. "There has been a running debate over whether such checks should be called tax cuts," Ahern said. Ahern is of the school that thinks when the government is writing checks, that shouldn't be called a tax cut. A news release from the Republicans in Congress also correctly notes that the provision is a direct payment to insurance companies, not to the taxpayer. "It would not reduce any individual's tax liability," the release states, "and is therefore not a tax cut." "You can quibble over what to call it," said Linda Blumberg, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute, but when you have subsidies tied to tax credits, as they are, they need to be reconciled with one's taxable income, and so a credible case can be made that they are tax cuts. We're not going to weigh into this philosophical debate on taxes, because there are other more clear-cut reasons why Durbin's claim is misleading. For one, it fails to mention that even if you regard the insurance subsidies for people in the exchange as tax cuts, there are also significant tax increases. Here are the biggies, along with what the government's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates they will bring in over the next 10 years: • Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called "Cadillac plans," over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. • Starting in 2011, new annual fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers. That's expected to raise $27 billion over 10 years. • Starting in 2014, a 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices. The 10-year total: $20 billion. Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers. Total estimated 10-year revenue: $60.1 billion. • Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's expected to bring in $15.2 billion over the next 10 years. Starting in 2011, a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. That's expected to bring in $2.7 billion over the next 10 years. In all, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates various revenue-generating provisions in the health bill will bring $437 billion over the next 10 years. "There are big chunks of money coming in and big chunks of money going out," Blumberg said. "We need to get away from the extremes in this conversation. There are big revenues being raised and big spending." So let's talk net. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the changes in direct spending and revenue effects of the health care reform bill (as well as the reconciliation bill, which has yet to pass) and concluded the total net effect is that the bill would bring in an additional $525 billion in total revenues over the next 10 years. In recent weeks, President Barack Obama has repeatedly used a variation of Durbin's claim. For example, in remarks on health care reform in Iowa on March 25, 2010, Obama said, "And when this exchange is up and running, millions of people will get tax breaks to help them afford coverage – credits that add up to the largest middle class tax cut for health care in history." There are a couple qualifiers in there that Durbin failed to mention. For one, Obama referred to middle class tax cut. That conveniently ignores the significant tax increases that predominantly will hit higher income people, the Medicare payroll tax and those with "Cadillac health plans." Obama also limits his claim to tax cuts for health care. It in no way is the largest tax cut of any kind. The Bush tax cuts alone dwarf these cuts. "It's wrong in both directions," Ahern said of claims that the health care bill is either the largest tax cut or tax increase in history. "It's obviously not the largest tax cut." To sum up, when Durbin said the bill is "also the biggest tax cut in history," it's based first on the contentious assumption that tax credits to help lower income people buy insurance on the exchange can be called tax cuts. But more than that, if you look at the net effect, the bill is a tax increase. In general, higher income people will pay more, lower income people will get more. In any case, even if you only looked at that side of the ledger, the side with $500 billion of tax credits over 10 years, that wouldn't be the largest tax cut in history. Durbin would have been closer to the truth had he stuck to the president's script -- largest middle class tax cut for health care -- but we think even that is misleading because it ignores that the bill is an overall tax-raiser. But as Durbin even left those qualifiers out of his statement, that makes our call easy: It's False.	None	Richard Durbin	None	None	None	2010-03-25T19:06:13	2010-03-24	['None']

pomt-15372	"50 percent of murders in Texas have been linked to illegal aliens."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/01/gavin-mcinnes/no-undocumented-immigrants-are-not-tied-50-texas-m/	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is standing by his sweeping and negative comments about Mexican immigrants. But the billionaire’s remarks at his campaign announcement speech have cost him: His show contract with NBC has been canceled, Mexico has withdrawn from the Miss Universe contest Trump cosponsors, and Macy’s announced it will stop selling Trump-branded menswear. Trump blamed the media for taking his remarks out of context. His reference to rapists and drug dealers referred to a failed immigration policy, not all Mexicans he said. But the blowback aside, Trump has his ardent supporters. Count Gavin McInnes among them. The flamboyant and purposefully politically incorrect talker appeared on Fox News to defend Trump. In a conversation on The Greg Gutfeld Show, McInnes called Trump an "awesome guy" who "ought to be revered." McInnes said the media was wrong to brush off Trump’s assertions. "He just said a bunch of hate facts," McInnes said. "The crime rate with illegals is through the roof." When Gutfeld pressed McInnes to give some facts of his own, McInnes delivered one. "50 percent of murders in Texas have been linked to illegal aliens," he said. "Is that a fact?" Gutfeld asked. "I don’t know." We can resolve that uncertainty. No, it isn’t a fact. Hard data The Texas Department of Public Safety has pretty good data on any non-U.S. citizen who is arrested for a crime in Texas. That group includes both people living in the United States legally, and people living here illegally. Unfortunately, Texas doesn’t break down the number of murder charges and convictions by group (legal non-U.S. citizen vs. illegal non-U.S. citizen). But Texas officials say that from June 2011 through May 2015, 67 percent of non-U.S. citizens found guilty of any crime "were identified by DHS status as being in the U.S. illegally at the time of their last arrest." According to Texas’ data, authorities charged 872 non-U.S. citizens for murder between June 2011 and May 2015, of which 337 were convicted. If the 67 percent figure were to hold, that would mean unauthorized immigrants would have been charged with 584 murders; 226 of which would have ended in a conviction. How does that compare to the total number of homicides in Texas? The official homicide figure for 2014 has yet to be released, but we do have the numbers for 2011 through 2013. (These totals are for calendar years, while the state’s tally of arrests of non-U.S. citizens starts midway through 2011.) This is where McInnes’ claim falls apart. There were 3,384 homicides in Texas for the three years between 2011 and 2013, compared to an estimated 584 murder charges involving undocumented immigrants over a period stretching nearly four years. That’s nowhere near half, despite counting an additional year of murder charges involving undocumented immigrants. And the gap between his claim and the data gets bigger if you look at the actual convictions of undocumented immigrants. McInnes’ claim remains wrong even if you count every non-U.S. citizen murder charge, all 872 cases. (July 1, 2015, update: A couple of hours after we published this fact-check we noticed that the Texas Department of Public Safety had updated its numbers to include June 2015. The changes were tiny. Homicide arrests went from 872 to 879, and the convictions went from 337 to 344. Again, this included arrests and convictions of legal and illegal immigrants. The percentage of undocumented immigrants changed from 67 percent to 66 percent. The changes do not affect our analysis.) Fuzzy data We contacted McInnes on Twitter and he directed us to an excerpt from Ann Coulter’s latest book Adios America. (He also noted that "Putting ‘fact’ in your URL doesn't make you right, dingbat," but as they say, sticks and stones, and so forth.) Coulter, in her book, does talk about undocumented immigrants and murders in Texas, but she doesn’t actually say that they committed 50 percent of the homicides there. Actually, she was lambasting a 2014 fact-check by our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas examining a claim that in a seven-year period, illegal aliens were responsible for 3,000 murders. Fact-checkers rated the claim Pants on Fire because the figure was based on arrests, not convictions, and included people who were in the country legally. It included a quote from Northeastern University criminologist Ramiro Martinez, who did some back-of-the-envelope math and estimated that if Perry were right, undocumented immigrants were behind 46 percent of the murders. Martinez said that made no sense. "It just boggles the imagination that level of ‘aliens’ were involved to that extent over time and nobody noticed," Martinez said. For Coulter, this proved her point that the government and the media intentionally fail to collect and report data on crimes by illegal immigrants. "Strictly speaking, boggling the mind of a professor is not data," Coulter wrote. "Martinez asked how so many illegal immigrants could be committing murder and ‘nobody noticed.’ It might be easier to ‘notice’ if we weren’t prohibited from noticing." Our ruling McInnes said that 50 percent of murders in Texas have been linked to illegal aliens. The source of this stat ultimately tracks back to a criminologist who used it as a way to debunk a claim, not because he thinks it’s valid. Current data from the Texas Department of Public Safety show that undocumented immigrants are not associated with 50 percent of murder charges or convictions. McInnes’ statement is a mighty exaggeration. We rate this claim False.	None	Gavin McInnes	None	None	None	2015-07-01T16:00:19	2015-06-22	['Texas']
pomt-13800	"Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have left us with $19 trillion in debt."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/19/sean-duffy/gop-rep-sean-duffy-exaggerates-role-barack-obama-h/	Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. gave a stern speech about crime and violence against police on the first night of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He was followed immediately by another Wisconsinite, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, who began his remarks on July 18, 2016 with a big smile and a: "Hello, America!" Duffy, joined by his wife, conservative activist Rachel Campos-Duffy, remained light-hearted throughout their presentation. But they also made partisan jabs, including this one by Duffy: "Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have left us with $19 trillion in debt." We asked three federal budget experts, including Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, about Duffy’s claim. "It’s sort of garden-variety political exaggeration," Bixby said. Here’s why. Debt figures The U.S. Treasury Department’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator shows the total federal debt is nearly $19.4 trillion. That includes nearly $14 trillion in debt held by the public -- by individuals, corporations, Federal Reserve banks, foreign governments, and other entities -- and $5.4 trillion in what are known as intragovernmental holdings. So, Duffy is correct on the overall figure. But many factors bear on how it got there. And, the experts said, it’s really not possible to calculate how much any one of them is responsible for the debt. Bixby; Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget; and Rudolph Penner, a fellow at the Urban Institute and former director of the Congressional Budget Office, told us: 1. About half of the $19 trillion was amassed before Obama took office in January 2009. 2. Obama took office amid a deep recession, which meant government revenues fell and spending on government programs rose. "The debt would have exploded certainly during (Obama’s) first term, no matter who was president," said Bixby. 3. Obama proposed federal budgets, but Congress, including the Republican leadership, ultimately holds the purse strings. Obama bears some of the responsibility for not taking steps to prevent the debt from growing, "but attributing the debt to a president doesn’t make sense," said MacGuineas. Meanwhile, Clinton, as Obama’s secretary of state, made budget requests for her department. But that’s a tiny amount of the overall federal budget and the secretary of state has virtually nothing to do with overall fiscal policy. Our rating Duffy said: "Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have left us with $19 trillion in debt." The total federal debt is at $19 trillion. But most of it was amassed before Obama took office. And many factors -- Congress, the economy and Obama himself, but to almost no extent Clinton -- played a role in the debt increases during Obama’s tenure. For a claim that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/212be74c-0104-4349-a8ef-bade8c9f88f1	None	Sean Duffy	None	None	None	2016-07-19T13:42:48	2016-07-18	['Barack_Obama', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']

pomt-05856	"[A]t his current rate, President Obama will have added more debt to the United State of America by the end of his first term than each of the previous 43 presidents -- combined!"	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/13/GaGOP/obama-setting-debt-record-georgia-gop-says/	Georgia Republican Party leaders are actively trying to make the case that President Barack Obama is not a good steward of the nation’s checkbook. One recent post on the party’s website caused our Truth-O-Meter to light up. "It is clear that America could not afford the first four years of Barack Obama’s presidency, let alone the unimaginable economic nightmare that would surely be his second term," the party wrote. "In fact, at his current rate, President Obama will have added more debt to the United States of America by the end of his first term than each of the previous 43 presidents -- combined!" The party even has an "Obama Debt Watch" digital tote board on its website. Several Republican leaders have made similar claims, which have been fact-checked by our colleagues at our national PolitiFact office. The rulings have varied because the statements have been slightly different in each case. Let’s start with the basics concerning this particular claim. There are two ways to measure the national debt: the amount held by the public debt and the gross federal debt. The public debt includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. The gross federal debt includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money which is owed to beneficiaries in the future. Georgia GOP spokesman Chris Kelleher said the state party was measuring the federal debt held by the public, starting at the time Obama was sworn in as president on Jan. 20, 2009. On that January day, the debt held by the public was $6.3 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury Department data. Three years later, the total was nearly $10.5 trillion. In August, after much debate, Congress approved and Obama signed a debt deal that allowed the federal government to raise its debt ceiling by more than $2 trillion but requires a similar amount in budget cuts over the next decade. The federal government manages its finances on a 12-month fiscal year schedule that begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. We are currently in fiscal year 2012. The White House’s Office of Management and Budget estimates that the debt held by the public will be about $12.8 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2013. The Congressional Budget Office has a slightly more conservative estimate of just under $12 trillion. Using the White House numbers means the debt will have risen by about $6.5 trillion since Obama took office, which is greater than the $6.3 trillion debt estimate when he became commander-in-chief. Using the CBO numbers, the increase since Obama took office will be about $5.7 trillion, which is less than the amount it was on Jan. 20, 2009. So which 2013 estimate should we use? We interviewed two experts on such matters. Jason Peuquet, the research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said he prefers to go with the OMB numbers. Georgia State University professor Katherine Willoughby, an expert in government budgets, said she prefers to use the CBO’s figures. Both, however, disagreed with the Georgia GOP’s process to base its claim. They say it’s more accurate to measure debt as a share of the nation’s gross domestic product. Peuquet said that statistic is preferable because it is a better historic measure of debt and the economy. "Dollars today are [worth] a lot less than they were 200 years ago," he said. "So [the Georgia GOP comparison] is not an apples-to-apples comparison." In fiscal year 2009, the public debt as a share of the nation’s gross domestic product was about 53 percent, according to OMB and CBO figures. By the end of fiscal year 2013, both organizations estimate it will be 75.1 percent. The difference between those four years is not more than America’s first 43 presidents combined. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether it was fair for the party to put this all on Obama when Congress approved the August 2011 debt deal? "In the American democracy, there are split powers," Peuquet said. "Congress has played a big part in tax cuts and spending increases in the past." Said Willoughby: "My take on this would be that the statement is partially true. Certainly, our debt has soared in light of the Great Recession. To be fair to Obama, though, it would be better to consider debt held by the public as a percent of gross domestic product." Willoughby noted that the public debt as a share of the nation’s GDP rose to dangerously similar levels during World War II. It went from 47 percent in 1942 to 106.2 percent by 1945, according to OMB data. Georgia Republican Party spokesman Chris Kelleher said responsibility for the debt increases solely belong to the president. He said congressional Republicans were forced to go along or face a government shutdown. "The fact of the matter is that the request for the increase in the debt ceiling -- which directly allowed our government to continue writing bad checks and adding to our public share of the debt -- came directly from President Obama. The blame lies squarely at his feet; for Barack Obama, the buck stops nowhere," Kelleher told us via email. Our conclusion: There are two factors to consider here. One, has the public debt risen under Obama’s presidency more than all of his predecessors combined? Two, is this all Obama’s fault? The Georgia GOP’s rationale for its claim is based on using the raw totals reported by the OMB. There are other factors to consider, however, when examining the accuracy of this statement, such as measuring the debt increase by the nation’s gross domestic product. There, the GOP claim is in trouble. As for whether Obama bears all of the blame here, Congress, which has a Republican-controlled House of Representatives, passed the 2011 debt deal and is partly responsible for the projected increase by fiscal year 2013. With these caveats, we rate this claim as Half True.	None	Republican Party of Georgia	None	None	None	2012-02-13T06:00:00	2012-02-01	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-07202	"Part of his ride was to warn the British that were already there that, 'Hey, you're not going to succeed.' "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/06/sarah-palin/was-trash-talking-british-part-paul-reveres-ride/	In another weird twist to her family vacation bus tour, Sarah Palin got herself in a bit of a press dust-up when she dabbled in a folksy version of early American history. The subject: Paul Revere. Here's the quote in question: "He who warned the British that they weren't gonna be takin' away our arms by ringing those bells, and makin' sure as he's riding his horse through town to send those warning shots and bells that we were going to be sure and we were going to be free, and we were going to be armed." Many media outlets quickly pounced, saying Palin needed a history lesson. We were frankly going to let this one go. It seemed to us like perhaps an impromptu slip up. But then Palin doubled down in a June 5 interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News. "You realize that you messed up about Paul Revere, don't you?" Wallace asked. "I didn't mess up about Paul Revere," Palin said. "Here is what Paul Revere did. He warned the Americans that the British were coming, the British were coming, and they were going to try to take our arms and we got to make sure that we were protecting ourselves and shoring up all of our ammunitions and our firearms so that they couldn’t take it. But remember that the British had already been there, many soldiers for seven years in that area. And part of Paul Revere’s ride — and it wasn’t just one ride — he was a courier, he was a messenger. "Part of his ride was to warn the British that were already there. That, hey, you’re not going to succeed. You’re not going to take American arms. You are not going to beat our own well-armed persons, individual, private militia that we have. He did warn the British. And in a shout-out, gotcha type of question that was asked of me, I answered candidly. And I know my American history." We don't remember anything about Revere trash-talking to the British in the version of events from the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem "Paul Revere's Ride." But it's probably not wise to go with a poem for the last word on history. Not at all wise, according to a Maine Historical Society website account of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's famous poem. "The basic premise of Longfellow's poem is historically accurate, but Paul Revere's role is exaggerated," the historical group states. "The most glaring inconsistencies between the poem and the historical record are that Revere was not the only rider that night, nor did he make it all the way to Concord, but was captured and then let go (without his horse) in Lexington, where he had stopped to warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock of the impending attack. "Longfellow's intention was not to write a history; it was to create a national hero, and he was successful at doing so." So let's go to accounts from Revere himself. The Massachusetts Historical Society has two accounts of the night of April 18, 1775, from Revere. The first came via a deposition, likely prepared at the request of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress to prove who fired the first shot at Lexington. The second, in which he provides a similar account, comes from a letter Revere wrote in 1798. In both accounts, Revere recounted that he received instruction from Dr. Joseph Warren, a leader among the Patriots, to ride to Lexington to warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock that English troops were moving toward Lexington and/or Concord. The historical society notes that Revere recounted that he "secured a horse in Charlestown, avoided British officers near Charlestown Common, and reached Lexington (where he conveyed the message to Adams and Hancock). He set out for Concord with William Dawes and Samuel Prescott, but halfway there, he was captured by British soldiers." We'll pick up here with Revere's own words from the 1798 letter, explaining that after he was captured, a British commander began to question him: "He asked me if I was an express. I answered in the affirmative. He demanded what time I left Boston? I told him; and added, that their troops had catched aground in passing the River, and that there would be five hundred Americans there in a short time, for I had alarmed the Country all the way up." In the 1775 deposition, Revere simply said "500 men" -- rather than 500 Americans -- were gathering to face the "Regulars" (the British). In his 1994 book, "Paul Revere's Ride," author David Hackett Fischer relied on historical documents to recount this passage: With six pistols pointed at him, Revere spoke with a spirit the British officers found infuriating in a provincial prisoner, who seemed not to know his place, or to care about the danger he faced. One of the prisoners, Elijah Sanderson, listened at a distance and later remembered, "I heard him pick up with energy to them." "Gentlemen," Revere told them, "you've missed of your aim." "What of our aim?" one answered in a "hard" tone. Another insisted that they were out after deserters, a frequent employment of British officers in America. "I know better," Paul Revere boldly replied. "I know what you are after, and I have alarmed the country all the way up." So Palin is correct about one point: Revere did warn the British that they were going to face armed resistance from some 500 colonists. But Palin's comment suggests Revere was "running around ringing bells and warning the British," said James Giblin, author of The Many Rides of Paul Revere. "He wasn't, of course." "He was captured by the British and never made it to Concord," Giblin said. "While he was a prisoner of the British, he warned them they might meet a strong force of Americans. He was sort of boastful, telling them, 'You don't know what kind of force you're going to encounter at Concord.' He was propagandizing for the rebels." "She really needed a fact-checker before she spoke," Gilbin said. Again, here's what Palin said in her Fox News interview, after she'd been challenged on her initial account of Revere's ride. "Part of his ride was to warn the British that were already there that, "Hey, you're not going to succeed. You're not going to take American arms. You are not going to beat our own well-armed persons, individual, private militia that we have...He did warn the British." Again, it so happens that after he was captured, Revere did "warn" (or boast) that armed Americans were awaiting the British militia. Palin's comments touch on this little-known part of history. But Palin's comment clearly suggests that one of Revere's aims that night was to warn the British. It was not. His aim -- in his own words -- was solely to warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock of British troop movement. We rate Palin's comment Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08118	Oregonians have an "amazing no-cost way to fight abortion" with free political donations	true	/oregon/statements/2010/dec/10/oregon-right-life-pac/oregon-right-life-encourages-oregonians-take-advan/	One of Oregon's better known political action committees, Oregon Right to Life, has taken to the newspaper pages to remind you that it appreciates presents just as much as anyone else. But, in case you’re not feeling particularly politically philanthropic this season, Right to Life is sweetening the pot. In a recent ad in the Catholic Sentinel, the group tells readers that making a difference (i.e. donating) is "free" and "easy." "Announcing an amazing no-cost way to fight abortion," the ad says. We love seeing "free" and "no cost." Mostly in conjunction with sales, but also here because it’s a tell-tale sign of a good fact check. The ad urges people "to use some of your taxes to help prevent abortion" and says the group uses the money "to help elect pro-life candidates in Oregon." According to the ad, individual Oregonians can make a $50 political donation ($100 for couples) to Oregon Right to Life and get a tax credit back in the very same amount. Amazing! But is it true? We did some googling and found ourselves on the Oregon Department of Revenue’s website. Lo and behold, there it was, under a list of possible tax credits: "Political contributions." "Oregon law allows a tax credit for political contributions," according to the site. It makes sense, we suppose, why wouldn’t politicians pass a tax break that has the potential to help them? Here are the details: Under Oregon tax law, an individual can donate up to $50 (again, $100 for a couple jointly filing) to a candidate or their principal campaign committee, a political action committee or a political party (national, state or local) and claim an equal credit on their return. Read more here. The ruling is pretty evident; weird as it may seem, Oregon does allow you to make a small political contribution ‘for free’ by giving you a tax credit of up to $50.

pomt-09220	Elena Kagan "has published five scholarly review articles, mostly on administrative law and the First Amendment. These articles were mostly on technical and procedural issues."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/17/david-brooks/elena-kagan-law-articles-not-so-easy-count/	Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan has never been a judge, which means there are no legal opinions to analyze. So her scholarly writing has taken on heightened prominence. Kagan's writings have drawn an interesting mix of reviews. Some people say her record is highly regarded and substantial, while others say it's embarrassingly puny. One of the nay-sayers is New York Times columnist David Brooks, who wrote that Kagan has been so cautious and strategic in cultivating her career that she's, well, boring. As evidence of this, Brooks cited her academic record: "She has become a legal scholar without the interest scholars normally have in the contest of ideas. She's shown relatively little interest in coming up with new theories or influencing public debate. "Her publication record is scant and carefully nonideological. She has published five scholarly review articles, mostly on administrative law and the First Amendment. These articles were mostly on technical and procedural issues." His description of her record caught our attention; we had read other reports that gave different numbers for her scholarly output. SCOTUSBlog, a respected blog about the Supreme Court, said Kagan wrote six major articles, while Eugene Volokh, a respected law professor from University of California at Los Angeles, described her publications on his blog The Volokh Conspiracy as "four major articles" and "three shorter but still substantial pieces," which would be seven pieces. We set out to determine how many articles Kagan had written and what they were about. We soon discovered is that counting scholarly articles is not an exact science. When Kagan was being confirmed as President Obama's solicitor general, she submitted a list of her publications to the U.S. Senate's Judiciary Committee. That list is lengthy, citing 19 separate pieces. Some of these are obviously not "scholarly review articles," such as short introductions for longer works, or memorials of people who have died. We did find five pieces of Kagan's that seem pretty indisputably to be original, scholarly publications: • "Chevron's Nondelegation Doctrine," Supreme Court Review, 2001 (co-written with David J. Barron) • "Presidential Administration," Harvard Law Review, 2001 • "Regulation of Hate Speech and Pornography after R.A.V.," University of Chicago Law Review 1993 • "The Changing Faces of First Amendment Neutrality: R.A.V. v St. Paul, Rust v Sullivan, and the Problem of Content-Based Underinclusion," Supreme Court Review, 1992 • "Private Speech, Public Purpose: The Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment Doctrine," University of Chicago Law Review, 1996 There's also a fairly significant piece that we don't include above only because it's written in response to another law professor's article and might not be considered purely original. But it is substantial and it did appear in a respected law review. It is included in the SCOTUSblog tally. • "When A Speech Code Is A Speech Code: The Stanford Policy and the Theory of Incidental Restraints," University of California at Davis Law Review, 1996 There are also two lengthy book reviews Kagan wrote for law reviews. Volokh counts the first one. • "Confirmation Messes, Old and New," University of Chicago Law Review, 1993 • "A Libel Story: Sullivan Then and Now," Law and Social Inquiry 1993 We consulted with two law professors who served on hiring committees for law schools to get additional perspective on how law professors count scholarly articles. "It's an interesting question, and there's a good deal of disagreement," said Richard Friedman, a professor of law at the highly regarded University of Michigan Law School. Hiring committees look for work that has had "scholarly impact," Friedman said, which usually means other scholars or judges notice the work and comment on it. "Some book reviews are pretty ambitious theoretically," Friedman said. "I don't think there should be a hard, fast rule that says, 'Oh it's a book review, it doesn't count.' ... But a book review is probably going to count less." Another law professor said productivity is also a top concern for hiring committees. "The usual contours the discussion takes are over how much people have done over a period of time," said George Rutherglen, a professor at the highly rated University of Virginia Law School. "You need to ask how long she was working as a law professor full-time." This is particularly pertinent in Kagan's case, because she has not been a full-time scholar for much of her career. She currently serves as solicitor general, the attorney who argues the government's cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Before that, she was the dean of the Harvard Law School, and she also served as an attorney and adviser in the Clinton administration. Her career as a legal scholar was interrupted by the latter two positions. Deans are usually administrators and not expected to consistently publish major scholarly work, said both Friedman and Rutherglen. Brooks also described Kagan's articles were "mostly on technical or procedural issues." We reviewed Kagan's major articles to see if they seemed particularly procedural or technical from a lay person's perspective. One of them definitely did: "Chevron's Nondelegation Doctrine" is about how Congress delegates policy decisions to official agencies. "Presidential Administration" was also long but less than thrilling, and concerned how "presidential control over administration can serve pro-regulatory objectives." We should note, however, that "Presidential Administration" has launched a fairly robust debate on the left about Kagan's views are on executive power. The blogger and civil rights attorney Glenn Greenwald has written that Kagan's article raises questions about her views in the wake of the George W. Bush's approach to executive power. Greenwald acknowledged that Kagan wrote the article before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001; he thinks she should answer questions about the article. But Greenwald still called the article "definitely a major piece of scholarship." Kagan's three other major articles are about First Amendment law. "Regulation of Hate Speech and Pornography after R.A.V.," "The Changing Faces of First Amendment Neutrality," and "Private Speech, Public Purpose" are fairly interesting discussions of how courts should consider First Amendment cases, when government tries to do things like suppress hate speech or enforce abortion gag rules. R.A.V. was the pseudonym of a teenager convicted under a hate speech ordinance for burning a cross on the lawn of a black family. The Supreme Court found that the ordinance in question crossed the line from punishing behavior to punishing viewpoints. These articles did not seem particularly technical or procedural. Rutherglen praised these pieces as "important contributions to the field," while Volokh wrote that the articles "attack difficult and important problems." Her most readable piece was her book review, "Confirmation Messes, Old and New," in which she argued that Supreme Court nominees should be more forthcoming about their legal views during confirmation hearings. (Yes, we're readying our Flip-O-Meter on this one, once her own hearings start.) To be clear, whether Kagan's scholarly output should be considered substantial or scant is a legitimate area for debate and we're not trying to settle that question here. Instead, we wanted to know how much Kagan wrote and what she wrote about. Brooks said she wrote five "mostly technical and procedural" scholarly review articles. We found that there are several different ways to calculate how many law review articles Kagan has written; and some legal experts offer higher numbers. Finally, if Brooks only counts five articles, at least three of those were about significant First Amendment issues with broad impact, which is at odds with his description of the articles as "mostly technical or procedural." So we rate his statement Half True.	None	David Brooks	None	None	None	2010-05-17T18:11:04	2010-05-10	['Elena_Kagan', 'First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution']
pomt-00133	Says Phil Bredesen "lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/25/marsha-blackburn/marsha-blackburn-falsely-says-phil-bredesen-lured-/	In the open race for U.S. Senate in Tennessee, Republican candidate Rep. Marsha Blackburn has repeatedly tied Democrat Phil Bredesen, former Tennessee governor, to loose immigration policies. A recent Blackburn campaign ad told voters that Bredesen "won’t stop illegal immigration, because he lured it." The ad flashes black and white images of Bredesen’s face against a backdrop of a highway packed with cars. "It was Phil Bredesen who, quote, lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee," a man’s voice says in the Oct. 11 ad. "Bredesen lured illegal immigrants hundreds of miles by offering them driver certificates. "Now, Bredesen opposes President Trump’s immigration ban. And Bredesen admits, ‘I don’t believe the wall is the right answer.’ "Phil Bredesen. He won’t stop illegal immigration, because he lured it." The voiceover closes with shadowy images of young men ascending a ladder or a wall, presumably an illegal border crossing. We took a closer look at whether Bredesen "lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee." Key takeaways • Between 2001 and 2006, Tennessee went from giving immigrants in the country illegally full driver's licenses, to giving them driver's certificates, to giving them nothing. • Under a 2004 law, illegal immigrants came from as far away as New Jersey to get certificates — before returning to their home states. • In the face of abuses, Bredesen ended the certificate program in 2006. Driver’s licenses in Tennessee: A bipartisan history The arc of the state's laws on driving privileges for the undocumented goes from granting them regular driver's licenses to granting them nothing. Blackburn's issue with Bredesen deals with a policy adjustment in the middle. In 2001, Tennessee passed a law that allowed a person without a Social Security number to get a typical driver’s license. The bill had support from most Democratic lawmakers and a bit under half of the Republican ones. Republican Gov. Don Sundquist signed it. Blackburn was a state senator and voted against it. Bredesen took office in 2003. In 2004, in the middle of a growing demand for tighter identification standards in the wake of the 9-11 terrorist attacks, Bredesen proposed creating a driver’s certificate. Anyone without a Social Security number who met the ordinary requirements for a license, such as passing a driver's test and proof of Tennessee residence, could get one. It was billed as a compromise between traffic safety and national security needs. "Its purpose is to make sure people understand the law and the rules of the road," said Melissa McDonald, the spokeswoman for the Department of Safety in a 2005 New York Times article. "You can't buy beer with it. You shouldn't be able to board a plane with it." The driver’s certificate card bore the words, "For driving purposes only — not valid for identification." Unlike a regular driver’s license, a certificate expired after one year. The 2004 bill passed muster overwhelmingly with both Republicans and Democrats. The vote in the state Senate was 32-0, including 15 Republican senators, and in the House, with 45 Republicans, the vote was 96-2. (By then, Blackburn was in the U.S. Congress.) Abuses uncovered The law took effect in June 2004. By October, people began gaming the system. In one case, according to court papers, a woman in Tennessee "transported illegal aliens from New Jersey to Tennessee in order to procure certificates for driving." She provided them with "hotel rooms while in Tennessee, and documents purporting to show that the aliens had addresses in the state." The judge in the case wrote that the aliens said "they wanted the licenses so that they could drive to their jobs in New Jersey." Where the immigrants went after they had their certificates has some bearing here. Watching Blackburn’s ad, you might think that the program attracted them to Tennessee to live. That doesn’t seem to be what happened. Attorney Mike Whalen represented the women who brought in immigrants from New Jersey. "To the best of my understanding, none of these folks stayed in Tennessee," Whalen said. "I speak Spanish, so I represent lots of folks who are undocumented. Never saw it." A larger scam operated out of a private driving school in Winchester, Tenn. Investigators discovered a scheme where people at the driving school bribed state workers to provide both licenses and certificates for undocumented immigrants. Officials said hundreds of illegal immigrants were directed to the school. The word "lure" comes from an Associated Press headline about the investigation. Certificate program ends As federal and state law enforcement began arresting and charging people in late 2005 and early 2006, Bredesen shut down the certificate program. "It’s clear from talks with law enforcement authorities that there are issues with this program that need to be addressed," Bredesen said in March 2006. "The only responsible course of action is to suspend the program while we determine the next steps." Stephen Fotopulos was policy director with the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition in 2006. Fotopulos said his advocacy group tried to preserve the program by making it more rigorous. "For months we worked with Department of Safety to change the process of getting a driver's certificate to make sure that only people in Tennessee would get it," Fotopulos told us. But in 2007, the Legislature passed and Bredesen signed the full termination of the program. With about 10 Democrats dissenting, the measure passed by wide majorities in both the House and Senate. Our ruling Blackburn said that Bredesen "lured illegal immigrants to Tennessee" by offering a driver’s certificate for the undocumented. The one accurate part of the claim is that people came from out of state and fraudulently applied for both certificates and full driver's licenses. After that, the claim begins to break down. Bredesen swapped a more lenient licensing law signed by his Republican predecessor for a less useful certificate that could not serve as official identification and lasted for only a year. To pin the law to Bredesen ignores that nearly every Republican lawmaker approved that change. When problems surfaced, Bredesen preempted the Legislature and ended the program by executive action. The next year, Republicans and most Democrats voted to affirm that move. Lastly, the ad strongly implies that Bredesent sought to have illegal immigrants stay in Tennessee. There is no evidence for that. We rate this claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Marsha Blackburn	None	None	None	2018-10-25T17:22:41	2018-10-11	['Phil_Bredesen', 'Tennessee']

pomt-12260	Says Barack Obama found out about Russia "in August. Now, the election was in November. That's a lot of time. He did nothing about it."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-barack-obama-did-nothing-about-r/	President Donald Trump on an overseas trip criticized former President Barack Obama, saying he "did nothing" about Russia before the 2016 presidential election. "Now, the thing I have to mention is that Barack Obama, when he was president, found out about this, in terms of if it were Russia, found out about it in August," Trump said during a July 6 press conference in Poland. "Now, the election was in November. That's a lot of time. He did nothing about it." People can argue that the Obama administration didn’t do enough to immediately crack down on Russia for meddling in the election. But Trump’s statement that Obama "did nothing" in the months leading up to Nov. 8 goes too far. The Obama administration learned in summer 2016 that election-related hacks could be traced back to the Russian government. Soon after, at the September G20 Summit in China, Obama personally confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin and told him to back off. Then-CIA Director John Brennan gave a similar warning to his Russian counterpart, Federal Security Bureau Director Alexander Bortnikov, during an August phone call. On Oct. 7, the Obama administration publicly identified Russia for the first time as being behind election-related hacks, issuing a joint statement from Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence. In the days following that statement, Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Vice President Joe Biden said the administration was considering options for a "proportional" response. Also, throughout August and up through the election, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson encouraged state-level election officials, through official statements and phone calls, to protect voting-related systems from cyber intrusions. However, the Obama administration took its most significant actions against Russia after Nov. 8. In late December, Obama ordered 35 Russian diplomats and suspected intelligence agents to leave the United States, and he also imposed narrow sanctions on some Russian individuals and organizations. "While I don’t think it’s fair to say that the administration ‘did nothing,’ their actions were fairly minimal prior to Nov 8," said Emma Ashford, an international security expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. Ashford and a couple other experts in U.S.-Russia relations told us that the Obama administration felt like it had few options prior to the election because of the political climate. The Obama administration likely waited until after the election to take any truly punitive measures because they "wanted to avoid the appearance of interfering in the election, and because they felt it was probably up to the next administration to deal with this policy problem," Ashford said. The White House had to consider the fact that acknowledging Russia’s involvement could actually help Russia get closer to its goal of delegitimizing the election, said Yoshiko Herrera, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. And there was also the possibility that retaliating could provoke Russia to take more action against the United States in a variety of arenas, including Syria. Herrera added that it’s quite possible the Obama administration and intelligence community took additional action against Russia that the public doesn’t know about because it’s classified. In hindsight, knowing how the Russia storyline has played out over the past few months, "it might have been better to call out Russia for hacking a bit sooner, but at the time I think the Obama administration tried to be responsible," she said. Our ruling Trump said that Obama found out about Russia "in August. Now, the election was in November. That's a lot of time. He did nothing about it." The Obama administration did not sit idle while Russia interfered in the election, as Trump makes it seem. The administration publicly named the Russian government as the culprit, confronted Putin in person, and worked to secure the country’s election infrastructure — all while the intelligence agencies investigated the issue. That said, Obama waited until December, after the election, to take any public, punitive measures against Putin, when he kicked out diplomats and imposed sanctions. Trump’s statement contains a grain of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

Across the five financial years from 2014-15 to 2018-19, the aid budget has been cut twice in nominal terms. And while data from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade shows that nominal aid spending increased marginally in the other three budget years, these gains disappear after inflation is taken into account. This equates to a real cut in all five budget years. Experts told Fact Check that the Consumer Price Index was a reasonable way to measure inflation in the context of Australian aid spending. Based on this, Fact Check calculates that, from year to year, aid spending was cut in real terms by as little as 0.2 per cent and by as much as 17.7 per cent. According to ANU's Development Policy Centre, which publishes the aid figures in 2018 dollars, this equates to an $8 million cut in 2018-19 and a $953 million cut in 2015-16.

pomt-07581	"Oregon is the only state out of the 50 states in the USA that continues to pay 100% of the medical benefits for its employees and their families."	false	/oregon/statements/2011/mar/28/dennis-richardson/dennis-richardson-says-oregon-only-state-pick-publ/	The issue of public workers and their pay and benefits is en vogue in capitols across the U.S. Oregon, it would appear, is no exception. In a recent newsletter to his constituents, Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, argues that state employees need to help pay some of the cost of their benefits packages. Right now, he notes, they’re not responsible for any of it. That, he says, makes Oregon unique: "Oregon is the only state out of the 50 states in the USA that continues to pay 100% of the medical benefits for its employees and their families." We were of the impression, that yes, Oregon is among a shrinking number of states that pay the whole tab for public worker benefits. But the idea that Oregon would be the only state caught us off guard. So, we looked into it. First off, we confirmed with Ingrid Norberg, the spokeswoman for the Public Employees’ Benefit Board, that Oregon does, in fact, cover the full cost of certain medical benefit packages for certain employees. That said, employees are still responsible for co-payments in certain cases, she said. Once we had that confirmed, we stopped by the National Conference of State Legislatures website. The group keeps an eye on state-related issues and trends, and public employee health care plans are among them. According to a report on their site, as of 2009, "(s)even states paid for 100 percent of the "defined standard" monthly premium costs for at least some familiesof state employees." They listed those states as Alaska, Delaware, Iowa, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Oregon. So, we placed a call to both Rep. Richardson and the Conference to sort out the discrepancy. Richardson explained, in a voice mail, that he had taken the information from a December 2010 report by then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski’s Reset Cabinet. He cited, as his proof, one sentence in the report: "Oregon is one of two states that pay the full cost of health benefits for employees and their dependents (the other is Alaska) and is the only state to do so in plans with no deductibles." That’s not quite what the representative said in his newsletter, but we noted the claim and asked Richard Cauchi, the NCSL’s Health Program director, about it. As far as Cauchi knew, there were more than two states covering 100 percent of the monthly premium cost. Of the seven cited online, he believed a few had since stopped covering the full cost, but that four or five continued to do so. As for the part about deductibles, he said the group did not track plans in that detail. Before he ended the call, however, he did add some perspective on the issue: "The one thing there is in this is a gradual, but real, trend toward employee contribution. Ten years ago there were certainly more states that paid 100 percent of the costs. That's been going down year by year. It’s been a dwindling list, if you will." We decided to go back to one of the sources of the report: Tim Nesbitt, a former chief of staff to Kulongoski. He said the line that Oregon was one of two states to cover the full cost came from the Public Employees’ Benefit Board. We doubled back to spokeswoman Ingrid Norberg. Norberg did some checking for us and found a set of slides used in a presentation to the governor’s Reset Cabinet. Using a different set of information from the National Conference of State Legislatures, PEBB had reported that Oregon was one of six states that covered the premiums for the lowest-cost medical plan. So why did it make it into the report that Oregon was one of two? Well, according to the NCSL information, only Oregon and Alaska also cover dental and vision costs. The comparison, Norberg noted, is still difficult to make -- a "contribution from the employer may be for a range of benefits and a range of benefit designs. So, comparing one with another is like comparing apples and bananas." The bottom line, however, seems to be that Oregon isn’t alone here. In his newsletter, Rep. Richardson says Oregon is the only state the nation that pays "100% of the medical benefits for its employees and their families." That’s just not true. Even the source he cites contradicts what he wrote. And even that source was a bit misguided in its assertion about Oregon being one of two to cover medical benefits completely. Oregon is one of two states that covers a full range of benefits -- health, dental and vision -- but it’s one of at least four that covers the premiums for its lowest-cost health plan. Richardson’s larger point, that Oregon is in a shrinking group of states that do so is certainly a strong and valid one. However, he undercuts his argument by resorting to hyperbole. We find his claim False. Comment on this item.	None	Dennis Richardson	None	None	None	2011-03-28T06:00:00	2011-03-04	['United_States', 'Oregon']

pomt-11804	"When Phoenix dropped its sanctuary city policy in 2008, its murder rate fell 27 percent the following year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/17/marsha-blackburn/rep-blackburn-claims-phoenix-murder-rate-decline-l/	U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., opined in a Fox News post that sanctuary cities threaten public safety and that their policies are lawless. She also linked a decline in Phoenix’s murder rate to the city’s abandonment of a sanctuary policy. "Sanctuary cities endanger their citizens," Blackburn wrote in a Nov. 9 opinion piece. "When Phoenix dropped its sanctuary city policy in 2008, its murder rate fell 27 percent the following year, and other violent crime rates also fell." So-called sanctuary cities are jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with immigration authorities, and the extent of their limitations vary widely. President Donald Trump has promised to cut their federal funding, a move supported by Blackburn. We wanted to know if Blackburn was accurate in her claim that Phoenix’ murder rate dropped 27 percent after the city abandoned a sanctuary policy. We did find a decline in the murder rate, but the extent attributable to a policy change is questionable. Did Phoenix have a sanctuary policy? There’s no widely accepted legal definition for "sanctuary cities," but the term is generally applied to jurisdictions that claim that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility, not a local one. They argue that reporting individuals to immigration officials can undermine communities’ trust in law enforcement officers. Phoenix officials pushed back on the premise that the city ever had sanctuary policies. "The city has never been a ‘sanctuary city’. We consistently comply with federal and state immigration requirements," said Tammy Vo, spokeswoman for the City of Phoenix. Phoenix Police Department Spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard also told PolitiFact they’ve "never had a policy that made us a sanctuary city." Blackburn did not return repeated requests for information for this fact check. But we found that some groups considered Phoenix a sanctuary city based on a police department policy up to 2008. Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues, in May 2008 issued a statement saying the Phoenix police chief was making changes to a policy which the group said "prohibited police officers from inquiring about the immigration status of individuals and from cooperating with federal immigration officials." The Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low immigration, in August 2010 also said that until 2008, "Phoenix was considered by many to be a sanctuary for illegal aliens." A 2010 report from Police Executive Research Forum said a policy prohibiting Phoenix officers from contacting immigration officials was interpreted by some as providing a "sanctuary city" for undocumented immigrants. That policy came under scrutiny after a police officer was shot and killed in September 2007 by an immigrant in the country illegally, the report said. A revised policy implemented in May 2008 required officers to question everyone arrested about their citizenship; allowed officers to contact federal authorities (after supervisory approval) when they suspected an arrestee was in the country illegally; and required records of all contacts with ICE, the report said. Was there a link between the murder rate drop and policy change? While we did not hear back from Blackburn’s office, we found similarities between her claim and a June 2017 Fox News report, headlined, "Crime drops in Phoenix after city drops sanctuary city status, former cops say." Fox News cited City-Data.com, saying its numbers showed that "from 2008 to 2009 Phoenix's murder rate fell 27 percent." City-Data.com’s figures appear to stem from FBI Uniform Crime Reporting data on murder and nonnegligent manslaughter. But experts cautioned against assuming that a change in one policy is the sole cause of a murder rate decline. "In terms of Phoenix (and other major metro areas around the country — both ‘sanctuary’ and ‘non-sanctuary’), crime rates, including homicide, actually began falling well before before 2008 and have generally continued to drop since," said Daniel E. Martínez, an assistant professor in the School of Sociology at the University of Arizona. "The supposed relationship that Blackburn is citing is likely due to several other factors beyond these policies." Without a proper study analyzing Phoenix’s murder rates years before and after a policy and how it compares to similar cities, claims that one policy change drove down the murder rate are suspicious, said Charis E. Kubrin, a professor in the department of criminology, law and society at the University of California, Irvine. Other possible changes in Phoenix, such as better policing, and whether Phoenix’s murder rate decline was consistent with nationwide trends are also important to consider, experts said. "When one event occurs before another, statisticians say that shows correlation but not necessarily causation. I would be very skeptical of the causation claim, even if it turns out that Phoenix had a sanctuary policy that it rescinded in 2008," said Huyen Pham, a law professor at Texas A&M University School of Law. "You would need a much more rigorous study, including study of other factors that may have caused the drop." According to City-Data.com, cited by Fox News, the murder rate in Phoenix dropped 10 percent from 2006 to 2007, and about 24 percent from 2007 to 2008. It’s also worth noting that the policy change in Phoenix happened in May 2008, so there were a few months in that calendar year under the former policy. From 2009 to 2010, the Phoenix murder rate did not change; it increased about 4 percent from 2010 to 2011, according to City-Data.com’s figures. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A review article by Martinez and two other colleagues notes they are only aware of four empirical studies systematically examining the relationship between limited cooperation policies and crime. "None of the studies support the claim that 'sanctuaries' are more crime‐prone than non‐sanctuaries," their paper said. Our ruling Blackburn wrote, "When Phoenix dropped its sanctuary city policy in 2008, its murder rate fell 27 percent the following year." While the murder rate did decline, experts say the change is likely attributable to many factors, not just a single policy change. Phoenix officials claim the city has never been a "sanctuary city," but some groups pegged the city as such based on a policy in place up to 2008. We rate Blackburn’s claim Half True.

pomt-07123	Says an alternative to Social Security that operates in Galveston County, Texas, has meant that participants will "retire with a whole lot more money" than under Social Security.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/17/herman-cain/herman-cain-touts-alternative-social-security-used/	During Monday’s Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., former pizza executive Herman Cain touted an alternative to Social Security that has been operating for three decades in Galveston County, Texas. "The city of Galveston, they opted out of the Social Security system way back in the '70s," Cain said. "And now, they retire with a whole lot more money. Why? For a real simple reason -- they have an account with their money on it. What I'm simply saying is we've got to restructure the program using a personal retirement account option in order to eventually make it solvent." We’ll give Cain a pass on a pair of minor errors -- it’s Galveston County, not city, and the program launched in 1981, not in the 1970s. Instead, we’ll cut to the bottom line: Has the program meant that participants "retire with a whole lot more money" than they would under Social Security? First, some background on the Galveston program, which is an oddity in American retirement-security policy. (The federal government banned such moves by local governments in 1983.) In 1981, employees of Galveston County -- as well as those in two adjoining Texas counties, Matagorda and Brazoria — voted, after lengthy presentations and discussions, to withdraw from Social Security and initiate a system of individual accounts to provide retirement, survivor and disability benefits. Participants would contribute to their retirement accounts, supplemented by an amount from their employers, and those funds would be invested in annuities through a financial-services company chosen by a county-run bidding process. The Alternate Plan, as it is called, was designed to supplement a separate, existing, defined-contribution pension plan known as the Texas County and District Retirement System. The Alternate Plan’s benefits are not indexed for inflation (a key difference from Social Security -- more on that below), and while each participant is assigned an individual account, the employee is not able to control investment decisions. In recent years, as various politicians have floated ideas to partially privatize Social Security, the Galveston plan has received an unusual amount of public attention. However, the primary statistics available to gauge Cain’s claim are imperfect, since they are more than a decade old. Judging which plan provides a better payout requires constructing models for various types of employees, accounting for variables such as income, the length and consistency of job tenure, marital status and the number and age of dependents. So comparing the two plans is a complex undertaking, and the most thorough independent examinations of the question -- a pair of 1999 studies by the Government Accountability Office and the Social Security Administration -- do not appear to have been updated in the past dozen years. We’ll first explain what GAO and SSA concluded in 1999, then look at what variables must be taken into account before applying their 12-year-old conclusions to today. As our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas summarized in an item published in December, 2010, participants who had higher earnings and fewer or no dependents generally fared better under the Galveston plan, particularly over the near term. But workers with lower earnings and more dependents tend to receive more money under Social Security. This stems from the plans’ divergent designs. The Galveston plan is somewhat analogous to a 401(k) plan -- that is, a plan designed to encourage workers to save for retirement -- rather than a social insurance, or safety-net, program like Social Security. "Social Security is a social insurance program designed, in part, to provide a basic level of retirement income to help retired workers, disabled workers and their dependents and survivors stay out of poverty," GAO wrote in 1999. As a result, GAO said, Social Security benefits "are tilted to provide relatively higher benefits to low-wage earners" than they would have received based on what they put into the system. There is no such redistributive mechanism in the Alternate Plan. If you have a higher salary and put more money into the system, you’ll get more out of it -- perhaps even more than Social Security would provide, GAO and SSA concluded. But if you are on the low end of the income scale, Social Security will give you a relatively better payout at retirement, compared with the Alternate Plan. There’s another important factor to note. Because the Alternate Plan lacks inflation protection -- unlike Social Security, which increases benefits annually if there’s inflation in consumer prices -- the studies found a serious risk that Alternate Plan beneficiaries will fare worse over time than if they had received Social Security and its built-in cost-of-living increases. (The specific scenarios outlined in the studies are highly varied; readers who want more details should read the reports directly.) The takeaway from the GAO and SSA studies is that the Galveston plan can be better than Social Security -- if you’re better off and if you fall into certain specific demographic categories. For many workers, especially those who are paid less, Social Security provides more. This result doesn’t directly conflict with Cain’s statement, but it does undermine the sweeping certitude with which he said that participants will "retire with a whole lot more money." "It's a great plan if you have worked under the plan for many years, if you do not die and leave any dependents, if you are not divorced from someone covered in the plan and if you are not interested in having your retirement income stream protected against inflation," said Eric Kingson, a professor at Syracuse University's School of Social Work and a longtime skeptic of the plan. "Short-term workers who leave the plan receive little if any benefits for their work and do not have their years under the Galveston Plan covered by Social Security. Low-income working persons do not receive anything approaching the kind of protection they receive under Social Security." Keith Brainard, the research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, agreed that the Galveston plan is better for some types of workers, including those with long tenures. But the "problem," he said, "lies in Cain’s implication that Social Security should be a wealth-producing vehicle, when that’s not what it’s supposed to be. Social Security is supposed to be old-age insurance. That should be the emphasis of the program, not ‘retiring with a lot more money.’" As we noted, the GAO and SSA studies are old. How do they hold up? As it turns out, they may bolster or even strengthen the case for Social Security. The 1999 studies were conducted at a time of higher returns in the marketplace. The Galveston plan invests conservatively -- by design and from the beginning -- in annuity contracts with a guaranteed rate of return, rather than stocks. So the Galveston system is insulated from much market volatility. Still, even these safer financial vehicles have seen ramped-down returns in the current economic climate. Because of prevailing low interest rates, the contracts now provide the minimum rate of return that was negotiated as a floor in 1981 -- either 3.75 percent or 4 percent annually, said Rick Gornto, president of First Financial Benefits Inc., who has operated the Galveston plan for 30 years. That’s lower than the 1999 GAO and SSA studies had projected. And that’s notable, because when the 1999 studies came out, plan supporters criticized the reports for assuming lower returns than the plan had produced historically, thus unfairly selling the plan short compared to Social Security. "These studies assumed a low 4 percent return, which is the minimum rate of return on annuities guaranteed by the insurance companies," wrote Judge Ray Holbrook, who oversaw the creation and administration of the Galveston plan, and Alcestis "Cooky" Oberg in a 2005 paper for the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative think tank that has been a longtime supporter of the plan. Holbrook and Oberg wrote that as of 2005, the average annual rate of return had been "about 6.5 percent over 24 years." Our reading of the SSA study is that they actually assumed a 5.55 percent rate of return for the Galveston plan. The figure used in the GAO study was not specified. Either way, the rates of return for the Alternate Plan are either equal to or lower than the 1999 studies had assumed. That would either bolster the 1999 conclusions or put the Alternate Plan at a disadvantage if such a comparison were made today. (Rates of return for Social Security depend on a person’s individual economic history, so there is no simple apples-to-apples comparison to make. That’s why comprehensive, model-based analyses like the GAO’s and the SSA's are necessary.) Now we’ll add some caveats. Retirement plans can only be judged on long-term returns, so today’s low rates may be putting the Galveston plan in an unusually poor light on the specific issue Cain highlighted. There’s nothing to say that the Galveston rates won’t rise in the future. In addition, there are some advantages to the Galveston plan -- not just to the higher earners who get more out of the program, but also to the government entity running them. The Alternate Plan doesn’t face the same kind of long-term fiscal challenges that Social Security does, because it only promises participants the investment returns for the money they pay in to the system. The downside, of course, is that the investments may not perform well enough to exceed what Social Security would have provided. In addition, some commentators have said that structural reasons would prevent a Galveston-type plan from being a good model on a national level, even if it were deemed to work well in a local context. But that debate is beyond the scope of this article. On the specific question Cain raised -- whether participants in Galveston will "retire with a whole lot more money" than if they were in Social Security -- the answer is, "it depends." According to studies published a dozen years ago, some will, and some won’t. And the outlook today for the Galveston plan’s rate of return -- while not immutable going forward -- is more downbeat than it was in 1999. On balance, we rate Cain’s statement Half True.

pomt-07611	"Eleven years ago, the city of Detroit lifted the residency requirement for police officers and today, 53 percent of officers live outside of the city. If we want the tax base of Milwaukee to resemble the tax base of Detroit, this is the way to go."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/22/tom-barrett/milwaukee-mayor-tom-barrett-says-53-percent-detroi/	Facing an uphill fight to preserve a requirement that police officers live in the city, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is invoking Detroit -- perhaps America’s No. 1 symbol of urban decay. Milwaukee is one of the nation’s last big cities with a residency rule, but Republicans in control of state government appear poised to change that. Gov. Scott Walker’s budget would free Milwaukee teachers of residency, and a GOP-backed bill would let Milwaukee police and firefighters live anywhere in the five-county area. Barrett opposes both moves, arguing that city property values will decline because large numbers of middle-class employees will move to the suburbs. Proponents -- typically employee unions -- say workers should be able to live where they want to live. The mayor quantified his concern in a Business Journal story in which he explicitly predicted Milwaukee could see a Detroit-style devastation of its tax base if residency rules are ended. "Eleven years ago, the city of Detroit lifted the residency requirement for police officers and today, 53 percent of officers live outside of the city," said Barrett. "If we want the tax base of Milwaukee to resemble the tax base of Detroit, this is the way to go." He added: "I don’t want the tax base of Milwaukee to be as decimated as the tax base in Detroit." Did Detroit’s police force undergo such a radical geographical change? And how much of the blame for tax-base losses is traceable to dumping residency? A bit of background first. All Milwaukee city employees are currently required to live within the city limits, a rule that has been in place since 1930, according to the mayor's office. Chicago, another holdout for residency, apparently will stick with it based on comments by incoming Mayor Rahm Emanuel. What about Detroit? Mayor Dave Bing recently unveiled a program to help cops buy homes in the city -- an effort to reverse the migration that Bing says followed the 1999 scrapping of Detroit’s residency law by Michigan state lawmakers. In his 2011 state of the city speech in February, Bing said approximately half of the Detroit force now lives outside the city’s confines. We asked Bing’s office for backup, and spokesman Dan Lijana said the precise figure is 53 percent, and we confirmed that with the Detroit Police Department. So on the numbers Barrett is right. And Detroit is not alone in seeing big numbers of employees leave. St. Louis dropped its requirement in 2005 and 36 percent of those eligible to live elsewhere have so far chosen that route. Barrett points to a 1994 city-commissioned study on teachers that predicted 60 percent would live outside the city without a residency requirement. The conclusion was based partly on other cities’ experiences. Marc Levine, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professor who has studied urban out-migration, said he estimated 50 percent to 65 percent would leave over time. Unions who back lifting the rules predict far less impact than city officials. "I don’t think it will cause a mass exodus or the doom and gloom the mayor portrays," said Milwaukee Police Association President Michael Crivello. But what about the assertion, implicit in Barrett’s remarks, that the loss of residency requirements leads to tax base losses? That’s part of the claim, too. Academics, real estate officials and City Hall agree that sale prices could get pushed down, especially in pockets near the city’s edges where many city employees and teachers tend to live. They disagree on the extent of the reduction in values, and how widespread it would be. Nailing down the extent of the cause and effect in other cities is difficult if not impossible. There is a dearth of useful research trying to parse out exactly how much impact residency has on a city’s tax base. But there is strong anecdotal evidence that Detroit’s decades-long population and tax base decline was accelerated after the state dropped residency for city workers, said Patrick Anderson, a former Michigan budget official and expert on the economics of Michigan cities. Anderson is CEO of Anderson Economic Group, which predicted negative effects from dropping residency, in a study commissioned by Detroit officials in 1999. At the same time, Anderson said, you can’t blame most of Detroit’s woes on the residency change. And Milwaukee, he said, has avoided some of the disastrous political squabbling and decision-making that hurt Detroit. Anderson notes Milwaukee has not taken the hits Detroit has -- and in fact its population has stabilized. That’s a point Barrett agrees with. The mayor attributes some of that to the residency rule, and says he wants to avoid action that tips the trend in the wrong direction. Said Anderson: "Once a city starts to deteriorate in safety, public services, tax base and cost, no ordinance will keep people inside its fence." It’s also worth noting that those cities that have dropped residency rules have taken different approaches. Some have tried to limit a fast exodus -- and the potential hit on their tax base. Philadelphia, for example, requires five years on the force before officers can live outside the city; St. Louis makes it seven. The Milwaukee police bill does not put on any such restrictions. Some observers, though, see an overreach in Barrett’s allusion to Detroit. "That’s a worst-case scenario," said Marquette University economics professor David Clark. "When you look at Detroit, they have faced significant challenges that we have not faced. They were tied to one industry. We have a more diverse employment base. We don’t have the crime they have and haven’t seen entire neighborhoods empty out like they have." So, the real estate market, the economy, crime and other quality of life factors can play into moving decisions -- and the impact on home values. Let’s return home and to the question at hand. Barrett notes that less than a decade after Detroit dropped residency, less than half its police force still lives in the city -- and in the same breath ties the change to the "decimated" state of Detroit’s tax base. The statistic Barrett cited was confirmed by Detroit officials and has gone unchallenged. Evaluating the implicit claim that ties the residency issue to tax base loss is more difficult. Experts agree there is at least some negative impact, but note there are many other factors at work. We rate the mayor’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-14713	"More than 60 percent of people in America support Planned Parenthood and only 11 percent approve of Congress."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/jan/02/cecile-richards/mostly-true-cecile-richards-says-far-more-american/	In a Dec. 15, 2015, interview with actress and writer Lena Dunham in Lenny Letter, Dunham’s feminist email newsletter, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards discussed testifying to Congress, running Planned Parenthood in the wake of the shooting in Colorado Springs and her experiences fighting for reproductive rights. Their conversation came as Republicans in Congress continued to seek an end to any federal aid to Planned Parenthood in the same year videos released by an anti-abortion group purported to show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the use of fetal tissue in medical research. Federal funding to Planned Parenthood does not go toward abortions and is instead used to fund the organization’s other services, such as sexually transmitted disease testing and treatment, mammograms and contraceptive services. In the interview, Dunham asked Richards about changes in the politics of abortion rights over Richards’ nine years as president of Planned Parenthood. Richards, eldest daughter to Ann Richards, the late former Texas governor, replied by mentioning the partisan realignment of legislatures in 2010, which mostly benefited Republicans, and the Republican Party’s national shift to the right. "But if you look at the people in this country," Richards continued, "they are supportive of safe and legal abortion. They support Planned Parenthood. I was just looking at the recent numbers. More than 60 percent of people in America support Planned Parenthood, and only 11 percent approve of Congress." Those numbers, Richards said, show that "just because the politics are going one way, it’s not because that’s where the people are." Where the people are is a pretty broad assessment. We focused on whether Richards was right about the relative popularity of Planned Parenthood and unpopularity of Congress. Congressional approval Congress hasn’t been widely admired very often. As we noted in a December 2014 story, the Gallup polling organization started inquiring into attitudes toward Congress in 1974. Its results show Congress never proving very popular, except after the 9/11 attacks, when there was a spike to 84 percent of respondents approving of the job Congress was doing. The most recent Gallup poll available at the time of Richards’ interview placed public approval of Congress at 11 percent. (After that, according to Gallup, support edged up to 13 percent.) The poll, conducted from Nov. 4 to Nov. 8, 2015, asked respondents, "Do you approve or disapprove of the way Congress is handling its job?" A whopping 86 percent disapproved, and 3 percent had no opinion. Eleven percent approval was a low point for Congress in 2015. Twenty percent approved of Congress in February 2015, and 19 percent approved in May 2015. Approval of Congress declined starting in May 2015, reaching 14 percent in August 2015 and 13 percent in October 2015, before hitting 11 percent the next month. A poll released Dec. 3, 1015, by Rasmussen Reports placed public support for Congress even lower: 9 percent of likely voters said Congress was doing a good or excellent job according to Rasmussen’s methodology, which in 2015 often returned lower favorability numbers than Gallup’s polls. Support for Planned Parenthood funding In reviewing the other end of Richards’ claim, we recognized two ways to gauge "support" for Planned Parenthood. Polls in 2015 inquired into U.S. attitudes about ending federal aid to the group and about general feelings about the group which, we’ve noted, provides family planning and other women’s health services, including abortions. Planned Parenthood, asked for the factual backup to Richards’ statement, pointed us to several surveys showing support for the group itself and support for its funding as well as opposition to shutting down the government rather than continuing its aid. An Oct. 14, 2015, PolitiFact Wisconsin fact-check found True this September 2015 claim by Wisconsin Democrat Gwen Moore: "60 percent of all Americans do not want to see Planned Parenthood defunded." Three September 2015 surveys--similarly cited by Planned Parenthood when we made our recent inquiry--seemed to back Moore’s claim: • A NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of adults asked: "Would you favor or oppose totally eliminating federal funding to Planned Parenthood for family planning and preventative health services?" Sixty-one percent of respondents opposed eliminating federal funding to Planned Parenthood. • A USA Today/Suffolk University poll of likely voters asked: "Do you think all federal funding for Planned Parenthood should be cut off: yes or no?" Sixty-five percent said no. A similar poll conducted in December 2015 saw that number down slightly at 58 percent. • A Pew Research Center poll tied Planned Parenthood funding to a possible government shutdown in its question but got a similar result: 60 percent of adults said any federal budget agreement to avert a government shutdown would have to maintain funding for Planned Parenthood. Another survey, however, did find support for eliminating Planned Parenthood’s funding. Released Dec. 2, 2015, the poll from the Robert Morris University Polling Institute found that 53.3 percent of respondents supported defunding Planned Parenthood, and 31.5 percent opposed it. The RMU polling institute speculated in its news release that the starkly different response stemmed from the wording used in the polling question. The RMU poll asked respondents: "Congressional Republicans favor shifting Planned Parenthood federal funds to community clinics that perform the same services, but do not perform abortions. Would you say you support or oppose this plan?" Other polls generally asked a version of the question, "Do you think all federal funding to Planned Parenthood should be cut off?" without mentioning clinics, services, or abortions. The RMU poll stood alone in finding support for defunding Planned Parenthood. Support for Planned Parenthood Survey questions asking directly about support for Planned Parenthood in itself — rather than its government backing — had positive responses, at lower numbers than the 60 percent mark. These polls all asked a version of the simple question, "Is your opinion of Planned Parenthood favorable or unfavorable?" An Oct. 6, 2015, poll by Rasmussen Reports, which Planned Parenthood also shared with us, found that 53 percent of likely voters had a favorable opinion of Planned Parenthood, with a margin of error of 3 percent. A Bloomberg National Poll in November 2015 got 50 percent favorability for the organization, with the same margin of error. A Sept. 28, 2015, poll from Quinnipiac University delivered lower numbers: it found that 44 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of Planned Parenthood, compared with 39 percent unfavorable, with a 2.5 percent margin of error. The lowest favorability ratings came from a September 2015 CBS News/New York Times poll, which found 40 percent in favor and 27 percent not in favor. Thirty-one percent in that poll said they did not know enough to answer the question. By email, Planned Parenthood media relations assistant Claire Barnes pointed to an Aug. 5, 2015, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll that put Planned Parenthood’s favorability ratings in context. The poll found Planned Parenthood’s 45 percent favorability rating was higher than favorability ratings for the NRA, the Supreme Court, Bernie Sanders, President Barack Obama and several Republican presidential candidates included in the survey. Our ruling Richards said that more than 60 percent of people in America support Planned Parenthood, and only 11 percent approve of Congress. Richards had a bead on Congress, which was wallowing in 11-percent approval territory in November 2015. In addition, most polls suggested more than 60 percent of Americans opposed the federal defunding of Planned Parenthood. Still, there’s clarification missing. While more people look favorably on Planned Parenthood than not, polls indicated, that was the opinion of 40 percent to 53 percent of Americans--not more than 60 percent.

pomt-00960	Says Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has an "immigrant family background."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/17/laura-ingraham/ingraham-says-sotomayor-comes-immigrant-family/	A note to our readers: A reader recently asked us to look into comments made by conservative talk show radio host Laura Ingraham about Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. The reader heard that Ingraham said Sotomayor must choose between her "immigrant family background" or the U.S. Constitution she is sworn to protect and uphold. We decided the claim was worth looking into and found the clip, but after publishing our fact-check, we noticed that Ingraham's original claim was made in February 2014, not February 2015. It's not normal procedure to fact-check a claim a year old. Yet in this case, Ingraham's claim has as many flaws now as it did then -- namely because Sotomayor's family is Puerto Rican and not an immigrant family in the traditional sense. We have corrected the fact-check with the accurate dates. *** Puerto Ricans occupy an unusual legal space in America and conservative radio talker Laura Ingraham stumbled in discussing their status. Ingraham was inveighing against Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who told an audience she shunned the term "illegal aliens" because it "does seem insulting." That got Ingraham fired up. "Her duty is to defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and that’s what she says?" Ingraham said during a Feb. 4, 2014, broadcast of her radio show. "Why do we have a Supreme Court Justice whose allegiance obviously goes to her immigrant family background, not the U.S. Constitution?" A reader asked us to check whether Sotomayor comes from a family of immigrants. We reached out to Ingraham through her producer and did not hear back. Legally speaking, Ingraham’s characterization is inaccurate. Sotomayor’s parents moved to New York City from Puerto Rico during World War II. Puerto Ricans are American citizens, and have been since 1917 when President Woodrow Wilson signed the Jones-Shafroth Act. Puerto Rico became a U.S.-held territory after the 1898 Spanish-American War. The Jones Act granted the island a certain amount of autonomy and carved out a legal patchwork quilt for its residents. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens who have no vote in Congress, don’t pay federal income taxes on money earned in Puerto Rico and can’t vote in general elections for president. But they can vote in party primaries. Puerto Rico is neither a state nor a country. But specific to Ingraham’s focus on illegal immigration, the key point is that as citizens Puerto Ricans can move anywhere they wish in the United States. "Whether people move from California to Texas, or from Puerto Rico to Florida, it’s the same thing," said Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of Hispanic research at the Pew Research Center. Lopez said the Pew Center and the U.S. Census use the term migrants when talking about people who move from Puerto Rico. "The word ‘immigrant’ is inappropriate because they are citizens at birth," Lopez said. On the other hand, the distinction between migrant and immigrant can get cloudy. Jose Cruz, a political scientist at the State University of New York at Albany, studied how Puerto Ricans worked their way into New York City politics in the 1960s. In an article, Cruz wrote how Puerto Ricans can appear different when seen through a legal lens or a sociological one. "De jure, Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico are not immigrants but de facto they are," Cruz wrote. "Not only do most of them look foreign but they are clearly foreign by nationality, ethnicity, culture, and language." Under the second approach, Sotomayor’s parents would carry with them the qualities of many immigrants. Lopez at Pew also said that if he and his colleagues are studying matters of assimilation, they sometimes consider Puerto Ricans under the same umbrella as actual immigrants. The confusion between social and legal perspectives can creep into the popular press. When the New York Times reviewed Sotomayor’s book My Beloved World, it referred to "the corner of Puerto Rican immigrant New York where she was raised." However, the instances when Puerto Ricans are thought of as immigrants is only in a sociological, not a legal sense. They are citizens and, whatever limits they face while they live in Puerto Rico, all it takes is a move to any state and they immediately enjoy all the rights of full citizenship, including the right to vote for president and write checks to the IRS. Our ruling Ingraham spoke of Sotomayor’s "immigrant family background." Importantly, Ingraham said this in the context of enforcing American immigration laws. Legally, Sotomayor comes from a family that was always American. Her parents did not immigrate to New York. They moved there, just as Americans have moved around the country for centuries. However, we did find that in terms of language and culture, there are times when Puerto Ricans share some characteristics with immigrants, and this can muddy the waters. Researchers sometimes treat Puerto Ricans as immigrants for sociological reasons. Ingraham’s topic was strictly legal, but the element of social identity could have played a role in her meaning. Her statement is largely inaccurate but might contain a smattering of truth. We rate her claim Mostly False.	None	Laura Ingraham	None	None	None	2015-02-17T13:06:29	2014-02-04	['None']

pomt-07245	"Abraham Lincoln (once) jumped out of a window in the Illinois Legislature in order to deny a quorum."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/30/mark-miller/wisconsin-senate-minority-leader-mark-miller-says-/	Mark Miller, the Wisconsin Senate minority leader, thinks Democratic state senators who fled to Illinois to block a vote on collective-bargaining limits were on the right side of history. And he’s citing Abraham Lincoln as proof. In a Journal Sentinel interview on May 18, 2011, the Monona Democrat who led the walkout repeated an anecdote that has been making the rounds for months in various media accounts of the battle over Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s move to curtail collective bargaining. "When we were in Illinois, we learned that Abraham Lincoln had jumped out of a window in the Illinois Legislature in order to deny a quorum," Miller said. "So we felt like in that case we were definitely in good company." Trying to deny a quorum -- that does sound familiar. But is that fact or just a Lincoln legend? Some of the details we heard caused us to wonder. Many accounts, even in some well-regarded Lincoln biographies, claim Lincoln jumped from the second story. Now, we are well aware of the lanky Lincoln’s length, but, really, wouldn’t injury have been the result of such a leap? No injury was reported. And many accounts refer to Lincoln jumping from the state Capitol building that day, Dec. 5, 1840. But historians note the new Capitol would not open until days later. So what’s the truth? We found numerous book and newspaper references to Lincoln’s desperate attempt to block a vote on a banking bill, including an account in Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer David Herbert Donald’s "Lincoln" (1995). Lincoln, an advocate of a strong central banking system, was trying to save the state bank of Illinois. Donald called it a "second story" job at the Capitol building. Lincoln himself later made a brief speech about his "jumping scrape" when the Legislature reconvened in January 1841, historians say, citing legislative documents. We located the Illinois State Register’s account of that day in the Legislature. The Springfield newspaper’s correspondent said Lincoln "unceremoniously raised a window" and jumped through. His account ran on Dec. 11, 1840 -- less than a week after the incident itself. So, we found no real dispute on the outline of what happened. But let’s settle some details. We turned to the co-author of one of the books Donald, who died in 2009, cited for his account: Wayne Temple, chief deputy director of the Illinois State Archives in Springfield. Temple’s book is, "Illinois’ Fifth Capitol: the House That Lincoln Built and Caused to Be Rebuilt." Temple has personally sifted through the newspaper accounts and legislative minutes from the 1840 session. It happened, Temple told us. "That’s the story, and I’ve done it from primary sources." The episode actually took place at a church serving as temporary legislative chambers, he said. The new capitol building wouldn’t open for the Illinois House until two days later. How does Temple know? "I have records to show which church got paid," he said. Tour guides at the Capitol sometimes have wrongly told visitors that Lincoln jumped from there, Temple said. "If he had jumped out of there he would have killed himself," he said. His "escape," Temple said, was from the first floor, not the second. Lincoln and his Whig Party colleagues had already been tallied as present and voting before they opened the window and jumped out, numerous accounts show. So Lincoln may have been trying to block a quorum, but he failed. "It was for naught!" Temple said. In Donald’s account, the Whigs were absent for many hours, leaving Lincoln and a few lieutenants behind to watch the proceedings. But they made a procedural blunder, necessitating their quick exit. Democrats ridiculed Lincoln and his "flying brethren," Donald wrote, noting that "his celebrated leap caused him no harm because his legs reached nearly from the window to the ground." The senators in the "Wisconsin 14" ultimately failed to stop a vote, too, but they stayed away for 22 days, allowing massive protests to develop in Madison. "Lincoln didn’t leave the state -- he didn’t even leave the square," Temple told us. "The sergeant of arms could have gotten him by the nape of the neck and dragged him back." Wisconsin has seen its share of quorum-escaping moves over the years, according to a colorful historical account in the Wisconsin State Journal. One episode, the paper reported, involved state Rep. Ruth Doyle, mother of former Gov. Jim Doyle, refusing to leave the "ladies powder room" where she fled to avoid voting on a resolution asking Gen. Douglas MacArthur to address the state Legislature about the "appeasement of Communists in our own nation and the world." Let’s bring this back to the present. In the summer of 2011, recall elections for state senators will help write history’s view of the tumultuous battle over collective bargaining rights in Wisconsin. It’s premature to predict the outcome now. But let history record that media accounts in 2011 properly recorded that Abe Lincoln and the Whigs did try to block a quorum in 1840 by staying away. And the future president did leave through a window. It was a botched attempt, and therefore is a poor comparison to the Wisconsin episode in February 2011. But Miller heard it right. Honest Abe, and a True.	None	Mark Miller	None	None	None	2011-05-30T09:00:00	2011-05-18	['Illinois', 'Abraham_Lincoln']
pomt-14746	Says carpet bombing means bombing "not a city, but the location of the troops," with "embedded special forces to direct the air power."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/16/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-misfires-definition-carpet-bombing-gop-de/	In the wake of the apparently ISIS-inspired terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Republican presidential candidates have sparred over how best to take on the terrorist group. In early December, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, began saying that his military approach to ISIS would be "carpet bombing." He said during a speech in Iowa on Dec. 5 that "we will utterly destroy ISIS. We will carpet bomb them into oblivion. I don't know if sand can glow in the dark, but we're going to find out." Critics, including other Republican presidential candidates, blasted Cruz. On Meet the Press, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said that Cruz "talks tough on some of these issues. For example, he was going to carpet-bomb ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it." Hillary Clinton, speaking at the University of Minnesota, also blasted Cruz: "Shallow slogans don't add up to a strategy. Promising to carpet bomb until the desert glows doesn't make you sound strong -- it makes you sound like you're in over your head." Then, during the CNN-sponsored debate in Las Vegas, moderator Wolf Blitzer tried to pin Cruz down on his "carpet bombing" proposal. "To be clear, Sen. Cruz, would you carpet-bomb Raqqa, the ISIS capital, where there are a lot of civilians? Yes or no?" Cruz responded, "You would carpet bomb where ISIS is -- not a city, but the location of the troops. You use air power directed -- and you have embedded special forces to direction the air power. But the object isn't to level a city. The object is to kill the ISIS terrorists." But there’s a problem: What Cruz described isn’t carpet bombing. What he described is actually the opposite of carpet bombing. What is ‘carpet bombing’? We’ll start by noting that the term "carpet bombing" is an informal one -- "a non-military euphemism," said retired Maj. Gen. Robert Scales, a former commandant of the Army War College. Still, it has a generally understood definition, experts say. The defining characteristic of carpet bombing is that it’s indiscriminate -- not targeted. " ‘Carpet bombing’ typically refers to bombing a defined area without discriminating between targets," said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. Ted Bromund, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, concurred. "It implies the use of mass, conventional air-strikes not directed against specific targets, delivered with sufficient intensity to completely cover -- 'carpet’ -- an area," he said. The first use of the term dates to around World War II, the first global conflict in which air power had advanced to the point where massive, indiscriminate bombing was feasible. Military historians differ on which previous military actions by the United States qualify as carpet bombing, but a number of historical examples may fit the bill. In World War II, Allied strikes during and following the invasion of Normandy killed an estimated 40,000 French civilians. Later in the war, a three-day, joint U.S.-British attack on Dresden, Germany, stirred up monumental fires that killed more than 125,000 people. And in Tokyo, a March 1945 attack by 250 planes, each carrying six tons of incendiary bombs, burned almost 16 square miles and killed more than 80,000 people. Other examples from the Korean War and the Vietnam War are sometimes cited. Given the downsides of carpet bombing -- especially large civilian casualties, which don’t reflect well on the bombing nation in a media-interconnected world -- it’s not a military tactic used often today. For one thing, it’s arguably outlawed by the 1977 Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions. But the more important factor is that today’s precision-guided "smart" bombs and delivery systems provide better targeting without any loss in explosive power. The World War II examples of indiscriminate attacks were undertaken "because more precise bombing was not possible," said John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org. "The U.S. tried precision daylight bombing where they tried to hit individual factories, but they were too vulnerable to enemy fighters and anti-aircraft artillery, so they joined the Royal Air Force in burning down German cities at night." By contrast, today, "we can do more damage with a single strike than we could with hundreds of aircraft in World War II," Janda said. "The only advantage might be psychological. But again, while scaring millions may have an emotional appeal, it also risks alienating millions and making more enemies for ourselves. There’s also the argument that we’re supposed to be the good guys." So when Cruz describes bombing troops specifically rather than cities, and potentially using "embedded special forces" to select discrete targets, he’s not talking about carpet bombing -- he’s "describing what we are already doing," Janda said. "Now, he might launch more airstrikes, and if ISIS suddenly gathered 10,000 guys out in the open, I suppose you could forget targeting and just bomb everything in that area. But they aren’t going to do that." Cruz’s use of the phrase "carpet bombing" is designed "to get a reaction from people," Janda said. "He’s not using it literally or correctly." Our ruling Cruz defined his desired approach for fighting ISIS -- "carpet bombing" -- as bombing "not a city, but the location of the troops," with "embedded special forces to direct the air power." Since the defining characteristic of carpet bombing is the dropping of bombs indiscriminately, Cruz’s definition is essentially the opposite of carpet bombing. We rate his claim False. CORRECTION, Dec. 18, 2015: This story has been updated to correct the description of a March 1945 attack on Tokyo. The attack involved six tons of incendiary bombs for each of the 250 planes involved, not a total of six tons of bombs.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2015-12-16T13:52:53	2015-12-15	['None']

pomt-12444	"This Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/12/donald-trump/trump-calls-trump-russia-story-made-/	In his interview with NBC News anchor Lester Holt, President Donald Trump dismissed the very idea that there was any tie between his presidential bid and the Russians. "This Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story," Trump said May 11. "It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won." Made-up? By Democrats? With multiple investigations under way, we don’t know whether there was collusion between members of the Trump team and Russian interference in the election. But that isn’t the question. The question is whether Democrats plucked the idea out of thin air. A few highlights from the past year say otherwise. First, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report expressing with "high confidence" that the Russian government put its thumb on the scale in favor of Trump. "We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election," the Jan. 7, 2017 report said. "Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary (Hillary) Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump." In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, then-FBI Director James Comey confirmed that his agency was investigating Russian efforts to interfere with the election. "That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts," Comey said March 20, 2017. Comey added that the investigation began in late July 2016. Asked what evidence it took to launch this sort of investigation, Comey answered, "A credible allegation of wrongdoing or reasonable basis to believe that an American may be acting as an agent of a foreign power." Let us pause here to note that these points alone rebut Trump’s description of this story. The investigation began with the FBI, not the Democrats. It started in July 2016, a full three months before the election. It was not invented, but was based on evidence serious and credible enough to launch an investigation. We can go further. Both the House and Senate intelligence committees are investigating, and Republicans control both chambers. Democrats don’t set the agenda. Steven Aftergood with the Federation of American Scientists, a group that advocates for more transparency in government, said the fact of a Trump campaign-Russia connection is well established. "It is supported by statements from Trump family members and associates, who have described financial relationships with Russian sources," Aftergood said. "The only question is whether the various Trump-Russia connections violated any laws. That is what the FBI and Congress are trying to determine." Lastly, former director of national intelligence James Clapper was asked in a May 12 MSNBC interview if he thought that the investigation was a witch hunt. "I don’t believe it is," Clapper answered. Our ruling Trump said, "This Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won." The record shows that credible evidence led the FBI to begin investigating possible ties between the Trump team and Russia in July 2016. That is the start of the story, more than three months before the election. The American intelligence community expressed with confidence that Russia aimed to interfere in the election to harm Clinton and help Trump. Democrats did not create the story, nor do they control the agenda of the House and Senate committees which are conducting their own investigations. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-00750	"American families work hard to earn $4,250 a month. Obama is spending $18,972 a month on each illegal immigrant child."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/17/america/meme-compares-spending-undocumented-immigrants-typ/	Is President Barack Obama lavishing almost five times as much money on undocumented immigrant children than the typical household earns in a month? A meme making the rounds on social media says that’s the case. The meme, forwarded to us by a reader, was created by ForAmerica, a conservative group founded by longtime activist L. Brent Bozell III. The meme says: "American families work hard to earn $4,250 a month. Obama is spending $18,972 a month on each illegal immigrant child. Like if you're sick of Obama rewarding illegal immigrants." The visual that accompanies this text contrasts an "American family" looking sadly at a small pile of dollars, while Obama grins at a much larger pile. By April 17, 2015, the meme had attracted more than 90,000 likes and had been shared more than 25,000 times. Taken literally, that would mean that the government is giving every undocumented immigrant child $228,000 every year, which would seem to be a ridiculously large amount. It would also mean a total cost of $228 billion when applied to the estimated 1 million unauthorized immigrant children in the United States. Such figures made us skeptical. We had previously reported that all direct federal spending on minors totaled roughly $300 billion -- for the benefit of all 75 million or so Americans under 19. So we decided to take a closer look. Looking at the data We reached out to a public-relations firm representing ForAmerica, and they provided us with the data to back up their claim. The $18,972-a-month figure comes from what it cost the federal government to address a surge of tens of thousands of children from Central America for four months in 2014. This is an important piece of context that the meme doesn’t make clear. We’ll get to several problems with the meme’s dollar comparisons in a moment, but first, we’ll briefly summarize what the numbers refer to. The figures were reported in a Sept. 9, 2014, Department of Health and Human Services response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the conservative investigative group Judicial Watch. The documents detail the contracts between the federal government and a group called Baptist Child and Family Services to take care of the children who showed up on the border. The group agreed to provide 1,200 beds at each of two sites -- the former Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas (for $77.9 million) and Fort Sill, in Oklahoma (for $104.2 million). The grand total of $182.1 million covered housing, medical care, and educational and recreational activities, including staff pay and benefits, food, clothing, utilities and linens, for four months, from May to September 2014. In putting together its meme, ForAmerica divided $182.1 million by four months to get the cost per month, then divided by 2,400 to get the monthly cost per child being cared for. That’s how the group arrived at the $18,972 figure cited in the meme. Meanwhile, the family income figure is on target. As we noted in a recent fact-check, the median family income in 2013 was $51,939, which works out to $4,328 a month -- not far off from what the meme said. What’s missing from the comparison So the meme’s numbers have a basis in fact. Where the meme is more problematic is in its comparison of the two. The most reasonable argument for making this comparison is simply to provide a context for understanding how much money was being spent to care for the unexpected influx of unaccompanied minors. We think most readers will agree that spending $18,972 to house and feed a child for a month is a significant sum, and one way to explain how big that is would be to compare it to what a typical family earns per month. But the meme’s text and visuals go well beyond that. For instance: • The meme fails to make clear that these expenditures are for a specific and limited subset of undocumented children. The meme says the government is spending $18,972 a month on "each illegal immigrant child." Yet it doesn’t clarify that this money is being spent only on children who were being housed at those facilities -- who represent a small fraction of the roughly 1 million undocumented immigrant children in the United States. Not including that qualifier is significantly misleading. • The framing and imagery of the meme could lead readers to believe that Obama is paying undocumented immigrants directly. The dollar figures cited are not equivalent, even though both are punctuated visually by piles of dollar bills. The figure for families refers to the dollars they earn and can spend as they wish, but the figure for undocumented immigrants refers to the money paid to a contractor on their behalf. It’s not money the individual immigrant can pocket. • The meme implies that this high rate of spending is ongoing. The meme says that "Obama is spending" that amount -- present tense. But the data covers a specific period that ended in September 2014, and it’s unclear how much the government is spending for that purpose now. (We have asked HHS for that information and will update this item if we receive it.) Our ruling The meme said that "American families work hard to earn $4,250 a month. Obama is spending $18,972 a month on each illegal immigrant child." The numbers cited by the meme are rooted in reality, but the comparison is framed in a misleading way. The sum of money cited has been allotted to a small fraction of all undocumented immigrant children in the United States, and it isn’t going into their pockets as family earnings are. It’s also unclear whether this high rate of spending has continued to today. The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-12343	"How many federal rulings have NOW found intentional discrimination by #Txlege since 2011? 6."	true	/texas/statements/2017/jun/14/rafael-anchia/rafael-anchia-six-times-2011-federal-rulings-found/	After federal judges in April 2017 ruled that Texas Republicans had intentionally diluted minority voting strength when they redrew U.S. and Texas House districts, a Democratic legislator said it wasn't the first time — or even the fifth. Rep. Rafael Anchia of Dallas, who chairs the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, posted a tweet saying: "How many federal rulings have NOW found intentional discrimination by #Txlege since 2011? 6." Six rulings? We wondered. Specific rulings When we inquired, Jaclyn Uresti, executive director of MALC, emailed us a list that added up to six decisions, all of which we confirmed from news accounts and court rulings: August 28, 2012: In a case brought by the U.S. Justice Department three federal judges ruled that the Republican-led state had "not met its burden to show that the U.S. Congressional and State House Plans will not have a retrogressive effect, and that the U.S. Congressional and State Senate Plans were not enacted with discriminatory purpose." In rejecting the argument from state attorneys, the court said the maps had "the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group" in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The opinion came from U.S. District Judges Rosemary Collyer and Beryl Howell, and Circuit Judge Thomas Griffith. August 30, 2012: In a unanimous ruling, three judges in Washington, D.C., issued the first of what were to become several decisions that blocked the state’s photo ID law, which requires Texans to present a state-issued photo ID before casting a ballot at the polls, though as of August 2016 in accord with a federal court ruling a voter could vote after providing another form of ID, such as a utility bill, after signing an affidavit explaining why they were unable to obtain one of the IDs allowed under the law. "A law that forces poorer citizens to choose between their wages and their franchise unquestionably denies or abridges their right to vote," the opinion said, adding that the law was intentionally discriminatory. "Simply put, many Hispanics and African Americans who voted in the last election will, because of the burdens imposed by (the law), likely be unable to vote in the next election." The panel included Judges David S. Tatel, Rosemary Mayers Collyer and Robert Leon Wilkins, who serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. (In January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up a request from Texas officials to reinstate the voter ID law, but the court said it might consider the case at a later date.) October 9, 2014: In a case brought by U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth, U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi ruled the voter ID law violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by disproportionately and intentionally burdening African American and Latino voters. She blocked the law from going into effect and said it amounted to an unconstitutional poll tax. March 10, 2017: A three-judge panel ruled, in a case brought by Shannon Perez, a Latina Democratic Bexar County voter represented by pro-Democratic attorneys Rick Gray and David Richards of Austin, that Republican lawmakers in 2011 drew three of the state’s 36 congressional districts in a way that discriminated against Latino voters. Districts 23 and 27, both represented by Republicans, and District 35, were held by a Democrat. The court found fault in the district lines in their current forms, but did not order legislators to redraw them. This ruling brought a 2-1 split on the court. U.S. District Judges Orlando Garcia and Xavier Rodriguez ruled in favor, District Judge David Smith dissented. April 10, 2017: Judge Ramos of Corpus Christi -- reviewing Veasey’s voter ID case at the direction of U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5h Circuit -- found that the 2011 Legislature intentionally discriminated against minority voters by advancing the mandate that each voter present a photo ID if casting a ballot at the polls. Most recently, the 2017 Legislature revised the voter ID law, in an attempt to alleviate Ramos’s concerns that the list of acceptable IDs was too strict, but Democrats argued the reforms were not nearly far-reaching enough. Ramos was expected to issue an updated ruling, taking into account the adopted changes, later in 2017. April 20, 2017: The pair of federal judges who ruled against Texas in March 2017 decided, in a new case brought by Democrats, that Republican lawmakers in 2011 redrew Texas House districts with the intention of diluting the electoral strength of minority voters in several parts of the state. "The impact of the plan was certainly to reduce minority voting opportunity statewide, resulting in even less proportional representation for minority voters," according to the court’s 2-1 opinion, with Smith dissenting. "Discussions among map drawers demonstrated a hostility to creating any new minority districts, as those were seen to be a loss of Republican seats, despite the massive minority population growth statewide." The cited rulings looked to us like six instances of federal judges all finding intentional discrimination by the 2011 Legislature. Potential fallout That finding, if it sticks, could have significant consequences (though it’s also worth keeping in mind that after the 2020 U.S. census, the 2021 Legislature will be expected to redraw districts afresh based on changes in the state’s population since 2010). To our inquiry, Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and former civil rights attorney in the Department of Justice under President Obama, said as little as a single judicial finding of intentional discrimination by Texas lawmakers could fuel a court to reimpose a previous decades-long requirement that any changes in state election law be submitted to the Justice Department or a federal court before taking effect. That "preclearance" hurdle went away for Texas and other jurisdictions, mostly southern states, when the Supreme Court in 2012 found unconstitutional a provision in the Voting Rights Act specifying when a state or local government must face preclearance. Levitt said of Anchia’s claim: "If you include intentional discrimination, there’s no question the number is six. Six is a giant number when it comes to this. A court only needs one example to suffice, so five or six is a lot." Our ruling Anchia said that six times since 2011, federal rulings found intentional discrimination by the Texas Legislature. We confirmed six such rulings from August 2012 through April 2017 issued by federal judges regarding Republican-drawn U.S. House and Texas House districts or the GOP-driven law requiring voters to present photo identification at the polls. We rate the claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-06924	Says that U.S. Rep. Allen West is "a constituent of mine."	true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/21/debbie-wasserman-schultz/latest-west-wasserman-schultz-feud-she-says-he-liv/	Most of the she-said, he-said, back-and-forth between South Florida Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Allen West has been good for political theater but bad for fact-checkers. If you missed it, Wasserman Schultz -- a Democrat -- criticized West -- a Republican -- this week over his support for a plan to sharply reduce federal spending and require a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. In a speech Tuesday on the floor of the U.S. House, Wasserman Schultz said the West-backed GOP plan would raise costs for Medicare beneficiaries, and that it was "unbelievable" for West to support it because he represents so many South Florida seniors. West responded via e-mail. "Look Debbie ... you want a personal fight, I am happy to oblige. You are the most vile, unprofessional, and despicable member of the U.S. House of Representatives. If you have something to say to me, stop being a coward and say it to my face, otherwise, shut the heck up." See? Not a lot to check in either statement. But as the debate ballooned into cable news drama Wednesday and Thursday, Wasserman Schultz provided an interview -- and a sound bite -- to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that had us scratching our heads. Wasserman Schultz said she is West's elected representative to the House. "He's a constituent of mine, and so I was dutifully doing my job and representing my constituents and taking to task someone who I think is really taking the wrong position when it comes to the people we represent in South Florida who badly need that safety net and make sure that we're not going to dramatically increase their costs, which that cut, cap and balance plan does," she said. Blitzer stopped for a moment. "So you're saying he lives in your district, he doesn't live in his own district?" "Yes," Wasserman Schultz continued, "Congressman West is a constituent of the 20th Congressional District, but represents the 22nd." To win a seat on the city council, you have to live in that city when you take office. To win a seat in the state House, or the state Senate, you also have to live in the district you represent. The obvious question is why would it work differently for Congress? The U.S. Constitution, that's why. The requirements for U.S. House members are spelled out in Article I, Section 2: "No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen." We're not sure why the framers loved all the negatives, but in other words: U.S. House members need only live in the state they represent to be eligible for their seat. "Remember back in 1789, things weren't like they are today," said lawyer Mark Herron, an elections expert based in Tallahassee. "A state was a state. It was just a reflection of the times, and they tried to keep it as simple as possible." In fact, the Roanoke Times recently identified a handful of House members who lived outside their districts, including Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz, California Democrat John Garamendi and Georgia Democrat David Scott. And West does, too, it turns out. West moved to Florida with his wife, Angela, and two daughters in 2004 after retiring from the Army. The former colonel lives in a four-bedroom, two-bathroom $200,000 home in the city of Plantation, Broward County property records show. His zip code, when punched into the U.S. House of Representatives website, and his address, when entered into the St. Petersburg Times' MyLawmaker database, both show his home falling in Florida's 20th Congressional District, represented by Wasserman Schultz. West has owned up to this before. Amid questions over residency requirements for several South Florida lawmakers in 2008, West correctly cited federal law to the Palm Beach Post and explained, "I'm a distance runner, and I even do my 5 to 10 miles mostly in District 22. "The U.S. Constitution says only that a person must live in the state in which he is running for Congress," said West, then a challenger to former Rep. Ron Klein. "But I'm not trying to hide where I live. Yes, I live just outside the district. Part of Plantation is in District 22 and the other part in District 20. The dividing line is University Drive and I live about a mile from there." "They redistrict every 10 years anyway and what are you supposed to do, move all the time?" West said. We won't answer that. But on the matter at hand, Wasserman Schultz is correct that she can count West as a constituent. And it's okay, according to the U.S. Constitution. We rate this claim True.

pomt-06923	"The firefighter and police officer pension system is not headed for bankruptcy, far from it. That’s because New Jersey first responders -- fire fighters and police officers -- have never missed making payments to the retirement system."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/22/dominick-marino/official-says-new-jersey-police-fire-pension-syste/	After years of controversy about the state of New Jersey’s pension systems, some good news about the status of their solvency might be welcome. Dominick Marino, president of the Professional Firefighters Association of New Jersey, believes he has that news for at least one pension fund. "The firefighter and police officer pension system is not headed for bankruptcy, far from it," Marino said in a June 6 column posted on PolitickerNJ.com. "That’s because New Jersey first responders -- fire fighters and police officers -- have never missed making payments to the retirement system." Hardly a day goes by in New Jersey without someone criticizing the supposed failing status of the state’s pension systems, so PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check Marino’s claim. We found its accuracy depends a lot on how bankruptcy is defined. First, let’s look at how pension systems work for New Jersey police and firefighters. New Jersey has several pension funds: a joint retirement system for police and firefighters, and one each for state police, teachers and the judiciary. All other state employees fall under the Public Employees Retirement System. The state and municipalities are each required to make contributions to the police and firefighter fund, but in recent years municipalities have done a better job of making their contributions. For example, as of June 30, 2010 – the most recent date that the funds were certified by accountants, the police and firefighters pension was at 71 percent funding, or $19.8 billion, said Andrew Pratt, a spokesman for the state’s Treasury Department. Pensions ideally should be fully funded, which means the pension has 100 percent of its required funds. Roughly, half the fund is financed by employee contributions, which come automatically from payroll deductions and the other half by employers, Pratt said. As of June 30, 2010, the teachers pension was funded at 63.9 percent or $25.9 billion; the state police pension was 73 percent funded, or $1.7 bllion; and the judiciary pension is at 59.7 percent funded, or $265 million. Police and firefighters had been paying 8.5 percent of every paycheck toward their pensions, and that climbed to 10 percent effective July 1 with the historic pension reforms signed into law by Gov. Chris Christie. Next, let’s define what bankruptcy means in terms of pension funding. Bankruptcy is not when a fund reaches zero, Pratt said. It’s when taxpayers can no longer afford to keep the system maintained as designed, because bankruptcy will become inevitable, he said. For now, Pratt said the police/firefighters fund is 70.8 percent funded. Marino put the figure at 72 percent. The pension is nearly three-fourths funded, but is it enough to escape bankruptcy or to be considered dangerously underfunded? "In the pension world, that’s a pretty good place to be, 75 to 80 percent is good," Marino said. Pratt agreed – to a point. "It is more important to say that from the standard of pension funds, 70-percent funded is an inadequate number," Pratt told PolitiFact New Jersey. "The law has determined that 80 percent is the minimum level actuaries would say the fund is solvent. The target is 80 percent with good reason. It is the long-term solvency of a system that is designed to provide benefits to police officers and firefighters not just over the next two or three years, but for the rest of their lives." An issues brief released in April 2010, "The Funding of State and Local Pensions: 2009-2013" by the Center for State and Local Government Excellence in Washington, DC, looked at the causes and possible solutions to repairing the problems with the nation’s state and local government pensions, and also reviewed 126 government pension funds across the nation -- including New Jersey’s. The level of New Jersey’s police and fire pension funding dropped from 100.8 percent in 2001 to 70.8 percent in 2009, according to the study. The U.S. Government Accountability Office also considers 80 percent an important threshold. While it doesn’t recommend 80 percent as a level of funding adequacy, the GAO considers below 80 percent "potentially worrisome," said Barbara Bovbjerg, managing director of Education, Workforce and Income Security Issues for the GAO. Iris J. Lav, a senior adviser at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, DC said public pensions should aim to be 100 percent funded, but noted that "in a bad economic time, having 80 percent isn’t a crisis. "It is true that an 80 percent funding threshold is considered adequate for public pensions opposed to private pensions," she said. "Cities, counties and states are ongoing institutions. Businesses can go out of business, and the money on hand that day is supposed to be enough to pay the pensions promised." Making changes to deal with lack of contributions and underfunding can improve the situation, according to the findings in the issue brief by the Center for State and Local Government Excellence. New Jersey’s recent pension reforms are one example of those changes. As part of the state’s new reforms, cost-of-living adjustments have been eliminated until the fund reaches a minimum 80 percent funding level. Pratt emphasized that New Jersey’s new pension reforms are projected to significantly bring pension funds above the 80 percent funding threshold. "Without reform, the funds were effectively bankrupt because they didn't contain enough money to pay the future claims of retirees, and without a stock market miracle, they never would have contained enough money to pay future claims," Pratt said. Let’s review. The president of the New Jersey Professional Firefighters Association says the joint police and firefighters retirement fund is far from bankruptcy and in better shape than other funds. While the funding level of that pension is higher than others in the state, several experts state that public pensions funded below a threshold of 80 percent -- the case for the police and firefighters fund, as well as other New Jersey pensions -- could be cause for concern. Bankruptcy might not be on the immediate horizon for the police and firefighters pension fund, but it’s not an impossibility, either. We rate Marino’s claim Half True.

pomt-00716	"It’s estimated that 40 percent of all the guns that are sold in the United States occur with no background records check."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/apr/28/tim-kaine/kaine-says-40-percent-guns-sales-estimated-escape-/	U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine commemorated the eighth anniversary of the Virginia Tech shootings that left 32 dead with a call for stronger gun laws. "It’s estimated that 40 percent of all the guns that are sold in the United States occur with no background records check," Kaine, D-Va., said during an April 16 floor speech. We asked Kaine’s office for the source of the statistic. Sarah Peck, his press secretary, pointed to a 1997 study by the U.S. National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey that asked them how they acquired their weapons. The researchers concluded 60 percent of the guns were bought from federally licensed firearm dealers and therefore subject to background checks. Federal licensed sellers have to conduct background checks before sales, individual private sellers and gift givers do not. The co-authors of the study had released a more detailed report on their gun owners’ survey in 1996, estimating that between 30-40 percent of all guns transactions occurred through an "off-the-books" transfer in which a background check isn’t required. The 40 percent figure has been long offered by gun control advocates as evidence that the nation needs tighter background check laws. But there’s been much debate about the research, conducted by Philip Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, including: The 1994 survey was conducted eight months after the Brady Act went into effect, mandating background checks on individuals seeking to buy firearms from federally licensed dealers. Survey participants were asked about gun their acquisitions going back two years.Some of the participants made gun purchases prior to the Brady Act, when they were not required to undergo federal background checks. Only a small group of gun owners -- 251 people -- answered the survey question about the origin of their weapons. Some of the gun owners weren’t sure how they’d gotten their guns, answering "probably" or "probably not" on whether they got the gun from a licensed firearm dealer. The 40 percent figure included transactions when a firearm was not sold but, for example, inherited or given as a gift. When the Fact Checker at The Washington Post asked Ludwig in 2013 to boil down the 1994 data, the researcher said that between 14 to 22 percent of the guns were purchased without background checks. The survey is almost 21 years old and begs a question: What’s the modern-day percentage of guns sold without a background check? Cook pointed us to an editorial he and Ludwig wrote about the 40 percent statistic for the National Review in the aftermath of the December 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. "We’ve been following the give-and-take with some interest because our research is the original source of that 40-percent statistic," they wrote. "Our views may come as a surprise: First, we don’t know the current percentage -- nor does anyone else." Ludwig and Cook said their national survey had not been replicated. Updated data doesn’t exist, in large part, because federal funding for gun studies dried up two decades ago. President Barack Obama in 2013 signed an executive order to get the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies to reexamine gun violence. The research is in progress. There’s debate among researchers about whether the two-decade old figure on gun purchases without background checks remains reliable. Some, like Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida, say it is. "That 40 percent without a background check is a pretty good estimate," said Corzine, who has researched crime prevention and the role of firearms in violence. "I have no quarrel with it." The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, is less certain. The think tank said in a 2013 report that the figure has "clear limitations" given its age, and the fact that it comes from a survey of a small group of gun owners. "Proponents of universal background checks, including this report’s authors, would be well served by acknowledging the limitations of the statistic," the center wrote. Our ruling Kaine says "it’s estimated that 40 percent of all the guns that are sold in the United States occur with no background records check." His source is a small-sample survey that’s almost 21 years old. It counted some firearms that were purchased before a law went into effect requiring federal background checks for many gun sales. The 1994 survey measured gun transactions, which included firearms that were sold and those that were given as gifts or inheritances. When the results were adjusted to guns sold -- the term Kaine uses -- only 14 to 22 percent of the firearms were sold without background checks. The researchers say they "don’t know" if their findings are relevant today. There’s no updated national study. Kaine did not acknowledge these points. So we rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-09754	Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/07/jay-rockefeller/rockefeller-says-health-insurer-profits-have-risen/	Those who advocate for health care reform have tried to rally the public by portraying insurers as greedy. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va. — a member of the Senate Finance Committee, a key player in the health policy debate — is no exception. Rockefeller recently wrote an opinion piece for the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call in which he said, "Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled." We'll address the first part of this statement in this item; we'll take up the second half in a separate item . On the first part — health insurer profits — Rockefeller took his numbers from a study sponsored by Health Care for America Now, a liberal group that supports Democratic health care reform efforts. Researchers for HCAN looked at financial data submitted by 10 large, publicly held health insurers to the Securities and Exchange Commission covering the years between 2000 and 2008. The 10 companies are Aetna, Amerigroup, Centene, CIGNA, Coventry, Health Net, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, Universal American Group and WellPoint. In the past, we have had problems with the data HCAN has used — we rated one claim on health insurance denials False and another on insurance company CEO compensation Barely True — but their data on health insurer profits look sound. We checked a few of HCAN's numbers by looking at some of the original disclosure forms on the SEC Web site and found no notable discrepancies. Rockefeller's use of the numbers, however, is a different matter. Whether the increase amounts to at least 400 percent depends on which years you choose. The researchers found that the collective profits of these 10 companies rose from $2.41 billion in 2001 to $12.87 billion in 2007 — a 466 percent increase, meaning that, over that period of time, Rockefeller would be right. But using the years 2001 through 2008 instead, the data show that profits rose from $2.41 billion to $8.40 billion — a 249 percent increase. That's still a whopping jump, but it's not as high as Rockefeller indicated. The general dropoff in the economy had a lot to do with the lower profits in 2008, said Alex Lawson, a health care researcher for Campaign for America's Future, a liberal group, who co-authored the HCAN study. Meanwhile, there's another caveat for HCAN's study. The group didn't adjust the profit statistics for corporate takeovers. When big companies absorb smaller ones, the net effect may be to enlarge the profits of the biggest companies (including many of the 10 giants in HCAN's study) even as the total size of the health insurance industry — the broader entity that Rockefeller seemed to be referring to — stays roughly the same. While doing such adjustments would have been logistically difficult, and maybe even impossible, the fact that they weren't done puts limits on how this data can be interpreted. A health industry analyst, Steve Shubitz of Edward Jones, agreed that consolidation is "a very large part of this overall increase" rather than simply higher profits by the remaining 10 companies. "Of course, these companies have increased profits, too, outside of acquisitions, but nowhere near to the extent that's implied by those stats," Shubitz said. Lawson acknowledged that the HCAN chart on profits does not address how much of an impact consolidation has made on profits. But he added that the table actually comes from a study that specifically addressed the harm to competition caused by consolidation, so the group hardly ignored that issue. In addition, he defended the decision to use numbers unadjusted for consolidation. "That's what the market reacts to, and that's what they put in their annual report," Lawson said. The insurance industry, for its part, argues that total health plan profits are less than one penny of the total national health expenditure dollar. "The data is clear that profits are not what is driving rising health care costs," said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the leading health insurance trade group. Let's recap. If you carry the data forward to 2008 — an admittedly somewhat atypical year — the increase falls short of Rockefeller's stated 400 percent. Also, the numbers Rockefeller used reflect 10 of the biggest companies as opposed to "insurance companies" in general. On the other hand, the increase exceeded 400 percent for the period 2001 to 2007, and however you slice the numbers, the rise in insurer profits is large indeed. On balance, we rate Rockefeller's statement Half True.	None	Jay Rockefeller	None	None	None	2009-10-07T16:40:49	2009-09-21	['None']

pomt-04636	The U.S. unemployment rate has remained above 8 percent for 43 consecutive months, the longest stretch since the Great Depression.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/14/phil-gingrey/unemployment-rate-comparable-great-depression-cong/	Many Republicans quickly pounced on the federal government’s latest unemployment data as proof that President Barack Obama should be removed from his current job by voters on Election Day. The August report showed about 96,000 jobs were added across the country that month and the nation’s unemployment rate dropped two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.1 percent. Many economists, though, said the numbers were below projections. Obama said he was dissatisfied with the numbers, but he pointed out that the nation has seen 30 consecutive months of job growth. U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, a Republican from Marietta, had a different observation about the unemployment data and claimed in a Twitter post it was part of a longer sort of streak. "Today's #jobs report marks the 43rd consecutive month unemployment has remained above 8%, longest since the Great Depression," the post read. Gingrey ended the tweet with his conclusion about how the nation has fared since Obama, a Democrat, took office in January 2009. "[N]ot better off," he wrote. There’s been plenty of ink spilled in newspapers and magazines that the nation’s unemployment rate has been above 8 percent for a long time. But we wondered if the congressman was correct to say this is the longest stretch the unemployment rate has been above 8 percent since the Great Depression. First, let’s look at the current unemployment situation. We examined the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate data, which Gingrey, Obama and everyone else use for such comparisons. The numbers are trusted by most economists, although some contend the data doesn’t tell the entire story because, for example, the unemployment rate doesn’t include people who’ve quit looking for a job. In February 2009, Obama’s first full month in office, the unemployment rate rose to 8.3 percent. It had been 7.8 percent the month before. The unemployment rate rose sharply to a high of 10 percent by that October. The unemployment rate was greater than 9 percent the next 16 months. In March 2011, it dropped to 8.9 percent, but rose back above 9 percent the following six months. In October 2011, the rate fell back below 9 percent. Each month since, it has been in the 8 percent range. The last time the U.S. unemployment rate topped the 8 percent mark was during the first term of Republican Ronald Reagan’s presidency. In November 1981, it rose to 8.3 percent and remained over that mark for 27 consecutive months, reaching a high of 10.8 percent in late 1982. The unemployment rate dropped to 7.8 percent in February 1984 and was 5.4 percent when Reagan left the White House in January 1989. Federal government data shows prior to the Reagan administration, you must indeed go back to the Great Depression to find unemployment at such high rates. In 1930, the annual unemployment rate for the United States was 8.7 percent. The annual rate ballooned to nearly 25 percent by 1933. The unemployment rate gradually declined until 1937, when it rose from 14.3 to 19 percent. Some economic historians blame the increase on President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s spending cuts in June 1937. University of Maryland associate history professor David Sicilia noted Roosevelt increased spending soon thereafter. The unemployment rate did not fall back under 8 percent until 1942, when it was 4.7 percent. Pearl Harbor was attacked in December 1941, drawing America completely into World War II and much of the nation’s young men into combat and putting many of its women to work. Sicilia sees some similarities between how the unemployment numbers have trended during the Great Depression and since 2009. He said the nation is more conservative now than it was during the Depression, so there is greater resistance to government spending increases to spur the economy and lower the unemployment rate. As for the accuracy of Gingrey’s claim, Sicilia said, "That’s correct." The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan source of analysis, wrote in February that this was the longest period of unemployment above 8 percent since the Great Depression. The last time the unemployment rate was this high was during Reagan’s first term. However, the 27 months during the 1980s the rate was greater than 8 percent is far less than the 11 years the unemployment rate was that high during the Great Depression.

pomt-09224	"Bill White used D.C. connections from his job in the Clinton administration to form a company that did business in the Middle East and defaulted on a $60 million loan."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/may/16/rick-perry/perry-white-used-dc-connections-form-firm-worked-m/	UPDATE May 21, 2010: Upon our published conclusion that Azerbaijan and Georgia are not in the Middle East, Gov. Rick Perry's campaign noted that the CIA "World Factbook" classifies the nations as in the Middle East. Asked why, CIA spokeswoman Paula Weiss told us that the book takes several factors into account in categorizing countries by region; she did not elaborate. Separately, we did a fresh round of research. The experts we consulted said that there's no standard definition of which nations make up the region but that Azerbaijan and Georgia would not generally be considered part of the Middle East. Bashing Washington helped GOP Gov. Rick Perry take out U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in his party's March primary. Lately, Perry is claiming a Washington taint in Democratic nominee Bill White's background. The narrator of a Perry Web video posted May 3 says: "Bill White used D.C. connections from his job in the Clinton administration to form a company that did business in the Middle East and defaulted on a $60 million loan." Those are several facts worth checking. To avoid a confusing pile-up, let's break Perry's statement into these parts: White's job in D.C., the connections it may have given him, and the international oil and gas company White started to explore in the Caspian Sea region -- not in the Middle East, contrary to what Perry says. To support the video statement, the Perry campaign provided us with news reports from five outlets, including The Houston Chronicle and a magazine, Azerbaijan International. White's DC job White's resume reflects decades spent as a lawyer, businessman and government employee. Most recently, he served for six years as the mayor of Houston. Perry's statement reflects back to the mid-1990s, when White served for about two years as deputy U.S. energy secretary in President Bill Clinton's administration. In his book "The Oil and the Glory: The Pursuit of Empire and Fortune on the Caspian Sea," journalist Steve LeVine calls White one of the Clinton administration's "pioneers of Caspian policy-making" and says he helped "put Caspian oil on Washington's agenda." According to a February 2003 story in the Houston Press, an alternative newspaper: "During his tenure as deputy energy secretary in the mid-'90s, White repeatedly visited the Caspian Sea area, where he met with Azerbaijan President Haidar Aliyev and Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia to discuss energy deals with Western companies." Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White, said that while he was deputy energy secretary, White traveled to the Caspian Sea region about six times, including at least three visits to Azerbaijan and two to Georgia. Denying that his interest in the region was financial, White told the Press then: "I had an interest in the former Soviet Union before I went into government, during government and after government. I thought it was critically important that the United States and the whole West try to teach good models of free enterprise over there." Frontera White left his federal post in August 1995 and the next year helped found Houston-based Frontera Resources, which set its sights on emerging markets like the Caspian Sea. That resource-rich region was the site of an oil rush after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. A May 1997 item in the Houston Press said that "after White left his energy post, he and Lan Bentsen, son of former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, immediately founded Frontera Resources and went into Azerbaijan and the neighboring state of Georgia." Time out for a geography lesson. Those two places -- along with Bolivia, the only countries where Frontera has operated -- are former Soviet republics in the Caucasus, a region just north of the Middle East. Did White use Washington connections from his federal experience to form Frontera, as Perry says? Several published accounts, including a 2003 Houston Chronicle story sent to us by Perry's campaign, characterize the formation of the company that way. Some of those articles note that Lloyd Bentsen, who served as Clinton's Treasury secretary in 1993 and 1994, was an investor in the company; White told us recently that he knew Bentsen before his stint as a federal official. White also said the other co-founders of the company, Bentsen's son, Lan, and Steve Nicandros, who came to Frontera from a job as head of international business development for Conoco, didn't reflect connections he made in Washington. Bacon said White's wife introduced him to Lan Bentsen. We visited with White about the 1997 form filed with the Texas secretary of state's office to form the company and wondered about two other officers listed as vice presidents. He told us that he'd worked with Reginal Spiller and Robert Berls at the Department of Energy. White said he recruited Spiller, a geologist, to the department from Maxus Energy and that Spiller became vice president of exploration and production at Frontera. White said he hired Berls, an expert on the former Soviet Union, to work at the Energy Department on the recommendation of senior officials at the Defense Department. LeVine, the "Oil and Glory" author, told us that it wasn't White's political connections in Washington that were key to the Frontera enterprise, but contacts farther afield. "It's the political connections that he made on the Caspian Sea as a D.C. official that gave him the entree there," said Levine. "He didn't need contacts in Washington. ... He was the contact." LeVine said: "There is no doubt that Bill relied on senior-level contacts as deputy energy secretary to have the entree to obtain the energy acreage that Frontera got in Georgia and in Azerbaijan. You cannot say flatly that none of that would have happened absent him, but having met the presidents of both countries numerous times, you know, that's how business is done." For his part, White called Perry's overall statement "ridiculous." He pointed to his deep background in oil and gas and energy-related fields and said he had "many (employment) alternatives" when he left the Energy Department. He also said the first money invested in the company was his own and noted that Nicandros, the company's current chairman and CEO, had been a leader in the oil and gas industry before coming to Frontera. Still, White acknowledged that his experiences as a federal energy official who traveled to the region had played a role in Frontera's business, saying: "They helped me in making the assessment that these countries would not expropriate the oil and gas concessions." Translation: White's administration experience helped the company assess the political and economic stability of the nations in which Frontera would do business. White was chief executive of Frontera until 1997, when he became president and chief operating officer of the Wedge Group, a private Houston holding company with interests in oil service companies, commercial real estate and hotels, according to a February article in the Austin American-Statesman. White remained chairman of Frontera's board until 2001. He no longer has any role at the company, although his most recent financial disclosure form, filed with the Texas Ethics Commission on Feb. 16, says he holds "10,000 or more" shares of Frontera stock, which trades on the London stock exchange and on the unregulated over-the-counter market in the U.S. A March 31 audit report performed for the company by PriceWaterhouseCoopers says it "has suffered recurring losses from operations and has limited available funds ... which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern." Bacon said White's shares are worth about $11,000. The loan In 1998, Frontera entered into an agreement with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan to develop oil fields there. In 2000, Frontera announced that it would receive $60 million in loans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was created as communism crumbled in 1991 to support private sector growth in central Europe and central Asia. Problems developed in 2001, said Frontera spokeswoman Liz Williamson, when the state oil company halted exports of oil from the project. This led to a dispute between the companies, Williamson said, which "triggered a violation of a loan covenant causing Frontera to default under the terms of certain financing agreements" with the bank, which did not immediately respond to our queries. Williamson said the bank then foreclosed. The following year, Frontera's interest in the Azerbaijan project was sold for $53 million, and the loan was repaid. Frontera continues to operate in Georgia. Summing up: Perry is right that White worked in the Clinton administration and that he later formed a company that defaulted on a $60 million loan. He's off the mark, however, when he says that the company did business in the Middle East. As for whether White used "D.C. connections to form" Frontera, as Perry says, that's true in only the baldest sense. Yes, White worked in Washington when he made key contacts overseas that surely helped him with Frontera. And he recruited two federal underlings to the venture. But Perry's wording leaves an impression of insider Washington wheeler-dealing by White not backed by what we found. We rate Perry's statement as Half True.

pomt-10243	"As governor, I've stood up to ... the big oil companies."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/01/sarah-palin/palin-sought-more-taxes-and-more-development-from-/	In her first speech as Sen. John McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin claimed a credential that might resonate with a nation blanching at the cost of gasoline — a record of taking on Big Oil. "Along with fellow reformers in the great state of Alaska, as governor, I've stood up to the old politics as usual, to the special interests, to the lobbyists, the big oil companies, and the good-old-boy network," Palin said, speaking to a crowd in Dayton, Ohio, after McCain introduced her to the nation on Aug. 29, 2008. "When oil and gas prices went up so dramatically and the state revenues followed with that increase, I sent a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of Alaska. And we are now — we're now embarking on a $40-billion natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence." We've already checked her claim that she sent "a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of Alaska." We ruled it True. So here we'll examine whether she really stood up to the big oil companies, some of the most influential players in Alaska's political scene. Palin was sworn in as governor on Dec. 4, 2006. Over the course of 2007, she fought to raise taxes on oil companies. Alaska gets about 85 percent of its state revenue from oil taxes, and as fuel prices skyrocketed, Palin complained the state wasn't getting its share of the windfall. She successfully pushed for a law that raised taxes on oil profits to 25 percent from 22.5, winning passage in the State Legislature in November 2007. The increase amounted to an estimated $1.6-billion annually more for the state. Oil companies had opposed the increase, with executives saying it would discourage them from investing in the state. BP Alaska president Doug Suttles said after the Legislature passed the increase: "I can only hope that once the impact of this legislation is clear, the administration and the Legislature will revisit the issue." So yes, with respect to taxes, Palin stood up to big oil companies. Palin has also sparred with big oil companies over who gets to build a pipeline to carry natural gas to market from Alaska's North Slope. The fields there have enormous gas reserves, but so far they have remained largely untapped due to the lack of a pipeline. Palin's predecessor, Frank Murkowski, supported a contract between the state and BP, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil to develop the pipeline. Palin opposed that, promising to consider other companies. Indeed, after she was elected she solicited other bids, and ended up supporting a proposal by TransCanada Corp. to build a 1,715-mile pipeline down the Alaska Highway and through Canada. Exxon, ConocoPhillips and BP all criticized Palin's move to give the job to the Calgary-based company. "She has taken an independent position and she has been protective of state sovereignty," said Gerald McBeath, political science professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. So in the pipeline battle as well, Palin took on big oil. Palin also continued efforts Murkowski had launched to take back leases the state had awarded to Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron and ConocoPhillips in the giant Point Thomson oil and gas field. Alaska officials were annoyed that the companies had not developed the field, which would boost state revenue. The companies said the fields posed technical challenges. In that respect as well, Palin stood up to big oil. We should note that Palin has been far friendlier to the oil industry than environmentalists would like to see the governor be. "She's definitely been very supportive of any increased oil and gas development," said Patricia Rolfe, Alaska regional representative of the Sierra Club. "In general, it's business as usual for oil companies in Alaska."

pomt-04869	Bill Nelson’s vote for the Affordable Care Act "cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/aug/09/american-commitment/tv-ad-says-bill-nelson-supported-cutting-medicare-/	An attack ad by a conservative outside spending group blames Sen. Bill Nelson for cutting billions from Medicare by voting for the Affordable Care Act. The ad is getting plenty of airplay, despite PolitiFact repeatedly finding the ad’s claims untrue. (We swear, our feelings aren’t hurt.) So what exactly is wrong with the claim in American Commitment’s commercial this time? In the ad, which is titled "Facts," a narrator intones that "Nelson’s health care vote imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class, cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs, and millions could lose their current coverage." American Commitment told PolitiFact they refused to work with us, citing previous Truth-O-Meter rulings with which they didn’t agree. Nelson’s lawyers in May asked Florida television stations to not air a commercial from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that made similar claims. The stations refused. For this item, we’ll skip the tax increase claim (which we’ve called Pants on Fire) or the loss of coverage (which we’ve called False), but will focus on the $500 billion in cuts. This is a standard conservative talking point after the passage of the president’s health care bill, focusing on a $500 billion reduction in projected spending that is an integral part of the federal health care law. These reductions include the amount of annual increases health care providers would receive from Medicare, administrative changes and alterations to Medicare Advantage. The difference, PolitiFact has repeatedly ruled, is that these don’t represent cuts, but rather an attempt to curtail future Medicare spending. The program is still projected to grow, the Congressional Budget Office predicts, just at a slower rate under the so-called Obamacare guidelines. Those savings, which the commercial says are being taken to fund "other government programs," are alterations to the way health coverage is paid for. One of those ways is to increase the scope of Medicaid. Another is to expand coverage of prevention services. A third is to help cover the Medicare Part D "doughnut hole" for prescription drugs. Nelson was among the 60 votes in favor of the bill on Dec. 24, 2009, providing the cloture needed to prevent the bill from being filibustered. That has drawn the ire of the bill’s opponents and conservative groups like American Commitment, which have charged all 59 Democrats and Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders all cast the "deciding vote" -- yet another claim we’ve ruled False, because several other senators’ votes were much more crucial. The ruling American Commitment claims Bill Nelson voted to slash $500 billion from Medicare to fund other programs. Our previous rulings have shown that there is no vast well of money already allocated that is being cut, and the programs being funded are a part of government health care services, of which Medicare is the largest. Yet again, we rate this claim as Mostly False.	None	American Commitment	None	None	None	2012-08-09T13:59:17	2012-07-05	['None']
pomt-15265	"Obama Makes Huge Move to BAN Social Security Recipients From Owning Guns"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/30/blog-posting/websites-say-obama-policy-change-means-seniors-gun/	After the shooting in Charleston, S.C., that left nine African-American worshippers dead, President Barack Obama made it clear where he directs the blame. "Every country has violent, hateful, or mentally unstable people," Obama said. "What’s different is not every country is awash with easily accessible guns." Though efforts to enact comprehensive gun control legislation through Congress withered amid intense opposition from gun rights supporters, Obama has done what he can to use executive orders to curb access to guns. One potential policy for his administration would have the Social Security Administration share information with the national background check system that is used to conduct background checks of gun purchasers. Adding names from the Social Security list would potentially increase the number of people barred from purchasing a gun. After this possibility emerged, gun-rights advocates reacted quickly and aggressively. "SPREAD THIS: Obama Makes Huge Move to BAN Social Security Recipients From Owning Guns," read the headline in the Conservative Tribune. Breitbart, another conservative website, declared: "Obama’s Secret Plan to Block Seniors on Social Security from Owning Guns." Other websites qualified their message by referring to "some Social Security recipients," and some cited a specific figure -- 4.2 million -- as the number of people that would be unable to own guns. We were curious to see how all these claims stacked up, so we dug into the evidence. The background check system Under existing federal law, several factors can prevent someone from buying a gun. Most of these have to do with law enforcement issues, such as a prior felony conviction or a record of domestic abuse. Mental-health issues can be another factor, such as involuntary commitment to a mental institution. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, is supposed to streamline the process of gun purchasing by quickly weeding out those who cannot legally buy a gun. In 36 states or territories, the FBI performs all background checks, whereas the remaining 25 states set up their own state agencies to either conduct full or partial background checks. But such a system is only as good as the databases it’s linked to -- and several analyses have shown that these databases are far from complete. If someone is ineligible to purchase a gun but their information didn’t get into the right database, then the background check won’t stop the purchase. For instance, suspected Charleston shooter Dylann Roof should have been ineligible to buy a gun because of a prior felony on a drug charge, but errors in paperwork, and a mistake by the FBI examiner in charge of the background check, meant that Roof passed the check. The Los Angeles Times article The source that every site we found linked back to was a July 18 Los Angeles Times article, headlined, "Obama pushes to extend gun background checks to Social Security." The article reports that the Social Security Administration is crafting a new policy that would prevent gun purchases by certain types of beneficiaries. The ineligible beneficiaries would be those who were deemed mentally incompetent. In this instance, a mentally incompetent person would be categorized as someone who has their finances handled by another party, known as a "representative payee." The Social Security change did not emerge suddenly. It stems from an executive order by Obama in January 2013 that required "require federal agencies to make data available to the federal background check system." The idea behind the executive order was to make the background check database more complete and prevent gun purchases by people who, under the law, are ineligible. We found several problems with the websites’ claims. • The new policy would not ban all Social Security recipients from owning guns. Rather, it would only affect the small fraction who are deemed mentally incompetent, and who are thus are barred from purchasing guns under the law. • The policy is not yet in force. When we reached out to the Social Security Administration, a spokesman responded, "We are still developing our policy." In developing the plan, the Social Security Administration is following the lead of another federal agency, the Veterans Administration, which is already sharing names with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The Social Security Administration’s policy is expected to be similar. • The policy would not take away guns from people who already own them. There is no indication that this policy would take guns away from people who already own guns. Rather, the policy would affect the ability of some mentally incompetent people from buying new guns. "There is nothing in the policy that would change the definition of who may possess a gun, nor anything that extends the federal government’s authority to take guns away from those who already have them," said Gary Kleck, a professor of criminology at Florida State University. There is one exception to this: California currently tracks and disarms ineligible gun owners. In addition to seizing the guns of those people determined to be mentally unstable, California law enforcement also disarms people with felonies or a domestic violence restraining order. The new policy, once it’s instituted, could marginally increase the number of mentally incompetent individuals living in California who are disarmed under that 2013 law. What about the charge that 4.2 million people would be affected by the policy? There’s some truth to it, but there’s an important caveat: 2.7 million of the beneficiaries who have their finances managed by others receive Social Security because of a mental disability, not just because of their age, according to LaVenia LaVelle, a spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration. So it’s not really accurate to say, as Breitbart did, that the plan is "to block seniors" from buying guns, since a large number of those affected would not be seniors. Data from December 2013 shows that about 1.2 million disabled workers with mental disorders who were receiving Social Security disability were under 50. Finally, some of these people may already be in the database for another reason. Our ruling Bloggers such as the Conservative Tribune wrote headlines like this one: "SPREAD THIS: Obama Makes Huge Move to BAN Social Security Recipients From Owning Guns." This is a vast exaggeration of the actual policy under consideration. It would not affect all Social Security recipients, but rather those who have already been declared mentally incompetent, and thus ineligible under current law from purchasing a gun. And it is targeted at blocking gun purchases, not taking away guns from people who already have them. Only in California could the policy lead to increased gun seizures, and only -- potentially -- for mentally incompetent residents of the state who would be newly added to the background check database. Obama has not made a sweeping move to disarm gun-owning senior citizens, as these websites claim. We rate the claim False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2015-07-30T14:28:21	2015-07-20	['None']

pomt-15285	Says Donald Trump "has supported a Canadian-style universal health care system."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/24/erick-erickson/conservative-columnist-trump-once-backed-single-pa/	The rise of Donald Trump is striking not merely because it has come so quickly, but because there’s much in his resumé that clashes with Republican orthodoxy. Conservative columnist Erick Erickson ran down the list in a recent post on RedState.com. Trump has given money to Democrats, including Hillary Clinton. He has supported abortion rights. And "he has supported a Canadian-style universal health care system," Erickson wrote. We decided to look into Trump’s track record on health care. The billionaire’s 2000 book The America We Deserve makes a strong pitch for universal health care. "I’m a conservative on most issues but a liberal on this one," Trump wrote. "We should not hear so many stories of families ruined by health care expenses. We must not allow citizens with medical problems to go untreated because of financial problems or red tape." When he turned to how the country might achieve universal coverage, Trump focused like a laser beam on a Canadian-style, single-payer plan. He said it would eliminate many billions of dollars of overhead. "The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America," he wrote. "We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing." Ever the pragmatist, Trump noted change would not happen overnight. "While we work out details of a new single-payer plan, there are a number of ways to make the health care system now in place work more efficiently," Trump wrote. So, it’s fair to say that in 2000, Trump supported a Canadian-style health care plan. By 2011, his views had changed. As he contemplated a presidential bid, he told the audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., that "I will fight to end Obamacare and replace it with something that makes sense for people in business and not bankrupt the country." In an interview with the New York Times, Trump backed away from a single-payer plan, as well as another of his proposals from a decade earlier, a surtax on the wealthiest Americans. ''We had a much different country when I proposed those two things,'' he said, according to the New York Times reporter. We searched the Nexis database of news reports for any other views Trump might have voiced on universal health care between 2000 and 2011 and found none. In a recent radio interview, Trump did not so much reject his previous support for a Canadian-style plan as describe, in a roundabout fashion, a totally different approach. He gave few details but said, "we're going to have great (private) plans," and that government should help people "at the lower levels." "You can’t have a guy that has no money, that’s sick, and he can’t go see a doctor, he can’t go see a hospital," Trump said. "I mean, because I’m actually a conservative with a heart." Our ruling Erickson said that Trump has supported a Canadian-style universal health care system. Trump’s own book from 2000 affirms that. By about 10 years later, he had changed his position. Erickson got it right. We rate this claim True.	None	Erick Erickson	None	None	None	2015-07-24T17:06:45	2015-07-21	['None']
pomt-00758	In Wisconsin, a "second arrest for carrying pot is a felony," but a second or subsequent arrest "for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/15/edward-flynn/wisconsin-carrying-marijuana-second-time-felony-il/	Even in a city repeatedly scarred by senseless fatal shootings -- a 10-year-old girl caught in the crossfire at a playground, a toddler struck by a bullet aimed at the wrong house -- this case stood out: A man driving his van in Milwaukee late on a Sunday afternoon struck and killed a 2-year-old boy who had darted into the street. He jumped out of the vehicle immediately and was grieving as he stood over the body. Moments later, a gunman, apparently enraged about the accident, shot the 40-year-old driver to death. But he also fatally wounded a 15-year-old, the toddler’s brother, who had rushed to the scene. Reacting to the incident, Mayor Tom Barrett linked increases in fatal and non-fatal shootings in Milwaukee with gun laws. In turn, Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. criticized the mayor, saying Barrett was blaming concealed carry permit holders for more guns being on the street. Then, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn, while speaking to reporters on April 14, 2015, two days after the accident and double-shooting, responded to the sheriff. "We're the only place I know," Flynn said, referring to Wisconsin, "where it's a misdemeanor to carry a gun illegally, but a felony for a second rap for carrying pot. Would you tell me how that makes sense? "Second arrest for carrying pot is a felony. Second, third, fourth, 10th arrest for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor. Is it any wonder these knuckleheads out there with guns aren't learning a lesson from getting locked up by us?"​ Is Flynn right about the Wisconsin laws? Except for some clarification, yes. Marijuana Carrying marijuana -- for a second offense and subsequent offenses -- is, in fact, a felony crime. But that doesn't necessarily mean a felony charge will be filed. Prosecutors generally have discretion in charging. So, while someone with a clean criminal record who is caught a second time carrying a marijuana joint technically has committed a felony offense, a prosecutor might decide to only issue a ticket. It’s also worth noting that carrying marijuana can be a felony on a first offense -- if you’re carrying with the intent to deliver, for instance. (Coincidentally, the day before Flynn made his claim, state Rep. Melissa Sargent, D-Madison, announced she would introduce a bill to legalize marijuana in Wisconsin. With Republicans controlling both houses of the Legislature, the measure has virtually no chance of passing.) Guns Wisconsin legalized the concealed carry of guns and other weapons in 2011. Carrying a concealed gun without a state-issued concealed carry license is a misdemeanor, for the first offense and for any subsequent offenses. It’s worth noting that someone convicted of any misdemeanor on three separate occasions within five years can be sentenced to more time behind bars. So, someone convicted of carrying a concealed gun illegally could be punished more if they are also convicted of two other misdemeanors, whether gun-related or not, within five years. In addition, for certain people, carrying a gun is a felony on the first offense. That includes convicted felons and people who are subject to an injunction such as a domestic violence restraining order. Our rating Flynn said that in Wisconsin, a "second arrest for carrying pot is a felony," but a second or subsequent arrest "for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor." A second arrest for carrying marijuana is classified as a felony offense, although depending on the circumstances, only a ticket might be issued. And generally a first or subsequent offense for carrying a gun illegally is a misdemeanor -- although for some people, such as convicted felons, a first offense is a felony. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-13016	"Trump’s Health Secretary Pick Wants a Medicare Phaseout by Summer 2017."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/07/winning-democrats/no-trumps-health-secretary-pick-tom-price-doesnt-w/	Donald Trump’s pick for Health and Human Services secretary, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., has a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. But a Democratic website says he wants to go further and nix Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors and the disabled. "Trump’s Health Secretary Pick Wants a Medicare Phase Out by Summer 2017," reads a headline on a Winning Democrats article posted Dec. 1. Over the next week the post generated 14,000 likes. The Winning Democrats article frames Price’s position as ending Medicare. "In short, Americans can expect Republicans in Congress to begin their effort to wipe out Medicare in one swoop, which would harm millions of Americans immediately and millions more in the years to come as Medicare no longer exists to help older Americans pay for health care without having to deal with all the bulls--- private insurance companies do," reads an excerpt from the piece. Democratic claims that Republicans wanted to end Medicare were pervasive in previous years, so much so that the claim "Republicans voted to end Medicare" won the 2011 Lie of the Year. Price’s alleged position is significant since Trump promised to leave Medicare alone as president. More recently, however, Trump’s transition website says he wants to "modernize Medicare so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation -- and beyond." Does Trump’s HHS pick actually want to discontinue Medicare? We found that Price does favor changing Medicare, but it’s wrong to say he wants to end it. Price’s plan does not equal phasing out Medicare Price’s spokesperson sent PolitiFact the Fiscal Year 2017 Budget Resolution as a basis for Price’s plan. The resolution was prepared by the House budget committee, of which Price is chairman. The plans does not include ending Medicare. The suggested plan would be similar to the Medicare Advantage program. Beneficiaries would pick from a list of government-approved plans and the government would make a payment to the insurers to help cover the cost of the plan. Paul Ginsburg, a public policy professor at the University of Southern California, called the "phase out" claim false. "The FY17 budget resolution says some things about Medicare, but they appear to be along the lines of more private-plan alternatives to traditional Medicare," Ginsburg said. "However, it is not at all clear how these would differ from Medicare Advantage plans, which have attracted more than 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries." Ginsburg wasn’t alone. None of the experts we interviewed said Price’s plan amounts to getting rid of Medicare. Experts did agree, however, that Price’s plan would dramatically change how Medicare works. "I do not equate Price’s plan to ‘phasing out Medicare,’ though the plan would significantly change how Medicare works, converting it from a defined benefit program (beneficiaries guaranteed a certain level of coverage) into a defined contribution program (beneficiaries given a fixed dollar amount with which to buy coverage)," said Michael Spearer, a health policy and management professor at Columbia University. That’s a serious change, but the Winning Democrats story makes it sound as if Price is referring to phasing out Medicare. Here’s how the remark appears in the story: That quote originally appeared in a Nov. 17 Talking Points Memo article, "Rep. Tom Price Reveals Republicans Eyeing Medicare Overhaul In 2017." So the Winning Democrats frames Price’s quote to refer to phasing out Medicare, when the remark was in reference to a Medicare overhaul. Our ruling Winning Democrats said Price wants to phase out Medicare by summer 2017. Price favors an overhaul of Medicare, but the phrase "phase out" is too strong and gives readers the specific impression Medicare won’t exist under Price. Medicare will exist, and Price’s preferred plan for its future is laid out in detail in the 2017 Fiscal Year Budget Resolution. In addition, the article offers little to no evidence to support the idea that Price wants to end Medicare.

pomt-03273	"This year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part time."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/07/susan-collins/susan-collins-says-year-overwhelming-majority-new-/	Policymakers and pundits are spending a lot of time these days talking about part-time jobs -- whether they are becoming more common at the expense of full-time jobs, and how problematic that trend could be. Republicans note that President Barack Obama’s health care law requires larger employers to provide health insurance to their workers, which they say gives companies an incentive to cut workers’ hours so much that they become part-time workers and thus exempt from the health insurance mandate. And beyond the question of Obamacare’s incentives, some economists worry that since the most recent recession, companies have been unusually willing to hire part-time workers rather than full-time workers. We recently noticed two seemingly contradictory comments on this topic -- one from a Republican, one from a Democrat -- and thought it would be worthwhile checking both. In this item, we will check a claim made by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, in a response to one of Obama’s Saturday radio addresses. "In the past, most new jobs were full time, but, this year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part time," Collins said. "Under this troubling trend, more workers will find their hours and their earnings reduced. Jobs will be lost. This is especially disturbing as our country is still battling high unemployment." The other comment we will check separately is by Alan Krueger, the chairman of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers: "Since the Affordable Care Act passed, 90 percent of job growth has been in full-time positions." These two comments paint sharply different pictures, so we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For Collins, we looked at the change in full-time and part-time employment between December 2012 and July 2013, then determined which of the two types of employment accounted for a larger share of the increase in overall employment. Here’s the summary: Date Full-time employees Part-time employees December 2012 115,868,000 27,502,000 July 2013 116,090,000 28,233,000 Change, Dec-July +222,000 +731,000 So Collins has a point -- 77 percent of the increase in employment over this period came from part-time jobs. We think a 3-to-1 ratio qualifies as "overwhelming." Still, we will offer a few caveats. • A large majority of these jobs are being taken by people who want to work part time. BLS breaks part-time jobs into two categories -- people working part-time for economic reasons (meaning they want a full-time job, but have to settle for a part-time job), and people working part-time for noneconomic reasons (because they prefer a part-time schedule to a full-time schedule). Date Part time for economic reasons Part time for noneconomic reasons Dec. 2012 7,918,000 18,763,000 July 2013 8,245,000 19,128,000 In other words, about 70 percent of people working part time right now are doing so because they want to work part time, not because the economy is forcing them to. This doesn’t mean there are no problems associated with a rise in part-time jobs -- such a shift could make it harder for the recovery to gain momentum, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Still, it’s important to point out that most people taking part-time jobs aren’t being forced into those jobs purely because of the economy. • Timing matters. If you use a longer time horizon, a large percentage of jobs created were full-time positions. "Over longer periods, a much smaller percentage of job gains have taken the form of part-time jobs," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. In other words, by choosing the time frame carefully, you can find support for either side of this argument. Our ruling Collins said, "This year, the overwhelming majority of new jobs are part time." The statistics show that 77 percent of the increase in jobs between December 2012 and July 2013 consisted of part-time jobs. It’s worth noting that longer time frames show the opposite pattern, and that most of the part-time jobs being created are being taken by people who actually want to work part time. Still, on the numbers, Collins is right, and we rate her claim True.	None	Susan Collins	None	None	None	2013-08-07T09:00:00	2013-08-03	['None']

pomt-06677	"The day President Obama took office, gasoline was $1.79 a gallon."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/08/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-gasoline-cost-179-gallon-whe/	During the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., offered a line she has used frequently in the past: "The day that President Obama took office, gasoline was $1.79 a gallon." She added that "it's entirely possible for us to get back to inexpensive energy." With regular unleaded gasoline now hovering around $3.60 per gallon nationally, a number of readers wondered whether Bachmann was right on the price when Obama was inaugurated. So we looked into it. We turned to historical data collected by the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Energy Department. The interactive database offers a variety of measurements, so we’ll cite a few of them here. We’ll use the third week of January 2009 as a stand-in for Jan. 20, the day Obama was sworn in. Here are the average prices in several categories that week, rounded to the nearest cent: • Conventional retail gasoline, regular unleaded, national average: $1.83 per gallon • Reformulated retail gasoline, regular unleaded, national average: $1.88 per gallon • Gasoline retail prices, regular unleaded, national city average: $1.79 So using one of these measures Bachmann is entirely correct and with the others she’s close. Of course, the national average is the most obvious way to analyze this issue, but there is usually variation by region. During the week in question, the cost of a gallon of unleaded ranged from a high of $2.00 on the west coast to a low of $1.61 in the Rocky Mountain states. It's also worth noting that a president's ability to affect gasoline prices is limited. "Other than lip service, there is little any president or member of Congress can do about the price of gas, since 70 percent of the cost of a gallon is determined by the cost of crude oil," said John B. Townsend II, a spokesman for the mid-Atlantic region of the American Automobile Association.

pomt-04630	Says that under Mitt Romney, 89 million Americans could be denied coverage if they have a pre-existing condition.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/14/barack-obama/obama-campaign-says-89-million-americans-could-be/	The "Obama Truth Team" wants you to tell your Facebook friends: Bad things will happen if Mitt Romney repeals the Affordable Care Act. A recent image posted to the team’s Facebook page pairs photos of President Barack Obama and Romney under the label "The Choice." Then it contrasts two numbers. "Number of Americans who could be denied coverage if they have a pre-existing condition" under Obama? Zero. Under Romney? 89 million. Obama’s health care law forbids insurers from using someone’s health or lack of it to "determine eligibility, benefits or premiums." Romney, the Republican candidate for president, has promised an effort to repeal the law. But he says that people with pre-existing conditions, as long as they’ve been insured in the past, shouldn’t be denied coverage. (He introduced confusion for a day Sept. 9, 2012, when he told NBC’s Meet the Press that, "I'm not getting rid of all of health care reform. Of course, there are a number of things that I like in health care reform that I'm going to put in place. One is to make sure that those with pre-existing conditions can get coverage." But his aides quickly clarified he still meant protection just for those who had maintained "continuous coverage.") We wanted to know: Could 89 million people be vulnerable to insurers using pre-existing conditions to deny them health coverage under Romney? There’s some support for this statistic — alongside significant caveats. The Romney plan Romney’s health care plan doesn’t pack a lot of details, and his campaign didn’t answer our requests for clarification. But he has consistently said that the Affordable Care Act should go away, and that people with health conditions who have "maintained continuous health insurance coverage should be guaranteed the ability to retain coverage." Democrats argue that means people who suffer gaps in coverage — after, say, a lost job — wouldn’t be protected under Romney. And that’s where the "89 million" figure comes from: a recent study of the number of people who lost insurance coverage for at least a month between 2003 and 2007. The idea is that if some of those 89 million happened to have a pre-existing condition, a gap in their health insurance could mean "denied coverage" later. But it’s not that simple. We checked out a summary of the August 2012 study from the Commonwealth Fund, and chatted with one of its authors and several other health care experts about the accuracy of the campaign claim. "If you take it very literally, it's accurate," said Pamela Short, one of the Commonwealth Fund study authors, who was a health care expert on President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers. "... It doesn't mean it would, but it could." Other experts were less generous. Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and founding editor of conservative magazine National Review, called the statistic "absurd and false." Here’s how both of them are right. • The 89 million encompasses those with coverage gaps — not necessarily those with pre-existing conditions. Estimates of how many Americans actually have pre-existing conditions vary widely. • Even if Obamacare disappeared, a 1996 law protects most people from denial after gaps of less than 63 days. Health experts we talked to assumed Romney would basically firm up the requirements of that law — which applies primarily to people with employer-based coverage, not less common individual policies — and perhaps strengthen it so it also applied to the individual market. But the group in the study is bigger than that, including those with coverage gaps of "at least one month." • That same law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, only allows insurers to look back 18 months for coverage gaps of 63 days or more. But the study tallied those who had gaps over a four-year period. • The study looked at people ages 4 to 64 with public and private health care coverage. But people who qualify for Medicaid, for example, couldn’t be at risk for being "denied coverage if they have a pre-existing condition." • Some people rejected for coverage for pre-existing conditions before the Affordable Care Act qualified for insurance through state-run "high-risk pools," an idea Romney includes in his health care proposals. So the Obama campaign claim is true only under the most literal reading of Romney’s approach — that "continuous coverage" could mean exactly that, with no allowances even for short gaps protected under the law for many people since the 1990s. (And even then, you’d have to subtract people who could take advantage of public insurance and high-risk pools.) Meanwhile, conservative health experts say that the group of reforms recommended by Romney, which focus on separating health insurance from employment, would cut down on gaps in health coverage. "The idea is that you create a new system in which it's much easier to get insurance yourself, give people a window (a kind of open season) to get insured in that system if they're not already insured, and then after that protect those who are from then on continuously insured," Levin said. The ruling The Obama campaign says that under Romney, 89 million Americans could be denied coverage if they have a pre-existing condition. Democrats point to Romney’s promises to repeal the Affordable Care Act as evidence, along with Romney’s statements that people should be protected from denial only if they have been continuously insured. The "89 million" comes from a study that looked at coverage gaps, without a focus on pre-existing conditions. Some of those 89 million — those on public insurance, or whose gaps were less than 63 days or more than 18 months old, or who qualified for high-risk pools — could be protected in a non-Affordable Care Act world. That reduces the number of people who could suffer coverage denials. So while Romney would work to repeal blanket protection for people with pre-existing conditions, the claim that he could expose "89 million" to the possibility of denied coverage is only partially accurate, and leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-09-14T11:59:17	2012-09-10	['United_States', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-07642	"There are corporations in this nation, some of the biggest corporations in this nation, who do not pay taxes."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/15/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-says-some-largest-corporations-pa/	Early this month, Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge of Warrensville Heights appeared on C-SPAN’s "Washington Journal," public affairs television program where viewers phoned in to ask her questions. A caller who identified himself as James, an Akron small-business owner, discussed some of the tax write-offs he uses as a small businessman, and said larger businesses "game the system" by writing off things like parties, food and clothes. Fudge agreed with him, calling for an overhaul of corporate tax policy, saying: "There are corporations in this nation, some of the biggest corporations in this nation, who do not pay taxes." "It is not that they are cheating," Fudge continued. "It is not that they are doing something wrong. We have given them tools." We thought examining Fudge’s tax claim would be worthwhile, since representatives of some of the nation’s biggest companies, such as Cincinnati’s Procter & Gamble, argue that Congress should be cutting business taxes. In January testimony on behalf of the Business Roundtable, P&G CEO Robert A. McDonald told the House Ways and Means Committee that too-high corporate taxes are costing American jobs and making U.S. companies less competitive in the global marketplace. Are some large U.S. businesses not paying taxes, as Fudge claims? To back up her assertion, Fudge’s office cites media reports about particular companies – like General Electric and Bank of America -- that did not pay 2009 taxes as well as a July 2008 report from Congress’ Government Accountability Office that showed it’s relatively common for big companies to pay no taxes. Between 1998 to 2005, GAO found that about 72 percent of large foreign controlled companies and 55 percent of large U.S. controlled companies reported zero tax liability for at least one year. About 57 percent of foreign controlled large companies and 42 percent of U.S. large companies paid no taxes in two or more years, and a third of the foreign companies and one quarter of their U.S. counterparts paid no taxes for at least four of those years. Just 45 percent of large U.S. companies and 28 percent of foreign companies reported a tax liability for each of the eight years. The report defined large companies as those with at least $250 million in assets, or at least $50 million in receipts When GAO factored smaller companies into the mix, it found a higher overall proportion who didn’t pay taxes. Throughout the eight years the study examined, the overall percentage of non-tax-paying foreign and U.S. controlled companies never fell beneath 60 percent annually. The report said that corporations may not pay U.S. income taxes for a variety of reasons, including current-year operating losses, tax credits, and multinational corporations shifting income to lower tax jurisdictions. "Some corporations could have zero income before deducting expenses and others could have zero net income after deducting expenses, both of which could result in no tax liability," the report said. After the GAO report was released, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Chief Economist Martin Regalia released a statement that stressed the difference between companies not having a tax liability and shirking taxes that are owed. "The GAO report doesn’t say that businesses aren’t paying taxes they owe," Regalia’s statement said. "Rather, it says that some corporations did not have tax liabilities — in other words, they did not owe taxes. So how do corporations avoid having tax liabilities? They don’t make any profits. You can have many billions of dollars in revenue and still have R&D, labor-related and other expenses that are larger than your revenues — and therefore no ‘income’ to tax. "In sum, the idea that there is a large pool of corporations not paying taxes that they legally owe is just incorrect," Regalia concluded. The nation’s big business representatives don’t dispute the report’s findings, even as they stress it should not be misconstrued to mean businesses are evading taxes they owe. During her television appearance, Fudge stressed that the businesses who don’t pay taxes aren’t cheating or doing anything wrong. Our research finds solid ground beneath her claim that some large U.S. companies don’t pay taxes. That’s why we rate her statement as True.

pomt-04947	"As we watch the news from Colorado with horror and sympathy for the families, we should remember that each day more than 80 Americans are killed by gunfire, unnecessary tragedies."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/27/rush-holt/rush-holt-claims-more-80-americans-are-killed-gunf/	U.S. Rep. Rush Holt said he can’t see the logic in opposing laws governing firearm safety when dozens of people die from gunfire every day. On July 20, the day a 24-year-old man opened fire in an Aurora, Colo., movie theater killing 12 people and wounding 58 others, Holt, a Democrat, sent out an e-mail newsletter stating, "as we watch the news from Colorado with horror and sympathy for the families, we should remember that each day more than 80 Americans are killed by gunfire, unnecessary tragedies. Arguments that gun safety legislation won’t help the situation seem to me illogical or blindly ideological." PolitiFact New Jersey found Holt’s statistic is relatively accurate, but only if suicides count as being "killed by gunfire." PolitiFact National recently dug into a similar statement that had been posted on Facebook: "Nearly 100,000 people get shot every year. That's 270 people a day and 87 dead." That claim landed at Mostly True on the Truth-O-Meter because the numbers were largely right but needed additional context. Saying "nearly 100,000 people get shot every year" suggests a person is being shot by someone else, but self-inflicted injuries represent a significant portion of that figure. Holt’s statement takes the Facebook post a step further by tying the gun deaths statistic in with comments about the Colorado shooting, strengthening the impression that the number he cites represents Americans killed by a gun in the hands of someone other than themselves. When suicides are removed from the count, the number of individuals killed by guns each day drops off steeply, we found. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks the causes of fatalities for residents of the United States. In 2009 -- the most recent data available -- 31,347 people died in firearm-related incidents. Suicides represent nearly 60 percent (18,735) of those gun-related deaths, while homicides make up nearly 37 percent (11,493). The rest of the fatalities fall into three categories: unintentional (554), undetermined (232) or legal intervention/war (333). Overall, about 86 people die daily across the nation in firearm-related incidents. That figure drops to roughly 35 people a day when suicides are eliminated from the count. About 32 people die daily in homicides. We asked Thomas Seay, the congressman’s spokesman, to explain why Holt used a statistic increased significantly by suicides to make a point about gun safety legislation after a mass shooting. Seay said in an e-mail that "you’re right to point out that gun deaths take many different forms. Gunfire kills people in mass shootings, as in the evil acts in Colorado. Gunfire kills people in isolated murders. Gunfire kills people in accidents. And in many cases, people use gunfire to kill themselves. Almost all of these deaths are tragic and the cause of family grieving, so as we grieve with the families of Aurora, there are many other families whom we should not forget." The questions of what to do about potential future deaths and injury should be confronted, examined, and answered, but we should start with an understanding of the problem: more than 80 deaths by gunfire each day." Our ruling Holt said, "As we watch the news from Colorado with horror and sympathy for the families, we should remember that each day more than 80 Americans are killed by gunfire, unnecessary tragedies." It’s true that more than 80 people died daily in firearm-related incidents, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Suicides represent a significant majority of that figure and that’s an important detail Holt’s statement lacks. While commenting on a mass shooting, he cites a statistic inflated by individuals who took their own lives. Saying more than 80 Americans are "killed by gunfire" each day in this context suggests those victims were shot by somebody else, not themselves. Still, it is true that guns are involved in more than 80 deaths a day nationwide. Overall, we rate this claim Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-07082	Says Gov. Chris Christie’s "poll ratings have been going up."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/26/piers-morgan/cnns-piers-morgan-says-gov-chris-christies-poll-ra/	CNN host Piers Morgan has joined the chorus of national voices asking Gov. Chris Christie if he’ll make a bid for the White House in 2012. Although Christie said he wouldn’t, Morgan pressed him on the issue. "Here's the thing. I don't understand why you wouldn't want to run this time. I mean, you've got the economy in tatters. Your record on that is pretty strong. You're admired for it. Your poll ratings have been going up," Morgan said in an interview with Christie on "Piers Morgan Tonight" that aired June 14. Really? PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check if Christie’s poll ratings are increasing. The publicist for "Piers Morgan Tonight" declined comment on Morgan’s claim. We looked at two measurements with enough data available to compare over time: the governor’s job approval and favorability ratings -- and found that recently, the governor’s ratings have not increased. Polls on job approval ratings conducted by Quinnipiac University, Fairleigh Dickinson University’s PublicMind and Monmouth University interview registered New Jersey voters. Quinnipiac’s polls show Christie’s job approval rating climbed from 44 percent in June 2010 to 52 percent in February, before falling to 47 percent in April and then to 44 percent in June. Those polls had a margin of error between 2.4 and 2.7 percentage points. PublicMind polls also show a recent decline. They put Christie’s job approval rating at 52 percent in the beginning of March 2010 and at 43 percent by the end of that month. By January it had climbed to 53 percent. By April it had dropped to 51 percent and in May it fell to 44 percent. The margins of error on those polls are between 3.5 and 4 percentage points. Monmouth University/NJ Press Media polls showed the governor’s job approval rating at 42 percent in April 2010, 49 percent in February and 46 percent this May. Those polls had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. According to Rasmussen Reports polls, which survey likely New Jersey voters, Christie’s job approval rating was 53 percent in April 2010. In September 2010 it jumped to 57 percent. But a May poll shows it has leveled back off at 53 percent. Those polls had a 4.5 percentage point margin of error. Rasmussen is widely considered Republican-leaning. Ben Dworkin, director of the the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, noted that a poll is "just a scientific model of a particular moment in time" and that if a poll goes up or down a point or two "it can also be considered statistically the same thing." But, he said, if done well, polls can offer a pretty accurate portrayal of the public’s mood. Dworkin also said that when people discuss whether poll ratings are increasing, "they are talking about from one poll to the next," unless they say otherwise. We then spoke to the heads of three polling institutes to get their analyses of the data. Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University’s Polling Institute, and Peter Woolley, the executive director of PublicMind, both said Christie’s job approval ratings are not increasing. Scott Rasmussen, founder of Rasmussen Reports, said the governor’s job approval ratings have been "pretty steady" since he took office. We also looked at the governor’s favorability rating -- a measurement that focuses more on personal attributes than policy issues. We found two institutes that tracked that rating over time. PublicMind showed a drop from 47 percent to 40 percent between the most recent surveys and the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University showed a very slight dip. Both polling institutes show the rating going down when compared over a longer period of time. Let’s review. Morgan said Christie’s poll ratings "have been going up." Polls measuring the governor’s job approval and favorability ratings all show a dip in the numbers among the most recent surveys. If we look at the same polls over a longer time frame, they show Christie’s ratings have remained relatively steady -- but staying even isn’t growth For these reasons, we rate Morgan’s statement False.

pomt-14091	Says Patrick Murphy is one of "only three Democrats in the House today who voted" to create the Benghazi committee.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/may/16/alan-grayson/patrick-murphy-voted-house-benghazi-committee-gray/	U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson wants voters to think he’s the only true Democrat in the race for Marco Rubio’s soon-to-be-open Senate seat. After all, he reasoned, his primary opponent helped Republicans create the Benghazi committee. "Two years ago last Sunday, the Benghazi committee came into being," the Orlando businessman and former lawyer said in a fundraising email on May 11, 2016. "There are only three Democrats in the House today who voted for it. One of them is my primary opponent, Patrick Murphy." Murphy, a Jupiter Democrat, was a Republican before switching parties two years before being elected to Congress in 2012. His moderate views have been challenged by progressives and especially Grayson, who has endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders in the presidential race. Could it be true Murphy was among a handful of Democrats who voted to investigate leading Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton? In a word, yes, although Murphy said it was because he wanted to clear Clinton’s name. Back to Benghazi On Sept. 11, 2012, just before President Barack Obama’s re-election, Islamic extremists attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission and a CIA compound in Benghazi, Libya. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed. Various conspiracy theories and cover-ups became partisan talking points as the White House was questioned about al-Qaida involvement and what officials did and did not know about the attack. Then-Secretary of State Clinton and the State Department faced scrutiny that has continued during her presidential campaign. By May 2014, seven congressional probes and a State Department review board had examined the issue. A conservative watchdog group obtained State Department emails about the attack that had been withheld from one of these House committees, sparking calls for a new investigation. The Republican-led House voted to form the House Select Committee on Benghazi, comprised of seven Republicans and five Democrats, to again question the Obama administration’s handling of the incident. The May 8 vote largely went along party lines, 233 to 186. We say "largely" because seven Democrats crossed the aisle and voted to create the committee. Murphy was one of them. (He did not serve on the committee.) Grayson chose his words carefully when he cited "three Democrats in the House today." Four of those seven Democrats who voted for the panel are no longer members of Congress. Only Murphy, Minnesota’s Collin Peterson and Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema are still in office. Murphy released a statement following the vote, saying he hoped Congress would not use the panel to grandstand on the issue. We couldn’t find the press release on Murphy’s House website, but the Tampa Bay Times published the statement in part: "While the congressman respects the work his colleagues have done already investigating this matter, when it comes to American lives lost overseas in service to our nation, we must make sure that all questions have been answered. He sincerely hopes that this committee is not used as a way to politicize this tragedy and the deaths of four Americans." This isn’t the first time Grayson has attacked Murphy over the vote. On Oct. 2, 2015, he called the committee "a partisan clown show" that had been "done with Patrick Murphy's permission." By Oct. 21, Murphy told MSNBC that officials were abusing the process and the panel’s usefulness was over. "Based on what we’ve heard just in the last several weeks from Leader (Kevin) McCarthy, to the whistleblower to Congressman (Richard) Hanna coming out, admitting pretty clearly that this is a political witch hunt, I think it’s past time that we disband this committee," Murphy said. MSNBC’s Chuck Todd asked Murphy if he regretted the vote, but Murphy stayed firm: "I stand by it, because I think it’s more than proven that there is nothing to hide there." When we contacted Murphy’s campaign, his spokesman echoed a past statement that "Republicans turned this tragedy into a political circus" and reiterated Murphy wanted the committee shut down. There’s little evidence that Clinton or other liberals are holding Murphy’s vote against him. Murphy is favored by Democratic officials in the U.S. Senate race, and Clinton reportedly told donors at a 2015 fundraiser that she is "so proud of him." Republicans on the committee have said they expected to release a final report in the summer before the 2016 election. Our ruling Grayson said Murphy is one of "only three Democrats in the House today who voted" to create the Benghazi committee. Murphy did vote with six other Democrats to create the committee in May 2014 (four of those seven are no longer in the House). Grayson is trying to paint Murphy as a conservative in liberal’s clothing. Murphy says his vote was to help clear Clinton’s name. That’s a bit of context that Grayson should have included, so we rate his statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2af8b75d-3090-4047-aaef-82791287352a	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2016-05-16T16:04:01	2016-05-11	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Benghazi']

pomt-15266	Says his political opponents "brought 100,000 protesters into our state."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/30/scott-walker/pro-union-protesters-were-shipped-wisconsin-scott-/	Pitching his qualifications for president, Gov. Scott Walker often cites how he faced 100,000 protesters who fought unsuccessfully to stop Act 10, the 2011 collective bargaining reform law that led to his historic recall election. But sometimes the Wisconsin Republican goes further -- suggesting that the throngs of pro-union demonstrators had been imported. That's what happened July 27, 2015, when Fox News talk show host Neil Cavuto asked Walker what he thought about a commentary by syndicated Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank. In the column, Milbank said Walker has a "technique of scapegoating unions for the nation’s ills" that is similar to techniques of the late Joe McCarthy, the Communist-hunting U.S. senator from Wisconsin. Walker began his response to Cavuto by saying: "Well, in the end, I’m used to -- you know, you’ve been up to Wisconsin, you’ve seen it firsthand. The big-government special interests, the powerful special interests, the union bosses and others, they will stop at nothing, and all their supporters out there. They brought 100,000 protesters into our state to try and intimidate us, to back us down." We’ve been here before. In late February 2011, during the heat of the daily protests inside and around the Capitol, Walker said "almost all" of the protesters were from outside of Wisconsin. He made the statement in a phone conversation with a Buffalo, N.Y., blogger who was posing as industrialist and conservative political donor David Koch. We rated Walker’s statement False. There were people taking buses to Madison from Illinois, and no doubt some protesters came from other states. But we found no evidence that the vast majority of demonstrators came from outside of Wisconsin. Indeed, there was criticism of the number of public employees in Wisconsin who took off work to participate in the rallies. On Feb. 18, 2011, some schools around the state shut down because so many teachers heeded the call of their union leaders to descend upon Madison. Fast forward to today. We asked Walker’s campaign for evidence that 100,000 protesters were brought into Wisconsin. The campaign cited isolated reports of demonstrators being bused in from Illinois and New York, but nothing more comprehensive. For the record, it’s clear tens of thousands of protesters participated in some of the daily demonstrations, but less clear whether the crowds ever reached 100,000. In their book "More Than They Bargained For: Scott Walker, Unions and the Fight for Wisconsin," Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporters Jason Stein and Patrick Marley noted that on Feb. 19, 2011, thousands of tea party backers joined the protesters in order to show support for Walker. Madison police estimated the overall crowd that day, a Saturday, at 68,000. The crowd the following Saturday was estimated at 70,000, "definitely one of the largest and most sustained demonstrations we've ever seen," a Madison police spokesman told reporters at the time. He said the total could have been as high as 100,000, but counting was difficult because the demonstration was spread over a large area surrounding the Capitol Square. Madison police officer Kim Alan told us that some busloads of union supporters made no secret of the fact that they had come from out of state. But she said her department did not attempt to discern what portion of the protesters overall were from outside of Wisconsin. Our rating Walker said his political opponents "brought 100,000 protesters into our state." In early 2011, tens of thousands of protesters -- and perhaps as many as 100,000 on some days -- participated in daily demonstrations near the state Capitol to protest Walker’s collective bargaining reform law. But there is no evidence to indicate that all or nearly all were from outside of Wisconsin. We rate Walker’s statement False.

pomt-08931	"Sometime in the next decade, there will be more Latinos in the state of Texas than there are Anglos. That will happen sometime in the next five to eight to ten years."	true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/26/john-king/cnns-john-king-says-latinos-will-outnumber-anglos-/	Setting up a question to San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, CNN reporter John King mentioned the changing population of Texas. "Sometime in the next decade, there will be more Latinos in the state of Texas than there are Anglos," King said on the July 13 edition of "John King, USA." "That will happen sometime in the next five to eight to 10 years." So cable news reporters are now demographers? Meryl Conant, senior publicist for CNN Washington, told us King based his prediction on information from a San Antonio Express-News news article and the San Antonio-based Texas State Data Center, home to the state demographer, Dr. Lloyd Potter. We'd already contacted Potter, who told us the data center’s population projections suggest various timelines for the state's Latinos to outnumber Anglos. According to the data center, it "is anticipated that the number of Hispanics will exceed the number of Anglos in the state at some point in the coming decade. This benchmark might be achieved a little sooner or a little later if migration is respectively more rapid or more slow than that utilized for this projection." King's forecast could prove correct "assuming most of our migration, fertility and mortality assumptions hold true," Potter said in an e-mail. "The only concern I have is (King’s) statement indicating such certainty." His e-mail continues: "The variable with the most uncertainty is migration. Under our most conservative migration scenario, we project this threshold will occur at about 2020 give or take a year. Under the most aggressive scenario, the threshold would occur around 2014 or 2015. Under the 'unlikely' no-migration scenario, it won’t occur until almost 2035." Assuming conservative migration numbers, the data center projects a population of 28 million by 2020, including more than 11.8 million Hispanics and slightly fewer Anglos. The trend has been seen in census numbers. In the 2000 Census, 52 percent of Texans were Anglo, and 32 percent identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino (of any race). By 2008, according to the Census Bureau, Texas’ Hispanic proportion had grown to 37 percent, and its Anglo proportion had shrunk to 47 percent. Potter said the ethnicity projections could change. "If the borders closed to international migration, that would slow it considerably. If Texas’ economy slumped, that would slow the trend. When looking into the projections crystal ball, keeping these limitations of uncertainty in mind is healthy." Still, King's prediction -- a majority Hispanic population within 5 to 10 years -- has enough wiggle room to fit all the data center's migration forecasts, except the no-migration scenario. We rate King’s statement True.	None	John King	None	None	None	2010-07-26T06:00:00	2010-07-13	['Texas', 'Anglo', 'Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans']

pomt-08991	"$120,000 will be spent by taxpayers on Charlie Crist's political photo-op special session."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/14/marco-rubio/rubio-says-special-session-120000-photo-op-crist/	On July 8, 2010, Gov. Charlie Crist called for a special session July 20-23 for legislators to put a constitutional amendment on the November ballot to ban oil drilling near Florida's coasts. Republican Marco Rubio, one of independent Crist's rival in the U.S. Senate race, immediately accused Crist of using the session for political gain. Rubio wrote in a July 9 press release, "$120,000 will be spent by taxpayers on Charlie Crist's political photo-op special session." Clearly, Crist will get news coverage including photo-ops out of the special session -- as will legislative leaders from both parties. But does Rubio have the dollar figure right? Everyone we spoke to agrees it's hard to say, but $40,000 a day is the most common figure used. When Crist announced this session, The Palm Beach Post cited a $40,000 a day figure while the St. Petersburg Times wrote $50,000. Other articles simply stated "tens of thousands a day." In the archives, we found that the $40,000 figure has been quoted for decades -- as early as 1983 in the Miami Herald and 1989 in the St. Petersburg Times. Is there no such thing as inflation when it comes to special sessions in Florida? We asked the House and Senate for the bills from some recent special sessions, and we added up the average costs for both legislative bodies to get one average cost per day. The special session in early October 2007 on budget cuts and personal injury protection for motorists cost an average of $47,924.19 per day. Another session later in October 2007 (property tax cuts) cost an average of $45,329.64. A session in January 2009 (state budget) cost an average of $46,378.71 per day. The average for those three sessions was about $46,544 per day. Then is $46,544 a good daily average? Not necessarily. The House and Senate spokespersons, the Division of Management Services and the Office for Legislative Services all caution that those averages are imprecise. For example, they include just travel, meals, hotels and per diem. Jill Chamberlin, spokesperson for the House, says the per-diem for special sessions is $80 a day. However, lawmakers can get reimbursements instead: up to $110 a day for hotel, up to $36 a day for meals, and travel at 44.5 cents per mile or the common airline fare. The OLS calculates the length of the session differently for each body depending on what they scheduled on their calendars each day. The averages also don't include the cost of aides. If legislators want to bring an aide -- most don't for a brief special session -- that is paid for out of their district funds, which are also taxpayer dollars. Lawmakers may come into Tallahassee the day before the session or stay overnight when it ends, which affect the costs. Chamberlin also notes that some special sessions include committee meetings instead of floor sessions that require full attendance, so the bean-counters try to separate those costs from the special-session costs. For example, a December 2009 session on transportation was mostly committee meetings so expenses associated with the session were low: an average of $22,105.31. We contacted the Florida Department of Management Services to ask about electricity use and other routine building costs. Do they contribute to the cost of a special session? Not really, says Linda McDonald, DMS spokeswoman, in an e-mail. She explains that the lights and the staff are there year-round. The electric bill was higher in January 2009 for the special session on the budget than in January 2008, but McDonald blames higher rates, not the special session, for most of the increase. There probably will be minimal additional costs for the Capitol Police, but Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokesman Mike Morrison said he couldn't speculate on the amount. The police provide security to the complex year round. Pinpointing the average is not a simple task because there are so many variables, said Lisa Swindle, finance and accounting director for the Office of Legislative Services. But each time the OLS attempts to come up with an average, it is around $40,000, she said. Swindle said several years ago both the House and Senate appropriation bills allotted an additional $40,000 per day for each body for special sessions if they needed it, and that's likely why it's the most common figure used. She also says the one coming up will be "a true special session," without deducting cost of committee meetings, so we here at PolitiFact will update those costs when the session is over. We asked for cost records of special sessions in the 1980s and 1990s to see why the $40,000 figure has stood up for so long. But the OLS says it doesn't have those records. We asked Rubio's campaign where it got the $120,000 figure. Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said the campaign had heard reports between $30,000 and $50,000 a day, and he cited a July 9 blog in the Orlando Sentinel. Even that blog states that Rubio's $120,000 figure "is probably low." So where does that leave us? When Crist announced the special session, Rubio pounced and accused him of creating a $120,000-taxpayer funded photo op for a four-day special session. Rubio was being conservative with his numbers, using the low-end of $30,000 for four days. We're going with actual average of $46,544 from three recent sessions, and adding a fudge factor for all those imprecise costs that nobody in Tallahassee seems able to pin down. Let's call it a minimum of $50,000 a day, and $200,000 if this session lasts four days. Rubio went with a logical but conservative estimate, so we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-13192	Says he’s "taken an 8% pay decrease in each of the nine years he has been in office."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/oct/24/gerald-daugherty/gerald-daugherty-says-hes-decreased-his-pay-every-/	An Austin Republican who talks up affordability says he's also repeatedly taken pay cuts. Really? Gerald Daugherty’s campaign website says: "Leading by example, he has also taken an 8% pay decrease in each of the nine years he has been in office." That’s nine years in two chunks: Daugherty, a businessman, recaptured the Precinct 3 post on the Travis County Commissioners Court, representing western Travis County, in 2012 after losing the spot to a Democratic challenger in 2008. He faces Democrat David Holmes, a mediator, on the November 2016 ballot. Confirmed: Daugherty's smaller raises Earlier this year, we found Mostly False a candidate’s claim that Daugherty had voted to raise his 2016 salary 19.6 percent. Daugherty had voted to adopt the county budget including pay raises for the four commissioners. Separately, though, he set his own increased salary at $93,000, which was $8,400 less than what the budget authorized for commissioners. For 2016 then, Daugherty’s pay went up 3.2 percent from his 2015 salary of $90,109. For that fact check, we also confirmed that while the county’s 2015 budget provided for each of the commissioners to be paid $98,463, Daugherty was actually paid $90,109 that year, or 8.5 percent less than his colleagues, according to the county’s 2015 actual expenditures data. We also found that earlier, after Daugherty rejoined the body in 2013, he accepted a salary of $90,109 for fiscal 2013, according to his signed affidavit. At the time, that was about 5.7 percent less than the budgeted salary for each commissioner. Pay cuts every year? For this fact check, we wondered about the claim on Daugherty’s campaign site that he’s taken an 8 percent pay cut every year on the court. Asked to explain his claim, Daugherty said by phone that each time that he voted for annual county budgets including pay raises for commissioners, he followed up by directing the county to give him less of a raise. "We make $103,000 this year, and I’ve elected to take $93,000, which is probably more than 8 percent" less, Daugherty said. "What I do is, each year I take somewhere -- at least 8 percent" less. Daugherty added: "I have never voted to give myself a raise." Hold that thought: Daugherty may not have voted for pay raises but he’s accepted them--albeit in smaller increments than his colleagues. Also, records we obtained from the county’s archival budget documents covering county fiscal years that begin in October of each preceding year mostly indicate he’s not demanded actual pay cuts. The specifics: In 2003, when Daugherty won a special election to succeed Margaret Moore on the court, the salary for the Precinct 3 commissioner had already been set at $67,570, or 9.39 percent less than the court’s adopted salary for that fiscal year of $73,915. In 2004, Daugherty’s salary shrunk to $66,523, for a 1.55 percent decrease. Our review indicates that was the only time Daugherty’s salary went down from his previous year’s pay during his stints on the court. Records show Daugherty’s salary stayed the same for 2005 before increasing by 2 percent, to $67,854, for 2006. For 2007, Daugherty’s salary went up 13.29 percent, to $76,872 and for 2008, his pay increased by 3.4 percent, to $79,562 though a few months into that fiscal year, Daugherty relinquished his seat to Democrat Karen Huber, who defeated him at the polls. When Daugherty returned to the court in 2013, he elected to keep his salary at what Huber had been fielding, $90,109, through fiscal 2015. This gets us to the years we covered in the previous fact check. We also analyzed Daugherty’s claim by his reasoning -- the idea that every year he’s served, he’s made sure to be paid 8 percent less than other commissioners. That holds up for each year of his interrupted tenure, we confirmed, with the exception of the year he returned to the court, fiscal 2013. That year, Daugherty’s salary was 5.74 percent less than the court’s adopted salary for commissioners. By phone, Daugherty disputed the notion that he’d said on his campaign site that every year he took an 8 percent pay cut. "I guess you can read it however you want; I think it’s pretty straightforward," Daugherty said. "Each year whatever the salary is, I take, on average, 8 percent less than that … some of this stuff you have to put in a bumper sticker kind of a size. You can get so verbose with it and get people so confused about ‘what the hell is he saying?’ "I don’t think it’s difficult to understand," Daugherty said. "If people say, ‘tell me what you mean by that,’ well, the salary for 2016 and 2017 is $103,000. I’ve signed an affidavit that I only want to be paid $93,000. And that’s greater than 8 percent" less, he said. Our ruling Daugherty says on his campaign site that he’s "taken an 8% pay decrease in each of the nine years he has been in office." As a commissioner, Daugherty took a pay cut once. In fiscal 2004, his salary went down 1.55 percent to $66,523. Daugherty also has consistently taken steps to ensure he’s paid 8 percent less than fellow commissioners each year, though in one year his pay ran about 6 percent behind.

pomt-01825	In Oregon, 12,808 people were arrested for marijuana-related crimes in 2012.	false	/oregon/statements/2014/jul/18/new-approach-oregon/were-12808-people-oregon-arrested-marijuana-relate/	New Approach Oregon, the group campaigning for legal recreational marijuana in the state, has unleashed data aimed at showing how many resources the state uses - or wastes, in its view - to enforce marijuana laws. The group turned in 145,000 signatures June 26 to get its measure on the November ballot and now is waiting verification from the Secretary of State's Office. The claim: In campaign literature and on its website, New Approach Oregon says police "arrested" 12,808 people in 2012 for marijuana-related crimes. The group makes the claim twice in a media packet and two more times in a "Myth vs. Fact" section on its website, newapproachoregon.com. More than 12,000 in one year? That seemed like a lot, especially since Oregon decriminalized possession of small amounts years ago. We decided to check it out. The analysis: As part of its campaign to persuade Oregonians to support legal recreational marijuana, New Approach Oregon has set out to highlight the cost of policing existing marijuana laws. The group claims that in 2012, the latest statistics available, 12,808 people were arrested in Oregon for marijuana crimes. Here's one of the examples, from a "Myth vs. Fact" section on the group's website: "Myth: Most of the statistics of marijuana 'arrests and citations' are simple citations. They are like speeding or not signaling the right way. They take very little resources. "Reality: More than half of the drug-related arrests made in Oregon are for marijuana. (Source: Oregon State Police, page 4-10). In 2012, the most recent year for which data is available, 21,856 people were arrested for drug crimes, and 12,808 of them were for marijuana." We emailed Lt. Gregg Hastings, the Oregon State Police spokesman, to ask for a breakdown of numbers on marijuana offenses in 2012. He responded with statistics and a link to the 2012 Oregon Annual Uniform Crime Report, which has comprehensive crime numbers. A table with the heading "Statewide Drug Law Arrests by Type of Drug and Activity - 2012" shows, for marijuana, the number New Approach Oregon cited: 12,808. But Hastings noted in his email that 10,054 of those people were cited for possessing less than an ounce of marijuana -- "a violation (but) not a criminal offense." "It is important to note," he continued, "that enforcement action in the case of a 'violation' is handled by the issuance of a citation, similar to a traffic citation for speeding or not wearing a safety belt. Someone cannot be taken into custody and lodged in jail for a violation offense." In other words, Hastings said, those 10,054 were cited, not arrested. That leaves 2,754 people arrested for marijuana crimes in 2012, not 12,808. The 10,054 figure is also in the state report, in a row listing those found with less than an ounce of marijuana. So why is the figure for violations listed under an "arrests" heading? Hastings, after consulting with a state police researcher, said Oregon's report is part of the FBI's national Uniform Crime Reporting Program, which includes information from more than 18,000 agencies nationwide. Each state must use the FBI's reporting requirements, which have only one field for "arrested, cited, referred, or summoned." Oregon separately tracks whether marijuana offenses involved more or less than an ounce, and includes that in another place in the report. On July 14, 2014, we called Peter Zuckerman, spokesman for New Approach Oregon and a former news reporter who worked at The Oregonian from 2007 to 2009. He pointed to the Oregon Uniform Crime Report and the "arrests" wording. Told about Hasting's comments, he said he would look into the numbers. In an email later that day, he stood by the 12,808 figure, saying it was the most accurate available. He said violations can technically be "noncustodial arrests," a term police sometimes use to describe when someone is stopped but not detained. By then, Hastings had explained to Zuckerman why the 12,808 figure was incorrect. In emails shared by Zuckerman, Hastings wrote on July 7, 2014: "I want to make sure it is clear to you that Possession of less than an Ounce of Marijuana is a violation in Oregon, not a crime. A violation is only handled by issuance of citation (similar to a traffic citation) and someone cannot be taken into custody for a violation. Even though it is listed as an 'arrest' in this report, it is not a 'custodial arrest.'" On July 8, Hastings sent Zuckerman the legal definition of an arrest in Oregon: "to place a person under actual or constructive restraint or to take a person into custody for the purpose of charging that person with an offense." Over multiple emails and phone calls to PolitiFact Oregon from July 14-17, 2014, Zuckerman continued to quibble over the definition of "arrest." He sometimes acknowledged that the 12,808 figure is incorrect but other times said "if" it's wrong, it's the fault of Oregon State Police. He noted that people can be arrested for possessing less than an ounce of marijuana if they're near a school or on parole but did not provide statistics to show what effect, if any, that would have on the 12,808 figure. Hastings said parole violations would be counted elsewhere and that possessing less than an ounce of pot near a school would not necessarily result in an arrest. He also said he doesn't hear of such arrests often. Ultimately, Zuckerman said New Approach Oregon should not be held responsible for promoting the number because it relied on a credible source - the state police - and followed up when the number seemed inflated. "If it turns out the state police issued a misleading crime statistics report because of a communications problem they have with the FBI, and then gave me bad information about custodial vs. noncustodial arrest, that's not our fault," Zuckerman wrote. "It's unreasonable to think we would or could have known that." The claim remained on the organization's website as of Friday afternoon. The ruling: New Approach Oregon claims 12,808 people were arrested in 2012 for marijuana-related offenses, citing a "Drug Law Arrests" listing in Oregon's Annual Uniform Crime Report. State police spokesman Lt. Gregg Hastings told PolitiFact Oregon and New Approach spokesman Peter Zuckerman that the number includes 10,054 people who were cited - but not arrested -- for possessing less than an ounce of marijuana, leaving the actual number of arrests in 2012 at 2,754. While the way the number is listed in the state report is confusing, officials have clarified the record. Citing it any other way earns it a rating of False. Thoughts? Questions?

pomt-08520	Says Sal Esquivel wants a 5 percent state sales tax on groceries.	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/06/lynn-howe/lynn-howe-says-sal-esquivel-wants-tax-milk-bread-e/	Yet more sales tax shenanigans! In Southern Oregon, Rep. Sal Esquivel, R-Medford, is campaigning for his fourth term representing House District 6. His Democratic challenger is Lynn Howe, who lost to him two years ago by a margin of 46 percent to 54 percent. Howe’s campaign issued a mailer stating that Esquivel "wants a 5 percent sales tax." The backside of the flier features a mother and child in a grocery aisle with a shopping list. "Buying milk, bread, eggs, cereal, bananas, chicken, tomatoes? SAL ESQUIVEL WANTS TO TAX IT." A tax on food staples? That’s rare, even in states with a sales tax. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check out the claim. The Howe campaign flier cites House Bill 3269, which was introduced by Esquivel and five co-sponsors in the 2009 legislative session. It was assigned to the revenue committee and never acted on. The bill, which ran 59 pages, included many ideas related to taxation -- reducing income and property taxes, adding a general sales tax. But a tax on groceries was not one of them. SECTION 102. Food products. (1) There are exempted from the taxes imposed by the Sales and Use Tax Law the gross receipts from the sale of and the storage, use or other consumption in this state of food and food ingredients. (2) The exemption under this section does not apply to prepared food. The proposed tax also would have exempted prescription drugs, fuel, water and utilities. The bill went nowhere. Most of the bill’s sponsors have been serious players in Oregon’s longtime quest to stabilize revenue: Rep. Vicki Berger of Salem, Rep. Scott Bruun of West Linn, Rep. Bob Jenson of Pendleton, and Sen. Frank Morse of Albany. All are Republicans. Sen. Ginny Burdick, a Portland Democrat and the Senate’s top person on finance in 2009, also was a co-sponsor. Howe now admits that the bill would have exempted groceries, but she said people need other items that could have been taxed: school supplies, diapers, shoes, refrigerators. It’s true Esquivel has advocated for a sales tax, in exchange for lowering other taxes. But Howe takes this too far, by saying he’s going after bread-and-butter kitchen staples. The bill specifically exempts food items. Combine that with the dearth of information on what the bill, in its entirety, would have done and PolitiFact Oregon rates this Pants On Fire.

pomt-05582	"Having an entirely Democrat congressional delegation in 2009, when the [federal stimulus] bill passed, increases the per capita stimulus dollars that the state receives per person by $460."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/03/chain-email/e-mail-says-having-all-democrat-congressional-dele/	The 2009 federal stimulus package, designed to get the U.S. economy out of the Great Recession, continues to be controversial. A chain e-mail making the rounds claims that states where all the U.S. senators and congressmen were Democrats got a lot more money, as calculated on a per-resident basis. Headlined, "It looks like our present administration is leading us down the path to economic failure as a country . . . ," the e-mail says, "Stimulus dollars were highly correlated to which political party controlled the state: Having an entirely Democrat congressional delegation in 2009, when the bill passed, increases the per capita stimulus dollars that the state receives per person by $460." As a state where all four members of the congressional delegation are Democrats, we wondered if that were true. Using data from Recovery.gov, which listed the amount each state has received per person, we found that the five states that had all-Democrat congressional delegations in 2009 -- Hawaii, Massachusetts, North Dakota, New Mexico and Rhode Island -- received an average of $1,209.80 per capita. That's $216 more than the average for the rest of the states, not $460. And the five-state average is only $1.80 per person more than the lone state with NO Democrats in its congressional delegation -- Wyoming. It turns out that the e-mail is quoting part of a March 23, 2012, opinion column at FoxNews.com by economist John R. Lott Jr. Co-author (with conservative anti-tax activist Grover Norquist) of "Debacle: Obama's War on Jobs and Growth and What We Can Do Now to Regain Our Future," Lott examines whether the states that needed the money most actually received it. We contacted him. Lott sent us his spreadsheet that turned out to have more up-to-date -- and therefore larger -- numbers showing how much had been awarded by state. Once again, we segregated the five all-Democrat states and looked at the average. It was $1,787 per resident. That's an extra $338 per capita compared with the other states, but still significantly below $460. So where did Lott's number come from? If you create a graph that shows how much a state received per capita on one side and the percentage of Democrats in the congressional delegation on the other, you get a graph that looks like 50 drops of paint spattered against a wall. But in this case, there is a pattern to that spattering. Lott uncovered it with a statistical analysis that turned the scattershot data into a straight line, indicating the overall trend. The lesson of the line: whenever Democratic representation increased by 10 percentage points, the per-person allotment in the state increased by $46. Thus, he said, by that measure, going from 0 percent Democratic representation to 100 percent gives you an extra $460. Plenty of individual states don't conform to this, as demonstrated by the fact that, using Lott's data, the only all-Republican state of Wyoming got more money than two of the five all-Democrat states. (Lott did not include the District of Columbia, which has all Democrats in its non-voting delegation and has received five times more stimulus money per resident than the national average.) Lott's analysis on FoxNews.com make it clear that he is looking at trends, noting, for example, that "each one percentage point reduction in the percent of a state's workforce represented by unions saw a $26 drop in stimulus dollars per person." But the e-mail stripped out that context. So why would the Democrat-heavy states get more money? Democrats controlled the House and the Senate at the time the legislation was written and one provision, Lott said, was that "a lot of the funding could only go for union jobs." Heavily Democratic areas are more likely to have unions, including government employee unions. OUR RULING The chain e-mail says, "Having an entirely Democrat congressional delegation in 2009, when the [stimulus] bill passed, increases the per capita stimulus dollars that the state receives per person by $460." The original author of the claim calculated $460 using a sophisticated analysis to find a trend that considers the varying degree of Democrat and Republican representation in all states. But that's a different question. If you compare the all-Democrat states to all the other states, the correct number is closer to $338. So states with a purely Democrat congressional delegation have, in fact, garnered quite a bit more money per capita than other states. But because the $460 amount is off by about 36 percent, we rate the statement Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

abbc-00226	The Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, has again addressed the issue of people smuggling.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-07-23/fact-check-nz-immigration-asylum-seekers/9990360	Mr Dutton's claim is not the full story. New Zealand citizens travelling on a New Zealand passport are automatically granted a visa when entering Australia. This is because of a bilateral arrangement between New Zealand and Australia, known as the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, which allows their citizens free movement between the two countries. However, people seeking asylum in New Zealand do not enjoy this privilege. Furthermore, asylum seekers granted refugee status would still require special travel documents and would need to apply for a visa before travelling to Australia. Experts told Fact Check that asylum seekers faced a lengthy process before being in a position to travel freely between New Zealand and Australia, needing first to qualify for citizenship. Anna Copeland, of Murdoch University's Law School, told Fact Check: "It's hardly justifiable to conclude that allowing New Zealand to take asylum seekers would create a backdoor into Australia. "The process to New Zealand citizenship is a long one ... For refugees from Manus [Island] or Nauru, they would have to first become New Zealand citizens, which takes more than five years."

pomt-01213	"The NRA supported background checks..."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/nov/24/kathleen-murphy/kathleen-murphy-has-rosy-memory-nras-past-support-/	Fairfax County voters next month will replace Republican Del. Barbara Comstock, who won the 10th District congressional seat this fall. Democrat Kathleen Murphy recently launched a bid for the seat Comstock will leave in the state legislature. In a three-page platform, Murphy calls for "reasonable" gun regulations and explains her position in personal terms. "I lost my brother to gun violence," she wrote. "Two gunmen robbed and murdered him. He was the father of five young children..." Murphy said she wants to close the "gun show loophole" through which people can buy guns from private gun sellers without a background check. She suggested that even the National Rifle Association could back that proposal. "The NRA supported background checks after the tragedy of 9-11," she wrote on her website. We wondered if Murphy’s statement was correct. After we asked, Morgan Finkelstein, spokeswoman for the Democratic Party of Virginia, told us Murphy made a mistake. The candidate had meant to say the NRA supported background checks after the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Co. that killed 13. That was two years before the World Trade Center attack. Murphy promptly took down the statement from her website. A few days later, she replaced it with the statement, "The NRA supported background checks after the tragedy at Columbine High School." Rather than haggle over when the NRA might have supported background checks, we decided to examine the key issue raised by Murphy: Did the NRA ever support background checks? Our colleagues at PolitiFact national looked at similar claims that were made last year by President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The statements were based on congressional testimony by NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre on May 27, 1999 -- five weeks after the Columbine shootings. "We think it’s reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone," LaPierre told the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. "That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn’t new, or a change of position, or a concession. I’ve been on the record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and positions papers, to news interviews and press appearances." At the time, Congress was considering legislation to expand background checks. LaPierre outlined a series of proposals that the NRA found "reasonable," including "instant background checks." But the crux of his testimony was that he found provisions of the legislation unreasonable, such as the way the bill defined a gun show, how it allowed a three-business day period for background checks of potential gun buyers, and that the instant background check system didn’t destroy records of guns sales immediately. The NRA eventually backed a substitute proposal that would have expanded background checks. The bill extended the requirement, which affected only licensed firearm dealers, to individuals selling their personally-owned weapons at gun shows. But in return for closing the loophole, the NRA-backed bill shortened the time for completing background checks to 24 hours. That led to the death of the bill, with opponents saying the 24-hour deadline would drastically weaken the checks. The Washington Post Fact Checker wrote last year that the NRA’s background check proposal was so limited that many control advocates concluded it was a "sham." LaPierre’s testimony came up again last year amid the gun control debate that unfolded after shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Conn. that killed 26. In a January 2013 interview, CNN Anchor Anderson Cooper read LaPierre’s testimony and asked Sandy Froman, an NRA board member, whether the group had changed its mind on background checks. "Yes, the NRA has changed its position, and the reason it changed its position is because the system doesn’t work. The (National Instant Criminal Background Check) system is not working now. We have to get that working before we can add any more checks to that system. It’s already overburdened," Froman said. "Let’s get it working. Let’s make sure that the 23 states that aren’t reporting the names of people who are mentally ill and have violent tendencies, let’s get those reported and into the system and then we can take a look." Our ruling Murphy said the NRA once supported background checks. It’s correct that LaPierre, the group’s executive director, did testify after the 1999 Columbine tragedy that the NRA supported "mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale." But Murphy’s version of that event is rosy. There were caveats to LaPierre’s statement and many gun control advocates later that year would accuse the NRA of scuttling legislation to expand background tests. So Murphy’s statement is accurate, but needs more information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Kathleen Murphy	None	None	None	2014-11-24T15:01:36	2014-11-18	['None']

pomt-01372	"Every time somebody new gets the Ebola virus, it mutates."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/16/glenn-beck/beck-warns-massive-mutations-ebola-virus/	The prospect of wholesale economic and social collapse exerts a peculiar magnetism on some people. The fight against the Ebola virus is custom-made for such speculations and conservative radio host Glenn Beck raised them in full during the Oct. 15 broadcast of his radio show. Beck envisioned fearful Americans avoiding trips to the mall, leading to a downward spiral in consumer spending. Although to date, the virus has only been known to be transmitted by contact with the bodily fluids of one infected person, Beck said that would change. "Think of this America, please think of this," Beck said. "Every time somebody new gets the Ebola virus, it mutates. It's going to go aerosol." To go "aerosol" would mean water droplets from a sneeze or a cough could transmit the disease. There is no recorded case of this occurring with Ebola; one study positively asserts that the virus does not spread this way. Still, Beck argued that the 8,000 victims of Ebola in West Africa represent 8,000 "different combinations" of Ebola. Around PunditFact, we say there’s no way to check a prediction, but what we can do is dig deeper into Beck’s claim that the Ebola virus mutates with each new person it infects. We contacted Beck’s producers and they added some nuance that Beck left out. "Many of those mutations mean nothing, but some of them might be able to change the way the virus behaves inside the human body," the producers said in an email. According to two top infectious disease researchers, Beck is correct that the virus mutates, but left out what his producers later noted -- namely that not every mutation does anything to make Ebola more deadly or more difficult to treat. The explanation why can get technical, but you can break down what happens as a series of steps that reduce the impact of these genetic changes. By the way, both researchers also said that the virus doesn’t need a new victim to mutate. It mutates inside its host, even if it is never passed on. Most mutations hurt the virus You need to understand a basic fact about Ebola. As of now, there is no "cure," as in there are no drugs that kill Ebola. Doctors treat the symptoms of Ebola while the body fights the virus. In that respect, it’s like the flu. Adam Lauring is an assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School. Lauring explained that because Ebola is an RNA virus, each time it replicates in a person’s body, there’s a good chance that small changes will take place. But Lauring emphasized that most changes do not strengthen the virus or make it more resistant to human defenses. In fact, the typical mutation has the opposite effect. "The available data consistently show that most newly generated mutations in RNA viruses reduce fitness," Lauring said. "That is, most mutations are made and then lost from the population. They do not take hold." Put simply, the virus might mutate but it doesn’t really matter. Lauring said we should keep in mind that the Ebola virus largely works through the proteins it produces. The virus’ genes make the proteins and then the proteins help the virus infect more parts of the body. Lauring’s point is that with most mutations, the genes produce a protein that doesn’t do what the virus needs and that copy of the virus dies. Most mutations don’t change anything With the virus replicating itself billions of times in a single victim, some genetic drift will take hold. But in this group, there are two basic types: synonymous and non-synonymous. The difference is in how they affect proteins. "Synonymous mutations don’t change the protein sequence," Lauring said. Remember, the proteins determine how the virus works. If the proteins remain the same, so does the virus, for all practical purposes. (This is cellular biology so things are more complicated.) Since non-synonymous mutations change proteins, we’d want to know how often they happen in Ebola. Fortunately, a large team of researchers published a paper that goes directly to that point. Stephen Gire, a researcher at the Sabeti Lab at Harvard University, was one of the authors. Gire and his colleagues recently took samples from 78 patients in Sierra Leone over a three-week period. When they drilled down into the virus’ genome, they found 40 mutations that had taken place in "protein coding regions." About a third were non-synonymous. Put another way, 14 were able to change the proteins in the virus. The other 26 left the virus functionally as it had been before. Of that group of 14, eight occurred in regions that Gire called functionally interesting. But Gire emphasized, "that doesn’t necessarily mean that these mutations changed or helped the virus." Without more research, Gire said it’s impossible to know if these mutations actually made the virus more successful as an organism, and more able to move from one person to the next. Mutations might not be passed on Gire and his colleagues found that even those mutations that propagated in a victim’s bloodstream might go nowhere. "We have many instances where we see a mutation pop up, but then there are no transmissions from that patient and so that mutation potentially dies off," Gire said. This gets back to the central topic in Beck’s statement. It isn’t a question of whether the virus mutates, but whether it adapts to new environments and spreads out in a new form. "Mutation is not evolution," said Lauring. A solemn reminder This isn’t to say Ebola is not a serious threat. Gire and his co-authors wrote that "continued progression of this epidemic could afford an opportunity for viral adaptation, underscoring the need for rapid containment." At the very end of the article, there is this dedication: "Tragically, five co-authors, who contributed greatly to public health and research efforts in Sierra Leone, contracted EVD (Ebola) and lost their battle with the disease before this manuscript could be published: Mohamed Fullah, Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Alice Kovoma, and S. Humarr Khan. We wish to honor their memory." Our ruling Beck warned that every time someone new gets the Ebola virus, it mutates. First, mutation and replication go hand in hand and infecting a new person doesn’t change that. But the much larger point is that Beck is painting mutations with a broad brush. Most of them hurt the virus and are automatic dead-ends. Of those that don’t actually hurt it, about two-thirds don’t change how Ebola functions. Of those that change how the virus functions, there’s no data to say whether the functional changes matter. However, the most recent study in West Africa found that many new varieties are not passed on to new victims. Beck’s statement about Ebola mutations is partially accurate but leaves out important details. Accordingly, we rate it Half True.

pomt-14607	The debt "comes up all the time in town meetings ... but it's never asked in the debates. It's really weird. It hasn't been brought up."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/02/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-wrong-claim-national-debt-never-debate-to/	Just a day after finishing far back in the Republican pack in Iowa, Jeb Bush sought a fresh start in New Hampshire with an appearance at Franklin Pierce University in Rindge. Among other things, Bush responded to an attendee’s question about the national debt with an observation about how little attention the debt has gotten in the presidential campaign. The debt "comes up all the time in town meetings ... but it's never asked in the debates," Bush said. "It's really weird. It hasn't been brought up." Really? No moderator asked about the debt, and no candidate volunteered anything about it? We found that hard to believe -- and it turns out, Bush’s memory on this one is faulty. (Bush has taken part in each of the seven main-stage debates in 2015 and 2016.) His campaign did not respond to an inquiry. * * * Examples of questions about the debt asked during a debate Milwaukee Republican debate In the Milwaukee debate Nov. 10, 2015, Fox Business News’ Maria Bartiromo relayed a question from a Facebook user to Ohio Gov. John Kasich: "We are approaching $20 trillion in national debt. Specifically, what plans do you have to cut federal spending?" Bartiromo went on to say that "the national debt is at record highs and growing unsustainably. Interest will be the fastest-growing part of the federal budget, tripling over the next 10 years. Social Security, the lifeline of millions of American seniors, is rushing toward insolvency. With all of the tax plans presented tonight, estimated to cost anywhere between $2 trillion and $12 trillion over a decade, what specific steps will you take to balance the budget?" Kasich talked about his budget record as governor and plans for taxes and spending if he were elected president. "Lower taxes, lower spending," he said. "My website, JohnKasich.com, will show you exactly how we balance the budget. I balanced the budget in Washington as a chief architect, and I have balanced it in Ohio for one reason. When you balance the budget and you cut taxes, people get work. North Charleston, S.C., Republican debate In the GOP debate in North Charleston, S.C., Jan. 15, 2016, Fox Business News’ Bartiromo again brought up the debt. She cited "the $19 trillion debt" in a question to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about infrastructure spending. Bartiromo later addressed Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., saying, "One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare. What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure?" Both Christie and Rubio proceeded to answer her question by discussing their plans for taxes and spending. Other candidates joined the discussion as well. Christie also made a point of discussing his plan to shrink spending on entitlements such as Social Security over the long term. "The reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard," Christie said. "It's a hard problem. And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you." * * * Examples of candidates bringing up the debt on their own Las Vegas Republican debate In the Las Vegas debate Dec. 15, 2015, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., used his closing statement to address the debt. "The greatest threat to our national security is our debt," Paul said. "We borrow a million dollars a minute. And whose fault is it? Well, frankly, it's both parties' fault. You have those on the right who clamor and say, oh, we will spend anything on the military, and those on the left who say the same for domestic welfare. But what most Americans don't realize is there is an unholy alliance. They come together. There's a secret handshake. We spend more money on everything. And we are not a stronger nation if we go further into debt. We are not projecting power from bankruptcy court." Back in South Carolina Marco Rubio: "How about Obamacare, a certified job killer? It needs to be repealed and replaced. And we need to bring our debt under control, make our economy stronger. Des Moines, Iowa, Republican debate Paul: "I'm worried about the country and how much debt we're adding. And I am the one true fiscal conservative who will look at all spending. And that's the only way we'll ever balance our budget." * * * A question about the debt limit Boulder, Colo., Republican debate At the Boulder debate, Oct. 28, 2015, CNBC’s Carl Quintanilla asked Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, about the debt limit, which is related to the larger question of the federal debt because Congress must periodically reauthorize issuing more debt if the country is to avoid default. "Congressional Republicans, Democrats and the White House are about to strike a compromise that would raise the debt limit, prevent the government shutdown, and calm financial markets’ that fear that another Washington-created crisis is on the way," he asked Cruz. "Does your opposition to it show you’re not the kind of problem-solver that American voters want?" Cruz sidestepped the question. Our ruling Bush said that the debt "comes up all the time in town meetings ... but it's never asked in the debates. It's really weird. It hasn't been brought up." Questions about the size of the debt were most clearly asked in two of the debates, and perhaps that count could be expanded to a third if you include a question about the debt limit. A few candidates also brought up the issue on their own. We rate the claim False.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2016-02-02T17:00:57	2016-02-02	['None']
pomt-02930	"Wisconsin ranks No. 2 in economic growth", according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/nov/01/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-cites-philadelphia-fed-say-wiscon/	In recent weeks, Gov. Scott Walker -- and his allies -- began emphasizing an obscure measurement to argue that his policies were improving the state’s economy: an index created by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. It sounds like a prestigious, important metric. But until Walker started discussing the Philly Fed report, scant attention was paid to this index of states’ economies. The report is meant to predict how the states’ economies will grow in the next six months, but is seldom cited nationally and almost never used to compare one state with another. More on that last point later. But after the report issued Sept. 24, 2013, the Philly Fed became a talking point for Walker and his supporters, including the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, which featured it in a $1 million television ad campaign. For his part, Walker’s office highlighted the Sept. 24, 2013 report in public appearances, social media, and with a news release. The headline: "Wisconsin ranked #2 in economic growth." Amid concern about jobs, is Wisconsin really ranked second for economic growth? As we looked into Walker’s claim, we learned that there’s good reason the report doesn’t receive much attention: The index varies wildly from month to month. In late spring, the index ranked Wisconsin’s economy as second worst in the nation, behind only Wyoming. How did we go from bottom of the barrel to the cream of the crop? The Philly Fed index seeks to measure state-by-state economic growth using variables such as building permits, initial unemployment insurance claims and data from a survey of manufacturers. A key component is each state’s monthly jobs report. This figure is based on reports from only about 3 percent of the state’s employers. It comes with a large margin of error, is revised in subsequent months, and ultimately replaced with more-accurate quarterly figures that come from virtually all state employers. The preliminary Philly Fed report for April 2013 showed only five states with contraction, assigning Wisconsin an index rank of -0.74 percent. Wyoming, with a rank of -1.29 percent, was the only state with a lower index. Things changed in the report issued one month later. The state’s April ranking was revised to 40th. And the new report, for May, said Wisconsin had moved up to 20th place. This volatility is identical to that seen in the monthly jobs reports. Walker’s own administration once highlighted those jobs reports as a measure of success, but now criticizes them as inaccurate. Yet the same data is used to create the Philly Fed index. State by state comparisons? The Philly Fed doesn’t provide a first-to-worst listing for the states, but it is easily created by ranking states by the percentage change in the states’ indexes from month to month. That is what Walker did in September, when he declared the August numbers showed Wisconsin ranked second. The index for Wisconsin grew 0.51 percent from July to August. The only other state that had a larger change was North Dakota, which increased 0.52 percent. Nationally, the index changed 0.23 percent in the same time frame. To be clear, the Philly Fed doesn’t do the ranking. The bank provides the monthly index and shows the change on a map. States are grouped into seven categories based on the size of the change. It’s a simple process to calculate the percentage change, and then sort them from highest to lowest. After Walker touted the number, the Philly Fed issued a statement saying that it was wrong to use its data to compare performance between states: "We do not consider state rankings based on the coincident and leading indexes to be valid." When we asked the governor’s office about this, they said such state-to-state comparisons were valid, and cited an unusual source: The Philly Fed itself. Walker’s staff pointed us to the part of the bank’s website that explains the indexes. it reads: "The model and the input variables are consistent across the 50 states, so the state indexes are comparable to one another." When we went back to the bank, spokeswoman Marilyn Wimp said they were sticking with their most recent statement -- don’t compare states -- despite what the website says. And bank spokesman Thomas Elliott directed us to a January 2013 report issued by the bank that evaluates the effectiveness of the index. That report says the index provides a good measure of states’ economies but that state-by-state comparisons are problematic because the system doesn’t provide good measurements for states that have a lot of agriculture or mining. Here is the relevant portion: "Since the volatility of the percent change in these indexes is relatively large compared to the average change, an individual state’s ranking based on the percent change can jump wildly from one end of a relatively narrow range to the other. Rank order is not persistent, thus state rankings are misleading." We asked Elliott if the bank has told Walker not to make state-to-state comparisons. "We were proactive in reaching out to those who mischaracterized our indexes," he responded. Our rating Walker said the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank ranks Wisconsin as "No. 2 in economic growth." But the bank did not provide the information as a ranking and maintains it is not valid to make such state-to-state comparisons. What’s more, the number for each state is based in part on monthly employment numbers which Walker’s own administration has criticized as inaccurate. Still, the fact the bank’s own website seems to invite a comparison. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2013-11-01T06:00:00	2013-09-24	['Wisconsin']
pomt-04766	"Half the kids coming out of college this year … can't find a job, or a job that's consistent with a college degree."	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/aug/27/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-right-getting-job-right-out-college-ca/	As former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., fielded questions from New Hampshire voters this week, Romney shared a new take on the American Dream. A junior at St. Anselm College in Manchester, NH, where Romney and Ryan visited, asked Romney what he’s going to do to help American students with debt coming out of college. "The first thing I’m going to do for you, is make sure we don’t keep on adding more, more and more debt that you don’t even know about," Romney said. "That’s number one. Number two, the next thing I’m going to do for you, is to make sure that when you graduate, you can get a job. Half the kids coming out of college this year, half, can't find a job, or a job that's consistent with a college degree. It's unacceptable. We have to make sure young people coming into the workforce can get a job. "I think it was Dick Armey the other day, who practiced a little humor, he said, ‘It used to be in America, that the American Dream was owning your own home. Now it’s getting kids out of the home you own.’ I want to make sure that you’re able to get a home of your own. That you can have a good job. That you can start paying back the debt." The former Texas congressman’s joke got some chuckles from the crowd. But half of college graduates are either unemployed or underemployed? That’s not a laughing matter. PolitiFact decided to check the claim to see if Romney was right. First, we reached out to Romney’s campaign to get the sources behind his statement. Romney spokesman Ryan Williams pointed to articles by the Associated Press and Time.com that each address the bleak job market for 2012 college graduates. PolitiFact also checked its coffer of claims and found a similar statement made by the Republican Jewish Coalition in June. It said, "One out of every two kids who are graduating college right now can't find a job," which was deemed Mostly True. PolitiFact used that same Associated Press article, which has the headline, "In Weak Job Market, One In Two College Graduates Are Jobless Or Underemployed," to reach its ruling. The article is based on research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which in turn is based on data from the federal Current Population Survey, as well as Labor Department measures of what level of education is required to perform each of some 900 jobs. Here’s how the AP summarized the findings: "A weak labor market already has left half of young college graduates either jobless or underemployed in positions that don't fully use their skills and knowledge. Young adults with bachelor's degrees are increasingly scraping by in lower-wage jobs – waiter or waitress, bartender, retail clerk or receptionist, for example – and that's confounding their hopes a degree would pay off despite higher tuition and mounting student loans. ... "About 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed. … Out of the 1.5 million who languished in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year." According to our interpretation of the article, Romney got it right: about 50 percent of recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in jobs that aren’t commensurate with their degree. Of this 50 percent figure, about half are unemployed and about half are in jobs that don’t require a college degree. The Republican Jewish Coalition missed the fact that a large part of the 50 percent figure is made up by students that are underemployed. PolitiFact also checked with Andrew Sum, the Northeastern professor who did the research for the Associated Press story. Sum agreed with our analysis. We also think there’s an additional piece of context worth mentioning. People shouldn’t compare this 50 percent rate to the more familiar unemployment rate, which was most recently recorded at 8.5 percent for June 2012. The reality is that even in strong economic times, a sizable percentage of recent college grads is either unemployed or employed in jobs below their abilities. According to the AP, the record low was still pretty high at 41 percent, in 2000 -- "before the dot-com bust erased job gains for college graduates in the telecommunications and (information technology) fields." That’s far higher than the more familiar unemployment statistic for the overall population ever gets. Still, there’s reason to be concerned about the current rate: At 53.6 percent, it’s the highest it’s been in at least 11 years. Our ruling Romney was right to say that half of American college graduates this year are either unemployed or underemployed, and he interpreted the corresponding research correctly. We give him a True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-08-27T14:39:38	2012-08-20	['None']
pomt-07188	"Studies show that people that are on welfare are higher users of drugs than people not on welfare."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/jun/09/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-welfare-recipients-are-more-likely/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott is defending his decision to sign a bill into law requiring drug tests for potential cash welfare recipients by saying that people who get welfare are more likely to be on drugs. During an appearance on CNN on June 5, 2011, Scott was asked what evidence he had that people receiving welfare assistance in Florida are using drugs. "Studies show that people that are on welfare are higher users of drugs than people not on welfare," Scott said. He started to continue his thought -- but was cut off by host T.J. Holmes. (You can watch the entire exchange by clicking here.) "Sir, to that point ... that would stop people in their tracks. And I don't have whatever study you are referring to, but you're saying that people out there who need this assistance, lost jobs, are on welfare, have a higher tendency to use drugs," Holmes said. "Absolutely," Scott responded. "Studies show that people on welfare are using drugs much higher than other people in the population. But the bottom line is, if they're not using drugs, it's not an issue. Our taxpayers don't want to subsidize somebody's drug addiction. It's going to increase personal responsibility. It's the right thing to do for Floridians." Are cash welfare recipients more likely to be drug users than other Floridians? Details about the drug-testing law Scott had run for office promising a drug-testing requirement, and he worked to broaden the original drug-testing bill that would have applied only to recent drug felons. The final bill, HB 353, which Scott signed on May 31, forces all people who receive welfare cash -- called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families -- to pass a drug test in order to be eligible for the funds. If prospective recipients fail a first test, they would lose benefits for one year. A second positive drug test would make them ineligible for three years. About 233,000 Floridians applied for cash assistance in 2009-10, according to statistics kept by the Department of Children and Families. During May 2011, 93,170 Floridians received cash assistance, a drop of 8.3 percent from a year ago. Payments can range from $100 to $200 a month per person. Under the law -- which takes effect July 1 -- welfare applicants would have to pay for the test. If they pass, the state would reimburse them for the cost, which can range from $10 to $25. Florida has tried to initiate drug testing before. The Legislature in 1998 approved a drug-testing pilot project for people receiving temporary cash assistance. But the results were underwhelming. Of the 8,797 applicants screened for drugs, only 335 (3.8 percent) showed evidence of having a controlled substance in their systems and failed the test, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The pilot project cost the state $2.7 million (or about $90 a test). The Legislature ultimately abandoned the program. Scott's case: Welfare recipients and drug use Scott spokesman Lane Wright provided PolitiFact Florida with government and academic research that suggests people receiving government assistance are more likely to use illicit drugs than people who are not. The government analysis comes from the Department of Health and Human Services, which -- through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency -- conducts an annual National Survey on Drug Use & Health. (A lot of long names, sorry.) The survey has been conducted since 1971. Surveyors administer questions through face-to-face interviews at the subject's home. Results are based on tens of thousands of responses. Government researchers used the 1999 and 2000 surveys to publish a report titled "Substance Use Among Persons in Families Receiving Government Assistance." Among the findings, researchers concluded that "past-month illicit drug use was higher in assisted families than in unassisted families among persons aged 12 to 64." Specifically, the report found that 9.6 percent of people in families receiving some type of government assistance reported recent drug use, compared to 6.8 percent among people in families receiving no government assistance at all. The government research, we should note, extends beyond the scope of what Scott is talking about -- cash payments through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program -- and includes families receiving food stamps, non-cash assistance through housing assistance or child care, and people receiving Medicaid. It also is 11 years old. But it does provide at least some grounding for Scott's claim. We asked Bradford Stone, a government spokesman for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency, if researchers have used more recent survey data to complete the same analysis regarding drug use and welfare assistance. Stone said researchers have not. The second report is from Harold Pollack, a professor at the University of Chicago who studies substance abuse among welfare recipients, and Lisa Metsch, a professor at the University of Miami. The 2009 report, "Substance Use Among Welfare Recipients: Trends and Policy Responses," concluded that "substance abuse and dependence are relatively uncommon" for people receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families dollars. Yet the same research found -- by reviewing many different surveys -- that "approximately 20 percent of TANF recipients report that they have used an illicit drug at least once in the past year." In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Pollack said that his research helps support Scott's claim -- but it also doesn't. "It is true that compared to other women of the same age, TANF recipients are more likely to use illicit substances," Pollack said. "That's a fact. "On the other hand, there are a couple of major caveats," Pollack added. Pollack said that most women who have used an illicit drug in the past year do not meet the diagnosis of being dependent on drugs, or abusing drugs. A lot of casual marijuana users may well test positive, Pollack said, but they do not have a "drug problem." Nor are they feeding a habit with welfare dollars, Pollack said. The other case: Welfare recipients and drug use The American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the drug-testing requirement, offered other government and academic research to consider. Researchers at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a part of the National Institutes of Health, published findings in 1996 that said welfare recipients "using, abusing, or dependent on alcohol or illicit drugs are consistent with proportions of both the adult U.S. population and adults who do not receive welfare." The research relied on 1992 data and concluded that drug use among welfare recipients ranged between 1.3 to 3.6 percent, compared to 1.5 percent for non-welfare recipients. The caveats here are much like the government research Scott provided. Namely, it includes other types of welfare than cash assistance, and it's old. The report was published in 1996, and relies on 1992 data. Another researcher used data from Michigan -- a state that participated in drug-testing for welfare recipients until the program was ruled unconstitutional. In Michigan, 10 percent of recipients tested positive for illicit drugs. That's comparable to The National Survey on Drug Use & Health, which found that in 2007-08, 8.95 percent of all Michigan residents (grouping non-welfare and welfare recipients) said they used illicit drugs in the last month. Lastly, the ACLU highlighted the work of professors Robert Crew Jr. and Belinda Creel Davis, who studied Florida's attempt to drug test welfare recipients. In two research papers, "Substance Abuse as a Barrier to Employment of Welfare Recipients" and "Assessing the Effects of Substance Abuse Among Applicants for TANF Benefits: The Outcome of a Demonstration Project in Florida," Crew and Davis assessed the results of the Florida program. They found that only 5 percent of welfare recipients showed evidence of drug abuse. But, Crew and Davis noted, the number is low in comparison to other data and raises "some questions about the procedures employed by the state." Yet, Crew and Davis also concluded: "The evidence from Florida suggests that the concern on the part of both citizens and public officials about substance abuse among welfare recipients may be unwarranted. Evidence from previous research on the welfare population in Florida shows that controlled substances are low (about 5 percent) when measured by a urine test." The study also concluded that welfare recipients who do use drugs are able to compete for jobs just like middle- and upper-class drug users -- meaning drug use isn't creating their reliance on welfare. But Crew, who teaches at Florida State University, told us that his research didn't try to compare drug use among TANF recipients and non-TANF recipients. "We didn't try to compare that population in Florida," he said. "I don't know how to do that." Crew said his research had two major conclusions -- which we previously noted. The percentage of welfare recipients who used drugs in Florida was "pretty small," and in terms of those recipients finding work, "it didn't make much difference whether they used drugs or not." Our ruling Let's remember what Scott said. He told CNN's T.J. Holmes that, "Studies show that people that are on welfare are higher users of drugs than people not on welfare." Scott's office provided evidence that supports that claim. Sort of. And opponents provided evidence that refutes Scott's claim. Sort of. What's obvious is that it's difficult to make broad generalizations about a whole group of people. And it's even more difficult to definitively measure drug use. Scott's statement is at least partially accurate because there are studies showing a higher prevalence of drug use among some welfare recipients. But he also is neglecting research that suggests that drug use among welfare and non-welfare recipients is consistent. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-10359	"The Iranians continue – in the view of every objective observer – continue to pursue the acquisition of nuclear weapons."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/07/john-mccain/no-consensus-on-irans-nuke-program/	Sen. John McCain ratcheted up his rhetoric against Iran in a recent campaign appearance, alleging that "every objective observer" believes the country is pursuing nuclear weapons. It's an incendiary accusation – maybe even a case for war. But is it true? No. In fact, the U.S. intelligence community said in its latest National Intelligence Estimate that "in fall 2003, Tehran halted its nuclear weapons program." The estimate cautioned that Iran was "keeping open the option" to develop nuclear weapons. And the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a United Nations affiliate, said in May it has "serious concern" about Iran's lack of transparency with respect to its nuclear program. But both of those sources – and plenty of other objective observers – have said there is no proof Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons. McCain's comments came during a June 24 telephone town hall meeting with South Florida voters. "Just one other issue I want to talk about of course is Iran/Israel," McCain said. "The Iranians continue – in the view of every objective observer – to continue to pursue the acquisition of nuclear weapons. It would destabilize the Middle East." Under the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, a global accord, the country is permitted to seek nuclear power but not nuclear weapons. Iran acknowledges it is enriching uranium, the most difficult task on the path to manufacturing a nuclear weapon. But the nation's leaders steadfastly maintain that they want the uranium to power reactors for nuclear energy, not to arm nuclear weapons. They say the country's supreme leader forbade the pursuit of nuclear weapons in a 2005 fatwa, or religious edict. "The Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has issued the fatwa that the production, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons are forbidden under Islam and that the Islamic Republic of Iran shall never acquire these weapons," the country told the IAEA in a 2005 statement . Iran's leaders regularly repeat such denials. In defending McCain's claim, his spokesman Brian Rogers pointed out that among those who have expressed concerns about Iran's nuclear program are the IAEA, the U.N. Security Council, former U.N. weapons inspector David Albright, nonpartisan think tanks and even Sen. Barack Obama. "It is on this basis that Senator McCain believes Iran continues to pursue nuclear weapons," Rogers said in an e-mail. It is true that there is widespread concern in the international community about Iran's intentions. Once Iran has enriched uranium into nuclear fuel – a technological Holy Grail the country has pursued furiously and claims to have mastered – it could, without much further difficulty, make highly enriched uranium. Once it has accomplished that, it could fairly easily make a nuclear bomb. The IAEA declared in 2005 that Iran's history of concealing nuclear activities constituted a breach of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The agency said "good progress has been made in Iran's correction of the breaches," but there was an "absence of confidence that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes." The IAEA has inspected the country's nuclear facilities unannounced at least 14 times in the past 15 months to try to verify that Iran is pursuing only nuclear energy, not weapons. In a May 26 report , it leveled a series of strong criticisms against Iran. It said Iran had not yet provided access to some uranium mines and research facilities the IAEA wanted to see. The IAEA said it had "serious concern" about studies Iran allegedly conducted in years past on high-explosives testing, missile design and a type of uranium called green salt. It said it wanted more information on a 1987 document on uranium metal – potentially a component of a nuclear bomb – that Iran said it received unsolicited from Pakistan years ago. And the IAEA said it had questions about the work of several military-related institutes, defense companies and scientists in Iran. "At this stage, Iran has not provided the agency with all the information, access to documents and access to individuals necessary to support Iran's statements," about the peaceful nature of its nuclear program, the IAEA said. But most of the questions the agency raised had to do with alleged activities that took place before 2003, when U.S. intelligence agencies said Iran halted its pursuit of nuclear weapons. And the IAEA reported that it "has been able to continue to verify the nondiversion of declared nuclear material (to military programs) in Iran." It said it had all the nuclear material it knows about in Iran under "containment and surveillance." The agency said that apart from the uranium metal document, it had "no information ... on the actual design or manufacture by Iran of nuclear material components of a nuclear weapon or of certain other key components, such as initiators, or on related nuclear physics studies." Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the IAEA, has maintained that stance for months. "What we have seen in the past (is) that certain procurements that have not been reported to us, certain experiments," ElBaradei told CNN in October 2007. "And that's where we are working now with Iran to clarify the past and the present. But I have not received any information that there is a complete active nuclear weapon program going on right now." Indeed, when U.S. intelligence agencies summarized their findings in last year's National Intelligence Estimate, they said Iran was believed to have had a nuclear weapons program in years past – despite its claims to the contrary – but that it halted the program in 2003 "in response to international pressure." Suzanne Maloney, a former policy adviser on Iran in the Bush administration through last year and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Iran's ongoing enrichment program "has a military dimension to it," since it would give the country the capability to produce a nuclear bomb. But, she conceded, McCain's statement "shades the legitimate gray area that exists about what Iran is doing now." Steven Aftergood, project director at the Federation of American Scientists, concurred. "There are different ways to lay out the facts and to state them more or less provocatively," Aftergood said. "But I don't think there is a basis to state categorically that they are pursuing nuclear weapons." So there are "objective observers," including some in the U.S. intelligence community, who are not convinced Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons. Surely McCain knew that when he said otherwise. Of course, we aren't able to answer the underlying question of whether Iran is seeking nuclear weapons, as McCain believes. We only can examine the part of his statement where McCain claims there is a consensus among "objective observers" in support of his belief. And on that, the evidence is clear: McCain is wrong. The facts say False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-07-07T00:00:00	2008-06-24	['None']
pomt-08996	“In Rick Perry’s Texas, we import nurses ... from other countries.”	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/14/bill-white/white-perrys-texas-we-import-nurses/	What do nurses and welders have in common? According to Bill White, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, those are two jobs in the state that foreign workers fill. During his June 25 speech to delegates at the Texas Democratic Party convention in Corpus Christi, White said the values of his Republican opponent, who has been governor for more than 10 years, are out of step with Texans’, saying: “Rick Perry’s Texas is different than our Texas. ... In Rick Perry’s Texas, we import nurses and welders from other countries.” We’ll leave welders for another day. In this article, we’re checking the nurses’ element. Katy Bacon, White’s spokeswoman, said the hiring of foreign nurses shows the state has failed to educate enough Texans for the jobs. That's a Perry issue “since he's the leader of state government, and the primary function of state government is education," Bacon said. "The buck stops at his desk.” Bacon backed White's statement about Texas importing nurses by pointing to the National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses, taken every few years by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration. The latest study, completed in 2004, had Texas among six states employing the bulk of the nation’s foreign-educated registered nurses. The leader was California (28.6 percent), followed by Florida (10.7 percent), New York (10.4 percent), Texas (7.5 percent), New Jersey (6.9 percent) and Illinois (5.6 percent). The survey found that the majority of the nation's foreign-educated nurses went to school in the Philippines, Canada or the United Kingdom. Based on a sample of nurses -- not a head count -- the report estimated that in 2004, Texas had 6,738 registered nurses who had attended foreign nursing schools. Counting licensed nurses, the Texas Board of Nursing put the number significantly higher: It said 20,048 internationally educated registered nurses were eligible to work in Texas in 2004. The number increased more or less steadily from 18,358 in 2000 to 24,483 in 2009, when they accounted for 11 percent of the state's 219,458 registered eligible nurses. News reports from the early 2000s confirmed that Texas hospitals were recruiting nurses from abroad to help fill their staffs. That's not new. Clair Jordan, executive director of the Texas Nurses Association, said foreign-trained nurses were even more prevalent decades ago. From the 1960s through the 1980s, she said, as many as 30,000 foreign-trained nurses may have been hired to work in Texas. Jordan said very few Americans go overseas for training. In the past few years, said Jordan, the nursing pinch has been eased somewhat by the economic downturn (which reduced job turnover as some nurses put off retirement or worked more hours) and an increase in graduates from the state’s nursing schools. Federal visa restrictions have also hampered foreign recruitment, said Amanda Engler, a spokeswoman for the Texas Hospital Association. What's been state government's role in all this? In 1999, the year before Perry became governor, the Texas Nurses Association joined with other organizations to address the nursing shortage, according to a report written in 2008 and updated this year by the Texas Team -- 10 state, industry, higher education and legislative leaders selected by the governor's office. Among the concerns raised by the coalition: Too many qualified applicants were being turned away from the state's nursing programs, mainly because the schools lacked the resources to train them. Graduating more nurses was one of the group's legislative goals. Since 2001, the Legislature has appropriated more than $100 million to tackle the nursing shortage, according to the nurses association. Enrollment in registered nursing programs increased 62 percent from 2001 to 2009 and graduates increased 81 percent, according to the Texas Center for Nursing Workforce Studies and the Texas Board of Nursing. What has Perry done? Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for the governor’s campaign, said Perry “has led the charge to improve the nursing shortage and nursing education in Texas.” We found five examples, from 2002 to 2010, of Perry citing the shortage in speeches and endorsing efforts to help expand the educational system. Under “Nursing Education Efforts” on his office's website, Perry touts several legislative actions, starting with the Professional Nursing Shortage Reduction Program, which he signed into law in 2001. The legislation, authored by then-Sen. Mike Moncrief, D-Fort Worth, established grant programs for nursing schools to increase student enrollment and retain faculty members. Elizabeth Sjoberg, associate general counsel for the Texas Hospital Association, told us Perry “has supported initiatives to address the nursing shortage for a number of years.” Sjoberg noted that Perry’s wife, Anita, is a former nurse. Despite the improvements, Sjoberg said, Texas still has catching up to do. In a 2010 report, the Texas Center for Nursing Workforce Studies said that by 2020, Texas will be short about 70,000 full-time registered nurses as the state continues to grow, its population ages and older nurses retire. The center said that to meet the demand for registered nurses by 2020, the number of graduates will need to triple from the 2009 level, when 8,211 people graduated. Texas nursing schools are still turning away qualified applicants -- about 8,700 in 2009, primarily because the schools lack sufficient faculty, the center reports. Upshot: White is correct that Texas imports nurses from abroad. But implying that Perry is to blame for that disregards the governor's efforts to address a shortage that existed before he became governor, and has persisted despite efforts by the state to produce more Texas-trained nurses. We rate White's statement as Half True.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-07-14T06:00:00	2010-06-25	['Texas']
pomt-03220	Says he "sued Obama’s EPA seven times."	true	/texas/statements/2013/aug/21/barry-smitherman/puc-and-railroad-commission-smitherman-part-seven-/	Want to burnish your conservative credentials in Texas? Doesn’t hurt to point out how many times you’ve sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Campaigning for attorney general, Railroad Commission head Barry Smitherman uploaded a video to YouTube on Aug. 5, 2013, in which he said that he’d "sued Obama’s EPA seven times to protect Texas jobs and energy for our families." PolitiFact Texas examined a related statement May 10, 2013, from the man holding the job Smitherman wants. State Attorney General Greg Abbott said he’d sued President Barack Obama’s administration 25 times, a claim we rated as True. Now running for governor, Abbott is highlighting his suits against the EPA (he’s up to 19). In many lawsuits, Abbott acts at the request of a department or branch of Texas state government. Spokeswoman Lauren Bean told us for that story, "We file them on behalf of state agencies. We’re the lawyer, they’re the client." That client capacity, Smitherman told us by phone, was the role he took in seven lawsuits spanning his time at the state Public Utilities Commission (2004-2011, became chairman in 2007), and Railroad Commission (2011-present, became chairman in 2012). The suits deal with greenhouse gases, cross-state air pollution and specific airborne toxins such as mercury. "What we have seen with all of these," Smitherman said, "is this EPA initiating rule-making that in my opinion is not backed up by law." His spokesman, Allen Blakemore, emailed us a list and descriptions of the seven lawsuits that he said Smitherman had, either individually or on behalf of the commissions, referred to the attorney general. What action is involved in such a referral "depends upon the case," Blakemore said. For example, in the two lawsuits that involved Smitherman’s role on the Railroad Commission, he said, "the commission voted to request representation by" Abbott. "A letter was then written to the AG requesting that action be taken against EPA." Here’s the top of one such letter, signed by Railroad Commission chairwoman Elizabeth Ames Jones and by railroad commissioners Smitherman and David Porter, dated Aug. 23, 2011: We looked up the lawsuits on PACER, a federal service providing public access to records from U.S. district, bankruptcy and appellate courts. All originated after Obama’s first inauguration Jan. 20, 2009. Smitherman is personally named as a plaintiff in three cases in his capacity as head of the PUC. The other four cases list only the agencies’ names as plaintiffs, but going by their filing dates, Smitherman was PUC chairman when two were filed, a member of the Railroad Commission when one was filed and chairman of the Railroad Commission in the most recent case. Five lawsuits involving the PUC, Texas’ regulator of electrical and telecommunication utilities, challenged EPA restrictions on greenhouse gases that Blakemore said "threatened the ability of electric utilities to receive permits, modifications or build new facilities." The two suits involving the Railroad Commission, Texas’ regulator of oil and gas, addressed a cross-state air pollution rule and a restriction on airborne mercury and other toxins that, Blakemore said, adversely affected mining for lignite used in electricity generation. (Created in 1891 to oversee, well, railroads, the commission ooched into energy after getting jurisdiction in 1917 over pipelines transporting oil and gas.) We asked University of Texas Law School professor Charles Silver, whose specialties include the procedures and practices used in civil lawsuits, if it’s reasonable to say Smitherman "sued" the EPA in these cases. "Seems fair to me," Silver told us via email. "In ordinary conversations, people don’t make the sort of technical distinctions you identify" -- such as being specifically named as a plaintiff vs. the commission being named -- "even though they’re accurate." Our ruling Smitherman said he "sued Obama’s EPA seven times." In the seven EPA lawsuits -- all during the Obama administration -- that his spokesman identified, either Smitherman or the commission he served on at the time is named as a plaintiff. We rate his statement as True. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-08232	"This is the first time a party has picked up multiple seats during a regular election since the mid 1980s, making this the largest majority of any party in more than 25 years."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/nov/16/mike-haridopolos/incoming-senate-president-mike-haridopolos-says-fi/	Election Day 2010 dealt a severe blow to Democrats statewide, with several congressional and state legislative seats crossing over to the Republican column. Just two years after Florida voters helped deliver the presidency to Barack Obama, Florida Republicans savored the mid-term election results that ushered conservative Marco Rubio into the U.S. Senate, business mogul Rick Scott into the governor’s office, and seven additional Republicans into the state Legislature. "This is the first time a party has picked up multiple seats during a regular election since the mid 1980s, making this the largest majority of any party in more than 25 years," said incoming Senate President Mike Haridopolos in a post-election interview on Nov. 2, 2010. "This increase will allow our Republican-led Legislature to tackle tough issues facing our state in the upcoming 2011 legislative session -- from balancing our state's budget to reforming Medicaid and cutting wasteful government spending, all with our conservative principles in mind." We decided to take a closer look at Haridopolos’ claim. First, was this the first time since 1984 that a party had picked up multiple seats during a regular election? Second, is this the largest majority of any party in more than 25 years? Picking up seats This election season, the GOP picked up five state House seats formerly held by Democrats and two state Senate seats. In addition, Republican Jeff Atwater defeated Democrat Loranne Ausley for the state’s chief financial officer post. The cabinet position was vacated by Democrat Alex Sink in her failed bid for governor. On the federal level, state Republicans picked up four congressional seats once held by Democrats. These seats included Allen West’s victory over Rep. Ron Klein for a district spanning Broward and Palm Beach counties; Steve Southerland’s win over Blue Dog Democrat Rep. Allen Boyd of North Florida; firebrand Rep. Alan Grayson’s defeat by Republican stalwart Daniel Webster in Orlando; and GOP state Rep. Sandy Adams’ win over Democratic incumbent Suzanne Kosmas in Brevard County. But with Republicans gaining in the state at all levels over the past two decades, surely the party has picked up "multiple seats" before now, right? Haridopolos communications director David Bishop clarified that the incoming Senate president was referring to the state Senate only when he said, "This is the first time a party has picked up multiple seats during a regular election since the mid 1980s." Bishop contends Haridopolos' statement is correct dating back to 1988, and he sent us a list that we verified is accurate. Special elections to fill vacancies, and senators switching parties have helped give Republicans an edge in certain non-general election years. But when it comes to regular elections, Republicans in the Senate have either picked up only one seat at a time or remained the same starting with the 1988 general election. For example, after the 1990 general election, there were 17 Republicans in the Senate, and two years later there were 20. At a glance, it appears that Republicans picked up three seats during the 1992 election, but a closer look reveals that a special election and a party switch helped bridge some of that gap. In June 1991, Republican Locke Burt of Ormond Beach narrowly defeated a Democratic challenger during a special election, bringing the GOP tally up to 18. That number went up to 19 in April 1992 when former Sen. Vince Bruner of Fort Walton Beach switched to the GOP. When the 1992 general election came in November, Republicans were able to pick up an additional seat. In other examples from non-general election years, Senate Republicans made gains in February 1995 when W.D. Childers of Pensacola switched to the GOP, and in March 1998 when former Rep. John Laurent of Bartow won a special election to fill a seat vacated by Democratic Sen. Rick Dantzler of Winter Haven who resigned to focus on an unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign. So Haridopolos is correct in saying that this is the first time the party has picked up multiple Senate seats during a regular election season, but he was off a bit in saying since the mid 1980s, because it last happened in 1988. Largest majority? As for the second part of Haridopolos’ statement, that "this is the largest majority any party has seen in 25 years," with the count now stacked at 81-39 in the House and 28-12 in the Senate it’s hard to argue otherwise. The last time either party saw a larger majority was between 1982 and 1984, when the Democrats held control of the House with an 84-36 majority, and 32-8 in the Senate. That was the start of Bob Graham’s second term as governor and it would also be the last time Democrats would post such high numbers. Each subsequent election, Republicans made small gains that chiseled away at the Democrats' once-strong block. Democrats remained in control of both the House and Senate up until the 1992 elections, covering the first two years of Lawton Chiles’ first term as governor. While Democrats were able to keep control of the House in 1992, the Senate was deadlocked with a 20-20 split. Then when the 1994 midterm elections rolled around, Republicans continued to make inroads and held control of the Senate with a 21-19 majority. It was during the 1996 elections, when President Bill Clinton carried Florida in his re-election bid, that Republicans finally sealed their lock on both chambers with a 61-59 majority in the House, and a 23-17 majority in the Senate. Ever since that decisive 1996 election, Republicans have remained in control of both chambers in the Legislature. In fact, while Republicans were able to gain seven seats in both chambers of the Legislature combined during the 2010 elections, it was between the 1994 and 1996 elections that they gained the most seats in the past 25 years, with a total of 11 seats. So back to the question at hand. How accurate was Haridopolos in stating, "This is the first time a party has picked up multiple seats during a regular election since the mid 1980s, making this the largest majority of any party in more than 25 years?" His comment wasn't clear that he was referring only to the state Senate with "multiple seats," and he could have been slightly more accurate by specifying since the late 1980s. Haridopolos was correct, though, in saying that this is the largest majority in the past quarter-century. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-06831	"Almost 88,000 United States service members are still missing and unaccounted for, dating back to World War II."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/08/jack-conners/assemblyman-jack-conners-says-almost-88000-us-serv/	As the United States continues to wage battle overseas, Assemblyman Jack Conners said the nation can’t stop looking for service members still missing from past wars. "Almost 88,000 United States service members are still missing and unaccounted for, dating back to World War II," Conners (D-Camden) wrote in a July 16 opinion column for The Times of Trenton. "For the families of these soldiers, closure has never come." Conners, chairman of the Assembly’s Military and Veterans’ Affairs committee, argued for continued support for the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, which is dedicated to accounting for all Americans missing from past conflicts. Without the work of that group, he said, "closure may never come." PolitiFact New Jersey thought the number of unaccounted-for soldiers seemed high and checked Conners’ statistic. We found that while the assemblyman was mostly correct, the number of missing and unaccounted for from World War II was recently lowered. A spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, Tom Hester Jr., sent us a news release from 2010 and an article from 2009 from the U.S. Department of Defense that said 88,000 service members are missing or unaccounted for since World War II to back up Conners’ claim. Hester also said the number is cited by veterans’ groups, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, which referenced the figure in an opinion column posted July 13 on its website. And up until a few months ago, that number was accurate. The Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office oversees the U.S. Department of Defense’s efforts to account for Americans missing from past conflicts. The agency keeps statistics on the number of service members still unaccounted for -- and they now put the number at 83,601, including: 73,792 from World War II, 7,997 from the Korean War, 125 from the Cold War and 1,687 from the Vietnam War. There are also two U.S. service members missing from the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The biggest change in the overall figure is attributable to the number of missing from World War II, which was reduced from about 78,000 to more than 73,000 in May, according to Maj. Carie Parker, spokeswoman for the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office. After World War II ended, the Army launched an initiative called "The Return of the World War II Dead Program" to account for all of the more than 400,000 Americans who died during the war, according to the missing personnel office’s website. When that program ended in 1951, an estimated 78,000 service members were still unaccounted for, according to Parker. In 2003, Parker said her agency found a 1956 roster of unaccounted-for service members that put the number at more than 80,000. Since then, more than 6,000 on that roster were found to have been buried at sea and another 780 remains were identified. Parker said the revised total of unaccounted-for service members from World War II was updated in May of this year. Joe Davis, director of public affairs for the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States’ Washington, D.C. office, said in an email that his organization wasn’t aware "the total missing and unaccounted-for number was lowered from 88,000 to 83,000 until just recently," and pointed out that in a recent opinion column by "the VFW and seven other veteran and POW/MIA family organizations we, too, cite the 88,000 figure." Still, he said, "whichever number is used, the Assemblyman is correct, because the loss is so monumental — and the circumstances of loss so catastrophic — that we may never ever be able to account for every single MIA, which is why the veterans' community and the families of the missing celebrate every new identification as if it were their own, because it means an American family somewhere finally has their loved one return home from war." Let’s review. Conners said 88,000 service members are still missing since World War II. The number of missing was recently revised to more than 83,000 missing and unaccounted for, according to the U.S. Department of Defense. Conners’ statistic may have been slightly dated, but his point -- that tens of thousands of Americans who served overseas remain unaccounted for -- is true. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-00263	Says "Mike DeWine wanted to allow insurance companies to refuse to pay for pre-existing conditions."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2018/oct/04/richard-cordray/does-ohios-mike-dewine-want-get-rid-pre-existing-c/	A TV ad by Democrat Richard Cordray in Ohio attacks Republican Mike DeWine for his position on pre-existing conditions as part of the Affordable Care Act. "If insurance companies do not have to pay for pre-existing conditions my son won’t get the blood thinners he needs," said the woman in the TV ad. "There’s plenty of people that just cannot survive without their medications. When I heard that Mike DeWine wanted to allow insurance companies to refuse to pay for pre-existing conditions it made me sick to my stomach." DeWine later countered with his own TV ad in which his daughter says DeWine "supports health care coverage for people with pre-existing conditions." We wanted to fact-check Cordray’s ad to see if DeWine wanted to allow insurance companies to refuse to pay for pre-existing conditions. DeWine isn't the only Republican to oppose Obamacare while stating support for the popular protection for pre-existing conditions. Looking over Dewine’s entire record, we find that he was a strong opponent of the Affordable Care Act for years, but now is staking out a more moderate position. DeWine’s actions related to the ACA DeWine’s campaign said that he has shown support for pre-existing coverage stretching back to the 1990s when he campaigned for and then won a seat in the U.S. Senate. In 1994, DeWine wrote on a survey by the Ohio Nurses Association that "pre-existing conditions must no longer be a bar to insurance." For example, in 1996 he voted along with the entire Senate in favor of a health insurance accountability bill that placed limits on pre-existing condition exclusions, among other things. But as attorney general, DeWine has fought against the federal health care law. On his first day in office in 2011, DeWine joined a multistate lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act. DeWine called the health care law a "huge federal overreach" because it mandated individuals to purchase insurance or face a penalty. He didn’t mention pre-existing conditions, but the law guarantees coverage for people who have them. When the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate in 2012, DeWine said he was disappointed in the outcome. As attorney general, the first references we could find of DeWine defending pre-existing condition coverage were from this year. For example, DeWine said during a September gubernatorial debate, "I’ve always been for coverage of people pre-existing illnesses." More recently, DeWine has not joined either side of a multistate lawsuit filed in a Texas federal court in February by Republican attorney generals and governors. That lawsuit argues that the law is no longer constitutional because Congress gutted the individual mandate as part of the 2017 tax overhaul. DeWine didn’t join the lawsuit because he believes it's up to Congress to decide whether to repeal Obamacare via that route, his office spokesman Dan Tierney told PolitiFact. DeWine argues that it’s possible to oppose the law and the mandate, while keeping pre-existing condition coverage. But that’s not what the federal government has said. The Justice Department said in a legal brief that the individual mandate is inseparable from protections for people with pre-existing conditions. That’s because if there were no mandate, people would wait until they were sick to purchase health insurance. Our ruling Cordray’s ad said, "Mike DeWine wanted to allow insurance companies to refuse to pay for pre-existing conditions." DeWine was a strong opponent of the Affordable Care Act, joining a lawsuit to fight against it in 2011. DeWine argues his opposition was over the individual mandate, but if the lawsuit had prevailed it, would have struck down a law that guaranteed coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. This year, while being attacked over his health care record, DeWine said he has favored coverage for pre-existing conditions and pointed to his record decades earlier in the U.S. Senate.

pomt-07597	"The entire state of Florida led the nation last year with the most prison inmates committing tax fraud."	true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/24/bill-nelson/sen-bill-nelson-says-florida-leads-nation-prisoner/	The April 15 deadline for Americans to file their taxes is creeping closer. As millions of folks rush to file their 1040 forms, Sen. Bill Nelson is urging the IRS to keep better tabs of prisoners filing fraudulent tax claims. "It's an unwelcome distinction, but the entire state of Florida led the nation last year with the most prison inmates committing tax fraud," Nelson wrote in a press release dated March 18, 2011. He made the same claim in a March 17, 2011, letter addressed to IRS Commissioner Douglas H. Shulman, noting that: "A recent report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found that nearly 45,000 fraudulent tax refund claims were filed in 2009 by prisoners in the United States, including 8,777 fraudulent claims by prisoners in Florida correctional institutions. The report also found the level of tax fraud in Florida prisons higher than in any other state." We decided to take a closer look at Nelson's claim -- does Florida lead the nation in prisoners filing fraudulent tax returns? First, a little primer on the rules regarding how prisoners file their tax forms. Each inmate is in charge of requesting his or her own 1040 form and filing their taxes "like any other citizen," said Florida Department of Corrections spokeswoman Jo Ellyn Rackleff. Typically, inmates don't earn enough from their prison jobs to trigger a tax withholding, but some are eligible for tax returns because they and their families receive income from inheritances or other investments. Since 2005, Nelson, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, has pushed for legislation that would allow the Internal Revenue Service to share inmates' financial information with state and federal prison officials in hopes of stopping the fraud. In 2008, Congress passed the Inmate Tax Fraud Prevention Act that allowed the IRS to share inmate information with federal prisons, and in 2010 lawmakers passed an amendment (which Nelson supported) that allowed the IRS to share the same information with state prisons. However, for the exchange of information to proceed between the state prisons and the IRS, states and the federal tax-collection agency have to sign separate agreements -- a step that, to date, has not been completed. "I am concerned that more than eight months after Congress passed a measure to crack down on tax fraud by prison inmates at state correctional institutions, the Internal Revenue Service and Florida Department of Corrections have yet to reach an information-sharing agreement that will help state prison officials identify prisoners filing false tax returns," Nelson wrote in his letter to Shulman. Rackleff, with the Department of Corrections, said a memorandum of understanding is in the works and is expected to be finalized by mid April. As for other states, in February, USA Today reported that Shulman wrote a letter to the governors of the top 10 fraud states asking for their states to create agreements for the exchange of prisoner data. The IRS' goal is to have a Memorandum of Understanding for each state in place prior to January 2012, according to the December 2010 report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA). We asked TIGTA for a listing of the tax fraud committed by state. The agency insisted we file a Freedom of Information Act request, and we've done so. Meanwhile, Nelson's office provided us with the following spreadsheets compiled by the IRS listing the amount of tax fraud committed by state, and a more detailed list breaking down the number of fraud cases specific to each state's prison. Overall, inmates nationwide filed 44,944 false claims and were refunded $39.1 million in undeserved tax returns, according to the IRS figures. The IRS told USA Today that it could not determine how much of the 2009 refunds had been recovered because the process "can take several years." In Florida, inmates submitted 8,777 bogus tax claims in 2009, the latest year available. Of those claims 2,911 were given tax refunds to the tune of $12.58 million in 2009. For example, Gadsden Correctional, Glades Correctional and Taylor Correctional institutions each had more than 200 false returns identified, while the Tallahassee Road Prison, Cocoa Work Release Center and Berrydale Forestry Camp in Jay had five false returns each. Of all 50 states, Florida indeed came out on top both for claims filed and refunds received. Georgia is second with 7,351 fraudulent claims filed and $3.56 million received, and California is third with 3,713 bogus claims filed and $2.76 million received. (For a full list check out this chart.) It's worth noting that the top three states have some of the largest prison populations in the nation, with California ranked second, Florida ranked third and Georgia ranked fifth, according to the Pew Center on the States. Texas tops the list for the number of prisoners, and was ranked fourth for prisoner tax-fraud claims. TIGTA’s December 2010 report cited by Sen. Nelson also expressed concerns over the IRS efforts to identify prisoner tax-refund fraud. "If the IRS does not take action, the problem will only worsen and more taxpayer dollars will be lost," the report stated. "Prisoners continue to find ways to exploit weaknesses in the system in order to receive refunds to which they are not entitled." It may not be a top ranking that Florida wishes to claim, but Nelson is correct in noting that the state leads the nation in prisoners committing tax fraud. We rate this claim True.

pomt-05649	Says Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele "eliminated" sheriff’s office funding for providing security for presidential and presidential campaign visits.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/21/david-clarke-jr/funding-eliminated-milwaukee-county-sheriffs-role-/	With Wisconsin’s presidential primary less than two weeks away, the matter of the candidates’ security has become an issue in the state’s largest county, where two of the top elected officials are taking potshots at each other. Conservative Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., who has called Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele a soft-on-crime liberal, took aim at Abele on Feb. 19, 2012, four days after President Barack Obama visited Milwaukee. In an interview with Milwaukee’s WTMJ-TV (Channel 4), Clarke claimed that Abele used the 2012 county budget to kill Sheriff’s Office funding for providing security for presidential and presidential candidate visits. "The county executive, Chris Abele -- and he again substitutes his judgment for mine," Clarke said, pausing in mid-sentence. "I asked for an increase for this year because it is a presidential campaign year. Wisconsin is a swing state; we're going to have a lot of presidential visits, campaign visits. We need additional money this year. Not only did they not give me additional money for this activity, they completely eliminated it." Was such funding really completely eliminated? Asked for evidence to support Clarke’s claim, sheriff’s spokeswoman Fran McLaughlin cited the county budget’s elimination of the sheriff’s community relations division. "Because mounted patrol, dignitary protection, neighborhood watch and public demonstrations are not core services and can be provided by municipalities, this division is eliminated," saving nearly $450,000, Abele’s budget says. "Dignitary protection" is the part of that allocation that covers sheriff’s security for presidential and presidential candidate visits. So, literally, Abele did eliminate funding earmarked in the budget for such security, as Clarke claimed. McLaughlin said because of the budget cut, the Sheriff’s Office did not cover freeway ramps during Obama’s visit -- a task that normally accounts for the largest portion of the manpower assigned to dignitary protection. That was done instead by the State Patrol. But does that mean no money is available from other parts of the budget for this task? No. For instance, the Sheriff's Office participated in planning for the president's visit and contributed help with SWAT and K-9 teams at the airport and with some officers participating in the presidential motorcade, McLaughlin said. Two days after Obama’s visit, in the wake of criticism that Clarke was playing politics with the issue, the sheriff issued a statement suggesting that the elimination of the $450,000 line item wasn’t the only hindrance in providing dignitary protection. He said he could not simply "move money around" to provide the usual presidential visit security because his overall budget, which is about $152 million, had been cut by $12 million. We asked Abele’s deputy chief of staff, John Zapfel, about Clarke’s claim in the TV interview. He said Clarke "could have chosen to use his staff for protection (of Obama) rather than attending the Association of SWAT conference and vendor show." Zapfel’s reference was to a three-day Wisconsin Association of SWAT Personnel conference held in suburban Milwaukee; the final day was the same day as Obama’s visit. Zapfel cited a report by Milwaukee’s WISN-TV (Channel 12) that "more than 15 and as many as 25" SWAT team members were at the conference during Obama’s visit. Clarke’s response to that report was a statement saying presidents are well protected by the Secret Service and that "local law enforcement provides a support role." Interestingly, the WISN-TV story was done by reporter Brendan Conway, who two weeks later announced he was becoming Abele’s spokesman. In his new role, Conway also responded to our request for information on Clarke’s claim. Conway said Clarke has the flexibility to reallocate money in his budget if he wanted to provide the same level security as in the past for presidential campaign visits. To underline his point, he noted that during the 2012 budget process, Clarke in October 2011 said he would refuse to make most of the changes that Abele called for in his budget, such as eliminating a boot camp-style inmate program and using deputies to patrol parks and the Milwaukee lakefront. Indeed, Clarke, as an independently elected official, isn't required to allocate the money as specified by the overall county budget. He can shift funds internally as he deems necessary, even if that strays from budget language. County supervisors have readily acknowledged the sheriff's power trumps the county board and executive's budget authority. Our rating Clarke said Abele "eliminated" sheriff’s funding for providing security for presidential and presidential campaign visits. So-called "dignitary protection" was among the services included in a nearly $450,000 line item that Abele deleted from Clarke’s budget. Moreover, Clarke’s total budget was trimmed, limiting his overall ability to provide various services. But despite the line-item cut, Clarke did provide some security services for Obama’s visit. And he has the authority, as an independently elected official, to reallocate funds allocated to him by Abele and the County Board. Clarke’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	David A. Clarke Jr.	None	None	None	2012-03-21T09:00:00	2012-02-19	['None']

pomt-14093	"The United States has a low voter turnout rate."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/may/16/mamie-locke/mamie-locke-says-us-has-low-voter-turnout-rate/	State Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, recently defended Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s decision to restore voting rights to about 206,000 felons who have served their time and said Republicans opposing the action want to suppress turnout in this fall’s presidential election. Locke participated in a May 8 panel discussion of McAuliffe’s decree conducted by NewsOne.com, an outlet dedicated to presenting news to black Americans. "There’s this feeling that somehow, since the governor did this, that somehow this state is once again going to vote for a Democrat for president of the United States," she said. "So that is the fear, that somehow, these 206,000 individuals are going to vote for a Democrat." "We do not have voters in this country flocking to the polls," she added. "The United States has a low voter turnout rate. You would think that you would want individuals voting in this country." There’s no shortage of Republicans who are accusing McAuliffe of issuing the blanket restoration of rights to help presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton - his good friend and fellow Democrat - carry Virginia this fall. What caught our attention is Locke’s claim that the U.S. has a low voter turnout. We wondered if she’s right. Locke pointed us to a May 2015 study by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. It examined voter turnout in the member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 democratic nations - mostly with industrialized economies - seeking to improve trade. Voting-age population Pew looked at OECD members’ most recent national elections. It computed the votes cast as a percentage of each country’s estimated voting-age population. In the U.S., Pew estimated that 53.6 percent of citizens old enough to vote participated in the 2012 presidential election. That ranked 31st among OECD nations. The only trailers were: •Japan, 52 percent in 2014; •Chile, 45.7 percent in 2013; and •Switzerland, 40 percent in 2011. By contrast, the five countries with the highest age-eligible turnout were: •Belgium, 87.2 percent in 2014; •Turkey, 86.4 percent in 2011; •Sweden, 82.6 percent in 2014; •Denmark, 81.8 percent in 2011; and •Australia, 80.5 percent in 2013. It’s important to note that three of the top five - Belgium, Turkey and Australia - have mandatory voting laws. There are 14 nations in the world that enforce such statutes, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. Registered voter turnout If Pew’s 53.6 percent voting-age participation estimate for the U.S. in 2012 sounds low to you, there’s a good reason. Turnout often is expressed as the percentage of registered voters who cast ballots and, under this measure, the U.S. does fairly well. In 2012, when President Barack Obama won a second-term challenge from Republican Mitt Romney, 84.3 of registered voters went to the polls - ranking seventh in that measurement among OECD countries. But Pew says national turnout comparisons based on registered voters "may not be very meaningful." That’s because "in most countries, the government takes the lead in getting people’s names on the rolls - whether by registering them automatically (as in, for example Sweden or Germany) or by aggressively seeking out and registering eligible voters (as in the U.K. and Australia). As a result, turnout looks pretty similar regardless of whether you’re looking at voting-age population or registered voters. "In the U.S., by contrast, registration is mainly an individual responsibility," Pew says. "And registered voters represent a much smaller share of potential voters in the U.S. than just about any other OECD country: Only 65 percent of the U.S. voting age population (and 71 percent of the voting-age citizenry) is registered, according to the Census Bureau, compared with 96 percent in Sweden and 93 percent in the U.K." For these reasons, Pew said that political scientists "typically" measure turnout by looking at the percentage of age-eligible people who went to the polls. We found one other data source that compares election turnouts based on countries’ voting-age population. The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance compiles that information for 109 nations and territories. The U.S., with its 53.6 percent turnout in 2012, ranked 73rd. Top on its list is Uzbekistan, a landlocked former member of the Soviet Union, where 98.4 percent of age-eligible people voted in its 2015 presidential election. At the bottom is Haiti, an impoverished Caribbean nation, had an 18.9 percent turnout. Our ruling Locke said "The United States has a low voter turnout rate." She based her statement on a Pew study that shows the U.S. ranks 31st among 34 OECD nations in the percentage of age-eligible people who cast ballots in recent national elections. Wider data, compiled by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, ranks the U.S. 73rd among 109 nations and territories.

pomt-03869	"In 32 other states and Washington D.C., they [voters] can avoid the wait by voting before Election Day."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/mar/10/christopher-blazejewski/rhode-island-state-rep-christopher-r-blazejewski-s/	Long slogs at polling places have led many states to allow voters to cast ballots before Election Day. Early voting is supposed to lead to shorter lines on Election Day and encourage more people to vote. State Rep. Christopher R. Blazejewski, D-Providence, has submitted a bill that would allow early voting in Rhode Island. Blazejewski’s bill would allow people to vote in person at locations that would be determined by local elections boards. The early voting period would start 21 days before a general election. Early voting would conclude the Saturday before Election Day. There would be no early voting during special elections. For a primary, the early voting period would start 13 days before Election Day and conclude the Saturday before. The early votes would not be counted until the polls close. Blazejewski said early voting would better suit voters’ schedules, providing more hours to vote, including weekends. In an interview, he said the right to vote is fundamental for a democracy and that early voting broadens people’s access to the polls. He cited long lines at the polls in Providence during the November 2012 election, including waits of more than three hours at the Juanita Sanchez Complex polling place. In a news release, Blazejewski said: "In 32 other states and Washington D.C., they [voters] can avoid the wait by voting before Election Day." Do that many states let people vote early? We contacted Blazejewski and ultimately heard from Larry Berman, House spokesman, who said the lawmaker’s source was the National Conference of State Legislatures. PolitiFact Rhode Island had already been checking around, including the National Conference of State Legislatures’ website. The site does indeed list the 32 states, and the District of Columbia, as allowing early in-person voting as of Sept. 4. In those places, "any qualified voter may cast a ballot in person during a designated period prior to election day" with "no excuse or justification" required to vote early, the NCSL says. Two other states -- Washington and Oregon -- have voting only by mail. Wendy Underhill, a senior policy specialist with the NCSL, said in an interview that the number of states with early voting has not changed since September. Some states allow voting as early as 45 days before the election and as late as the Friday before the election. Average starting time for early voting in the 32 states was 22 days prior to the Election Day. Our ruling State Rep. Christopher R. Blazejewski, D-Providence, said: "In 32 other states and Washington D.C., they [voters] can avoid the wait by voting before Election Day." The National Conference of State Legislatures’ figures support Blazejewski’s statement as far as in-person voting and we could find no other figures that showed a lower tally. There are two other states that have all mail-in voting We rate the statement True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-08872	"Kendrick Meek was named one of the two most corrupt Democrats in Congress by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington."	false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/03/jeff-greene/kendrick-meek-second-most-corrupt-democrat-congres/	In the insider/outsider campaign being waged in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, billionaire Jeff Greene continues to paint U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek as a corrupt politician who abuses his power and is too close to special interests. Greene's latest mailer uses the case of indicted developer Dennis Stackhouse to make his point. The mailer, which is designed to look like a manila folder, has a picture of Meek on the front cover and two phases -- "Corruption-tainted Kendrick Meek," which is part of a headline used by the Orlando Sentinel, and "CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION," written in red to mimic a stamp mark. The inside of the folder tells Greene's version of the Meek-Stackhouse story: That Meek requested more than $4 million in federal earmarks for Stackhouse. That Meek's mother, former U.S. Rep. Carrie Meek, got $90,000 and a Cadillac Escalade from Stackhouse for consulting work. And that Stackhouse loaned $13,000 to Kendrick Meek's chief of staff. Stackhouse eventually was arrested, accused of stealing nearly $1 million from a failed Miami-area biopharmaceutical complex. Nothing was ever built. All the evidence helps Greene wind up to his final point. "Kendrick Meek was named one of the two most corrupt Democrats in Congress by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington," the mailer states, highlighting most corrupt in red type. In this fact check, we'll see if Greene is accurately reflecting the words of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. But first, we want to make sure people are up to speed on who Dennis Stackhouse is, and his ties to Meek. Stackhouse background The Miami Herald has been documenting Stackhouse and his plans for a blighted tract of land in Liberty City for years. Back in 2003, in one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country, Stackhouse promised to build a massive biopharmaceutical park. The park was sold as a place where multinational drug companies and prestigious universities would develop cutting-edge medical advances and Miami's public hospital would provide free healthcare to 150,000 poor people a year. More than 1,500 high-paying jobs would follow, and so would hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and tax revenue. Put simply, it was the most dramatic economic development project ever seen in Miami-Dade. The politicians were smitten. They funneled millions in taxpayer dollars into the project. What did they get for that investment? Nothing. Or, as the Herald put it -- empty lots, dormant earthmovers and piles of dirt and gravel with no sign of the buildings, the biotech companies or the high-tech jobs promised to Liberty City. Stackhouse was arrested in October 2009, accused of stealing nearly $1 million from a county agency and a private Boston bank through double billings and fake invoices. He is awaiting trial. One of those smitten politicians -- Meek -- is now running for the U.S. Senate. In 2004, Meek obtained a $72,750 earmark in the federal budget for the Stackhouse project, the Herald reported. In June 2005, he also helped get a $1 million labor grant for Miami Dade College to train 800 technicians and related workers for the biopharmaceutical park. In April 2006, Meek requested another $4 million in federal appropriations for Stackhouse's project, money that was never obtained. But that's not all. Stackhouse hired Meek's mother, former U.S. Rep. Carrie Meek, paying her $90,000 in consulting fees and paying for a Cadillac Escalade for her to drive. And Stackhouse arranged a home mortgage for Meek's then-chief of staff in Miami, Anthony D. Williams, and gave Williams $13,000 for the down payment on his house. Meek has said that he didn't know Stackhouse paid his mother $90,000 and gave his chief of staff $13,000 to help him buy a house. "I did what I had to do as a representative of this community to bring resources and jobs here," Meek said. That hasn't kept Greene from promoting the connections in TV ads, press releases, and in the manila-folder mailer. Greene's claim The claim that Meek was named "one of the two most corrupt Democrats in Congress" tracks back to the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. CREW is a group that does exactly what it sounds like it would. It promotes ethics and accountability in government and public life by targeting government officials. The group says it's nonpartisan, but critics note that it tends to target Republicans more than Democrats. The group has been publishing a Most Corrupt report since 2005 that focuses on Congress. It also produces a report on the worst governors, and tracks and exposes parts of the federal earmark process. We turned to the most recent Most Corrupt report, from 2009. The report includes a Top 15 list of the most corrupt members of Congress. The list includes eight Democrats -- but not Meek. He didn't make the Top 20 list in 2008, the Top 22 list in 2007, the Top 20 in 2006, or the 13 in 2005 (we don't know why the numbers varied). So Meek isn't one of the "two most corrupt Democrats in Congress," according to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington like Greene claims. What's happening then? Greene is using a different list, the Crooked Candidates List. On July 20, 2010, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington "launched an effort to compile the most corrupt and unethical candidates vying for federal office in 2010." The Crooked Candidates list started with 11 candidates and included Meek for what the group called a "shady relationship" with Stackhouse. Meek was joined on the list by one other Democrat, Alvin Greene of South Carolina, so ostensibly that's where the Greene campaign backs the claim that Meek is one of the two most corrupt Democrats in Congress. Yet Greene isn't in Congress, he's an unemployed military veteran running for the U.S. Senate. (The original list, we should note, also included Florida Senate candidates Marco Rubio and Charlie Crist.) To make matters worse for Greene -- Jeff not Alvin -- he was added to the crooked candidates list himself. You can read the rationale why here. Our ruling In a new mailer, billionaire Jeff Greene says that "Kendrick Meek was named one of the two most corrupt Democrats in Congress by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington." But the group never labeled Meek one of the two most corrupt Democrats in Congress. It did include Meek on a list of so-called "crooked candidates," along with one other Democrat -- who isn't in Congress. And later, the group added Greene himself to the same list. The series of amateur follies would be amusing if it wasn't in the middle of an important primary election. We rate the statement False.

pomt-07017	"Forty percent of the Fortune 500 were started either by immigrants or children of immigrants."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/06/steve-case/steve-case-says-40-percent-fortune-500-were-starte/	In a discussion about immigration on CNN's State of the Union on July 3, 2011, AOL co-founder Steve Case said it's crucial for the economy that the United States "continues to be a magnet for high-skilled immigrants who want to start companies here." "The reality is these high-skilled immigrants are job-makers, not job-takers," Case said. "...We really need to make sure that we get the best and brightest, not just in our schools here and give them Ph.D.s, but when they graduate, we get them to stay here and start companies here, not start companies other places. CNN host Candy Crowley said that's a tough sell in the current environment because with unemployment so high, many people are asking why we are letting in more immigrants. Case responded that "statistics show they (immigrants) are job creators, that 40 percent of the Fortune 500 were started either by immigrants or children of immigrants. So they are creating great companies. And we want them to create those companies here. If we send them off to other countries, they will create the companies there, and that's where we're going to see the jobs and the economic growth. So that's a key part of it, making sure that you really are a magnet." Case is a co-chair of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit that seeks to develop bipartisan consensus on government policy. And he was tapped by President Barack Obama to serve as chair of the Startup America Partnership and serves on the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. We decided to check his claim that "40 percent of the Fortune 500 were started either by immigrants or children of immigrants." The statistic comes from a report prepared by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a bipartisan group of mayors and business leaders that seeks an overhaul of national immigration policy. Released in June 2011, the report, "The 'New American' Fortune 500," is an analysis of the origin of the founders of the top 500 revenue-producing companies published by Fortune Magazine. According to the report: "More than 40 percent of the 2010 Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children. Even though immigrants have made up only 10.5 percent of the American population on average since 1850, there are 90 immigrant-founded Fortune 500 companies, accounting for 18 percent of the list. When you include the additional 114 companies founded by the children of immigrants, the share of the Fortune 500 list grows to over 40 percent." Those companies employ more than 10 million people worldwide and generate revenues of over $4.2 trillion, the report states. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the co-chairs of the Partnership, has repeatedly cited the findings in speeches calling for immigration reform. "The American dream cannot survive if we keep telling the dreamers to go elsewhere," Bloomberg told the Council on Foreign Relations on June 15, 2011. "It's what I call national suicide, and that's not hyperbole." We spoke to Jeremy Robbins, policy adviser and special counsel to Mayor Bloomberg and one of the creators of the report, about its methodology. "We tried to be as conservative as possible," Robbins said. They contacted or read the company literature to determine the founders of the Fortune 500 companies. In the case where there were multiple founders, and some were not immigrants, or the children of immigrants, they were not deemed to have been founded by immigrants for the statistic. In the case of utilities, which were the result of several local utilities merging, they erred on the side of not counting them, he said. And when there wasn't a clear founder -- such as companies created by government charter, they were counted as not immigrant-founded. "We let the companies draw the line (about who was the founder) with their own narratives," Robbins said. "The reality is, it's hard to make a decision about how to do this in a fair way." It can be tricky business. Take the case of Alexander Graham Bell, born in Scotland, who is credited in the report with founding AT&T. Bell is also listed in the report as the founder of Verizon (which emerged from the breakup of AT&T, one of the seven "Baby Bells"), because the report's authors couldn't identify anyone else as a founder. Verizon was counted as immigrant-founded, Robbins said, "on the theory it cuts both ways." Robbins said they stayed consistent with that line of reasoning even when it went the other way. General Electric is another example of the ambiguity involved in determining the role of immigrants. The company is listed as founded by the child of an immigrant, Thomas Edison. Born in Ohio, Edison was the son of Samuel Edison of Canada, who emigrated to the U.S. after he took part in the failed Mackenzie Rebellion of 1837. But Edison was also the son of Nancy Matthews Elliot, who was born in New York. The report did not consider whether the founders of the companies were legal or illegal immigrants or the children of legal or illegal immigrants. You can check out the full list here (Appendix A). The immigration debate isn't simply about how to deal with illegal immigrants, Robbins said. There is a dearth of legal immigrants, he said, to meet the country's economic needs. "If we want America to compete, we have to have an avenue for the world's talent to get here," Robbins said. The figures in the report may be technically accurate, but as they are presented as demonstrating entrepreneurial exceptionalism by immigrants, they are misleading, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which believes fewer immigrants should be allowed into the U.S. Camarota pointed to a 2007 Center for Immigration Studies report which found the self-employment rate for people 25 and older in 2007 was 11.3 percent for immigrants; and 12.6 percent for natives (Table 9). That's a good guidepost of entrepreneurialism, he said, and the numbers suggest that the rates are roughly the same. "Immigrants are not lacking in entrepreneurship," Camarota said. "But it's also not a distinguishing trait of immigrants." Camarota also pointed to a 2000 report he did for the Center for Immigration Studies, which found that the rate of self-employment for immigrants (13.8 percent) outpaced the rate for natives in 1960 (9.6 percent) (Figure 1). But the rate for immigrants and natives largely merged over the ensuing decades. "You could have argued this 50 years ago, but no longer," Camarota said. "Since 1980, immigration has not been a unique source of entrepreneurship." It's also important to look at the context of illegal versus illegal immigration. The self-employment rate was particularly high for immigrants from Korea (30.8 percent); Iran (27.5 percent); Italy (25.2 percent); Vietnam (19.5 percent) and Canada (18.4 percent). It was lowest for immigrants from the Dominican Republic (5.1 percent); Haiti (5.5 percent); Philippines (5.8 percent); Ecuador (7.3 percent) and Mexico (7.8 percent). The largest number of illegal immigrants are coming from that latter group, he said. Camarota also questioned the relevance of Case's statistic in the context of the current immigration debate. With some of the immigrant-founded companies listed in the report, he said, you are talking about companies founded 100 years ago that have changed dramatically since then. "The current AT&T is not really the same company," Camarota said. "It has been reassembled so many times. I don't know what this tells us about immigration policy." We think it's valid to look at the percentage of companies founded by immigrants or their children to provide some historical context to the immigration debate. But it was not a scientific analysis, and there were some assumptions made -- such as counting as children of immigrants anyone who had one parent who was an immigrant, or including companies spun off from ones founded by immigrants -- that some may legitimately debate. The analysis also includes companies with strength and dominance today that may be more attributable to more recent leaders than their founders. We rate the claim Half True.

Leticia Van de Putte, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, suggested National Guard troops dispatched to the Texas-Mexico border by Gov. Rick Perry were reduced to asking for food assistance while fulfilling their duties. According to a Texas Tribune news story posted online Aug. 29, 2014, Van de Putte, a San Antonio state senator and chairwoman of the Senate Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee, said: "Today, we learn that our men and women of the Guard have been forced to contact food banks to feed themselves because they haven’t been paid in weeks. This is unacceptable." And had Guard members placed along the border contacted food banks to fill their bellies? By email, Van de Putte campaign spokesman Manny Garcia said the senator made her statement in an Aug. 29, 2014, press release based on news stories including an account published that day by the San Antonio Express-News. By email, he provided web links to news reports including an initial Aug. 28, 2014, report by KGBT-TV in Harlingen quoting Terri Drefke, chief executive officer of the Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley, saying: "We were contacted that 50 troops that are in the Valley don't have any money for food and gas and they need our assistance." The Express-News story said the Texas National Guard had just contacted the food bank to ask whether the charity had food and gas resources for about 50 soldiers in need of assistance because they hadn’t yet received a paycheck. Then again, the story said that, according to Omar Rodriguez, a food bank spokesman, it was unclear how many soldiers had used the food bank because its clients aren’t asked to say where they work. Separately, Texas Army National Guard Brig. Gen. Patrick Hamilton said no troops had visited the food bank to his knowledge, the newspaper reported. "We identified 50 soldiers who came on at the very end of the first pay period who would see a three-week lag in income," Hamilton said, adding that the Guard support service officer who called the food bank was "trying to help" but did so outside a chain of command. The same day, the Guard issued a statement indicating two previously unemployed Guard members involved in the border deployment had indicated they were needy; the statement did not say either went to a food bank. But broadly, the Guard said, all "members supporting the operation" near the border "are furnished with lodging, meals, transportation and the equipment required to perform their mission. Service members supporting this operation receive pay, allowance for housing and per diem for meals on the normal state payroll schedule." The statement further said: "Media reports indicate some members of the Texas National Guard supporting this new operation were in need of resources, including food and gas. It is important to note, the Texas National Guard offers robust services to its service members and their families who identify a need, including temporary financial assistance, resilience training and counseling, family readiness and reintegration activities." The statement went on: "As a result of inquiries for assistance by service members deploying to the Rio Grande Valley, the Texas National Guard Family Assistance Coordinator identified a variety of options for service members who may have existing financial hardships, including inquiries to local food banks among other organizations. The agency specifically had two previously unemployed service members who requested support. Both of those soldiers were provided assistance." It doesn't look like the described assistance involved stopping by a food bank. An Austin American-Statesman news story posted that afternoon quoted Lt. Col. Joanne MacGregor, a spokeswoman for the Texas National Guard, saying its officials had no indication any Guardsmen had received assistance from the food bank. In response to our follow-up inquiry, MacGregor said there had been no change in this respect; the Guard was "not aware of any service members utilizing the food banks," she emailed. According to the Guard, troops receive one meal while on duty, plus a $32 per diem food reimbursement included in their paychecks. We reached Rodriguez, the spokesman for the Pharr-based food bank, who told us by phone the bank still hadn't noticed Guard members coming in for food. "As far as actual members coming in for food assistance, we have not seen any," Rodriguez said, though (again) he cautioned that no one who seeks such assistance is asked where he or she works. We circled back to Garcia, who said by email the senator stands by her statement. Our ruling Van de Putte said: "Our men and women of the Guard have been forced to contact food banks to feed themselves." No one has confirmed any troops contacting food banks to feed themselves. What happened: A National Guard functionary took the precautionary step of asking a border-area food bank about troops yet to be paid possibly receiving groceries if necessary. The food bank said it could provide. We rate this statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

We’ve covered some squabbles over that tax and the program here and here. So, naturally, our interest was piqued when the subject cropped up again recently. This time It came by way of Oregon Catalyst, a conservative political website and a picture it posted of an Oregon Healthy Kids billboard. Flying above pictures of healthy kids and their families and physicians is the sentence "No family earns too much to qualify." Sure, the program has been expanded, but could that possibly be true? Or, as Oregon Catalyst poses the question: "Can anyone explain this? It seems like anyone is entitled to government service whether you need it or not." We decided to check in with Cathy Kaufmann, manager of the Healthy Kids Office, and see whether it’s true that any family can qualify for the program. "Any Oregon family with an uninsured child has a path to Healthy Kids regardless of income," she said. However, that insurance may come at a cost that makes it -- for most people -- essentially out of reach. Any family can get insurance through the Healthy Kids Connect program, Kaufmann explains, but some will pay more than others. Families earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level (about $44,000 a year for a family of four) qualify for free child health care. Families earning between 200 and 300 percent of the federal poverty level (about $66,000 for a family of four -- also Oregon’s median income) qualify for subsidized health care on a sliding scale. Now for the third category: Those families making more than 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Well, they could still enroll their children through Healthy Kids Connect, but they won’t get any financial break, Kaufmann said. In fact, because the Healthy Kids coverage is so comprehensive -- it covers medical, dental and vision care -- they’ll be paying a pretty high yearly premium. Possibly as much as $3,400, according to a rate sheet posted on the Healthy Kids website. So, it seems, the billboard is factually accurate. Any family can qualify, whether they make $1 a year or $1 billion. That said, it seems to us Oregon Healthy Kids could have been more precise in their advertising: Families do have to meet certain income limits to qualify for assistance.

pomt-13075	"Final election 2016 numbers: Trump won" the popular vote.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/14/blog-posting/no-donald-trump-not-beating-hillary-clinton-popula/	Donald Trump unquestionably won the 2016 presidential election, but he is trailing in the popular vote. That might come as a surprise to people who Googled the phrase "Final Election Count" as late as 2 p.m. on Nov. 14. The first entry in Google’s news category -- above those from news links to the Washington Post and Politico -- was a Nov. 12 post (updated the following day) from a little-known site called 70news. "Final election 2016 numbers: Trump won both popular (62.9M-62.2M) and Electoral College Votes (306-232)," the post’s headline said. Further down the page, the site’s anonymous author wrote, "To all the liberal loonies still rioting because you claim Trump did not get the popular vote, get your meds now and prepare to be shocked because the finals results are in. Trump got 306 Electoral College vote while Hillary Clinton got 232. For #PopularVote: #Trump: 62,972,226 #Clinton: 62,277,750." According to its Facebook page, the site launched in August and seeks to "share news that matters to you. What liberal media will try to hide, we will uncover." Here’s a screenshot of how that particular Google search displayed the 70news post -- prominently. But while it’s absolutely true that Trump won the Electoral College vote -- which is the only thing that matters in determining who moves into the White House on Jan. 20 -- he is not leading in the popular vote. The most comprehensive vote-tracking analysis is published by David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. As of 2:30 p.m. on Nov. 14, according to Wasserman’s calculations, Clinton led Trump by 784,748 votes -- specifically, 61,422,098 for Clinton, 60,637,350 for Trump, and 6,691,311 for other candidates. Other tallies showed similar results. CNN at that time showed a Clinton-over-Trump margin of 668,059, while the Associated Press had a margin of 668,483. (Different media outlets may report different numbers at a given time because of delays in obtaining and uploading new data.) Here’s CNN’s tally by mid-day Nov. 14, showing Clinton ahead by half a percentage point. And given the votes left to be counted, it’s almost impossible to imagine that Trump will gain back ground in the coming days. That’s because California -- a state where Clinton is beating Trump by a 62 percent-33 percent margin -- has the most votes still to count of any state. Nearly a week after the election, CNN estimates that only 70 percent of the California vote had been counted. In addition, only 87 percent of the vote in Oregon had been counted; Clinton beat Trump 52 percent-41 percent there. And Washington state had counted only 87 percent of its vote; Clinton beat Trump there by a 55 percent-38 percent margin. So it’s entirely plausible that Clinton could end up winning the popular vote by 1 million to 1.5 million votes -- roughly two or three times the popular-vote margin assembled by Al Gore when he lost the Electoral College, and the presidency, to George W. Bush in 2000. By Nov. 14, the Washington Post and Business Insider both posted articles questioning why Google still had the 70news article at the top of their news category. A Google representative said the company was looking into the issue. And on Nov. 14, 70news posted an update: "Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. … If I’m wrong, I won’t hesitate to change the numbers. It’s the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it’s out there already." (The Twitter post cited by 70News was this one.) But as of 3 p.m. on Nov. 14, 70news still had the article up. Our ruling Social media was abuzz with the claim that the "final election 2016 numbers" showed that Trump had won won both the popular and Electoral College contests. Trump certainly won the Electoral College vote, and as a result, he will become president. But he clearly trails in the popular vote. As of this writing, Clinton is ahead by nearly 800,000 votes, a margin that is likely to expand further as late returns trickle in from California, Oregon and Washington state, all of which are strong Clinton states.

pomt-14621	"We now have more jobs in solar than we do in oil."	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/jan/29/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-claims-more-jobs-solar-oil/	Hillary Clinton is bullish on clean energy as an economic opportunity for the United States. In a meeting last month with the Concord Monitor’s editorial board, she held out the burgeoning production of wind turbines in Iowa as evidence of the country’s potential future as the "clean energy superpower of the 21st century." And what’s more, the fall of fossil fuels in favor of renewables is already happening, she said. "We now have more jobs in solar than we do in oil," the former Democratic secretary of state told the newspaper on Dec. 8, 2015. We’ve heard that the renewable energy market has been heating up. And sure, some of our neighbors are putting up solar panels, and these shrunken gas prices can’t be good for the oil industry. But could the total number of jobs in the field of solar power truly have surpassed the long-established and machinery-heavy oil industry? PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to have a look at the numbers. Labor statistics Clinton’s campaign cited two sources: the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics and The Solar Foundation. First, we’ll shine some light on the state of America’s solar industry. The Solar Foundation estimated last year that there were roughly 174,000 people who spend at least half their working hours "on solar-related work," a term that goes undefined in the nonprofit’s 67-page annual report. It notes that 90 percent or more of those workers spent 100 percent of their time on "solar-related work." Of the total, 97,000 are employed by installation companies, 32,000 are in manufacturing, 20,000 are in sales and distribution, 15,000 are in project development and 9,000 are classified as "other," including research and development firms, nonprofits, government agencies and academic researchers. A Bureau of Labor Statistics economist, Caila Pinkleton, pointed by email to one specific solar-related current employment statistic. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed 5,170 solar photovoltaic installers employed in May 2014, a small fraction of the 97,000 people that The Solar Foundation said are employed by installation companies, of which the vast majority (92 percent) were installing photovoltaics. So there’s some discrepancy in the total number of jobs. The Solar Foundation, which describes on its website that its mission "is to increase understanding of solar energy through strategic research and education that transforms markets," didn’t respond to an email seeking clarification. But the Bureau of Labor Statistics left open the possibility that the total number of jobs could be higher, noting that some solar thermal installers are classified under "plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters" and some solar photovoltaic electricians are listed under "electricians." What’s clear, according to the Solar Foundation’s numbers, is that the industry is growing quickly: from 93,502 in 2010 to 173,807 in 2014. The nonprofit recently released its updated census for this year, which showed 208,859 solar workers as of November 2015, only slightly below the 210,600 projection from a year earlier. Meanwhile, the oil and gas industries have been falling in employment, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. While Clinton specifically mentioned the oil industry, not gas, her campaign only furnished data combining the two industries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t keep individual data for each. Clinton’s campaign referenced total employment in oil and gas extraction in December 2015, which was 185,000, compared with the 209,000 solar workers that The Solar Foundation reported in November 2015. If that was the whole story, she’d be right. But just as the solar industry has installers, manufacturers, salespeople and researchers, so does the oil and gas industry. Besides oil and gas extraction, there’s also support activities for oil and gas operations: 266,000 jobs. Oil and gas pipeline production: 124,000 jobs. Mining and oil and gas field machinery: 73,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You might even want to include the 912,000 people who work at gas stations. We aren’t going to be that pedantic. But the American Petroleum Institute is. It found that in 2007 the oil and natural gas industry directly provided 2.1 million jobs. Including the indirect impacts, API claims the industry supports more than 9 million American jobs. While this type of study is undoubtedly commissioned to promote the industry, a critic could say the same of The Solar Foundation’s work. Using only Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers, and discounting gas station employees, we’re still left with about 648,000 jobs in oil and gas spread over extraction, support activities, pipeline production and field machinery, compared to 210,000 for solar. In other words, for Clinton’s claim to be true, two out of three Americans employed by the oil and gas industries would have to be working solely with gas. Even then – comparing conservative Bureau of Labor Statistics data against generous figures from The Solar Foundation – oil would come out slightly ahead. Our ruling Clinton said "we now have more jobs in solar than we do in oil." But the numbers don’t support that claim. For the oil industry, she didn’t look at the whole picture. And self-reported calculations by both the solar and oil and gas industry aren’t close. Oil and gas reports 10 times more jobs. Independent data from the federal government also shows more jobs in oil and gas compared to solar. Maybe someday Clinton’s claim will be true, but for now we rate it False.

pomt-07964	A test last month at the MAX station at 162nd Avenue and East Burnside saw crime down 41 percent compared with December 2009	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/jan/22/jefferson-smith/rep-jefferson-smith-says-classical-music-pilot-pro/	East Multnomah County state Rep. Jefferson Smith, D-Portland, has introduced House Bill 2909 to require TriMet to broadcast classical music at MAX light-rail stations in high-crime areas. The jokes are swirling already. Would you like a little Vivaldi with that mugging? Maybe it’s more like, I’d like to harass that innocent bystander but this Chopin is making me feel so mellow. Or even, this classical music is so annoying that I’m going to take my trouble-making self elsewhere. But scoffing aside, PolitiFact Oregon was intrigued by a statement Smith made to The Oregonian’s Michelle Cole. A test last month at the MAX station at 162nd Avenue and Burnside, he said, saw "crime was down 41 percent from the December a year ago." We checked with the representative’s office, who directed us to the Portland Police Bureau for the results. Portland Police Sgt. Pete Simpson confirmed -- as does this online post by Portland Police Sgt. John Scruggs -- that TriMet installed a classical music system at that light-rail station on Nov. 16. Simpson said there is no official report, but the numbers are as follows: From Nov. 16, 2009 to Dec. 16, 2009, there were 46 calls for service. From Nov. 16, 2010 to Dec. 16, 2010, there were 27 calls for service. The math is correct. There is a 41 to 42 percent difference in the number of service calls between the time periods. But a call for service doesn’t necessarily indicate criminal activity. A service call can be for anything from disorderly conduct to a fare check, Simpson said. They can be generated by an officer who decides to check out a station, or by someone calling in a request for help. And this is why Sgt. Scruggs was more careful in his post: "The first month of data for our attempt has shown a 42% reduction in calls for service at 162nd/ Burnside. We are going to do a more comprehensive study soon." "I think it’s a good indication that it’s working, but it’s early numbers, early stats," Scruggs said in an interview. In his interview with Cole, Smith readily acknowledged that statistics based on one month merit more review. He stressed the numbers were preliminary. This week, his legislative assistant forwarded more information from Scruggs that show a 40 percent reduction in calls for service at that stop over a two-month period. Three other stops without classical music showed increases in service calls. Again, this is all early data. PolitiFact Oregon enjoys classical music. If it actually helps reduce crime at light-rail stations, that’s great, but we’re not weighing in on that broader question. Our focus is on the recent test. In an interview with PolitiFact Oregon, Smith said he may have used the two terms -- "crime" and "service calls" -- interchangeably when talking to Cole, inaccurately conflating the two. We rate the claim Mostly True -- accurate but needing just a little bit of clarification. Comment on this item.	None	Jefferson Smith	None	None	None	2011-01-22T09:00:00	2011-01-13	['None']
pomt-14500	Says Donald Trump "wants to keep big government in charge" of federally-owned land.	mostly true	/nevada/statements/2016/feb/23/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-attacks-donald-trump-wanting-leave-public/	Of all the controversies associated with Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, his position on federally owned land tends to attract less attention. But the issue of public land ownership is important to Nevadans, where federal government agencies manage and control around 85 percent of state land. And it’s partially why Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is slamming Trump on the issue in a campaign ad airing just days before the Nevada Republican presidential caucus on Feb. 23. "Eighty-five percent of Nevada is owned and regulated by the federal government," says Cruz in the ad. "And Donald Trump wants to keep big government in charge. That’s ridiculous." The ad has aired dozens of times in Reno through the lead up to Nevada's caucus, according to Political TV Ad Archive. We thought Cruz’s claim merited fact-checking, because public lands management is a critical issue with Nevada voters. An on-screen graphic refers to a January interview with Field & Stream magazine, where Trump said he would be hesitant to give federal land over to state and local governments. "I don’t like the idea, because I want to keep the lands great, and you don’t know what the state is going to do," he told an interviewer. "I mean, are they going to sell if they get into a little bit of trouble?" Trump’s campaign offered a slightly more detailed explanation of his proposed policy in an answer to a candidate questionnaire, but said the bigger issue was land management and not transfer of ownership. "The issue is not that so much of the state is public land; it is how that land is managed," the campaign wrote, promising to cut "needless bureaucratic red tape." The Trump campaign didn’t return emails seeking comment. Cruz, on the other hand, takes a more libertarian stance on public land issues and said the amount of land owned by the federal government is "unacceptable." "I believe we should transfer as much federal land as possible back to the states and ideally back to the people," he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in December. Cruz fought with the Bureau of Land Management over the agency's efforts to "claim 90,000 acres of disputed land near Texas’s Red River," and for a time supported Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy’s standoff with the federal government over his unpaid grazing fees. And many of the Texas senator’s Nevada supporters pushed for a failed bill in the state Legislature that "would lay claim to almost all federally managed public lands and water rights in the state." It’s worth noting that Nevada’s state constitution expressly gives up the state’s rights to all "unappropriated public lands" to the federal government, which is why it’s worth quibbling with candidates like Cruz and Rubio promise to "return" control to its citizens — who have never held a claim to the federally owned land in the past 151 years of Nevada statehood. Our ruling Cruz says that Trump wants to keep "big government" in charge of Nevada’s public lands. Trump has answered questions on public land management twice. He has not advocated for transferring ownership, but he has focused on cutting bureaucratic red tape. Cruz exaggerates Trump's position slightly by saying Trump favors "big" government.

pomt-07778	The House of Delegates budget bill "cuts $50 million from education."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/22/virginia-senate-democratic-caucus/virginia-democrats-say-house-delegates-budget-cuts/	Numbers are flying around state Capitol this week as legislators try to hammer out a budget agreement and adjourn their 2011 session on Saturday. The Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-run House of Delegates have sharply different ideas on how dollars should should be spent. Each chamber is trying to win public sentiment for its proposals. In a Feb. 10 press release, the Senate Democratic Caucus said the Senate had "introduced a balanced budget restoring funding cuts to education, public safety and health care," while saying the House "introduced a budget that cuts $50 million from education, and reduces funding from other core areas." We checked the $50 million claim. Keiana Page, communications director for the Senate Democratic Caucus, said the number comes from a Feb. 17 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The story indeed said the House budget would cut K-12 spending by $50 million. That’s the roughly the amount the House wants to reduce an education budget recommended by Gov. Bob McDonnell in December. We reviewed the numbers and found the House pared overall public education spending by $50.8 million. But that didn’t make the caucus' claim a slam dunk. Almost all of the reduction -- $43.2 million -- stems from lowered estimates of the number of students who will be enrolled in Virginia schools during the coming fiscal year. The remainder of the savings is coming from higher than expected sales tax revenue. When localities reap more money from their portion of the sales tax, the state pays less to support schools. Del. M. Kirkland Cox, R-Colonial Heights and vice chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said there are 8,000 to 9,000 fewer students attending Virginia schools than originally projected, with a total enrollment this school year of just over 1.2 million. Cox, a high school teacher, maintains the cuts are "technical," not changes to policies. The House plan would hold per-pupil spending roughly flat. The current budget provides state spending of $5,166 per pupil, according to Robert Vaughn, staff director of the Appropriations Committee. The proposed House changes would lead to per-pupil spending of $5,161 next school year. The Senate wants to spend $5,242 per pupil next year. Despite the lower-than-expected student numbers, the Senate bill would increase current spending levels, using the new money mainly for textbooks, English proficiency programs and remedial summer school classes. The House has one other key proposal that would alter education spending. It wants to shift $89.8 million largely invested in instruction to the Virginia Retirement System for teachers’ pensions. The money would help make up for past shortfalls in retirement funding and lay the groundwork for the higher contributions that will be needed in future budget cycles. The cash would come from $55.4 million in promised payments to 97 localities that lost money last year when the state rejiggered its allocation formula to school systems. The rest of the pension payment comes from $34.4 million currently funding resource teachers in middle schools. Vaughn said the state currently pays for resource teachers in grades K-7, while state law only requires funding those teachers up through fifth grade. Under current rules, state contributions into the pension system are matched by school districts. Vaughn said the House decided not to require matching payments on the $89.8 million because localities had not planned for these payments when building their budgets. House budget writers say that since the money is going towards teacher pensions, it’s an education expense. But critics argue the pension payment would consume money that could otherwise have gone into classrooms. Jim Regimbal, a former Senate Finance Committee staffer who now runs consulting company Fiscal Analytics, said the extra pension payments mean "less on-the-ground spending for teaching kids." To review, the Senate Democratic Caucus says the House of Delegates is pushing a budget "that cuts $50 million from education." They are basing this on the overall dollar figures proposed by the governor and largely adopted by the House of Delegates. Much of the reduction in funding is due to student population being lower than expected. Spending on a per-pupil basis would remain relatively constant. But the House budget also removes $55.4 million in education funds that localities could use at their discretion and invests it in teacher pensions. That would likely result in less money going into classrooms, which sounds like a cut to us. We rate the claim True. Correction: This statement was originally attributed to the Democratic Party of Virginia. It was in fact published by the Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus.

pomt-07548	"Ninety percent of Texans say they do not want the nursing homes to close. It polls higher than anything else."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/apr/02/sylvester-turner/state-rep-sylvester-turner-says-90-percent-texans-/	Urging his colleagues to tap more of the rainy day fund to close $4 billion deficit in the current budget, state Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Houston, said nursing homes would shutter without the extra cash. "Ninety percent of Texans say that they do not want the nursing homes to close," Turner said on the House floor March 31. "It polls higher than anything else." Turner, who introduced an amendment to draw an extra $1 billion from the state’s savings to close the budget gap, hammered the point later: "Not 9 percent, not 20 percent, but 90 percent of Texans. And I know not all 90 percent of Texans are Democrats." We wondered whether nursing homes really polled higher than any other service facing funding cuts as the state grapples with the budget crisis. Backing up: Advocates have warned that 33 percent in cuts proposed for nursing homes that accept residents who are covered by Medicaid will force homes to close, according to a March 23 Austin American-Statesman article. Allison Lowery, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services, told us that of the 90,000 residents of nursing homes statewide, 56,000 — about 60 percent — are covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people and those with disabilities. Alison Brock, Turner’s chief of staff, passed on a Feb. 22 press release from the Texas Health Care Association, that said "a new University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll finding 90 percent of Texans expressing opposition to cutting state-funded nursing home care exemplifies the depth of public opposition to proposed" cuts. "The 90 percent opposition to nursing home cuts represents the highest level of opposition to all of the funding cut categories tested." Next, we looked at the relevant question in the Feb. 21 poll: "The Texas Legislature is currently discussing different ways to reduce state spending in order to address the state’s budget shortfall. Please think about the following list of proposals for cutting the budget, and check all of the measures you think should be taken to reduce spending." The least popular budget proposal — cutting "state funding for nursing home care" — was checked by only 10 percent of respondents. And so it follows that 90 percent opted to not cut nursing home funding. The most popular proposal — ending "funding for pre-kindergarten classes" — was checked by 38 percent. According to a Texas Tribune news article accompanying the poll results, "voters were protective of state programs, and overwhelmingly so." Jim Henson, one of the pollsters who teamed up with the Tribune, confirmed the online poll’s results, which have a margin of error of 3.46. The sample size: 800 registered Texas voters. Next, we looked for other polls. A September UT/Texas Tribune poll found that more than half of respondents said they would support increased funding for border security, but oppose higher funding for community colleges (73 percent), pre-kindergarten programs (72 percent), nursing homes (68 percent) and increased exemptions from the business franchise tax (78 percent). The poll doesn’t ask respondents whether they’d want to cut spending for nursing homes. A January poll commissioned by the Austin American-Statesman and other newspapers found that voters want to spare public education and health care programs from budget cuts, with about 70 percent of respondents saying lawmakers shouldn't cut school spending, while 61 percent said they want no cuts on health care programs for children and low- to moderate-income families. Respondents weren’t asked about nursing homes. Henson told us this poll and the UT/Tribune’s poll are the only statewide surveys that he’s aware of that cover budget cuts. Our results: The UT/Tribune poll found that 90 percent of respondents didn’t want state funding for nursing home care cut, and opposition to that idea polled "higher than anything else," as Turner said. Though he erred when he couched that as opposition to closing nursing homes — the poll didn’t ask about that — it’s reasonable to assume that a comparable percentage of respondents would feel negatively about closures as well. But gauging the strength of statewide public opinion on the basis of a single, online poll of 800 voters is a questionable proposition. We rate Turner’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-13231	"Heroin .. pours across our southern borders."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/donald-trump/trump-says-heroin-pours-across-southern-border/	In the third and final presidential debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump blamed President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for many of the problems faced by people in New Hampshire. Trump said that included drug addiction. "The single-biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern borders, just pouring, and destroying their youth and is poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people," Trump said. We’ve all heard of poppy fields blooming in Afghanistan, but is Trump right that heroin is entering the United States largely through the southern border? Yes. Even though Southwest Asia supplies heroin to most of the rest of the world, nearly all of the heroin available in the United States comes from Mexico and South America. "Mexico, and to a lesser extent, Colombia, dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy US heroin demand," the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration wrote in its National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015. "Mexico continues as the primary supplier of heroin to the United States," the White House’s page on the international heroin market reads. "Estimated cultivation of opium poppy reached 10,500 hectares in 2012, with an estimated pure potential production of 26 metric tons." Here’s a chart from the DEA report demonstrating the prevalence of heroin from the southern border: As you can see, South America and Mexico have been the sources for much of the heroin in U.S. markets for the past two decades. In recent years, Mexican traffickers have expanded by simultaneously wedging black tar heroin into Northeastern markets dominated by Colombian white powder heroin and increasing production and distribution of white powder heroin themselves. Mexican heroin accounted for 45 percent of the total weight of heroin the DEA seized and analyzed in 2012 (South American heroin accounted for 51 percent). By 2014, the proportion of Mexican heroin had grown to 79 percent (South American heroin made up about 17 percent), DEA spokesman Russell Baer told PolitiFact in September. This market share is also reflected in the amount of heroin seized at the border and the amount grown in Mexico. From 2013 to 2015, the amount of poppy fields cultivated in Mexico increased by 169 percent from 11,000 hectares to 28,000 hectares, according to Baer. In 2008, the total amount of heroin seized at the U.S.-Mexico border (about 560 kilograms) surpassed the amount seized from commercial airlines for the first time (about 400 kilograms). Border seizures nearly quadrupled from 2008 to 2015 (2,210 kilograms), according to data provided to us by Baer. "The majority of the drugs in the U.S. market are trafficked across the Southwest Border from Mexico into the US. Southwest Border seizures conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, while not the complete picture, provide insight into trafficking trends," he said. Traffickers typically smuggle the drugs in through secret compartments in vehicles across the border (illegally and legally), transport them to stash houses in hub cities like Dallas, Los Angeles and Phoenix, and then distribute to the Midwest and East Coast. Our ruling Trump said heroin "pours across our southern borders." The vast majority of heroin in the United States comes from Mexico and South America.

pomt-09130	Of hospitals in Rick Scott’s Columbia/HCA health care company, "A top executive said they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/jun/15/florida-first-initiative/groups-ad-attacks-rick-scott-over-history-columbia/	With his multi-millions and meteoric rise to frontrunner status in the Republican gubernatorial primary, former Columbia/HCA hospital CEO Rick Scott has become a formidable figure in Florida politics. Look no further than a new attack ad by Florida First Initiative that paints Scott as a ruthless moneyman whose success hinged on shunning the nation's poor, and in at least one incident, the near-dead. The shadow group, a 527 under federal tax code, has used rival Bill McCollum's name in its fundraising pitch and is unregistered in Florida. Attack ads generally try to undermine an opposing camp, and the rancor seeping from this ad campaign comes across as a screaming alarm bell. "As CEO, Rick Scott profited from the largest Medicare fraud in American history," begins Refused, a 30-second spot that began airing June 12, 2010. "His hospitals illegally refused emergency room patients who were poor. They turned away sick people... and pregnant women." The ad is set against a backdrop of images of seemingly frail elderly men and women and a harrowing score. The most shocking claim comes near the end of the ad: "A top executive said they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door." The words, "they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door" flash across the screen. The $616,282 TV ad buy is scheduled to air through Wednesday -- two days before the state election filing deadline. Scott's opponents have rarely missed the opportunity to point out his corporate troubles. Scott was CEO of Columbia/HCA in 1997 when federal agents made public an investigation into the company. Scott resigned that year. He notes that he was never indicted and says he was never questioned in the case. In a 2000 settlement, the company agreed to plead guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies, including three counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States, and pay a $1.7 billion fine. But the claim that a man died at one of the company's hospitals after being turned away was new to us. Could it be true? Federal records list Alachua County GOP Chairman Stafford Jones as the contact for Florida First Initiative. Reached by phone, he declined to answer questions and did not return a request for comment. The group's registered agent, Ken Cleary, hung up on a reporter when reached by phone. The ad attributes the allegation to an ABC News 20/20 interview from Sept. 26, 1997. We found no reference in the 20/20 transcript to "they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door." We also searched a newspaper database and found no references to those exact words. The interview features Marc Gardner, a former Columbia administrator who went on a 1997 media blitz, including the appearance on 20/20, in a bid to secure a book deal about the hospital chain's alleged illegal dealings. Among his many allegations of wrongdoing, Gardner claimed the hospital and other facilities owned by Columbia/HCA limited treatment of uninsured patients. "Columbia hospitals exist to make money -- period," he told the Wall Street Journal in 1997. Gardner pointed to several deaths tied to improper care at the hospitals, including a 1995 case involving Adolph Anguiano, a homeless man who was found dead outside the Las Vegas hospital -- where Gardner served as vice president -- hours after he was examined by an emergency room doctor. We couldn't reach Gardner for comment. Scott's campaign attributed the allegation to Gardner in an e-mail response to the ad. The campaign dismissed Gardner as a "publicity hungry wannabe writer" and insisted the hospital did not turn Anguiano away. Rather, he was evaluated and then discharged. The emergency room physician, Susan Meyer, was later suspended over the incident, Scott's campaign said. With Meyer's name, we tracked down court records that detail the July 1995 death. On the day he died, Anguiano was found unconscious on the lawn of a hotel and taken by ambulance to Columbia Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas. Meyer gave him a full physical, but decided against further tests, according to court records. Anguiano had not eaten in three days and had been drinking and smoking marijuana. He was given some juice and crackers, and hospital security escorted him out. He was found dead on the hospital grounds two hours later. Hospital officials said Meyer treated Anguiano for roughly seven minutes, which violated hospital rules, according to court records. Meyer was suspended. She sued the hospital and lost. The Nevada Supreme Court eventually concluded the hospital acted with the reasonable belief that it was furthering quality care. Hospital officials said they worried Anguiano's death might be seen as new evidence of "patient dumping," or refusal to treat patients in need of emergency care, according to court records. Federal law prohibits emergency rooms from turning away patients because they don't have insurance. Columbia Sunrise had already been under investigation for denying care to uninsured patients after a homeless person passed out at a casino shortly after being released from the hospital in 1994, according to multiple news reports. Federal officials threatened to take away the hospital's Medicare contract until a second investigation a few weeks later found the hospital was providing emergency beds to the uninsured. Columbia Sunrise wasn't the only Columbia/HCA hospital hounded by reports of patient dumping. From 1988 to 1997, Columbia/HCA was fined at least $180,000 for alleged patient dumping violations at eight hospitals, according to news accounts. In all of those settlements, the company did not admit wrongdoing. Where does all that leave us? We know a former Columbia/HCA executive did complain about the company's alleged penchant for patient dumping. In several interviews, he discussed the death of Adolph Anguiano, a homeless man who was found on hospital property. Court records confirm Anguiano died outside a Columbia/HCA hospital and that the hospital was under scrutiny for mistreating poor patients. But Anguiano was not turned away, as the ad claims. He received some care before he was shown the door. Also, court records state Anguiano wasn't intentionally left to die. So while what happened to Anguiano is an ugly tale, it is not as ugly as the story portrayed in the attack ad. We rule this Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

President Donald Trump hired his former contestant to work on his campaign and then in the White House. Now that she’s not part of the administration, those reality TV tactics have come to haunt him. Omarosa re-entered the headlines in August with her book Unhinged, which recounts a tumultuous year in the Trump White House. She also claimed to have heard a tape in which Trump used racial slurs, and then provided CBS with a recording of Trump campaign staffers discussing the incident. (On Aug. 14, Trump tweeted that Omarosa was "a lowlife" and "a dog.") The drama led some websites friendly to Trump to speculate about Omarosa’s motivations. One article written by the Young Conservatives and posted on Chicks on the Right has the headline, "Omarosa exposed: Turns out she was actually working for Hillary." The article was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We decided to investigate whether Omarosa "was actually working" for Trump’s 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton. It turns out the connections are nothing new. A tumultuous past The headline of the article implies a new revelation about Manigault Newman’s connections to the Clintons by saying she was "exposed." But the body of the article focuses on Omarosa’s previous connections to the Clintons, which were already public knowledge. There is no evidence that Omarosa double-crossed Trump in favor of Hillary Clinton. In 2000, she briefly worked for President Bill Clinton in the White House. After moving between jobs in the administration, she was fired. Omarosa emerged as a reality television star in 2004, making her name as a contestant on Trump’s TV show, The Apprentice. She quickly became known as a reality TV villain, fighting with the other contestants and creating chaos within the competition. She was invited back to The Apprentice twice, and also participated in Celebrity Big Brother. During her early career as a reality TV contestant, Omarosa openly supported the Clintons and would mention her experience in the White House alongside them. In a 2015 Washington Post article, she identified as a "die-hard" Hillary supporter. In 2018, while competing on Celebrity Big Brother after leaving the Trump administration, she said that she had done work on the Ready For Hillary super PAC before joining the Trump campaign: "It wasn’t hard when (Trump) called me and said ‘Can you be on board?’ because I had just been used and abused by the Ready for Hillary organization." We contacted Chicks on the Right to ask if they had proof that Omarosa was working for Hillary while serving as Trump’s White House director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison. They responded with a quote from Nick Arama, who wrote the story. "Our added commentary is only opinion and our commentary doesn't claim Omarosa was simultaneously working for Hillary while working in the Trump White House," he said. "We think many people do find it troubling that she was working Ready for Hillary in 2015, just one year before the election." They also clarified that the "added commentary is only opinion." After we contacted them, Chicks on the Right added a clarification at the end of the article: "We’re not claiming that we have evidence that Omarosa was working for Hillary during her work for Trump. We are noting how soon in time that she worked for Hillary before she worked for Trump." Our ruling The Young Conservatives article featured the headline, "Omarosa Exposed: Turns Out She Was Actually Working For Hillary." This headline may mislead readers into believing Omarosa was a double-agent during her time in the Trump administration. There is no evidence this is true. The article calls into question Omarosa’s loyalty to Trump from his campaign to her year in the White House given her previous record of supporting Hillary Clinton and working for Bill Clinton. After she had a falling-out with Hillary Clinton’s campaign organizers, Omarosa was recruited by Trump to help his campaign. The claim is partially accurate but missing substantial context.

pomt-13887	Says Kelly Ayotte "stands with the Washington gun lobby. They fund her campaigns."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/jun/30/americans-responsible-solutions/how-much-do-gun-lobbyists-fund-kelly-ayottes-campa/	The ad cuts to a shadowy close-up of a man and woman shaking hands, as if they'd just made a deal, superimposed over a stack of $100 bills. The narrator explains: "She stands with the Washington gun lobby. They fund her campaigns." The 30-second spot attacks Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte's record on gun control measures as she faces a tough re-election bid against New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat. Sponsored by the political action committee for Americans for Responsible Solutions, the ad’s ominous tone and imagery leave the viewer with the impression that Ayotte doesn’t care what her constituents want because she’s in the pocket of well-heeled firearms lobbyists. It’s a line of attack used in the wake of the Orlando shootings and the Senate’s votes on gun control legislation. It has also employed by New Hampshire Democrats. "Ayotte puts her gun lobby backers before the safety and security of New Hampshire," Ray Buckley, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said in a June 21 statement. PolitiFact New Hampshire wondered how much the "gun lobby" is really spending on Ayotte’s campaign. We’ve recently looked into Ayotte’s voting history on expanded background checks. Now, we’ll focus on the financial supporters of her campaign. Following the money A review of campaign finance records shows that Ayotte has accepted at least $7,450 in donations from the most prominent lobbying group, the National Rifle Association, over her career. Over the course of Ayotte’s career, according to the database, gun rights groups have given her campaign or leadership PAC a total of $68,595. This total includes donations from the NRA as well as other groups such as the National Shooting Sports Foundation. It also includes donations from individuals who have a pattern of making political contributions supporting gun rights, which most people wouldn’t associate with the "Washington gun lobby." Americans for Responsible Solutions communications director Mark Prentice said the data in the OpenSecrets database makes it "absolutely clear" that gun rights groups fund her campaign. Beyond direct campaign contributions to Ayotte, those groups have spent another $12,500 in independent expenditures to support her, bringing the sum to more than $80,000. But it’s important to keep those numbers in context. The average U.S. Senate campaign costs more than $10 million, according to a study by MapLight.org, a nonpartisan group that studies money in politics. As she prepared for a contentious reelection battle, Ayotte reported having $6.9 million cash on hand in the last fundraising report March 31. In other words, the money she’s received -- directly or indirectly -- from gun lobbyists during her political career represents about 1 percent of the cash she has on hand right now. When compared against the $12.4 million she’s raised since she first became a candidate in the 2010 cycle, it’s 0.65 percent of her lifetime fundraising. And Ayotte’s $7,450 from the NRA pale in comparison to what the group gave to its top recipient in Congress, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. McCain has received $37,150 in direct support and more than $7 million in independent expenditures for him and against his opponents, according to OpenSecrets records dating back to 1989. "The ad is misleading because the contributions cited equal only about half a percent of the total amount raised by our campaign over her career," Ayotte’s campaign spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in an email statement. Meanwhile, the group that’s running the ad, Americans for Responsible Solutions, was founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords, an Arizona Democrat and mass-shooting survivor. It has spent $834,278 in independent expenditures against Ayotte’s candidacy, according to OpenSecrets. That’s about 10 times the amount of money spent on Ayotte’s campaign by pro-gun groups. Ayotte’s gun-policy views The ad also claims Ayotte "stands with the Washington gun lobby" in return for the donations she’s received, but that hasn’t universally been the case. Ayotte received an "A" rating from the NRA in 2012, meaning she was viewed as a "solidly pro-gun" candidate. The NRA and associated groups have taken out ads supporting Ayotte in the past. "Thank you for protecting the rights of gun owners, hunters and all who cherish the freedoms of our Second Amendment," one ad from from the National Shooting Sports Foundation said. Another ad came from an organization called the The New Hampshire Men and Women of the National Rifle Association. However, her voting record has not always adhered to the NRA’s stances. On June 20, for instance, Ayotte backed two bills blocking gun sales to suspected terrorists -- a switch from when she voted to kill a similar Democratic plan in December. A day later, she co-sponsored a bipartisan gun control bill with U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to strengthen existing background check laws, which the NRA opposed. Collins, one of the Senate’s most moderate Republicans, has a C+ rating from the NRA. Our ruling The gun control group Americans for Responsible Solutions said Ayotte "stands with the Washington gun lobby. They fund her campaigns." Ayotte has indeed benefited from money from gun rights groups – $81,095 over her career, to be exact. But it’s worth adding some context -- that’s about one-half of one percent of the total money she’s raised, and a modest amount compared to other Senate Republicans. Meanwhile, it’s not entirely correct to say that Ayotte always "stands with the Washington gun lobby." She has voted for legislation favored by the NRA, but has also bucked the NRA on at least one occasion. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True. Editor’s note: This article has been clarified to reflect the existence of some ads that were supportive of Ayotte from pro-gun groups and to reflect that some campaign contributions came from individuals, not organizations. The rating remains the same.	None	Americans for Responsible Solutions	None	None	None	2016-06-30T16:32:19	2016-05-24	['Kelly_Ayotte', 'Washington,_D.C.']

pomt-05361	If Congress froze the current spending level and then cut it by 2 percent annually, "we could balance the budget in five years."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2012/may/10/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-2-percent-annual-cuts-would-bala/	GOP Senate candidate Jamie Radtke says she has a plan to end the federal government’s deficit spending in five years: cut spending by 2 percent each year. Radtke, a tea party organizer, outlined the idea on her campaign website, where she compared cutting the federal spending to reducing her children’s $1 allowances during a time of family need. "My kids would have no problem cutting two cents out of their allowance so we could ensure that we can provide for their basic needs," Radtke wrote in an April 5 post. "So what if I told you that if Congress were willing to do the same thing with the federal budget, we could balance the budget in five years and save America from financial Armageddon?" Radtke calls her proposal "My Two Cents" and touted it during an April 28 debate among the four candidates running in the June 12 Republican primary for the Senate. "I’m the only candidate up here that has offered concrete solutions on how to balance the budget in five years," she said. We wondered if the United States, running a $1.2 trillion deficit this fiscal year, really could balance its budget by cutting spending 2 percent annually through 2016. Radtke used predictions in an August 2011 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. She started with CBO’s baseline projections, which assumes that current spending laws will play out as enacted. Then she added a few assumptions of her own, according to Chuck Hansen, a spokesman for here campaign. Radtke, unlike the CBO baseline, posited that the Bush tax cuts will be extended at the end of this year and that the Alternative Minimum Tax will be indexed for inflation, as Congress has done in the past. Those two assumptions result in about $1.4 trillion more in debt over four years, the CBO estimates say. We took Radtke’s 2 percent idea and assumptions, and we applied them to the CBO’s latest baseline projections, published in March. This fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, the federal government is expected to spend $3.64 trillion and collect revenues of $2.46 trillion. Under Radtke’s proposal, the government would freeze spending at the $3.64 trillion mark and then cut 2 percent each year. The red ink would disappear during fiscal 2016, when spending would be pared to $3.36 trillion and revenues would come in at $3.47 trillion. That means there would be a $110 billion surplus. So Radtke is mathematically correct in saying annual 2 spending cuts would balance the budget in 2016. We should point out it would take four years to end deficits, not the five years the candidate claims. But is her proposal realistic? In practice, the policy would require far more sacrifice than Radtke suggests. Her presentations ignore a key point: The cost of federal entitlement programs -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- will increase over the next four years and longer as Baby Boomers retire and collect benefits. So during the same four years that the Radtke proposal would push down spending with compounded 2 percent annual cuts, the CBO projects the cost of the federal government’s current policies will rise by about 3 percent a year -- almost entirely to support mandatory adjustments to entitlement programs. In 2016, Radtke’s plan would cut $282 billion from the current spending level, requiring Congress to bring the budget down to $3.36 trillion. But the CBO estimates the costs of current policies will increase by about $460 billion in 2016, bringing the baseline budget up to $4.1 trillion. So in 2016, there would be about a $742 billion gap between Radtke’s proposal and the CBO baseline budget. That means for Radtke’s plan to work, Congress in 2016 would have to cut about $742 billion from existing programs. The excision would almost match the entire $786 billion defense budget this year and exceed the $708 billion expected to be spent on Medicare. Radtke’s proposal would slice almost twice as deep as the House Republican budget plan, which in 2016 calls for a $410 billion cut to current services, including a major overhaul of Medicare. The GOP budget calls for the U.S. to keep running deficits until 2040. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that advocates a mix of cutting spending and increasing revenues to balance the budget, was dismissive of Radtke’s proposal. "Surely it seems reasonable in the face -- cut 2 percent and you’ll get there," he said. "But what do you cut? The real question is your intestinal fortitude to do that. There are mandatory spending programs -- Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid -- and then, even in discretionary spending, the big enchilada there is defense, and you don’t go too far in Virginia talking about defense cuts." Roberton Williams, senior fellow with the Tax Policy Center, pointed out that Radtke’s plan in 2016 would limit spending to about 80 percent of the amount the CBO says would be needed to support current programs. "The issue is not whether her numbers are accurate but whether they would mean much larger spending cuts than the rhetoric suggests," he said via email. Radtke does not prescribe a formula for achieving the 2 percent cuts, according to Hansen, her campaign spokesman. "That said, she has said that Social Security and other entitlements are not sustainable for seniors or younger people in their current form," he said. "She has proposals reforming Social Security, Medicare and other entitlements so we can provide better services with less money." Radtke, on her website, calls for a number of spending cuts: repealing President Barack Obama’s health care act; eliminating Medicare fraud; allowing health savings accounts in Medicare; moving Medicaid to a block grant program; permitting younger people to invest Social Security contributions; cutting foreign aid and eliminating federal subsidies for products such as ethanol. Radtke told us she does not know how much her specific policy proposals would save and offered no assurance they would cover the cost of her deficit-reduction proposal. She said her point is not to offer an exact list of cuts for her 2 percent idea, but simply to show the math works. "I wanted to show people that it doesn’t have to be a shock to the system," she said. "This is a very reasonable approach -- it can give us the process and infrastructure because we can’t continue with business as usual." Our ruling Radtke says the U.S. budget could be balanced by 2016 if Congress froze the current spending level and then cut it by 2 percent in each of the next four years. As a cold equation, the math works out. But Radtke sugarcoats her tough proposal by comparing it to cutting a child’s allowance by pennies. Her program of 2 percent cuts does not account for the mandated increases in entitlement programs. While she says she would be cutting about $282 billion over four years, Congress would really need to cut $742 billion from programs as they now exist. Her program would actually require cuts in current programs going far deeper than anything proposed by even House Republican budget writers in their war against spending. That makes Radtke’s plan highly unrealistic. Radtke’s calculation doesn't give a full result. For that reason, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-04628	The reason 29 states no longer have a death tax "is that the tax damaged their economic competitiveness."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/14/yes-84/did-29-states-dump-estate-tax-be-more-competitive/	The estate tax is the tax the government levies on your right to transfer assets upon death. Fans of the tax have called it the "Paris Hilton tax," after the hotel heiress who would benefit from a permanent repeal. Critics, who prefer to call it the "death tax," collected enough signatures to put a ballot measure on the Nov. 6, 2012, ballot to phase out the tax by 2016. The "Yes on 84" campaign website has a page dedicated to "7 Reasons to Eliminate" the tax. Reason No. 6 is that the estate tax "weakens us — Oregon is one of only three states west of the Mississippi with a death tax." Estate tax haters say the tax discourages investment in Oregon because there are 29 other states where they can go to accumulate wealth and die, free from worry that the state will hit their heirs with a bill. Here’s how the argument ends: "In 2001, all 50 states had some form of a death tax. The reason 29 states no longer have such a tax is that the tax damaged their economic competitiveness." We knew from a previous PolitiFact Oregon check that Oregon is in the minority with its estate or inheritance tax, but we were a little fuzzy on how that all happened. Did 29 states dump their tax because of fear that another state would woo away rich residents? Like Paris Hilton’s dad? We have to back up for a minute and explain how this works, because most of us will not die with enough money to have to pay this tax. In Oregon, the first $1 million of a person’s estate is exempt and the amounts above that are taxed at graduated rates. The federal government is more generous. The IRS exempts the first $5 million and has a maximum tax rate of 35 percent. That could change. Read on. The feds didn’t always have a $5 million threshold. It used to be $675,000 but in 2001, President Bush signed the first of what’s come to be known as the Bush-era tax cuts. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 -- better known to wonks as EGTRRA -- gradually increased the allowed exemption and lowered the maximum tax rate until 2010, when the estate tax would be repealed. In 2010, Congress set the current exemption and tax rate through 2012, at which point members need to review the issue again. How did the 2001 law affect states? Or, more importantly, what was the competition like for those very wealthy, dying individuals? The short version is that all 50 states were connected to the federal estate tax in some way, so they were pretty much on even footing. Most states used the "pickup" or "sponge" tax to get a share of the tax paid without imposing a separate tax on the deceased resident. This is why it’s accurate to say that all 50 states had an estate tax in 2001. The 2001 law gradually eliminated the credit that states could claim until it zeroed out in 2005. Elizabeth McNichol of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, says that following the 2001 law, a dozen states decoupled from the federal estate tax law, allowing those states to continue collecting those taxes. Three states, including Oregon and Washington, approved estate taxes not tied to the federal tax. Seven states had to do nothing to maintain their estate or inheritance tax. The other states let their "death tax" provisions die. "So with the Bush tax cuts in 2001, states were put to a choice of whether they would implement their own estate tax or whether they would let it phase out," said J.L. Wilson, a lobbyist with Associated Oregon Industries whose group supports the state ballot measure. "Most of the states in the west allowed their estate taxes to phase out." We contacted Kevin Mannix, the Salem attorney and former legislator who is president of Common Sense for Oregon, the main organization leading the campaign in support of the measure. First, he pointed out that the Measure 84 website has several tabs, including the "reasons to eliminate" page, which he considers to be arguments. The "death tax facts" page, Mannix says, is where the campaign puts out "facts," as opposed to "arguments." (A very interesting argument, we say.) On we go to the facts page, where point No. 2 reads: "In 2001, all 50 states had estate/inheritance taxes. Since then 31 states have repealed them." That’s not true, since not all of the states actually repealed estate tax legislation, but Mannix says the campaign was "trying to shorthand the statement." So let’s return to the "reasons" page, which Mannix has by now changed, in light of PolitiFact Oregon’s query: "In 2001, all 50 states had some form of a death tax. Since then, 31 states have done away with such a tax." Mannix acknowledged that the campaign lacked the evidence to make the assertion that concerns over economic competitiveness had prompted the mass departure after 2001. "Our main point is that in terms of competitiveness," he says, "every time another state eliminates the tax, those in the diminishing number that still have the tax are in a more difficult position." Sure, that makes intuitive sense. If PolitiFact Oregon had $5 million and we could choose where we die, we might opt for the state without an estate tax so we could leave more money to the baby PolitiFact-lets. But we suspect there are many reasons that factor into where a person dies, even many financial reasons. As of now, 28 states do not have an estate tax. That will grow to 29 in January when Ohio’s repeal goes into effectand to 30 in July when Delaware’s estate tax is set to expire. Earlier this year, Tennessee lawmakers agreed to phase out the state’s inheritance tax by 2016. The rest of the states have an estate tax, inheritance tax, or both in the case of New Jersey and Maryland. On the West Coast, Hawaii let its tax lapse but approved a new one. Washington lawmakers approved an estate tax right away in 2005, which voters declined to repeal in 2006. Oregon lawmakers voted in 2003 to reconnect to the 1997 federal tax code, and not the 2001 one. "We did make a conscious decision to connect," says Mazen Malik, senior economist with the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office. (By the way, he also said his office found that repealing the death tax could result in a tiny bump of wealthier people moving to Oregon or deciding to stay in Oregon, but that any added tax benefit was negligible compared with an estimated $100 million a year Oregon collects in estate taxes.) A key argument of the Yes on 84 campaign is to claim that Oregon is at an economic disadvantage because of our estate tax. Saying that more than half of states got rid of their estate tax laws because they feared being at an economic disadvantage drives home the point that Oregon could be dumb for not doing the same. But that wasn’t the stated reason for most of those states. They didn’t take a vote to repeal. The feds made the change. The states just let the provisions lapse. Mannix admitted he lacked the documentation to say that states no longer have an estate tax because of competitive fears. We’ll reiterate here what we’ve said elsewhere: Campaigns have a special responsibility to make sure they put out accurate statements. One would think that Mannix, a former legislator with decades of experience in Oregon public policy, would understand that. Mannix corrected the statement in the "arguments" section online, although he still has an inaccurate statement on the "facts" page. We’re not going to elaborate on what we think about differentiating between arguments and facts, except to say that no matter what the label is, statements of fact should be accurate. This one isn’t. We rule the statement False.	None	Yes on 84	None	None	None	2012-09-14T17:56:26	2012-09-07	['None']

pomt-07551	Says Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg "put an 80-year-old farmer in jail for refusing to plant native vegetation on his farm."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/01/citizens-strong-america/ad-says-joanne-kloppenburg-jailed-80-year-old-farm/	Critics of JoAnne Kloppenburg, the challenger to Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice David Prosser in the April 5, 2011 election, portray her as a rigid "government lawyer" bent on enforcing regulations no matter the consequences. Among them is a group called Citizens for a Strong America, which claims in a TV ad: "Kloppenburg is so extreme, she even put an 80-year-old farmer in jail for refusing to plant native vegetation on his farm." Among its other charges, the ad points out that Kloppenburg has never been a judge. Of course, only a judge -- not an assistant attorney general such as Kloppenburg -- can put people in jail. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s till some ground and see how much truth grows out of this claim. The farmer referenced in the ad is Wayne Hensler, who was involved in an 11-year water pollution dispute with Jefferson County, as well as the state, over farmland he owned adjacent to Marsh Lake. We wanted to ask Citizens for a Strong America-- one of five conservative groups that reportedly have spent $2 million in TV advertising against Kloppenburg -- for evidence to back its claim. That proved to be difficult. According to its website, the group is based in Beaver Dam, Wis., and "promotes public policies that reduce tax burdens on families, increase public safety and protect the rights of parents to make decisions about their children’s medical, psychological and educational well-being." No names, phone numbers or e-mail addresses were provided on the website. And there are no Beaver Dam phone numbers listed for Citizens for a Strong America or for Veronica Johnson, a person identified as having placed the TV ad. We did find a statement that the group filed with TV stations as support for its anti-Kloppenburg ad. The statement cites online court records to back up the claim that Kloppenburg put Hensler in jail. But that’s not what the records show. What they show is that now-retired Jefferson County Circuit Judge John Ullsvik ordered Hensler to serve five days in jail after finding him in contempt of court -- for a third time -- in connection with his land dispute. The records show that Kloppenburg prepared an order so the court could seize $5,000 from Hensler’s bank account to cover a court-ordered forfeiture that Hensler had repeatedly refused to pay. But that involved getting the court-ordered payment, not the jailing. And the judge instructed Kloppenburg to do this. It is common in legal matters for attorneys to draft documents, such as proposed findings, that are ultimately issued by the court. In any case, that’s not the same as Kloppenburg putting Hensler in jail for not planting native vegetation -- a claim that is all the more ridiculous when you consider what happened over the course of Hensler’s 11-year dispute with the government. Here are some of the highlights, based on online Jefferson County Circuit Court records, as well as a civil complaint and the jailing order that were filed in the case: April 1999: County officials meet with Hensler about the "severe erosion problem" on his farmland, which slopes down toward a culvert that discharges into Marsh Lake. So it doesn’t start out as a "native vegetation" issue at all. October 1999: In its third meeting with Hensler, the county suggests remedies, including seeding the area with winter wheat or rye, and offers to pay 70 percent of the cost. He rejects all the options. Later, the state agriculture department gets involved, ordering Hensler to solve the erosion problem within three years. August 2003: With the three-year deadline having passed, the state Department of Natural Resources gives Hensler a new one-year deadline, ordering him to plant vegetative cover to stop the erosion. December 2004: After the one-year deadline and an extension pass, a county official checks to see if Hensler has done the seeding. Hensler says: "Hell no, I ain’t doing nothing. You have to prove I am running all that (expletive) dirt into the lake." April 2005: Kloppenburg, representing the state, files a civil complaint against Hensler in Jefferson County Circuit Court. The complaint says Hensler’s land is a significant source of pollution in the Rock Lake watershed and it cites state law that requires corrective action to protect water quality. November 2005: After another deadline passes, Judge Randy Koschnick, who initially handled the case, finds Hensler in contempt of court and gives him another deadline to plant the native vegetation. May 2007: Hensler admits that he ripped up seeding that had been done by the DNR with permission of the court. He is found in contempt of court again. July 2008: Ullsvik, who took over the case from Koschnick, finds Hensler in contempt of court a third time and orders a five-day jail term. Hensler does not go to jail because he has heart surgery. February 2009: Ullsvik orders Hensler, then 80, sent immediately to jail for the contempt and for not paying a court-ordered $5,000 forfeiture to cover the DNR’s cost to re-seed the land. The Jefferson County Jail confirmed that Hensler spent five days in jail. We tried to call Hensler, but his number has been disconnected. Court records indicate he turned the land in dispute over to family members. We did reach Ullsvik and asked whether Kloppenburg had asked him to put Hensler in jail. The retired judge said he asked Kloppenburg at one hearing "somewhat sarcastically" if she wanted Hensler jailed, and that Kloppenburg said no, she only wanted Hensler to comply with the orders. So it was a judge’s decision -- based on Hensler’s contempt of court, not based merely on his refusal to plant grass -- to put Hensler in jail. OK, we’ve turned over enough soil; let’s see what our work has yielded. Citizens for a Strong America claimed in a TV ad that Kloppenburg "put an 80-year-old farmer in jail for refusing to plant native vegetation on his farm." Wayne Hensler did refuse to plant native vegetation and he was 80 when he went to jail. But it is impossible for Kloppenburg -- or any attorney -- to put someone in jail. What’s more, the ad leaves out 11 years’ worth of context. Hensler repeatedly ignored orders from county and state officials -- and then from a court -- to remedy an erosion problem. He was found in contempt of court three times by two different judges. And when Hensler was finally put behind bars, it was on the order of a judge for contempt of court, not merely refusing to plant native vegetation. Kloppenburg didn’t even request the jail time. The claim against Kloppenburg is ridiculously false. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Citizens for a Strong America	None	None	None	2011-04-01T16:40:08	2011-03-31	['None']

pomt-10413	"I had an uncle ... who was part of the first American troops to go into Auschwitz and liberate the concentration camps."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/27/barack-obama/uncle-liberated-camp-but-not-auschwitz/	Speaking at a Memorial Day event in Las Cruces, N.M., Sen. Barack Obama misidentified the concentration camp his uncle helped to liberate with the 89th Infantry Division during World War II. "I had an uncle who was . . . part of the first American troops to go into Auschwitz and liberate the concentration camps," Obama said in the speech on May 26, 2008. "And the story in our family was that when he came home, he just went up into the attic and he didn't leave the house for six months. Right? Now obviously something had really affected him deeply. But at that time there just weren't the kinds of facilities to help somebody work through that kind of pain." Obama's story immediately seems implausible because Auschwitz was liberated in 1945 by Soviet, not American, troops. It's further complicated by a back-and-forth between Republicans and the Obama campaign the day after his remarks. The Republican National Committee issued a press release drawing attention to the historical gaffe. "Barack Obama's dubious claim is inconsistent with world history and demands an explanation," Republican National Committee Secretary Alex Conant said in a statement. "Obama's frequent exaggerations and outright distortions raise questions about his judgment and his readiness to lead as commander in chief." Later that day, the Obama campaign acknowledged getting the location wrong but said Obama's great uncle (his grandmother's brother) was part of liberating a concentration camp in Ohrdruf, a subcamp of Buchenwald in Germany. "Sen. Obama's family is proud of the service of his grandfather and uncles in World War II — especially the fact that his great uncle was a part of liberating one of the concentration camps at Buchenwald," said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton. "Yesterday he mistakenly referred to Auschwitz instead of Buchenwald in telling of his personal experience of a soldier in his family who served heroically." Now, in order to rule on Obama's statement, PolitiFact needed to answer two questions: First, what military unit liberated the camp at Ohrdruf? And most important, was Obama's great uncle in that unit at that time? Here's the answer to both: According to an article from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the 89th Infantry Division on April 4, 1945, overran Ohrdruf, about 40 miles southeast of the Buchenwald concentration camp. "Ohrdruf was the first Nazi concentration camp liberated by U.S. troops in Germany," the article states. "A week later, on April 12, Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower, George S. Patton, and Omar Bradley visited Ohrdruf to see, firsthand, evidence of Nazi atrocities against concentration camp prisoners." According to a Web site dedicated to the 89th Infantry Division, "Ohrdruf was a work camp, not an extermination camp, but the difference is difficult to discern. Prisoners were literally worked to death and disposed of by burning in incinerators, which was the most 'cost-effective method.'" According to a 1998 account by Bruce Nickols, a member of the 89th Infantry Division: "As we stepped into the compound one was greeted by an overpowering odor of quick-lime, dirty clothing, feces, and urine. Lying in the center of the square were 60-70 dead prisoners clad in striped clothing and in disarray. They had reportedly been machine gunned the day before because they were too weak to march to another camp." There's little question, then, that the 89th Infantry Division liberated Ohrdruf, a Nazi work camp that may not have been a facility on the scale of Auschwitz but shared many of that camp's notorious characteristics. That leaves the matter of whether Obama's great uncle really served in that Army unit at that time. The Obama campaign did not provide any documentation to confirm that Charles T. Payne, 83, served in the 89th Infantry Division in April 1945. And we wanted more than their word. Although we were not able to reach Payne directly, Payne's son, Richard Payne, said his father "definitely served in the 89th Infantry Division" and confirmed that Obama's account was substantially accurate, except for identifying the wrong concentration camp. Richard Payne declined to say anything further. Mark Kitchell, who maintains a Web site dedicated to the 89th Infantry Division, said he was able to locate a list of servicemen that includes a Pfc. C. T. Payne who served in the K Company of the 355th Infantry Regiment of the 89th Infantry Division. The list included only the initials for first names. The 355th Infantry Regimen was the one that liberated Ohrdruf, Kitchell said. Kitchell, the son of 89th veteran Raymond E. Kitchell, obtained the list from the official Division History book, written shortly after the war. Finally, the National Personnel Records Center, an operation of the federal government's National Archives and Records Administration, put this question to rest. Researchers confirmed to PolitiFact that Army personnel records for Payne would have been destroyed in a 1973 fire that consumed many such archives, but they dug up a "Morning Report" dated April 11, 1945, showing Pfc. Charles T. Payne was assigned to the 355th Regiment Infantry, Company K. The Records Center provided a copy of the report. A faxed copy provided to PolitiFact was legible enough for us to make out Payne's information, but the faxed photocopy of the record is too grainy to be of use if posted here. There's no question Obama misspoke when he said his uncle helped to liberate the concentration camp in Auschwitz. But even with this error in locations, Obama's statement was substantially correct in that he had an uncle — albeit a great uncle — who served with troops who helped to liberate the Ohrdruf concentration/work camp and saw, firsthand, the horrors of the Holocaust.

pomt-02920	"We’re one of the only communities in the country that didn’t lose population in the last census."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2013/nov/03/chris-abele/chris-abele-says-milwaukee-one-few-communities-did/	Among the plethora of positive points Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele shared in a recent speech was this one: Milwaukee is on a very short list of areas that didn’t shrink in the last U.S. census. Here’s what Abele said in the Oct. 1, 2013 speech to the Rotary Club of Milwaukee: "We’re one of the only communities in the country that didn’t lose population in the last census, the median age for which went down, and any economist will tell you that’s good news." That is good news. If it’s accurate. To be sure, the city of Milwaukee’s population losses in recent decades have paled in comparison to some other Midwestern cities. But we were surprised by Abele’s broader population claim, which compares us with communities across the nation. Just what numbers was he using? Abele’s office first pointed us to state population trends from 2010 to 2012 showing a gain for Wisconsin. But that didn’t address his claim about Milwaukee and the country. What’s more, Abele’s state data showed that 49 states gained population from 2010 to 2012, based on the most recent estimates. So, virtually no one went down. There’s another problem: The figures he shared with us were based on annual population estimates by the Census Bureau, not the full census -- the nose count that occurs every 10 years, most recently in April 2010. Abele’s "last census" reference may have been to the estimates, not the actual census. But as we’ll see it doesn’t change the accuracy of his claim. Let’s look at the population numbers, starting with the last full census. Milwaukee’s population change First, we checked population figures for the city, for Milwaukee County and for the Milwaukee metro area, comparing the 2000 census with the 2010 census. City: Milwaukee lost about 2,000 people, coming in at 594,833. So, it actually shrunk a bit, by 0.4 percent. Milwaukee County: It grew by 0.8 percent, landing at 947,735. Metro area: The four-county metro region added about 55,000 people, or 3.7 percent, landing at 1,555,908. The national picture Then we examined census data on other large urban areas, again noting the change in population in the decade. Cities: Only Chicago, Detroit, Memphis and Baltimore lost ground among the 25 largest cities. In the next tier of 25, Milwaukee joined Cleveland (-17.1 percent) and Oakland (-2.2) on the downside. So the vast majority gained population, with 19 cities adding more than 10 percent. Counties: Forty-four of the top 50 most-populous counties gained population. In fact, Milwaukee County’s gain was one of the smallest on a percentage basis in that group. Metros: Forty-five of the top 50 metropolitan areas grew. The big winners included Raleigh, N.C.; Austin, Tex.; Charlotte, N.C.; Las Vegas, Nev.; Orlando, Fla.; Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif.; and Phoenix, Ariz. It’s clear from the data that most urban areas grew or at least held steady, contrary to Abele’s claim. And the modest growth in the Milwaukee metro region, though rivaling the Los Angeles and New York City areas, was at the very low end among large urban areas. A Census Bureau report on the 2000-2010 trend among some 900 metro and "micro areas" confirmed that growth was widespread, though slower than in the 1990s. A "micro area" contains an urban core of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 people, according to the federal definition. "Population growth of at least twice the national rate occurred in many metro and micro areas, such as some areas in parts of California, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Florida, and the Carolinas. No metro area in the West region declined," the 2010 Census report said. Among counties, the report said, "the counties that lost population were mostly regionally clustered and mirrored decades of population loss for those areas." For example, there were population declines in many Appalachian counties in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia; many Great Plains counties in the Dakotas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas; and a group of counties in and around the Mississippi Delta. Notably, the report found that "many counties along the Great Lakes and on the northern U.S. border either lost population or grew below 10 percent." After we completed our fact check, Abele’s office got back to us again. This time, we were told Abele had been referring specifically to the city of Milwaukee, and the small estimated gain it made between the 2010 census and 2012. It’s true that annual census estimates since the full 2010 census show the city of Milwaukee growing slightly, by about 2,000 people. But gains in that two-year post-census period were common, even among cities that saw declines from 2000 to 2010, based on media reports and the Census Bureau estimates released for 2011 and 2012. In 2011, for example, the Census Bureau noted that "overall, the population in cities grew by 1.0 percent across the nation between 2010 and 2011. However, large cities (285) tended to grow faster than the national rate at 1.3 percent." Abele spokesman Brendan Conway conceded his boss would have been more accurate had he referred specifically to the Great Lakes Area cities and population growth. Our rating Abele contended that "We’re one of the only communities in the country that didn’t lose population in the last census." However you cut it, he’s way off base. This claim, given that fast growth in certain regions of the U.S. is well-established and well-known, ventures into ridiculous territory. Pants on Fire.

pomt-05242	"The U.S. is borrowing approximately $2.52 for every $1 of economic growth so far in 2012."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/03/rodney-frelinghuysen/rodney-frelinghuysen-says-debt-rose-more-twice-fas/	The nation faces a hefty tab that keeps growing. According to U.S. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, the United States is increasing its debt twice as fast as its economy is expanding. A May 25 e-mail newsletter from the Morris County Republican cited growth in debt compared with the increase in the gross domestic product, or GDP -- a measure of the nation’s economy -- in the first quarter of 2012 and said, "the U.S. is borrowing approximately $2.52 for every $1 of economic growth so far in 2012." Really? PolitiFact New Jersey checked the congressman’s numbers and found he’s right -- down to the penny. Let’s first discuss the different types of federal debt. Gross federal debt includes two components: debt held by the public, which is money the government owes outside entities, and intragovernmental holdings, which is essentially money the government owes itself. As we -- and our PolitiFact colleagues -- have noted previously, some economists prefer to focus on debt held by the public since it is money borrowed from private groups rather than gross debt. In the time frame the congressman specified, the debt held by the public actually increased more than the gross debt. Here, we’ll note the changes in both measures of debt and compare each with the growth in the nation’s economy. In the first three months of 2012, the gross debt grew by more than $359.1 billion to reach more than $15.58 trillion. Over the same time frame, the debt held by the public grew by $399.1 billion, totaling nearly $10.85 trillion. According to preliminary estimates from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis -- the most recent data available at the time Frelinghuysen’s e-mail newsletter was sent -- the GDP grew by $142.4 billion to reach roughly $15.46 trillion in the first quarter of 2012. Those figures are in current dollars and not adjusted for inflation. So how does the national economy’s expansion compare to growth in federal debt? Gross debt grew by more than $359.1 billion in the first three months of 2012, while the GDP increased by $142.4 billion. That’s $2.52 added to the debt for each $1 added to the nation’s economy. Or for debt held by the public, it’s $2.80 in borrowing for each $1 in GDP growth. We should note that the Bureau of Economic Analysis released updated figures on Thursday that showed slower growth in GDP. According to that data, the GDP grew by $134.6 billion in the first quarter of 2012. Using that figure, the nation added $1 to the economy for every $2.66 it added to the gross debt. Jason Peuquet, the research director for the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Frelinghuysen’s statistic is not very surprising given the impact of the economic downturn on the federal budget. Lower revenues driven in part by high unemployment and stagnating wages, as well as increased spending on programs such as unemployment insurance and food stamps have all added "even more to deficits and debt in the near term," Peuquet said. But, Peuquet said, "the most important fact isn’t that this is going on because this is what everyone would have predicted." More importantly, he said, "we are not on a path to have the budget recover completely once the economy does" because structural deficits will "keep piling on more and more." Our ruling Frelinghuysen said: "the U.S. is borrowing approximately $2.52 for every $1 of economic growth so far in 2012." The gross debt grew by more than $359.1 billion in the first three months of 2012. During the same time frame, the GDP increased by $142.4 billion, according to the data available at the time of Frelinghuysen’s statement. That’s $2.52 added to the debt for every dollar added to the nation’s economy. We rate this statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

The headline on a June 14, 2017, post on FreedomCrossroads.us declared, "Nancy Pelosi suffers breakdown, taken from Capitol Hill on a stretcher." Facebook users flagged the post as potentially being fabricated as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. The brief post said that Pelosi "was transferred via ambulance to Bethesda" and quoted the unmistakably fake Rear-Admiral Thomas Phillip McCrakken, the alleged head of psychiatry, as saying Pelosi may not recover. There is absolutely no proof this incident happened, of course, and a Pelosi spokesman had no comment. The image used at the top of the story is taken from NBC footage recorded after a shooting at the Capitol on March 28, 2016. But FreedomCrossroads.us had a familiar feel to it — it shared a design template with TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody site responsible for literally hundreds of fake news stories popping up across the Internet. That site was run by a man named Christopher Blair, who has told us he was a self-described liberal troll living in Maine. He said his aim was to trick conservatives with absurd and fictional news stories that exposed how gullible they were. A Whois lookup showed that FreedomCrossroads.us is registered to Blair, and lists information PolitiFact had previously used to contact him. The site was registered on Aug. 18, 2016. Its posts are archived back to March 21, 2017. We tried to reach Blair to verify he was the site’s owner but didn’t get any response. The Pelosi post is credited to an author called "Truth Dealer," who is crosslisted as Alan Whitemor. FreedomCrossroads.us said on its page footer that the site made up its stories. "Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate," it reads. Pelosi did not have any kind of breakdown.

pomt-00528	The Democrats are "responsible" for "the swift, mindless drawdown of a military that was generations in the making."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/22/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-democrats-responsible-swift-mindless/	The size and scope of the U.S. military is already becoming an issue on the presidential campaign trail. During his presidential campaign kickoff speech, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush criticized the Obama administration for leaving the military to wither. Among the bad decisions being made by "the party now in the White House," Bush said, was "the swift, mindless drawdown of a military that was generations in the making." We decided to take a closer look at his claim. We’ll break it down into two key questions. Has there been a "swift, mindless drawdown" of the military? And are the Democrats "responsible"? Has there been a 'swift, mindless drawdown' of the military? The Bush campaign confirmed that the candidate was referencing the military budget, so we’ll look there. The unified "national security" budget -- which includes both the Pentagon and related spending such as nuclear-weapons work by the Energy Department -- rose in 2010 and 2011, but has fallen every year since then, by a cumulative 15 percent over the four-year period. Other ways of looking at the question show declines as well. National security spending was 20.1 percent of the federal budget in 2010, but an estimated 15.9 percent in 2015. And over the same span, national-security spending fell from 4.6 percent of gross domestic product to 3.3 percent. These are genuine declines, in a fairly rapid time frame. There are two main reasons for this. The first is the Obama administration’s decision to start removing U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. This is clearly visible in the chart below, published by the Congressional Budget Office. To understand the chart, it’s important to know that in recent years, the defense budget has been divided into two categories -- the "base budget," which funds basic, ongoing military needs, and the "overseas contingency operations" budget, which funds specific deployments, such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq. The lighter of those two lines, the overseas contingency operations budget, has fallen more dramatically during the past few years. As the chart shows, the base budget has also been going down, partly because of a process known as sequestration. What’s sequestration? In 2011, the federal government was nearing its legal debt limit, which meant that Congress had to authorize a higher level for borrowing. House Republicans insisted that actual spending cuts be passed along with an increase to the debt limit. House Speaker John Boehner led negotiations with the White House, and at first the sides seemed to be moving toward a wide-ranging overhaul of the federal budget, dubbed the "grand bargain." However, the closed-door negotiations fell apart, and Republicans and Democrats came to a less ambitious debt-limit agreement, enacted as the Budget Control Act of 2011. The law included approximately $1.2 trillion in budget cuts spread over 10 years. But it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion through a 12-member panel known as "the super-committee." As an incentive to action, the law included an unusual budget threat: If the super-committee couldn’t agree on a package, or if Congress voted it down, then automatic, across-the-board cuts would go into effect, with half of those cuts hitting defense. These automatic cuts are known as "sequestration." Sequestration was intended more as an incentive to get the two sides to negotiate than as a realistic policy alternative. However, when the super-committee failed to agree on a deficit-reduction package, sequestration cuts kicked in. These were across-the-board cuts -- not reductions to particular programs carefully selected by lawmakers -- and they included both domestic and military programs. While the defense budget had already been drifting downward under Obama, the impact of the sequester was noteworthy. "The cut in defense spending in 2013, when sequestration went into effect, was the largest, single-year percentage cut in the Defense Department budget since the end of the Korean War, so I think that counts as ‘swift,’ " said Todd Harrison, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. "And because the cut was initially through a sequester, which cuts all accounts by the same amount, it was also ‘mindless.’ " So Bush has a point when he says the cuts have been "swift" and "mindless." But is the Obama administration solely to blame? No The Obama administration has already proposed spending increases for future years. The most recent Obama budget proposed a 7.8 percent increase in the base Defense Department budget between 2015 and 2016 -- clear evidence that he is seeking increased defense spending despite the continuing threat of sequestration. And the increase isn’t fleeting. CBO projections based on Defense Department requests show rising defense spending over the next five years. Taking account of inflation, defense spending is projected to rise by 8.8 percent between 2015 and 2019. The CBO also predicts increases above the rate of inflation as far in the future as 2030. "Defense spending is rising modestly now even at Budget Control Act levels," said Mackenzie Eaglen, a resident fellow in security studies at the American Enterprise Institute. The Bush campaign argues that author Bob Woodward’s detailed book about fiscal negotiations has described the sequester as a Democratic invention. They also note that when House Republicans sought to use overseas contingency funding to go around the budget caps on military spending, Obama threatened a veto. However, a cross-section of experts told PolitiFact they see the two parties as co-owners of sequestration. Republicans in Congress voted for the law that set up its possibility. In the House, 174 Republicans and 95 Democrats voted for the law, while 66 Republicans and 95 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 269-161.) In the Senate, 28 Republicans and 45 Democrats voted for it, while 19 Republicans and 6 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 74-26.) Two other laws that modified the terms of the sequester were also passed on a bipartisan basis -- the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. "The Budget Control Act was adopted by bipartisan majorities with a Republican House, Democratic Senate, and signed into law by a Democratic president," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "The failure of the super-committee was a bipartisan failure. This falls on both sides." While Eaglen acknowledged that the White House initially came up with sequestration, she added that "both parties are responsible for the drawdown. Many members of Congress voted for these military reductions, and the president signed them into law." Harrison agreed. "In a divided government, I don’t think it’s ever completely accurate to say that one party or the other is responsible for something," he said. "What happened is that both parties took the defense budget hostage in the budget debate, and when both sides have the same hostage, it doesn’t work out well for the hostage." He added that the administration has proposed a defense budget each year that was higher than what Congress ultimately enacted, with the exception of 2015, when Congress enacted spending at close to the level Obama proposed. "So Congress has been providing less to the Defense Department than the administration has requested, but the president has signed each of those appropriations bills into law," he said. "So I think the blame has to be shared." Is the level of funding today, and in the near future, adequate for the military’s needs? Perhaps not surprisingly, there is less consensus on this question. Even taking into account sequestration, current defense spending is high by historical standards. As we noted, defense spending is estimated to be 3.3 percent of gross domestic in 2015. That’s higher than in the period immediately before 9/11 -- the years 1997 to 2002. Additionally, the current round of cuts "are consistent with other post-war drawdowns, including Korea, Vietnam, and the Cold War," said Christopher A. Preble, the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that favors lower defense spending. "I believe that we are extraordinarily safe and secure, both by historic standards, and relative to any other country on earth," Preble said. To be sure, Eaglen said that military chiefs and civilian leaders have repeatedly said sequestration poses an intolerable risk to U.S. forces. "I would agree," she said. At the same time, she added, the military brass has said that Obama’s proposed budget levels "are acceptable. Putting aside how it’s funded -- through the overseas contingency budget or not -- the GOP Congress is giving the president" what he wants. Our ruling Bush said Democrats are "responsible" for "the swift, mindless drawdown of a military that was generations in the making." There has certainly been a decline in military spending during much of Obama’s presidency, and to the extent that sequestration has contributed to this, it’s not unreasonable to call the cuts "swift" and "mindless." But to pin that solely on the Obama administration is wrong. Obama has proposed increases for defense spending beyond the rate of inflation lasting years into the future, and Bush’s decision to exclusively blame the Democrats for past cuts isn’t justified. It has taken two to tango, experts say. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-06-22T10:53:02	2015-06-15	['None']

pomt-08722	"Buck wants to privatize Social Security."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/02/michael-bennet/bennet-says-ken-buck-wants-privatize-social-securi/	Demonizing privatization was a key to the Democrat's success in defeating President George W. Bush's plan to change Social Security. Now they're using it again in an attempt to hold on to legislative majorities in the House and the Senate. In his latest TV ad, Senate candidate Michael Bennet, D-Col., questions whether his opponent, Ken Buck, is the right person for the job. The ad opens with a video of Buck saying he'll be the "voice of people on Main Street" but quickly transitions to ominous music and a narrator asking "Who is Ken Buck" and "Does he speak for Colorado?" The narrator goes on make a series of charges, including that "Buck wants to privatize Social Security." History has shown that accusing your opponent of wanting to privatize Social Security is a good political strategy. President Obama has certainly taken notice. During the 2008 campaign, then candidate Obama accused Sen. John McCain of wanting to revitalize Bush's plan to "privatize" Social Security. We rated that Barely True. And during his weekly address in August, Obama said that some Republican leaders in Congress" are "pushing to make privatizing Social Security a key part of their legislative agenda if they win a majority in Congress this fall." We rated it Barely True once again. So how does the evidence stack up in this case? In March of 2010, while speaking at the Constitutionalist Today forum, Buck was asked whether it is "constitutional for the government to have a Social Security program where it directs the monies that we put into it?" Here is his response, in its entirety: "I don't know whether it's constitutional or not. It is certainly a horrible policy in what happened in the LBJ Administration back in the 60's when they took the money out of the trust fund to fund general fund programs, and what we ended up with was a system that will be bankrupt anywhere from 10 to 25 years from now. It is a bad policy. I don't know that the federal government should be involved in a retirement plan. It should be a plan that certainly once people pay into it, they have the expectation of getting a return, and they're entitled to that, but the idea the federal government should be running health care or retirement or any of those programs is fundamentally against what I believe and that is that the private sector runs programs like that far better." So Buck is clearly critical of Social Security in its current form, and he did say that the "private sector runs programs like that (Social Security) far better," but is he actually for privatizing the program? Here is what Owen Loftus, Ken Buck's press secretary, told Denver's 9News on Aug. 31, 2010: "Ken is not in favor of privatizing Social Security. Here is Ken's position -- For current beneficiaries; the government has made a sacred promise. Current retirees have planned their lives based on these Social Security benefits. For older workers approaching retirement, they have already planned their retirement. We need to ensure that Social Security is solvent for these workers. All ideas should be on the table to ensure this. These can include some sort of means testing, or raising the retirement age to reflect the fact that people live longer than they used to. For younger workers and future generations, the issue isn't Social Security; it's savings. We must ensure that Social Security is there for younger workers when they retire, and that retains its main function as a safety net for retirees. To do this, the government needs to craft policies to encourage younger workers to save more." During a July 22, 2010 debate sponsored by Denver's 9News, Buck said, "We've got to peg Social Security to individuals so those individuals have the ability perhaps to invest in various funds that are approved by the government. But those individuals also own that fund." Then there is an interview with CNN's John King on Aug. 11, 2010. Asked whether he thinks the government should be involved in retirement policy, Buck responded that he does not think "it's what the Founding Fathers intended, but we have the policy. We've made a promise to our seniors. We need to keep that promise. I think we need to make sure that we are putting Social Security on a sustainable path. It's absolutely something that the federal government is going to be involved in, in the future. We can make it the best program we can make it." Trevor Kincaid, communications director for Michael Bennet, maintains, however, that Buck has shown hostility toward the Social Security program. "Context again is important here, and in the context of an entire answer in which he explicitly questions whether Social Security should exist at all, Buck's hostility towards the program (at least in its current form) is clear. And calling the program in its current form a horrible policy is calling the program as it exists a horrible policy," he told 9News. Going back to the original claim, Michael Bennet said that Buck wants to privatize Social Security, using a term that we believe is often used to scare seniors into thinking that their lifetime savings will be transferred into the stock market -- the same one that took a plunge in 2008 and is still struggling. He said that he does not think that the Founding Fathers intended to have the program, and he openly stated that the private sector would do a better job of allowing younger workers to save. But he also has been very clear that he does not want to change the program for current retirees or those close to retiring. Bennet's ad gives the impression that Buck wants to expose all seniors' benefits to the vicissitudes of the stock market, but we find that's not the case. As a result, we rate this Half True.

pomt-04720	Says under the Romney-Ryan budget ... "the American Opportunity Tax Credit for college tuition would be eliminated."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/aug/31/barack-obama/romneyryan-budget-would-be-end-road-american-oppor/	As a battleground state, New Hampshire sees its share of campaign attacks as national candidates try to catch the eye of Live Free or Die voters. The latest shot came in an email from President Barack Obama to New Hampshire reporters titled, "New Report: Impact of Romney-Ryan Plan on Education in NH." "Disappointingly, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan support a plan that would give millionaires tax breaks while cutting college scholarships and other key resources in education that help create a strong middle class," Obama said in the email sent Aug. 21. "Romney thinks that students should ‘borrow money’ or get help from their parents to help pay for college, and under the Romney-Ryan budget, college aid would be cut for nearly 10 million students nationally and the American Opportunity Tax Credit for college tuition would be eliminated." PolitiFact already checked Obama and actress Eva Longoria -- a national co-chair for Obama’s re-election campaign -- about part of this claim, which says the plan from Ryan, the House Budget Committee Chairman, would cut Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students. They each got a Half True.PolitiFact concluded that Obama’s statement was fair using his set of assumptions--that spending cuts called for in Ryan's budget plan would be made evenly across federal programs--but they ignored what House Republicans said was a preference that Pell grant maximums not be reduced. But the so-called Romney-Ryan budget also would eliminate the American Opportunity Tax Credit? That’s one we hadn’t examined yet, so we decided to check it out. First, we contacted Obama’s campaign to get sources behind the claim. They didn’t get back to us. We also reached out to Romney’s people, who had no response. The Urban-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center did give us an answer, however. Through the Romney campaign website and email exchanges with campaign policy advisors, the Tax Policy Center has issued an analysis of Romney’s "Fairer, Flatter, and Simpler" tax plan. According to the center, Romney’s economic advisers say that the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) would be reverted back to the Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE) tax credit if Romney is elected president this year. HOPE was among higher education tax incentives initiated in 1997 to combat soaring college expenses. Along with the Lifetime Learning Credit, and a deduction for tuition and fees, federal tax subsidies for college students jumped from zero -- before their enactment -- to roughly $6 billion in 2005-2006. In 2009, an Obama-backed Congress enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which temporarily replaced the 1997 tax credits with the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which was worth more, and available to more families, through a few changes: - It increased the amount of student expenses that were eligible for the credit and the types of expenses allowed; the AOTC credit includes expenses for course-related books, supplies and equipment that are not necessarily paid to the educational institution. - It extended coverage to a student’s first four years of school--versus just the first two years allowed by HOPE. After the first two years under the HOPE plan, the student switches over to the Lifetime Learning Credit for their last two years of college. - It made the tax credit partially refundable. The tax credit is worth up to $2,500 of the cost of tuition, fees and course materials paid during the taxable year, or $10,000 over four years. A cool 40 percent of it, up to $1,000 a year, is refundable, so money became available to more low-income students, even if they owed no taxes. In contrast, the HOPE and LLC credits are nonrefundable. "It's basically more generous," said Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate with the Tax Policy Center, referring to the American Opportunity Tax Credit. Both of the tax credits currently exist, but they can’t be used together. "No one would’ve opted to take the HOPE over AOTC," Rosenberg added. IRS statistics show that in one year, the number of tax returns claiming education credits increased, from 2008, when 7,740,979 households claimed some education tax credit totaling $7.6 billion, with HOPE, to 2009, when 10,598,706 households claimed total credits of $10.8 billion, with AOTC. Although the American Opportunity Tax Credit was only intended to be temporary, President Obama’s annual budget proposals extended the tax credit through 2012 and proposed making it permanent, Rosenberg said. If Romney were elected, however, he would allow it to lapse as scheduled under current law. "The AOTC was only ever enacted as a temporary provision, so that’s slated to expire with a lot of other tax related things at the end of this year," Rosenberg said. "Absent of any further legislative changes, the AOTC would expire. Without anything else happening, the HOPE would again be available for people to take up." But does allowing a tax credit to expire warrant Obama’s characterization as "elimination?" "There’s always a sort of debate," Rosenberg said. "People change the way they phrase it depending on how they want it to look, whether an expiring tax provision, to expire as scheduled, is action or not." Either way, if no action is taken on the American Opportunity Tax Credit, it puts an end to to the program. Obama has used this a major talking point in his campaign. In some ads, he has been as vague as to say that Romney will "eliminate the tax deduction for college tuition." And he has tried hard to characterize Romney’s budget as favorable to the rich and weakening the middle class, including on the topic of education. It’s important to keep in mind that even though Romney would allow the credit to expire, that doesn’t mean all tax deductions for college students would be lost. If Romney does not renew the American Opportunity Tax Credit, students would revert back to using the less generous, nonrefundable alternatives. Because the four-year program is refundable -- it gives something back to students who don’t have enough income to owe taxes -- losing it would impact the lower income population. Before the American Opportunity Tax Credit was created, low-income students could get little or no benefit from the two nonrefundable tax credits available. And critics complained that they didn’t really impact college enrollment, because it provided subsidies for people who would have pursued secondary education anyway. Our ruling Romney’s campaign has said that the former Massachusetts governor will not renew the American Opportunity Tax Credit if he is elected in November. And because it’s slated to expire at the end of 2012, it would no longer be available to college students and their families if no action is taken to extend it, as Obama has done since it was enacted in 2009. But the AOTC is not the only tax deduction out there for students, as Obama’s ads may lead voters to believe. So while Romney would allow the deduction to end, it does not mean all college tax deductions would be lost. In fact, it would revert back to a previous program that has been in place since 1997. As a result, we rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-08-31T15:26:18	2012-08-21	['None']
pomt-11222	Says the term "illegal alien" is "a legal term, it’s in statute, it’s a federal term."	half-true	/texas/statements/2018/may/09/steve-mccraw/illegal-alien-legal-term-federal-law/	An exchange between a legislator and the leader of Texas’ state law enforcement agency made us wonder whether federal law uses "illegal alien" to describe any individual living in the U.S. without legal authorization. It doesn’t, we learned, though the term makes a few appearances. Many news organizations avoid the "IA" term. In 2013, the Associated Press dropped "illegal immigrant" from its stylebook. AP spokesman Paul Colford said then that "illegal" should be used to describe actions, not people, and the AP counseled journalists against using "illegal alien" except in direct quotations. We recognize, though, that "illegal alien" persists. The term showed up 80 times in our May 2018 Google search of the PolitiFact website with "illegal aliens" popping up 5,620 times. Let’s unpack what touched off this fact-check, then turn to "illegal alien" in American law. West Texas legislator questions director At an April 18, 2018, Texas House hearing, state Rep. Mary González, D-San Elizario, elicited agreement from Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, that the words that "we choose to use" are powerful. González then told McCraw she "had concerns about the language that you use and the agency is using in talking about undocumented immigrants. If we’re talking about children, for example, unaccompanied minors, then using words like ‘illegal aliens,’ I have had a concern about that, right?" she said. "And so but then, in your testimony you used it again. And so I’m guessing, my question is, is the agency standard in typically referring to undocumented immigrants as IAs?" McCraw answered: "I always use ‘illegal aliens’ and I have when I was assigned to the Department of Justice, when I worked at the FBI, when I was assigned as the director of the foreign terrorism task force because it’s a term, it’s a legal term, it’s in statute, it’s a federal term--and it’s not intended to degrade anybody in any way, shape or form." McCraw spent 21 years with the FBI before becoming director of Texas DPS, the state law-enforcement agency known for its state troopers and Texas Rangers. González replied that people "in my community" would find it "very concerning to use this language." McCraw answered that he’d consult DPS staff and "re-evaluate the use of words that their director has been using to describe, I’ve been consistent about that. And it it’s insulting, if it truly is insulting, I don’t intend to insult anybody." We later asked the DPS to elaborate on McCraw’s claim that "illegal aliens" appears in statute. We didn’t hear back. Checking for ‘illegal alien’ in federal law Given McCraw's singling out of federal statutes, we launched our post-testimony look by searching the portion of federal law titled "Aliens and Nationality," and saw that the chapter titled "Immigration and Nationality" defines the word "alien" alone as "any person not a citizen or national of the United States." But in the same "Definitions" section, we spotted "illegal" just once--and not in the context suggested by the DPS director’s testimony. "Illegal" appears in a section stating that an "alien" lawfully given permanent residency shall not be regarded as seeking U.S. entry in connection with the country’s immigration laws unless the "alien" has, among possibilities, "engaged in illegal activity after having departed" the United States. Another portion of the law says the U.S. attorney general "shall have the power and duty to control and guard the boundaries and borders of the United States against the illegal entry of aliens." Our scrolling of the act also picked up a mention of "illegal entrants". Federal agency offers examples We separately heard back from Arwen FitzGerald of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. By email, FitzGerald pointed to four uses of "illegal alien," two in federal law and the others in a congressional act. Section 1252(c) of the "Aliens and Nationality" laws is titled: "Authorizing State and local law enforcement officials to arrest and detain certain illegal aliens." The section authorizes state and local law enforcement officials "to arrest and detain an individual who— (1) is an alien illegally present in the United States; and (2) has previously been convicted of a felony in the United States and deported or left the United States after such conviction." Section 1365, titled "Reimbursement of States for costs of incarcerating illegal aliens and certain Cuban nationals," applies to any alien convicted of a felony who’s in the country unlawfully and whose most recent entry "was without inspection, or whose most recent admission to the United States was as a nonimmigrant and whose period of authorized stay as a nonimmigrant expired, or whose unlawful status was known to the government." FitzGerald also pointed out that a section of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 authorized the hiring of 25 new federal lawyers to "prosecute persons who bring into the United States or harbor illegal aliens or violate other criminal statutes involving illegal aliens." Also noted: A section of the act requiring an annual report detailing "the number of illegal aliens" sentenced or jailed for felonies in state and federal prisons. That act, we saw, relies on the established definition of "alien" spotted earlier. It doesn’t explicitly define "illegal alien," though by our count, the term appears nine times including in a section titled "Demonstration project for identification of illegal aliens in incarceration facility of Anaheim, California" and a section titled "Pilot programs on limiting issuance of driver’s licenses to illegal aliens." Experts: Mentions don’t mean much By email, though, academic experts on immigration law told us such scattered mentions of "illegal alien" in legislation and law don’t mean much. Denise Gilman, who directs the University of Texas immigration law clinic, pointed out that all but one of the term’s mentions in the 1996 act appear in section titles, not intended statutory language. "The title is a political marker in the legislation but is not the law itself," Gilman wrote. "For example, the section titled ‘PILOT PROGRAMS ON LIMITING ISSUANCE OF DRIVER'S LICENSES TO ILLEGAL ALIENS,’ goes on to use legal terms in the actual text," Gilman wrote, which refers only to "aliens who are not lawfully present" in the United States. Notably, Rick Su of the University of Buffalo School of Law told us, the "IA" term doesn’t appear in the vast Immigration and Nationality Act, the nation’s main immigration law. Su acknowledged that the term appears in the 1996 act’s section about the federal government reimbursing states for incarcerating certain immigrants. But that section, Su said, defines an "illegal alien" solely in the context of the section -- as "any alien convicted of a felony who is in the United States unlawfully and -- (1) whose most recent entry into the United States was without inspection, or (2) whose most recent admission to the United States was as a nonimmigrant and -- (A) whose period of authorized stay as a nonimmigrant expired, or (B) whose unlawful status was known to the Government, before the date of the commission of the crime for which the alien is convicted." In contrast, Su told us, "illegal alien" has been commonly used to refer to immigrants simply present in the U.S. without a valid visa or legal status, or whose legal status expired or is terminated. More prevalent terms in federal law, Su said, include "inadmissible aliens" or "unauthorized aliens." Su wrote that "inadmissible aliens" and "deportable aliens" are different individuals under the INA, and have specific criteria, he said, with "inadmissible aliens" probably "closest to how the term ‘illegal aliens’ is commonly used (federal law treats those who enter without inspection to be construed as not having been ‘admitted’)," Su wrote. All this said, Su said, other government documents--including memos, directives and reports--use "illegal alien." The Supreme Court also has used the term, Su said. He singled out the court’s rulings in De Canas v. Bica, a case decided in 1976 about California governing the hiring of "illegal aliens." Su also noted Arizona v. U.S. in which the court in 2012 upheld parts of Arizona’s 2010 immigration law. That opinion employs "illegal alien" twice in quoting others and twice in speculation about how Arizona might enforce its law. To our inquiry about McCraw’s claim, Jeff Baker of the Pepperdine School of Law summed up: "The term ‘alien’ is common in the United States Code and in U.S. law, although the term ‘illegal alien’ is very rare in the statutes. In the Code, ‘alien’ typically means someone who is not a citizen, and, despite the current political uses and preferences (including my own), this is fairly common. I do not know when ‘alien’ entered the law with this usage," Baker wrote, but he noted that President John Adams "signed the very controversial Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798." Baker went on: "That was not the ‘Illegal Alien and Sedition Acts,’ however." Personally, Baker told us, he favors "other language in our national discourse. ‘Alien’ may be a technical term of art, but ‘illegal alien’ is almost always pejorative in contemporary usage." State laws Finally, we searched Texas laws and the state constitution on the Texas Legislature’s website and didn’t find "illegal alien" or "illegal aliens" though we saw multiple provisions specifying how laws apply to aliens. Our ruling McCraw told legislators the term "illegal alien" is "a legal term, it’s in statute, it’s a federal term." The term appears--yet scarcely--in federal law. Best we can tell, though, no law defines the term as referring to all individuals living in the U.S. without legal authorization. Where the term does appear, it’s undefined or part of an introductory title or limited to apply to certain individuals convicted of felonies. On balance, we rate McCraw’s claim Half True.

pomt-10641	"There are 7,000 kids in New Hampshire who have health care because I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/06/hillary-clinton/clinton-promoted-childrens-health-care/	In a sharp exchange with John Edwards during a Jan. 5, 2008, debate in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton made the case that she has a well-established record of fighting for change. She pointed to her role in starting the State Children's Health Insurance Program, called SCHIP. The program, created in 1997, promotes health coverage for children by providing federal funding to states. The states then put up their own money and set rules to provide care for uninsured children. "There are 7,000 kids in New Hampshire who have health care because I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program," Clinton said. Clinton's number is correct. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that in June 2006, there were 7,688 children enrolled in SCHIP in New Hampshire. Clinton is also on solid ground saying that she helped to create SCHIP. Much of the credit for SCHIP usually goes to Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., who shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. But the Clinton campaign has said previously that she used her influence behind the scenes to push for SCHIP, and there is evidence to support that. Soon after the legislation passed, the New York Times reported, "Participants in the campaign for the health bill both on and off Capitol Hill said the first lady had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up White House support." In a previous campaign ad, Clinton claimed credit for SCHIP without any qualifiers, and we found that contention Half True, given the other people who had a hand in passing the legislation. (See that ruling here .) But in this case, she accurately said she helped to create SCHIP (as in she wasn't the only one), and she got the number right on how many children are enrolled in New Hampshire. For these reasons, we rate Clinton's statement True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-01-06T00:00:00	2008-01-05	['None']
pomt-00172	Abigail Spanberger "wants a tax increase of $32 trillion - that’s with a `T,’ to pay for her socialist health care plan."	false	/virginia/statements/2018/oct/23/dave-brat/brat-misstates-spanbergers-stance-medicare-all/	U.S. Rep. Dave Brat keeps telling voters in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District that Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger wants a $32 trillion tax increase to pay for a "government takeover of health care." You don’t have to look hard to find his claims. "My opponent wants a tax increase of $32 trillion -- that's with a 'T' -- to pay for her socialist healthcare plan," Brat, a Republican, wrote in a Oct. 11 Facebook post. "She and Nancy Pelosi want to...double down for a $32 trillion socialized takeover, government takeover, of health care," he said during and Oct. 15 debate with Spanberger. "And we know Spanberger’s health care plan would bankrupt Medicare as we know it - a $32 trillion spending increase that would double our taxes," says a Brat TV ad that debuted on Sept. 17. "Spanberger’s healthcare piece costs $32 trillion and will require you doubling the personal income tax rate - your personal taxes doubled - and the corporate rates doubled," Brat said during an Aug. 20 radio interview on the John Frederick Show, Spanberger has repeatedly denied Brat’s charge. So we decided to test Brat’s claim - that Spanberger wants a $32 trillion tax increase to pay for an overhaul of health care - on the Truth-O-Meter. Brat’s Explanation Brat says his claim stems from a comment Spanberger made during a May 31 debate with Dan Ward, her opponent in this spring’s Democratic primary. The candidates were asked for their "feelings about single-payer healthcare," a system in which one entity - the government - is responsible for providing health insurance and paying claims. Brat notes that Spanberger, in reply, said, "...I do, in principle, support single payer…". Brat says those words prove Spanberger supports the Medicare for All Act of 2017, proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. The bill, which is languishing in the Senate Finance Committee, would create a Medicare program that covers all Americans under one plan. Employers would be barred from offering competing insurance. Sanders’ plan would cover primary care, hospital visits, lab services, medical devices, maternity care, prescriptions and vision and dental care. The only copayments would be for prescriptions. The Mercatus Center, a free-market oriented research group at George Mason University, estimated Sanders’ plan would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years. "A doubling of all currently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan," the study, published in July 2018, said. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has not published a cost analysis of Sanders’ plan. Brat has company among Republicans in claiming Spanberger endorsed Sanders’ plan. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a GOP super PAC aligned to Speaker Paul Ryan, has run a TV ad that accuses Spanberger of "supporting a $32 trillion government takeover of healthcare and raising middle-class taxes." Full picture Spanberger, in answering the debate question, only briefly addressed a single-payer system. She spent most of her energy calling for the passage of Medicare X, a health care proposal that would give people under 65 an option: They could remain privately insured, or buy into a new government-run program that would use the network of Medicare providers and costs. The Medicare system is now reserved for elderly and disabled citizens. Brat focuses on one clause in Spanberger’s answer. Here’s a fuller excerpt of her remarks. "I support Medicare X, which is a public option as a path towards universal coverage in the achievement of universal coverage. I believe that a public option is the way that we can achieve that goal through government-provided insurance that does, in fact, build off the existing Medicare network, because it exists in every single zip code across the country and that is the way we can achieve health care for everyone. And I do, in principle, support single-payer, but I believe universal coverage through a public option is the method I would pursue." Spanberger never mentioned Sanders. Nor was the senator referenced by the questioner or in the response by Ward - Spanberger’s primary opponent. This is important because Brat not only accuses Spanberger of championing a single-payer system, he links her to Sanders’ proposal and its costs.The Mercatus Center, a libertarian research organization affiliated with George Mason University, estimates Sanders’ plan would cost $32.6 trillion over 10 years and wouldn’t be paid for even if income and corporate taxes were doubled. Sanders’ plan is very generous. It would cover hospital visits, primary care, medical devices, lab services, maternity care, prescriptions as well as vision and dental care. It would not subject consumers to any out-of-pockets costs, except a copay on prescriptions. But if Congress wanted to, it could pass a single-payer system that would be cheaper than Sanders’ plan, albeit still costly. For example, some single-payer countries require copays for medical treatment, some have don’t cover dental and eye care, others don’t cover long-term care. In other words, it’s possible to support "in principle" a single payer system but be opposed to Sanders’ plan. Spanberger repeatedly has said she’s against Sanders’ bill and denounced Brat’s attack as "false." It’s a mystery what she meant when she said she supports single payer "in principle." We found no evidence of her making a similar statement. When we asked Justin Jones, spokesman for Spanberger’s campaign, to explain the remark, he said, "She hasn’t seen any single-payer plan she supports." He wouldn’t elaborate. Brat says Spanberger changed her position on Sanders’ bill after an Aug.3 editorial in the Richmond Times-Dispatch criticized its $32.6 trillion estimated cost and said the measure would lead to "socializing medicine." The editorial didn’t mention Spanberger. Final Note: Medicare X has not been subjected to a rigid cost analysis. Supporters say it would at least break even because the bill requires that premiums "cover the full actuarial cost of offering such a plan, including administrative costs." A 2013 CBO study concluded a similar program would reduce federal deficits by $158 billion over 10 years. Our Ruling Brat says Spanberger "wants a tax increase of $32 trillion - that’s with a `T,’to pay for her socialist health care plan." The charge - central to Brat’s campaign - stems from Spanberger’s May 2018 comment that she does "in principle, support" a single-payer health system. Brat offers that statement as proof that Spanberger backs a very generous single-payer proposal proposed by Sen. Sanders of Vermont in which all health insurance would come the federal government. Spanberger has caused some confusion because she’s never explained her remark. It is possible, however, to be receptive to a single-payer program that’s cheaper and more limited than Sanders’ plan. Brat offers no evidence that Spanberger has endorsed Sanders’ plan, and she says she opposes it. On the other hand, Spanberger has repeatedly backed a Medicare X proposal that would allow the government to compete with private insurers. Unlike Sanders’ plan, people would retain choices on where to buy coverage. Brat conveniently has chosen a position for Spanberger that she never took. We rate his statement False.

pomt-01247	110 people a day move to Austin.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/nov/14/lynda-rife/austin-consultant-says-110-people-moving-austin-to/	An Austin political consultant worried recently about the city handling more growth. Lynda Rife, campaign manager for a group that unsuccessfully sought voter approval of a rail-and-roads proposition, said afterward she hopes transportation issues can still be fixed. She told the Austin Monitor: "110 people will move here tomorrow, and the next day and the next day. I’m hoping that someone is thinking about some kind of solutions." We were curious whether 110 people a day move to Austin. That's a figure we've seen cited elsewhere, including in 2014 news stories in the Austin American-Statesman, which used it in terms of the estimated number of people moving to the Austin area, not the city of Austin alone. (Mostly recently, a Statesman news story posted online Nov. 1, 2014 said: "U.S. Census data shows an estimated 110 people a day are moving to Central Texas.") Rife told us by email that she came across the figure in a Feb. 14, 2014, Austin Business Journal news story quoting Ryan Robinson, the city of Austin demographer. That article reported that Robinson mentioned the statistic in a speech, saying it reflects "net arrivals per day," factoring in people who leave the city. "The state of our union is very, very good," Robinson was quoted as saying. A day later, KVUE-TV, Channel 24 in Austin, quoted Robinson saying that every day, 150 people move into the five-county Austin area and 40 residents move out, leaving 110 net migrants. And a March 2014 American-Statesman news story said bureau estimates indicated that since April 2010, net migration into Austin’s five-county metro area was 110 people a day, with an additional 30 per day added, the story said, because area births outpaced deaths.Of the 140 people added each day, the story said, 81 settled in Travis County. Along similar lines, Rife later told us she should have said 110 people are moving to the "area" rather than just "Austin." Origin of '110' uncertain To our queries, city officials didn’t elaborate on exactly how they reached the 110-a-day figure. We also queried Beverly Kerr, lead researcher with the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, who speculated the figure was based at one time on results of the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey. The 2013 bureau survey, Kerr said by email, suggests 139,096 residents moved into the Austin area over the previous year. That breaks out to 381 people a day moving to Travis, Williamson, Hays, Caldwell or Bastrop counties, which make up the government's definition of the metro area. On a longer timeline, Kerr said, another chamber researcher explored the bureau’s survey results for 2008 through 2012 and calculated that over those years, 308 people a day moved into the region while about 206 people a day moved out, leaving 102 net settlers a day. Census Bureau, state demographer We sought additional insight from the U.S. Census Bureau and a state expert. Robert Bernstein, a bureau spokesman, said by email that according to its estimates, Austin grew by 20,993 residents from July 2012 through June 2013. That breaks out to net growth in the city of nearly 58 residents a day, Bernstein advised. Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, said that per the bureau’s resident population estimates for April 2010 through June 2013, Austin’s population grew by about 63 people a day with migrants into the city accounting for 39 of the daily newbies, he said. By phone, Potter said the estimates -- based on sources including federal tax returns -- also roll in the effect of local births outpacing deaths. According to the bureau’s estimates, Potter said, an average of 141 people a day moved to the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area in the same period. Potter said these estimates further suggest the Austin-area counties netted 93 migrants a day -- a figure taking into account some residents leaving. Bernstein, asked if the bureau had more Austin-specific detail, replied that according to other agency estimates, nearly 236 people a day moved into Austin from elsewhere in Texas, other states or abroad in 2013. Notably, Bernstein said, this figure doesn’t include additional Austin residents due to births outpacing deaths. Another bureau official offered a different calculation for the latest survey year, forwarded to us by Bernstein, suggesting 80,619 people moved to Austin from within the U.S. -- an average 221 movers-in a day. Another 10,988 newcomers were estimated to have landed in Austin from other countries -- an average 30 a day. In contrast, 77,103 Austin residents left for another U.S. location, the bureau estimates, an average 211 a day. By movers in and movers out alone, the figures suggest, Austin’s population increased about 40 people a day. Our ruling Rife said 110 people move to Austin a day. We failed to pin the basis for this oft-aired figure, but it is in the ballpark with federal estimates of the number of people recently moving into the city's five-county region. But Austin alone? The latest estimates we found for the city -- the entity most affected by the road-and-rails package Rife was discussing when she declared her 110 -- signal that even more people move into the city each day. Yet that's counterbalanced by nearly as many people moving out -- leaving a balance of perhaps 40 to 60 settled newcomers a day. We rate the 110-a-day-to-Austin statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-10546	The DNC says McCain flip-flopped on whether the Iraq War would be easy.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/20/democratic-national-committee/cherry-picked-quotes-distort-mccains-comments/	A video released last week by the Democratic National Committee uses a series of public statements from John McCain in an attempt to suggest that he flip-flopped on whether the Iraq War would be easy. The video begins with an Aug. 2006 press conference in Columbus Ohio, aired on CNN, in which McCain states: "...It grieves me so much that we had not told the American people how tough and difficult this task would be. And it has contributed enormously to the frustration that Americans feel today because they were led to believe that this would be some kind of day at the beach." Then comes a clip of McCain from a Sept. 24, 2002 episode of Larry King Live on CNN: "And I believe that the success will be fairly easy." And this one: "I believe we can win an overwhelming victory in a very short period of time." That one comes from a CNN Late Edition appearance five days later on Sept. 29, 2002. A press release from the Democratic National Committee that accompanies the video states that "in the run up to the war, John McCain parroted the Bush administration's misleading rhetoric. Just like President Bush, McCain said the war would be easy and that we'd be greeted as liberators. Only in the throes of the presidential campaign did he try to have it both ways by complaining that the American people 'were led to believe this could be some kind of day at the beach.' John McCain never admits that, just like President Bush, he said victory would be easy." The DNC quotes aren't taken out of context, but they don't quite capture McCain's full point of view on the struggle in Iraq. McCain's campaign did not respond to PolitiFact, but as luck would have it, Tim Russert raised this very issue with McCain in a Jan. 10, 2007 interview on MSNBC. Russert: "Go back, Senator, to 2002 -- the administration saying we'd be greeted as liberators, John McCain saying that you thought success would be fairly easy." McCain: "Well, it was easy. It was easy. I said we -- a military operation would be easy. It was easy. We were greeted as liberators. Look at the films when we rolled into Baghdad. And then there was a period of time where we allowed looting, when the whole country literally evolved into chaos. I went over there. I saw what was happening. I came back, and I made a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations and said exactly, tragically, what was going to happen unless we got control of the situation. It was easy, by the way." Russert: "But certainly securing the peace and instilling a democracy in Iraq has been far more challenging --" McCain: "Absolutely. Just as I said it would be." Russert: "But not nearly as much as the administration had suggested to the American people?" McCain: "Well, the mistake and failure...it's well-documented of what happened. We went in there, we won an easy military victory. They did greet us as liberators. The recent testimony of Saddam Hussein's own words indicate what kind of brutality they were subjected to. And then all of a sudden the looting started, understandably. We didn't have control of Anbar province. We didn't have control -- eventually, there was a steady deterioration which led us to the terrible situation that we are in today. And all along, it was because we did not have the classic counterinsurgency strategy which is clear, hold and build. We cleared and would leave. As I've said in other hearings, we were playing a game of Whack-a-Mole." McCain has been a consistently strong supporter of the war. But at the same time, he has often been a critic of the way the war effort has been carried out by the Bush administration. As far back as mid 2003, shortly after the invasion of Iraq, McCain was warning that the United States needed to send more troops to Iraq and more money to Iraq reconstruction efforts, or else face a deep and long-lasting insurgency. (see Politifact "McCain Trying to Have it Both Ways on Iraq" and "One man sacrificed for his country…") Yes, McCain predicted it would be an easy war and that Americans would be greeted by the Iraqis as liberators. And yes, neither has proven true over the long run. But Hussein's regime was toppled relatively quickly and McCain advocated early on that the U.S. needed more troops and resources to prevent just such an entrenched insurgency as has come to pass. And so, in that context, we rate the DNC's comment just Half True.

pomt-02144	Roughly 500,000 Georgians -- or about 5 percent of the state’s residents -- have gone through a background check to legally obtain a Georgia weapons carry license.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/may/06/nathan-deal/deal-target-gun-permit-estimate/	Gov. Nathan Deal recently signed legislation that has been applauded by Second Amendment purists and blasted by gun control advocates for expanding where Georgians with permits may legally carry firearms to include churches, schools and bars. "This legislation will protect the constitutional rights of Georgians who have gone through a background check to legally obtain a Georgia weapons carry license. Roughly 500,000 Georgia citizens have a permit of this kind, which is approximately 5 percent of our population," Deal told reporters and bill supporters at a signing ceremony for House Bill 60. We wondered where the governor got his estimate and whether it’s correct. We decided to dig deeper. We first reached out to Brian Robinson, the governor’s spokesman, who pointed to lawmakers as the source of the information. "It’s a rough estimate, which is how we couched it," Robinson said. "The numbers are constantly in flux." We then contacted state Rep. Rick Jasperse, R-Jasper, the bill’s major legislative champion, who broadened our understanding of the complexities of this fact check. "We figure the number of licenses is about 750,000," Jasperse said in an email. The 500,000 figure is what is reported by Georgia’s 159 probate judges to the state Administrative Office of the Courts, Jasperse told us. But, he pointed out, that information has its shortcomings. Some probate judges fail to report the number of applicants consistently. Others don’t report them at all, he said. Georgians aren’t required to have a license, or permit, to keep a gun in their car, on their property or at their place of business with the business owner’s permission. With a permit, a person can carry a gun openly or concealed, except in restricted locations, such as a nuclear power plant or within 150 feet of a polling place. We found two counties that were identified as not reporting for 2012. We also confirmed that there is a state law on the books (O.C.G.A. § 15-5-24(3)) that requires each county’s probate court to report how many gun license applications it receives. We scratched our heads and asked: Has any probate court ever been punished for not complying with the law? Or is that even possible? "No on both accounts" was the response. Cobb County Probate Judge Kelli Wolk told us the judges only know how many people have applied for licenses, not how many have obtained them. "It is a small distinction. But some folks are denied as ineligible. Some -- very few -- don’t get fingerprinted after applying. Some are revoked after issued. Some folks move to Cobb with licenses from other counties, etc.," Wolk said in an email. She provided us data that show gun applications in Cobb have risen from 3,426 in 2006 to 11,462 in 2013. From Jan. 1 to April 15 of this year, 3,690 applications were made in the county. (Permits are good for five years, unless revoked, Wolk said. The $79.25 fee that is charged is divided four ways between the Georgia Crime Information Center and Sheriff’s Office for the background check, the statewide vendor and the local probate court, she said.) We found that the 500,000-plus number that’s bandied about was derived by adding up five years worth of applications filed statewide with the probate courts. (Actual number of applications was 535,826 for 2008 through 2012, according to our calculations). This clearly has some shortcomings. But the rationale, we were told, was that figure could at least be in the park since gun permits are good for five years. In 2012, the federal Government Accounting Office found the number of states allowing concealed carry permits was increasing, and the eligibility requirements and reciprocity agreements differed broadly, depending on the state. Seven states and the District of Columbia, as of June 2002, prohibited the concealed carry of handguns. By March 2012, individuals could carry concealed handguns everywhere but Illinois and the District of Columbia, the agency found. According to state reporting to the GAO, there were at least 8 million active permits to carry concealed handguns in the U.S. as of Dec. 31, 2011. This included about 600,000 in Georgia, which, at the time, had an estimated 6.9 million people 20 years or older. "That number (the 600,000 reported by the GAO) is pretty close to my ‘adjusted’ number, corrected for the missing probate court numbers," Jasperse said. Jerry Henry with the gun rights group GeorgiaCarry.org said he estimates about 750,000 Georgians are licensed gun carriers. But the reality is we couldn’t find anyone who has an actual permit count. And the new law, which takes effect July 1, prohibits anyone from keeping a database of permit holders. Dubbed by opponents as the "guns everywhere bill," the law allows firearms in churches, bars and government buildings under certain circumstances. It prohibits law enforcement officials from asking someone with a gun whether he or she has a license. It gives school systems the ability to decide whether teachers or other staff should be armed. The new law also repeals state law requiring firearms dealers to obtain state licenses and maintain records of firearm sales and purchases, and it revokes the governor's authority to suspend or limit the carrying or sale of guns in case of emergencies. Since its signing, some religious leaders -- including Catholic Archbishop Wilton Gregory of Atlanta -- have declared that guns won’t be permitted in their churches. Summary: There’s no firm data on how many gun permits are out there. Deal made clear that the number he quoted was a rough estimate of gun permits in Georgia. It falls in line with the lowest of the estimates out there. Deal’s statement is accurate but needs a bit of additional context to be fully understood. We rate the governor’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-10247	McCain "said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/28/barack-obama/mccain-has-a-mixed-record-on-fuel-economy-standard/	Even though gas prices are (finally!) dropping, voters are still focused on energy, and so is presidential candidate Barack Obama. In his acceptance speech, the Democratic nominee painted Republican opponent John McCain as an opponent of energy efficiency and alternatives to oil. "Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years, and by the way John McCain has been there for 26 of them," Obama said. "In that time, he has said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investment in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels." In a recent item, we examined a similar statement that Obama made earlier this month. We found that Obama was right in noting that McCain had voted against renewable fuel standards and that McCain had voted against tax breaks for producing electricity from wind. But we also pointed out that McCain hasn't been completely opposed to renewable energy. You can read our analysis here. This time, Obama adds a different claim — that McCain has said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars. Last year, Congress passed the first increase in fuel-efficiency standards in decades. McCain missed the final vote in December 2007 and missed other votes in June on the issue. In 2005 and in 2003, McCain voted against an amendment that would have increased fuel-economy standards on a set timetable. At the time of the 2005 vote, McCain declared himself a supporter of higher standards, but also said the amendment "does not appear to be achievable without significantly and detrimentally affecting our economy." The Obama campaign also points to McCain's vote against a 2002 energy bill that would have directed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to set new standards for Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE). But that was a watered-down version of a bill that would have increased the standards through legislation, instead of directing National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to do it. A month earlier, the Senate voted on a motion by Michigan Sen. Carl Levin (a friend of the auto industry) to strike the increase in standards and replace it with the weaker language. McCain was one of just six Republicans who voted no, along with a majority of Democrats. In fact, McCain and Democrat John Kerry were the driving forces behind the tougher language. "One of the stated objectives of this new energy policy is to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil," McCain said before the final vote on a bill that also had other provisions he objected to. "Regrettably, we missed a critical opportunity when the Senate rejected a proposal to increase fuel efficiency standards, which would have substantially decreased our nation's dependence on foreign oil and also reduced greenhouse gas emissions." But don't take it from us or John McCain. Here's what Massachusetts Democrat Ted Kennedy said on the Senate floor that day before voting no: "But I think this bill doesn't do enough to ensure that efficiency is a serious component of our energy policy. I commend Senators Kerry and McCain for their efforts on fuel economy standards, but I'm very disappointed in the vote on CAFE." Obama makes it sound as though McCain opposed raising fuel-economy standards for cars, and there are votes to support that claim. But in 2002, McCain not only wanted tougher standards than most of the Senate did, but he was lauded by a Democratic colleague. Obama gives a misleading picture of a senator who has been a notable advocate of higher fuel efficiency standards. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02506	Businesses "will be required to certify to the IRS – under penalty of perjury – that Obamacare was not a motivating factor" for cutting staff.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/13/chris-stirewalt/foxs-stirewalt-new-rules-force-firms-deny-obamacar/	The Obama administration’s latest step to delay implementation of the Affordable Care Act gives employers more time to offer health insurance to their workers. The so-called employer mandate was suppose to kick in this year. About six months ago that was pushed back to 2015. As of this week, medium-sized companies, those with 50 to 99 employees, will now have until 2016. The president’s critics responded quickly. "The White House seems to have a new exemption from its failed law for a different group every month," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. On Fox News, Chris Stirewalt speculated that a wrinkle in the newly announced rules was meant to silence companies that were just a little over the 99-worker mark -- and might be tempted to get under it. "Firms will be required to certify to the IRS – under penalty of perjury – that Obamacare was not a motivating factor in their staffing decisions," Stirewalt said. "To avoid Obamacare costs you must swear that you are not trying to avoid Obamacare costs. You can duck the law, but only if you promise not to say so." Stirewalt’s point was that this was designed to stifle public discussion about the health care law and jobs. That’s an uncheckable theory, but a reader on Facebook asked us if we could test the specific claim that firms must tell the IRS – under penalty of perjury – that they didn’t fire workers simply to avoid paying for their health insurance. The worker clause In the new rules released Feb. 12, a company qualifies for the year delay if it: Employed 50 to 99 full-time workers in 2014. Did not cut workers in order to get under the 99-worker bar. Cutting the workforce for bona fide business reasons is fine, including if sales dip or an employee isn’t up to snuff. Did not eliminate or "materially reduce" the health coverage it offered as of February 2014. If a company meets those conditions, it has to tell the government, formally, under the rules of something called Section 6056. Jennifer Kraft, a lawyer who tracks the Affordable Care Act at the Seyfarth Shaw law firm, said some firms might find themselves navigating the nuances of these requirements. "Employers would need to be mindful of whether there are other bona fide business reasons for making any workforce adjustments if they are trying to get the protection of this transition relief," Kraft said. So Stirewalt is partially correct to say that companies can’t simply fire workers to gain an extra year before they need to offer health insurance. That’s not quite as broad as Stirewalt put it "to avoid Obamacare costs" but the rule certainly is part of Obamacare. Plus, a firm has to meet three conditions, not just the one Stirewalt mentioned, and report that to the government. But the matter of the risk of perjury seems to rest on much shakier ground. We asked Fox News and lawyers who focus on ACA law if they could point to the law that spells out the penalties for failing to comply under Section 6056. We heard nothing from Fox News and the two lawyers were uncertain. Lisa Klinger, a benefits attorney with the Leavitt Group, a large insurance brokerage, guided us to an IRS proposed rule on 6056. A paragraph there said the reporting requirement would be "subject to the general reporting penalty provisions under sections 6721 (failure to file correct information returns), and 6722 (failure to furnish correct payee statement)." We’re just concerned with reporting to the government so we looked at the law for 6721. That law makes no mention of perjury. In fact, Klinger found it took a lighter approach. "It doesn’t look like it comes with huge penalties," Klinger said. The reality is that the IRS has yet to release the rule that lays out what will happen if a company tells the government it didn’t lay workers off because of Obamacare when in fact it did. In a press release, the agency said final regulations will be out shortly. Our ruling Stirewalt said that under penalty of perjury, companies will need to tell the government that any downsizing they underwent was not due to Obamacare. The reporting part is partly accurate. Employers can lay people off but they can’t do so just to get under the 99-worker mark and get an extra year before they need to offer health insurance. There seems to be no support for the element that perjury charges await the firm that falsely reports why it downsized. Those rules have yet to be released. The claim gets a key piece of information wrong. We rate it Half True.	None	Chris Stirewalt	None	None	None	2014-02-13T14:48:00	2014-02-11	['None']

pomt-00937	Says President Barack Obama said "that American exceptionalism is no more exceptional than the exceptionalism of any other country."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/23/rudy-giuliani/rudy-giuliani-barack-obama-said-american-exception/	Okay, so maybe President Barack Obama does love America, Rudy Giuliani reluctantly admitted in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. But the former New York City mayor qualified the concession with another knock on Obama: He doesn’t think America is better than everyone else. "To say, as the president has, that American exceptionalism is no more exceptional than the exceptionalism of any other country in the world, does not suggest a becoming and endearing modesty, but rather a stark lack of moral clarity," Giuliani wrote Feb. 23. Giuliani penned the op-ed to defuse criticism that erupted last week after he told a crowd, "I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president loves America." Already, Giuliani tried to cover his tracks by claiming Obama doesn’t say "what an exceptional country we are" (which was painstakingly debunked by the Washington Post Fact Checker). But does his new explanation hold up? We decided to take a look. Giuliani didn’t respond to our request for more information. But it’s pretty clear from his comments and other recent remarks that he’s talking about a press conference from the early days of Obama’s presidency. (Yes, this controversy over whether Obama supports the idea of "American exceptionalism" is now six years old.) While at an April 2009 NATO summit in France, a reporter from the London-based Financial Times asked Obama "whether you subscribe, as many of your predecessors have, to the school of American exceptionalism that sees America as uniquely qualified to lead the world, or do you have a slightly different philosophy?" Obama gave a nuanced answer that affirmed his belief in American exceptionalism and that "America has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world towards peace and prosperity." Obama also added, "I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism." Admitting citizens of other countries believe that their countries are exceptional is not the same thing as saying all countries are equally exceptional, as Giuliani surmised. To put it in terms a New Yorker like Giuliani might understand: A Yankees fan who admits a Red Sox fan loves his team is not saying the Red Sox are as good as the Yankees. Obama went on to point out — on European soil no less — that America essentially saved Europe during and after World War II, and noted that the United States is "the largest economy in the world," has "unmatched military capacity," and possesses "a core set of values that are enshrined in our constitution ... that, though imperfect, are exceptional." Here’s Obama’s full response: I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism. I'm enormously proud of my country and its role and history in the world. If you think about the site of this summit and what it means, I don't think America should be embarrassed to see evidence of the sacrifices of our troops, the enormous amount of resources that were put into Europe postwar, and our leadership in crafting an Alliance that ultimately led to the unification of Europe. We should take great pride in that. And if you think of our current situation, the United States remains the largest economy in the world. We have unmatched military capability. And I think that we have a core set of values that are enshrined in our Constitution, in our body of law, in our democratic practices, in our belief in free speech and equality, that, though imperfect, are exceptional. Now, the fact that I am very proud of my country and I think that we've got a whole lot to offer the world does not lessen my interest in recognizing the value and wonderful qualities of other countries, or recognizing that we're not always going to be right, or that other people may have good ideas, or that in order for us to work collectively, all parties have to compromise and that includes us. And so I see no contradiction between believing that America has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world towards peace and prosperity and recognizing that that leadership is incumbent, depends on, our ability to create partnerships, because we create partnerships because we can't solve these problems alone. Our ruling Giuliani claimed that Obama said "that American exceptionalism is no more exceptional than the exceptionalism of any other country." In a response in which he repeatedly praised American exceptionalism and what it has offered the world, Obama also said, "I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism." That is a pretty obvious and benign statement, and it’s hardly the same as Obama putting his opinion of American exceptionalism on the same level as Greek exceptionalism, as his full remarks show. We rate Giuliani’s claim False.	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2015-02-23T17:15:45	2015-02-23	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-06591	Says Rick Perry is "spending more money than the state takes in, covering his deficits with record borrowing."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/sep/25/keep-conservatives-united/pro-bachmann-group-says-rick-perry-spending-more-m/	A group backing U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota for president says Gov. Rick Perry leads a state in fiscal dire straits. In an advertisement targeting South Carolina voters, the narrator says: "This year, Rick Perry is spending more money than the state takes in, covering his deficits with record borrowing." Talk about news; is Texas state government in the red? Some perspective: Texas is a "pay-as-you-go" state that, unlike the federal government, cannot borrow money to balance its operating budget. About 45 states have constitutional provisions requiring their budgets to balance, as we noted in a December 2010 fact check. The Texas Constitution says that barring a four-fifths vote of the Legislature, lawmakers may not spend more than the cash and projected revenue that the state comptroller certifies as available for appropriation. This June, State Comptroller Susan Combs certified the state would have sufficient revenue to fund the 2012-13 state budget that lawmakers sent to Perry, the Austin American-Statesman then reported. Perry signed the budget into law that month. So how is Texas in the hole? The Keep Conservatives United super PAC traces its ad claim to an Aug. 23, 2011, Wall Street Journal news article which says the state’s sale that day of $9.8 billion in tax-exempt general obligation tax and revenue anticipation notes, set to mature Aug. 30, 2012, was the largest sale of short-term notes since the state started selling short-term notes in 1987. "Such notes typically mature within one year," the story says, "and are generally issued by states at the start of their fiscal years to raise cash ahead of incoming tax and revenue receivables for that year." The story quotes the Texas state comptroller's office saying the notes mainly would be used to support payments to public schools at the beginning of the school year, but also to avoid a temporary cash shortfall in unrestricted accounts in the state's general-revenue fund and so the state could manage its cash flow spending through the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2012. According to the story, the comptroller projected a maximum temporary cash shortfall of $13.2 billion within fiscal 2012 without the note proceeds and other available borrowing. The state said it expects to start fiscal 2012 with a $1.8 billion negative cash balance in the general revenue fund's unrestricted accounts, and to end the 2012 fiscal year with a negative cash balance of $6.7 billion. Indeed, those figures are in the comptroller’s offering document describing its intended sale of the notes. But there’s more information, too, indicating the state won’t be in the hole once all funds are taken into account. The offering document says the notes "currently projects that the maximum temporary cash shortfall within fiscal year 2012 will be $13.2 billion before application of note proceeds and other available interfund and intrafund borrowing." And, the document says, while the Legislature approved a balanced budget, the state "expects to begin fiscal year 2012 on Sept. 1, 2011, with a negative cash balance in the unrestricted accounts in the General Revenue Fund of $1.8 billion. The General Revenue Fund is expected to end fiscal year 2012 with a negative cash balance of $6.7 billion in the unrestricted accounts." Later, the document says the state’s general revenue kitty has "historically been subject to a temporary cash shortfall during each fiscal year because taxes and other revenues are received more slowly than expenditures are paid through the first eight months of the fiscal year." Hence, the document says, the need for the short-term notes. So, the state made a record sale of short-term notes and predicted a cash shortfall during the fiscal year, which ends Aug. 31, 2012. Is that the same as running a budget deficit? We asked Combs, Billy Hamilton, the state’s former deputy comptroller, and Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, for their views. Combs’ spokesman R.J. DeSilva replied by email that annual sales of Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes aren’t designed to cover deficits. Instead, he said, they help the state maintain cash-flow. Looking ahead, he said, if there’s insufficient revenue to fulfill state obligations at the end of this fiscal year, the gap will be handled in the next year’s sale of notes. Hamilton told us it’s been state practice since the late 1980s to sell the short-term notes to smooth out payments — such as those to school districts — over months that state tax revenue isn’t accumulating fast enough to immediately cover expenses. Craymer, previously a budget adviser to two governors, said by email that the pro-Bachmann group’s claim, based on the comptroller's projection of revenues and spending for the year ending Aug. 31, 2012, overlooks the reality that Texas legislators approve two-year budgets — and the latest budget balances through August 2013. August 2012, then, is the "mid-point of our budget, not the end point," Craymer said. "It's kind of like criticizing someone who gets paid at the end of each month because they spend more than they take in during the first half of the month." Craymer added that the tax-anticipation notes sold by the state are "commonly used by states and other government entities to cover spending and revenue timing gaps within the budget. They are short-term notes paid off before the end of each fiscal year, and cannot be used to finance any deficit (in Texas or any other state)." Craymer said in an interview: "Washington has real debt. The states have to balance their budgets. There’s no logical connection between short-term cash borrowing and a (budget) defict. That’s a stretch." Our ruling is that while the state undertook record short-term borrowing, the state is not in the red by any stretch of that characterization. The two-year budget adopted by lawmakers and signed into law by Perry was required to balance--and there’s no indication that it no longer does. The ad’s statement--casting the sale of short-term notes as covering Perry’s deficits--misrepresents a routine annual sale. This is worse than incorrect. It’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-03600	Says "Did you know that if you accepted the District's proposal today you would have NO pay increase for 4 years? Seven years of frozen wages = Disrespect."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2013/may/11/portland-association-teachers/would-portland-teachers-have-no-pay-increase-four-/	Oregon’s largest school district and its teachers are bargaining over a new contract, with the expiration of its current contract at the end of June. Portland Public Schools is offering a four-year contract with no cost-of-living adjustments. Portland Association of Teachers would like a two-year contract with COLA increases of about 3.5 percent each year. The claim: The union had some tart words for the school district’s offer: "Did you know that if you accepted the District's proposal today, you would have NO pay increase for 4 YEARS? 7 years of frozen wages = Disrespect," reads the April 25, 2013 bargaining brief newsletter for members. The analysis: PolitiFact Oregon can’t weigh in on whether this amounts to disrespect by the district, but we can fact check whether the district’s proposal amounts to four years of "no pay increase" and seven years of frozen wages for teachers. In fact, Robb Cowie, spokesman for Portland Schools, urged us to do so. Teachers at Portland Public are on a multi-step salary schedule, with starting salary based on education. For example, the 2012-13 schedule calls for a salary of $35,886 for a teacher with a bachelor’s degree. From there, the teacher moves up a "step" every year to reach a top pay of $54,020 in the 13th year -- although chances are good that by then, that dollar amount will be higher. (Teachers at the upper end would start at $48,837 and in the 13th year, start making an annual salary of $73,101.) The yearly step increases aren’t anything to sneeze at. Those raises are about 3.4 percent every year. The across-the-board cost-of-living adjustments are what bump up the salaries contained in the steps from one year to the next. Otherwise the starting salary for that first-year teacher with a bachelor’s degree -- or the teacher with a master’s degree -- may never change. Again, here’s an example. The last time teachers received an across-the-board raise was in the 2010-11 school year; all the "steps" increased 2 percent. So a teacher with a master’s degree who might have moved from $41,955 in the 2009-10 school year to $43,383 in 2010-11 would instead earn $44,251 starting July 2010. About 51 percent of Portland teachers are at the top step, meaning that their salaries stay the same unless the district gives cost-of-living raises or adds another step to the top. It is true that teachers who have topped out would have no pay increase for four years under the district’s offer. But 49 percent of teachers would continue to see pay go up, because they move automatically up the steps. The actual percentage of teachers who reach the top may fluctuate, of course, but not that wildly, according to historic data. PolitiFact Oregon couldn’t track down Marty Pavlik, a consultant with the Portland Association of Teachers, who in earlier interviews defended teachers as real people with escalating bills to pay. Instead, we spoke with Gwen Sullivan, union president. She said the newsletter is intended for members, who know exactly what is meant by "no pay increase." That means no cost-of-living adjustments, she said, and teachers should be compensated for experience as well as inflation. That may be so. But a step increase of 3.4 percent is undeniably a pay increase, for the teachers who qualify. Let’s turn to the second part of the statement, that teachers will have had seven years of frozen wages under the district’s offer. As we’ve said, the last time teachers received a COLA increase was in July 2010, right when this seven-year time period begins. We find that to be selective cherry picking of a time period by the union. The statement also ignores the fact that teachers at the top received an additional step in this school year, which amounted to a 2 percent pay raise. It’s true that teachers agreed to delay step raises by half a year in order to shore up this current budget. But still, even the district’s most veteran teachers will have seen a raise within the seven-year period, despite assertions by the union. The ruling: Hey, what’s the saying? All’s fair in love and in labor negotiations? PolitiFact Oregon says make the most impassioned pitch for your side when bargaining. But this statement by the Portland teachers union is missing some key facts. At best the union’s assertion that teachers would have had "NO pay increase for 4 YEARS" is Half True, as it applies to half of the teaching body. Its second assertion of seven years of frozen wages is False. Which gets us to Mostly False. We’ll explain this another way. There’s a bit of truth in the assertion -- some teachers will have no pay increase for four years if this offer is accepted. But the statement ignores step raises, a 2 percent across-the-board raise in 2010, and the addition of a top step this school year -- also known in PolitiFact lingo as critical facts that would give a different impression. We rule the statement Mostly False.	None	Portland Association of Teachers	None	None	None	2013-05-11T03:00:00	2013-04-25	['None']
pomt-11575	"Consumer confidence, business confidence, and manufacturing confidence are the highest they have been in many decades."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/02/donald-trump/how-high-are-economic-confidence-polls-under-donal/	On a number of occasions, President Donald Trump has touted the degree of confidence Americans have in the economy on his watch. He did so in his State of the Union address, when he said, "Small business confidence is at an all-time high." We rated that True. But during a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he offered a broader sweep. "After years of stagnation, the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth," Trump said on Jan. 26. "The stock market is smashing one record after another, and has added more than $7 trillion in new wealth since my election. Consumer confidence, business confidence, and manufacturing confidence are the highest they have been in many decades." We looked at confidence measurements for each of those three areas to see if Trump has a point. Some of the measurements were suggested to us by the White House; others we found ourselves. Overall, we found that confidence is high, but there are times in recent history when it’s been higher. Consumer confidence There are two major, monthly surveys that measure consumer confidence — one by the Conference Board and one by the University of Michigan. Both show levels of consumer confidence that are high by historical standards, but they are not "the highest they have been in many decades." Currently, the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index is at 122.1. That’s higher than it ever was under President Barack Obama or President George W. Bush. However, it was higher between May 1997 and December 2000, the final three and a half years of President Bill Clinton’s presidency. Calling 17 years ago "many decades" ago is an exaggeration. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The University of Michigan data shows a similar pattern. In the most recent month for which there is data, November 2017, the rating was 98.5. The last time the rating exceeded that level was a one-time blip in January 2004. Prior to that, the index exceeded today’s level for almost four years under Clinton, from February 1997 to November 2000. (It fell below today’s level for one month during that period, October 1998.) See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Business confidence The survey data of business confidence generally provides weaker evidence for Trump’s assertion. There are several major surveys of CEO confidence. One by the Conference Board was at 63 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The index under Obama equaled or exceeded that on five occasions. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com A different survey, by the Business Roundtable, had the CEO economic outlook index at 96.8 in the fourth quarter of 2017. But the index was higher in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first two quarters of 2011. Another group, the Institute for Supply Management, surveys purchasing executives at some 300 companies on a monthly basis. The number for December was 59.7. The most recent time the index was that high was (briefly) in 2011, under Obama. Finally, YPO is an organization of 24,000 CEOs that publishes studies of business confidence around the world. The index exceeded the most recent rate under Trump nine times during Obama’s presidency. Here is the data for its survey of the United States since 2009: See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Manufacturing confidence This is the topic where Trump has the strongest argument. The current National Association of Manufacturers’ Outlook Survey is currently at its highest level since it was created in 1997. See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said, "Consumer confidence, business confidence, and manufacturing confidence are the highest they have been in many decades." In general, all three types of economic confidence are at relatively high levels today. However, it’s a stretch to say that they are "the highest they have been in many decades." Consumer confidence exceeded today’s level less than 20 years ago, and in several surveys, business confidence exceeded today’s level as recently as the Obama years. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-04245	Three thousand felons voted in Rhode Island in 2008.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/nov/18/carolyn-medeiros/leader-alliance-safe-communities-says-3000-felons-/	Usually after an election, the biggest arguments are over who won or lost. But on WHJJ’s "The Helen Glover Show" last week, the big beef was over who was allowed to vote. Glover’s guest was Carolyn Medeiros, executive director of the Alliance for Safe Communities, an organization that, among other things, monitors criminal justice issues and acts as an advocate for victims of crimes, that "they all be vindicated rather than further victimized." In a segment billed as the "Outrage of the Week," Medeiros cited the fact that 3,001 felons on probation or parole had been allowed to vote in Rhode Island during the 2008 election, and she said that a larger but unknown number had probably voted in this month’s election. "Our question is, are politicians going to pander to this new voter base," she asked. Whether allowing felons to vote is an "outrage" is a matter of opinion, not a question for the Truth-O-Meter. But we decided to check whether Medeiros’ number is accurate. We put in a call to Medeiros. While we awaited a response, we went to the Alliance’s website, where we found a blurb about the "outrage," with a link to the website of OpenDoors, a Rhode Island nonprofit organization that provides job training and other services to help released inmates from the Adult Correctional Institutions adapt to living outside prison. The OpenDoors website describes the group’s efforts to help released inmates become voters, and includes this passage: "The 2008 election cycle was [the] first in which RI felons on probation/parole could vote since [the] 19th century. Of 17,606 probationers and parolees re-enfranchised since 2006: *6,330 registered to vote in time for the general election on November 4, 2008; *3,001 voted in one or more of the three statewide elections in 2008." So Medeiros accurately cited the OpenDoors number. But where did the number come from? First, a little background. In 2006, OpenDoors -- then known as the Family Life Center -- was one of a number of organizations that pushed for a referendum to change the state Constitution to make it easier for convicted felons to become eligible to vote. Under state law at the time, felons couldn’t register to vote until they had finished not only their prison terms but any probation or parole as well. The referendum question asked voters to amend the Constitution to allow felons to register to vote after their release from incarceration, regardless of how long they might be on probation or parole. Supporters said that would help released inmates feel more connected to the law-abiding community and help reduce the odds of them committing new crimes. Opponents argued that those who committed serious crimes had to earn the right to vote by completing their whole sentence, including probation or parole. The probation issue was particularly relevant in Rhode Island because the state tends to resort to probation more often than imprisonment. A 2007 Pew Center on the States study found that Rhode Island’s imprisonment rate of 1 out of every 187 residents ranked 46th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. But Rhode Island’s probation rate of 1 out of 31 residents was in the top five nationally. Voters approved the change, 51.5 percent to 48.5 percent. It affected only the right to vote; felons still have to serve out their full sentences of probation or parole if they want to run for public office. After the vote, OpenDoors worked with the Department of Corrections and the secretary of state’s office to help released felons register and kept track of the results, yielding the numbers cited on its website. OpenDoors Executive Director Sol Rodriguez said the organization only has numbers for the 2008 election. Medeiros ultimately called us back and confirmed that OpenDoors was the source for her number. Our ruling Medeiros said 3,001 felons voted in Rhode Island in 2008. She accurately cited a number compiled by OpenDoors, which helps released inmates register and kept track of how many voted in 2008. We find her statement True. Note: In the beginning of her talk-show appearance, Medeiros said there were "17,606 re-enfranchised voters … that have begun voting since the 2008 election," mixing the numbers of felons eligible to register to vote with those who actually voted. But as she worked through her presentation, she cited the correct number. (To suggest a statement for fact-checking, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-00411	As Tennessee governor, Phil Bredesen "supported higher taxes on us. Higher gas taxes. Higher sales taxes."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/30/americans-prosperity/attack-ad-falsely-says-bredesen-backed-gassales-ta/	In the battle for the U.S. Senate, the Koch family-backed Americans for Prosperity launched a $2 million ad campaign against Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen. The group's ad targets Bredesen’s time as governor from 2003 to 2011. Bredesen will face Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn on the November ballot. The ad opens with a shot of a woman, child in her arms, shopping for groceries. Here’s the text: "When times are tough, we budget for our families. But when our state’s budget was in crisis, Phil Bredesen supported higher taxes on us. Higher gas taxes. Higher sales taxes." The ad ends with a claim about wasteful spending on rebuilding the governor’s mansion. For this fact-check, we wanted to review the data for gas taxes and sales taxes to see if they went up on Bredesen’s watch. Key takeaways While the ad suggests that gas and sales taxes rose, they remained the same through Bredesen’s years in office. At times, Bredesen suggested the gas tax might need to go up. The sales tax on food fell from 6 percent to 5.5 percent, but taxes on cigarettes and cell phone plans rose. Bredesen proposed eliminating the cap on a separate tax on big-ticket items such as jewelry and business equipment, but the Legislature rejected it. Gas tax held steady Tennessee’s Department of Transportation has a handy table of gas and fuel taxes going back to 1923. It shows no change in the gas tax between 1990 and 2017. It stayed at 21.4 cents/gallon through all the time Bredesen was governor. (The base rate was 20 cents with 1.4 cents in special fees tacked on.) Americans for Prosperity spokeswoman Gabrielle Braud noted that at various times, in 2003, 2006 and 2007, Bredesen said the gas tax might need to rise a few cents to secure federal highway matching funds and keep pace with rising costs. That is accurate, but Bredesen didn’t press the point. There is no evidence that he advocated for a hike. And as the recession was building in 2008, Bredesen told reporters that a gas tax increase was off the table, saying it would be a "terrible time" to ask people to pay more in taxes. Sales tax did not change As with the gas tax, the state sales tax held steady. The Tennessee Department of Revenue told us "the general state sales tax rate of 7 percent did not change between 2003 to 2011." According to the Tax Foundation, a group that tracks state and federal revenues, the rate went from 6 percent to 7 percent right before Bredesen took office and didn’t change on his watch. The Economic Research Service at the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed those numbers. Since the ad opens with a mother at a supermarket, we looked into any hike in taxes on food. The tax on groceries actually went down when Bredesen was governor. Bredesen and lawmakers agreed to trim that levy by half a percentage point from 6 percent to 5.5 percent in 2007. The Presbyterian Church was one of the groups that supported the change and said that it was "the first-ever reduction of the state’s high food tax." Bredesen made it a point to avoid raising the sales tax but he was quite open to other ways to boost revenues, especially as the state struggled through the recession. The year the sales tax on groceries went down, the cigarette tax went up, with most of the money targeted to education. The Tax Foundation’s analysis of the tobacco tax hike found that it fell most heavily on lower income households. In 2010, he, along with the Legislature, raised the fee for a driver’s license from $19.50 for five years to $46 for eight years, and increased the tax on cable and telecommunication services. Tennessee has a special sales tax on big ticket items such as cars and boats. An additional 2.75 percent charge is tacked on for each dollar between $1,600 and up to $3,200, at which point the tax stops. Braud noted that in 2010 Bredesen wanted to lift the upper limit. He did, but not across the board. His proposal left cars, boats and homes alone. Bredesen argued that the tax would fall mainly on businesses, not households. Lawmakers rejected the plan. Our ruling Americans for Prosperity said that Bredesen supported higher gas and sales taxes. Neither tax changed on his watch. Both the gas and state sales tax remained the same throughout his time as governor. Food taxes went down and cigarette taxes went up. While he piecemealed additional revenues here and there, he opposed raising the broad-base sales tax. The ad uses the word "support" in the broadest fashion possible to mislead Tennesseans about their experiences under Bredesen. We rate this claim False.

pomt-04675	Providence has "amongst the highest tax rate(s) in the entire country."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/07/anthony-gemma/providence-taxes-are-among-highest-country/	In a radio debate last week, Anthony Gemma, who is challenging U.S. Rep. David Cicilline in the 1st Congressional District Democratic primary, continued hacking away at the track record of the former Providence mayor. Cicilline served two terms as mayor until voters elected him to Congress in 2010. Gemma has repeatedly criticized Cicilline’s erroneous assessment of city finances as "excellent" prior to leaving office, and during the debate at WPRO-AM 630 charged that the consequences of Cicilline’s leadership reverberate today. "The City of Providence is in absolute shambles right now," said Gemma. "The roads are bad. The taxes are amongst the highest tax rate in the entire country." While Gemma cited the tax rate -- a figure that can be misleading -- we assumed from the context he was talking about the tax burden -- how much residents and businesses would have to pay. We asked Gemma’s campaign for his backup. In an e-mail, a Gemma campaign spokesman provided a link to a 2010 report by the nonpartisan Minnesota Taxpayers Association and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit think-tank. Their report compared, among other things, the commercial property tax rate of the largest city in each of the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, and the two next largest cities in Illinois and New York. Of the 53 cities, Providence ranked the second highest for commercial property taxes, behind only Detroit. The spokesman, Alex Morash, also pointed us to one of our own PolitiFact items from this past February when we checked a claim by Governor Chafee that Providence had, indeed, the second highest commercial property tax in the country. In that item (we ruled it Mostly True), we not only referred to the Minnesota Taxpayers Association study, but also to a report done by the Tax Foundation, a business-backed policy group based in Washington, D.C., that does state-by-state tax comparisons. They had prepared a draft report that compared the tax burdens a hypothetical corporation would face if setting up shop in about 100 U.S. cities. (The study looked at two cities in most states but only one city in small states such as Rhode Island.) In that study Providence would have the third-highest commercial property taxes for a corporate headquarters, behind Des Moines and Columbia, S.C. But what about residential property taxes? How would Providence rate against other cities? We e-mailed Richard Morrison, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation, and asked whether he knew of any studies that compared the residential property tax rate of U.S. cities. The closest the foundation had, said Morrison, was a county comparison, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2010 American Community Survey. Using that census information and the foundation’s property tax data web tool, Providence County -- of which the city of Providence is the largest -- had the 98th highest property taxes out of 806 counties ranked by the census bureau. Over five years, Providence County ranked 122nd out of 2,773 counties. Still we kept looking for a city by city comparison. The closest we came was a 2007 analysis by the census bureau’s American Community Survey, which offered a chart comparing the residential property tax rates for the largest city in each state. At 100-percent valuation, Providence ranked sixth in the nation with a tax rate then of $22.84 per thousand. (It is now $31.89, second only in Rhode Island to Scituate’s $32.73) Two communities within the top five (Bridgeport, Conn., and Philadelphia) were ranked as having higher property taxes but their rates were set at less than 100 percent valuation, which could have skewed Providence’s ranking. Our ruling 1st District Democratic congressional candidate Anthony Gemma said during a radio debate last week that Providence’s taxes are "amongst" the highest in the country. The word "amongst" by definition implies a generality, and the apparent lack of any specific city by city studies make comparing Providence’s tax rates difficult. Still, several studies indicate that there is a high tax cost associated with living and doing business in Providence. They all generally support Gemma’s claim but none of them is exactly on point. Therefore because the statement would need "additional information" for further verification, we rate it Mostly True (Get updates from PolitiFact Rhode Island on Twitter: @politifactri.

pomt-08569	On charging a toll for motorists to use Ga. 400 after it was slated to expire	full flop	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/28/georgia-state-road-and-tollway-authority/road-authority-reverses-course-ga-400-toll/	The grinding traffic and NASCAR-like driving habits of Atlanta-area motorists are enough to infuriate any motorist who uses the toll road Ga. 400. Some drivers, though, were comforted by the thought they wouldn't have to pay the 50-cent toll much longer. That changed Friday when the State Road and Tollway Authority voted to extend the toll to 2020. The toll was set to expire in 2011, when the bonds used to fund construction of the road extension are to be paid off. The authority's board has discussed briefly suspending the toll shortly after the bonds are paid off and then reinstating it. Some critics say temporarily suspending the toll is a sly attempt to avoid criticism that the authority reneged on an agreement to permanently stop collecting it. So did the authority flip-flop? Kennesaw State University political science professor Kerwin Swint said of the plan: "This is a political act to avoid being accused of going back on their word." Let's look at how the authority got to this point. Atlanta and state leaders began seriously looking in the late 1980s at a proposal aimed at improving traffic from the city's northern suburbs to downtown. The proposal was to create a 6.2-mile extension of Ga. 400 from the suburbs to I-85. Commuters would pay a 50-cent toll each way. Some neighborhood groups in Atlanta's Buckhead community strongly opposed the project. Robb Pitts, then an Atlanta city councilman, said he came up with a compromise that was included in Section 1(f) of a July 5, 1989, letter from the Georgia Department of Transportation to then-Mayor Andrew Young. "That all tolls shall be discontinued upon full payment of all bonds which are issued to finance construction of the Georgia 400 Extension and the Buckhead Loop," the stipulation read. "The Georgia Department of Transportation agrees to this stipulation." Pitts, now a Fulton County commissioner, said the Ga. 400 extension would not have passed if not for that agreement. The authority estimates nearly 120,000 people use the extension every day. State officials estimate they'll collect nearly $21 million from the toll in the 12-month period that began July 1. Now, let's get in the fast lane and move to September 2010. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution learned some state leaders were considering plans to continue the toll, although the bonds for the extension construction were scheduled to be paid off in 2011. The authority came up with a wish list of road projects it would like to implement if it had more money from sources such as, say, a Ga. 400 toll. The list includes connector ramps at the interchange at I-85 in Buckhead and widening the road between McFarland Road and Ga. 20. Pitts came to Friday's meeting but said he wasn't allowed to speak. The Fulton commissioner said he talked with Gov. Sonny Perdue, chairman of the authority board, and told him that extending the toll could hurt support for a 2012 voter referendum on a regional transportation funding plan that was passed by state leaders this year after years of debate. "If [the voters] can't trust you on [ending the toll], how can we trust you in 2012?" Pitts said he asked Perdue. Pitts suggested the authority stop the toll during a 30-day public comment period the authority allows to hear from state residents about items it has approved. The authority would look into stopping the toll at some point next year and charging motorists again as a "new" toll. When asked how long would the suspension be, the governor replied "brief," said AJC transportation reporter Ariel Hart, who covered the meeting. How brief? Perdue said he didn't know and then seemingly half-jokingly added "hours." Pitts said he supports the improvements on I-85. "It's not my preference, but it's a fallback position," Pitts said. "You may get more support for [extending the toll]." Atlanta City Councilman H. Lamar Willis has criticized the extension of the toll. If the toll must be continued, he would prefer using at least some of the money collected to fund regional transportation. Willis' proposal stems from the longtime lament among some leaders from Atlanta and DeKalb and Fulton counties that they contribute money from a 1 percent sales tax on most goods to help pay for MARTA but other counties do not, although some of their residents use the rail and bus system. Willis, a member of the council's transportation committee, calls extending the toll a "flip-flop." "We should never go back on a promise we made to our citizenry," the councilman said. Our Flip-o-Meter defines a Full Flop as "a complete change in position." This vote, we believe, falls into this category. This is a Full Flop if ever there was one.

pomt-12886	"About 30 percent of terrorists at Guantanamo Bay went back into battle. We know that a dozen or so killed Americans."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/jan/25/cory-gardner/how-many-released-guantanamo-bay-prisoners-commit-/	Republicans who agree with Donald Trump’s promise to keep Guantánamo Bay open have argued that too many released prisoners have committed new acts of terrorism. U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., said that Trump should put the worst offenders around the globe in the prison and provide transparency about the activities of released prisoners. "We know that about 30 percent of terrorists at Guantanamo Bay went back into battle," said Gardner, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Fox News Jan. 23. "We know that a dozen or so killed Americans. These are not good people. I hope the American people understand that. This is a facility that holds the worst of the worst offenders and now down to just a handful of people that can't be released because they are so dangerous." Gardner makes the numbers sound much more concrete than they actually are; it’s not clear that all of these prisoners ultimately turned back to terrorism. But there is some evidence that Americans have died when fighting against groups that include released prisoners. Former President Barack Obama reduced the prisoner population at Gitmo but fell short of his promise to close the prison. Trump promised to keep Gitmo open and "load it up with bad dudes." Estimates include unconfirmed reports At least every six months, the Director of National Intelligence, an appointee of the president, publishes a Congress-mandated report detailing the number of former Guantanamo detainees who have re-engaged in terrorist or insurgent activity. The most recent report, which was published in September, showed re-engagement of prisoners through July 15, 2016. The report included information on 693 prisoners released since the prison opened in 2002. The government reported that 17.6 percent -- 122 individuals -- had been "confirmed of re-engaging" and 12.4 percent -- 86 individuals -- "suspected of re-engaging" in terrorism. To get to Gardner’s claim of 30 percent requires adding those confirmed and suspected of re-engaging in terrorism. A spokesman for Gardner cited a June 2016 article in the Washington Post for both portions of his claim. The article notes that the 30 percent figure includes both categories. Gardner did not mention Obama while talking about Gitmo. However, it’s worth noting that about 90 percent who re-engaged or were suspected of doing so were released before Obama took office when George W. Bush was president. It was while Obama was president that the percent of released detainees who re-entered the battlefield became a Republican talking point. The two-page report provides no details about how it arrived at the figures beyond some basic definitions. The report explains that the government labels those as "suspected of re-engaging" if the information is plausible but unverified or from only a single source. A 2012 House Armed Services Committee report included some examples of released detainees who committed new terrorist acts, such as Abdallah Saleh Ali al-Ajmi who was released in 2005 and conducted a suicide bombing in Iraq in 2008. The federal government stopped releasing the names of those who re-engaged in 2009 to protect intelligence sources and methods, according to the report. "While this makes sense, it has hindered the public’s understanding of the topic and made it difficult to confirm DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) assessments in some instances," states the report. Some experts including DePaul University counterrorism professor Thomas Mockaitis have raised questions about the veracity of the numbers. "I do have concerns over the use of such figures without explanation or context," he said. "Many of those released are handed over to foreign states who assume responsibility for them. Tracking their activities after they leave Guantanamo can be problematic." Almost 10 years ago, the Director of National Intelligence, the Pentagon and other stakeholders tightened the criteria under which a released detainee was classified as "confirmed" or "suspected," said Cully Stimson, who was involved in that process and served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs during Bush's administration. He says the criteria are valid. "That said, there is no way to know of the actual number of recidivists because one cannot know what one does not know until one knows it," said Stimson, who is now an expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Said another way, the intelligence community won’t know if a Gitmo transferee went back to combatant activity unless and until there is some level of proof of that recidivism, sufficient to satisfy either the ‘suspected’ or ‘confirmed’ level." In June 2014, the New America Foundation, a centrist think tank, compiled its own numbers of released former detainees, using Pentagon reports, news stories and other public information. At the time there were 620 released prisoners, and the foundation found that 54 of them "are either confirmed to be or suspected of engaging in militant activities against either the U.S. or non-U.S. targets." That was about one-third of the government’s figure of 184 at the time. The foundation has not updated the report since that time. A Post report documents American deaths This part of Gardner’s claim stems from a Washington Post article that stated that the Obama administration believed that at least 12 released detainees launched attacks at U.S. or allied forces in Afghanistan, killing about a half-dozen Americans. That information came from government officials including Paul Lewis, who oversaw Guantánamo issues at the Defense Department, and told lawmakers in March that former Guantánamo inmates were responsible for the deaths of Americans overseas. The other officials were quoted by the Post anonymously. One official told the Post that: "Because many of these incidents were large-scale firefights in a war zone, we cannot always distinguish whether Americans were killed by the former detainees or by others in the same fight." Nine of the released detainees suspected to have launched new terrorist attacks were dead or in foreign government custody and all of them were released during Bush’s administration, the Post reported. The other news reports we found about the 12 released detainees rehashed the Post story. Our ruling Gardner said, "about 30 percent of terrorists at Guantanamo Bay went back into battle. We know that a dozen or so killed Americans." Gardner omits that to get to the 30 percent figure requires adding those the Director of National Intelligence says were confirmed of re-engaging and those only suspected of re-engaging. Also, the federal government provides no details in its report about how it arrives at the figures or the identity of the detainees that went back into battle. Gardner is on more solid ground that "a dozen or so killed Americans." That stems from a 2015 Washington Post article based on interviews with government officials. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b77967e-d73c-4573-b7e9-679e628289c3	None	Cory Gardner	None	None	None	2017-01-25T17:47:53	2017-01-23	['United_States']

pomt-04946	Says U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy is among seven "Tea Party freshmen" who "spent an average of $15,000 on cars for themselves."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/27/scott-keyes/gop-wisconsin-us-rep-sean-duffy-spent-tax-money/	The website of a left-leaning Washington, D.C., think tank broke some news on July 16, 2012, with an article headlined: "Seven Tea Party freshmen spent more than $100,000 in taxpayer money on personal cars." The word that has the most mileage with voters: personal. U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., the former prosecutor and onetime reality TV show star, was cited among the seven who "spent an average of $15,000 on cars for themselves." Has Duffy been taking taxpayers for a ride? The article Reporter Scott Keyes of ThinkProgress.org, a website of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, wrote the article. It attracted coverage from WisPolitics.com, and was criticized by the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and by former state lawmaker Pat Kreitlow, Duffy’s Democratic opponent in the November 2012 election. PolitiFact Wisconsin once before evaluated an article by Keyes, in September 2011, when we rated as Mostly False his intriguing claim that the Green Bay Packers "are a socialist organization." Keyes’ cars article said statements of disbursements from the U.S. House of Representatives show Duffy has spent $24,525 on a "car" since taking office in January 2011. That’s about $56 less than U.S. Rep. Chip Cravaack, R-Minn., the top spender among the seven congressmen singled out in the article. The article says Cravaack is leasing for more than $1,000 a month a 2011 Chevy Equinox, a small SUV crossover, but doesn’t say what Duffy has. So, Keyes’ article cites congressional records in claiming that Duffy spent more than $24,000 in tax dollars on a car for personal use, but provides absolutely no evidence of what type of vehicle Duffy has or whether it’s for himself. Reaction Duffy spokesman John Gentzel said Duffy did, as the article says, spend $24,525 -- but that’s for an 18-month lease of a 2001 Chevy Champion bus that is utilized as a mobile office. Gentzel said the converted five-seat bus is used only by staff to provide constituent services around the 7th Congressional District in northwestern Wisconsin, which he said is the largest in Wisconsin and the second-largest east of the Mississippi River. It includes Wausau and points south, goes west to Eau Claire and runs northwest almost to Duluth, Minn. Only four staffers have been authorized and insured to drive the bus, and Duffy has never driven it, Gentzel said. Indeed, he rarely rides in it, Gentzel said. The vehicle has made 230 stops in all 20 of the district’s counties since it was put into service in July 2011, and makes visits on a posted schedule. "It’d be a flat-out lie to suggest or imply (Duffy) has ever driven it or used it as a personal vehicle," he said. So, Keyes is way off when he wrote that Duffy leased a car for personal use. When we went back to Keyes, he said Duffy’s office hadn’t replied to a request for comment before his article was published. After it was published, Keyes attached to the article a Duffy news release refuting what the article said about Duffy. Keyes also told us in an email: "I take Duffy at his word on the matter and wish his staff had been more forthright on the matter initially. The larger point of hypocrisy remains, though. If he's going to use budget deficits to justify taking food stamps away from poor people, he should at a minimum be willing to lead by example in eschewing his own office expenses (like many of his GOP colleagues who represent much larger districts have done)." Our rating Keyes accused Duffy of using tax money for a car for personal use, saying he is among seven "Tea Party freshmen" who "spent an average of $15,000 on cars for themselves." But Duffy leases a bus that is used as a "mobile office," not a car for himself. That makes the claim about Duffy false and ridiculous and leaves Keyes at this destination: Pants on Fire.

pomt-12821	"Spending more taxpayer money on VISIT FL (or less) has not demonstrated a direct impact on tourism."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/feb/09/richard-corcoran/florida-house-speaker-says-funding-visit-florida-d/	Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran is throwing sand on the state’s primary tourism agency, one of Gov. Rick Scott’s most prized possessions. Year after year, Scott has called on the Legislature to boost Visit Florida’s budget to bring in more tourists, and this year was no different. Scott asked for $76 million in 2017-18 fiscal year. Corcoran is driving legislation to kill both Visit Florida and Enterprise Florida, which oversees state business incentive programs. Corcoran says the state's investment is a waste of money. "Spending more taxpayer money on VISIT FL (or less) has not demonstrated a direct impact on tourism," Corcoran tweeted Feb. 6. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com His tweet was accompanied by an infographic comparing the number of Florida visitors with the amount of funding given to Visit Florida. The various stats relay one message: More money to Visit Florida doesn’t equal more visitors. On the surface, Corcoran’s numbers seem to support the crux of his claim. But tourism experts cautioned they don’t tell the whole story. They said the amount of money that tourists spend, and how long they choose to stay, is more important than the sheer number of visitors. Not all tourists are created equal. Measuring the success of marketing tourism is complicated Corcoran’s push to eliminate Visit Florida comes after a fair share of negative publicity the past year. In December 2016, Visit Florida CEO Will Seccombe resigned amid political backlash after the agency paid Miami rapper Pitbull $1 million to promote Florida, which included a video promo dubbed "Sexy Beaches." This secret terms of the deal led Scott to ask the agency to create new policies that increase transparency. To prove his point that tourism dollars don't have a direct effect on more tourists, Corcoran’s team sent data that included three measurements from 2000 to 2015: the annual number of Florida visitors, the amount of funding to Visit Florida, and the amount of money spent by Visit Florida per visitor. (The infographic only highlighted the first two measurements.) Based on Corcoran's numbers, between 2011 to 2015, Visit Florida funding increased from $34 million to $74 million, or a roughly 112 percent change increase. In that same time, the number of visitors only showed a approximately 22 percent change increase. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Corcoran’s numbers seem to support his argument that increased spending historically didn't always lead to a tourist bump. But experts said annual counts aren't the only metric used to determine the success of a marketing investment. They also look at how much money tourists invest themselves. "A primary marketing strategy is to get tourists to stay longer in a destination thereby spending more money," said Kathleen Andereck, a professor at the College of Public Service and Community Solutions at Arizona State University. David Preece, the academic director for the Center for Hospitality & Tourism at Brigham Young University-Hawaii, said the better way to see a return on investment in marketing tourism is to look at how much visitors spend and the resulting tax revenues, rather than the number of visitors. "After all, you can’t deposit visitors in the bank, but you sure can deposit the money they leave behind," Preece said. Preece pointed to Visit Florida’s strategic plan to generate $100 billion in annual visitor spending by 2020. That number was $71.8 in 2012-13, $76.1 billion in 2013-14, $82 billion in 2014-15, and $89.1 billion in 2015-16. That plan shows a trend of roughly an additional 7.5 percent spending per year which, if held, would reach $100 billion in the next couple of years, he said. Other factors can affect annual tourism arrivals and spending, too, making it further difficult to draw broad conclusions about tourism spending alone. Experts said these include hurricanes and other natural disasters, terrorism and crime, the political environment, gas prices, and the cost of flights. International visitors pack bigger wallets Youcheng Wang, an associate dean at the Rosen College of Hospitality Management at University of Central Florida, knows firsthand why boosting Florida’s image can be so important, especially in international markets. Wang once attended an annual tourism meeting with China and the United States in Orlando. Wang said that before the marketing and tourism delegation from China arrived, they received a brochure highlighting popular tourist destinations. "When I looked at the brochure my jaw nearly dropped," Wang said. "In that brochure Orlando was described as small fishing village with 20,000 people." Wang tells that anecdote as just one of the many reasons marketing tourism is important, especially in the lucrative international scene, where Visit Florida has made investments. The agency spent $1.2 million to advertise with the Fulham Football Club, a British soccer team (that isn't in England's famous Premier League). Part of the deal includes placing Visit Florida logos on the team’s jerseys and on the stadium’s roof, which is near London Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest in the world. Seccombe argued before leaving Visit Florida that targeting visitors from the United Kingdom was worth the effort. "So everybody that flies into one of the busiest airports in the world sees 'Visit Florida' outside the window along with Buckingham Palace and Big Ben," Seccombe told the Tampa Bay Times. In 2015, the number of United Kingdom tourists that visited Florida reached 1.7 million. On top of that, British tourists outspent visitors from every other country except Canada by spending around $1.5 billion on their visits. They also stay in the state 13.3 days on average compared with 4.9 of a U.S. traveler. Our ruling Corcoran said spending money on Visit Florida doesn’t have a direct impact on the tourism. He has an historical point that spending increases don't always bring more visitors, but that neglects a primary objective of marketing tourism — getting people to spend more money when they’re here. The amount of money visitors spend in Florida has increased steadily over the years. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

pomt-11524	Says Michelle Obama said Florida shooting "is clearly our president’s fault."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/16/usdeplorablesnewscom/fake-news-says-michelle-obama-blamed-donald-trump-/	Facebook users flagged a suspicious post on a site called American President Donald J. Trump. The headline read, "Michelle Obama: ‘Florida shooting is clearly Trump’s fault, these shootings are happening constantly since he became our president." The news brief said Obama made those comments "in Chicago amid the Obama Foundation worldwide event." But this story is a hoax. The Obama Foundation has not held an event since 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 14. A search of the Nexis news database finds that former first lady Michelle Obama did not make those remarks at another event, or in any format whatsoever. An identical article showed up on three websites — Usdeplorablesnews.com, DailynewsforAmericans.com and Uberconservative.com. None should be trusted. In the aftermath of the Florida shooting, Michelle Obama retweeted the comments made by her husband, Barack Obama. He wrote: "We are grieving with Parkland. But we are not powerless. Caring for our kids is our first job. And until we can honestly say that we're doing enough to keep them safe from harm, including long overdue, common-sense gun safety laws that most Americans want, then we have to change."

pomt-01243	The State Department says the 42,000 jobs created by the Keystone XL pipeline are "ongoing, enduring jobs."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/16/russ-girling/transcanada-ceo-says-42000-keystone-xl-pipeline-jo/	With the U.S. Senate poised to vote Tuesday on authorizing construction of the long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline, the Sunday news shows drilled down on what the divisive project means for Americans. On ABC’s This Week, host Martha Raddatz quizzed the leader of the company that wants to build the pipeline, TransCanada CEO Russ Girling, about the project’s job creation potential. Girling cited TransCanada’s estimates for 9,000 total positions, and Raddatz countered with estimates from the U.S. State Department, which is tasked with a recommendation on the project to President Barack Obama because it crosses international borders. "There are others who say the jobs will not be so great, going as low as 4,000 jobs, and that the jobs will only be here for a couple of years," Raddatz said. "The State Department, you mentioned the State Department, says that once the proposed project enters service, operations will require approximately 50 total employees in the U.S." Girling conceded that actual operating jobs top out at 50, but he said "that doesn’t include all of the other jobs that come with it." Referring to the same State Department report that Raddatz mentioned, Girling highlighted its finding for the project’s support of 42,000 "direct and indirect" jobs. "For about two years," Raddatz cut in. "No," Girling said, "the 42,000 jobs is in ongoing, enduring jobs." Girling made it sound like the State Department’s estimate pertained to permanent -- or at least long-term -- jobs with his description of them as "ongoing, enduring." But that is an inaccurate way to evaluate these job creation estimates. The State Department’s January 2014 report, which evaluated the project’s environmental and economic impact for the country, concluded, "A total of 42,100 jobs throughout the United States would be supported by construction of the proposed Project." These jobs are measured on an "average annual" basis, meaning one position filled for one year. This total reflects both jobs created directly as a result of construction and manufacturing for the pipeline, as well as spinoff jobs supported by construction workers who purchase materials for the project or spend their wages in the economy. According to the State Department, construction would require around 10,400 seasonal workers for stretches that would last either four or eight months. This works out to 3,900 "average annual" jobs over one year of construction, or 1,950 jobs each year if the project takes two years to finish. The State Department estimates that 26,100 indirect and induced jobs "would be supported by construction of the proposed project" during the construction phase. The jobs would be in providing the supply chain to Keystone as well as employee spending on lodging, food, entertainment, health care, etc. Importantly, as Raddatz said, these jobs would only be supported during the construction phase, which is expected to take one to two years. After construction, the pipeline would employ about 50 people, primarily for maintenance. A TransCanada spokesman told us that Girling "crossed himself" as he described the project’s benefits for the economy, and that the 42,000 jobs are just during the two-year construction period. "The point here is many seem to denigrate construction jobs as not meaning much since they are simply ‘part time,’ " said spokesman James Millar, highlighting the thousands of workers TransCanada paid to build the Keystone pipeline’s base in 2010 and southern leg that opened in January 2014. "This is the way the profession works." "This is one of the largest infrastructure projects on the books in the U.S. right now, it is a $8 billion project so to say it will not benefit American workers and the U.S. economy is ridiculous," Millar said. Our ruling Girling shrugged off Raddatz’s point that an estimated 42,000 jobs supported by the Keystone XL pipeline would only last for two years, saying "no, the 42,000 jobs is in ongoing, enduring jobs." That description does not apply to 99 percent of the direct, indirect and induced jobs supported by the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project, which are temporary and would not last for more than two years. A spokesman for Girling acknowledged this fact. We rate his statement False.	None	Russ Girling	None	None	None	2014-11-16T13:19:16	2014-11-16	['United_States_Department_of_State']

pomt-06626	Says New Jersey is "losing 50 football fields of open space to development every day and the more we develop upstream the more flooding we have downstream."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/19/new-jersey-sierra-club/new-jersey-sierra-club-claims-new-jersey-loses-50-/	A single football field is not an unusual sight, but try to imagine 50 of them being overrun with development -- every day. That’s what the New Jersey Sierra Club says is happening daily in the Garden State. In a press release posted on its website Sept. 6, the environmental group tossed out that statistic when discussing the effects of development on flooding. "We are losing 50 football fields of open space to development every day and the more we develop upstream the more flooding we have downstream," according to the press release. "We need to not only limit development but we need to (make) development with less pavement and impervious cover." PolitiFact New Jersey found that football may be alive and well, but developers in New Jersey aren’t seeing as much playing time as they used to. The environmental group is right that development increases the risk of flooding, but construction activity has declined nationwide. First, let’s explain how "50 football fields" translates into acres, and where the Sierra Club received that figure. New Jersey Sierra Club Director Jeff Tittel argued that the group’s statistic doesn’t count the two end zones. However, the National Football League identifies the "field" as including both end zones. Based on the league’s measurements, a football field represents about 1.32 acres. Tittel also told us the statistic was based on research done by Rutgers University’s Grant F. Walton Center for Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis. The latest data on open space loss available from that center comes from a July 2010 report detailing land-use changes in New Jersey through 2007. According to that report, an average of 16,061 new acres were developed in 2007, or about 44 acres per day. That level of development equates to about 33 football fields of development per day. So, based on that data, the Sierra Club’s estimate is off by 17 football fields, or about one-third. But here’s the larger mistake made by the Sierra Club: that estimate of 33 football fields refers to development as of four years ago. "You can’t compare ‘07 to today," said Dominick Paragano, president of the New Jersey Builders Association. "It’s a different economy." Updated statewide growth figures will be available later this fall, but data already shows a sizable decrease in development in Ocean County between 2007 and 2010, said Rutgers University professor Richard G. Lathrop, one of the authors of that land-use report. Ocean County was one of the faster-growing counties as of 2007. Two other data sets also demonstrate the downturn in development activity in New Jersey: the number of housing units authorized by building permits, and the number of construction jobs, according to federal and state statistics. Many developers aren’t even focused on the sprawl-like development targeted by the Sierra Club. More builders are looking at redevelopment opportunities in urban areas, said Kevin Tartaglione, senior vice president and chief operating officer of the development division at Somerset County-based Advance Realty. Tittel argued that residential development may be down, but commercial development, highway-widening projects and infrastructure development are still under way. But with fewer development options available to landowners, the Somerset County-based New Jersey Conservation Foundation has been able to preserve more land in recent years, according to executive director Michele Byers. Whereas the New Jersey Conservation Foundation completed between 15 and 20 transactions annually in the early part of the decade, it completed about 40 in 2009 and then roughly 50 in 2010, she said. But Byers said the point behind the Sierra Club’s statement is still legitimate, because the potential for development in New Jersey remains. "We are really working hard to ramp up as much preservation as we can before we lose the opportunity," Byers said. On the Sierra Club’s second point about flooding, the group is right. Two professors confirmed to us that development heightens the risk of flooding, because there are fewer areas to absorb the water. "So that water has to go someplace," said Tulane University associate professor Stephen Nelson, who teaches a course on natural disasters. Our ruling The Sierra Club claimed "50 football fields" are developed in New Jersey every day, increasing the danger of flooding. Flooding can be a side effect of development, but the group’s statistic doesn’t reflect the steep decline in construction activity during the past four years. Tittel argues his organization is using the most recent data available, but that still doesn’t make it right. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

abbc-00123	The dual citizenship crisis continues to haunt the Parliament into 2018.	in-the-green	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-16/fact-check-is-labors-susan-lamb-a-uk-citizen/9416516	Mr Pyne's claim about Ms Lamb's citizenship status is a good call. Ms Lamb's own legal advice confirms that she obtained British citizenship by descent at birth. She applied to renounce her British citizenship before nominations for the 2016 election closed, but she did not enclose any evidence of her British citizenship with her application, as is required by the UK Home Office (and explained in its guidance notes). After the election, she provided some documents, but her application was still rejected. On publicly available information, she has not sought a review of the Home Office decision or made a new renunciation application. There is no evidence that the British Secretary of State has registered a declaration of her renunciation, which the Australian High Court has described as "the moment at which British citizenship is lost". Whether or not in the circumstances her continuing status as an Australian and British dual citizen means she is ineligible to remain in Parliament is a matter for the High Court to decide.

pomt-14406	"The Walton family of Walmart ... This one family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/mar/14/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-walmart-heirs-are-wealthier-bo/	U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders starts with the nation’s richest family when describing the magnitude of wealth inequality in the United States. "Today in America one family, the Walton family of Walmart. You all heard of Walmart. This one family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people," Sanders, I-Vt., said recently in Norfolk during a rally for his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. PolitiFact has looked at similar claims in the past from Sanders and other liberals, but the last time was in 2013. Since the statement has become a standard line in Sanders’ campaign speech, we decided to give it a new examination. The claim originates from research by Sylvia Allegretto, an economist at the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at the University of California-Berkeley. She last updated her research in 2014. Allegretto tallied the total wealth held by the six relatives of Walmart founder Sam Walton: his sons Jim and Robert Walton; daughter Alice Walton; daughter-in-law Christy Walton; and his nieces, Ann Walton Kroenke and Nancy Walton Laurie. Using figures from the Forbes list of the 400 richest Americans in 2013, Allegretto totaled the wealth of those six Waltons at $145 billion. Next, she turned to a survey of the net worth of Americans published every three years by the Federal Reserve. The most recent one was published in 2014 based on survey results from the previous year. The combined worth of the Walton clan in 2013, Allegretto said, "equaled the total wealth of the entire bottom 43 percent." We should point out that this is not a measure of "income" - the amount of money families earn every year. Instead, wealth is the bottom-line figure of a household’s "net worth." As our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin pointed out in their 2013 fact-check, net worth is the amount left over after accounting for things such as savings and retirement accounts minus what’s owed on home mortgages, credit card bills and other debts. That means it’s entirely possible for someone earning a six-digit salary to be in the "bottom 40 percent," because all their debts still could leave them with zero or even negative net worth. Tim Worstall, a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute free-market think tank in London, has been critical of comparing the Walton wealth to people of modest net worth. Worstall noted in a 2011 op-ed in Forbes that many high earners easily could fall into the category of zero or negative net worth, such as doctors still paying off loans from attending medical school. "If you’ve no debts and have $10 in your pocket, you have more wealth than 25% of Americans. More than that 25% of Americans have collectively that is," Worstall wrote. Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal Washington think tank, looked at the figure another way in a 2014 post. Noting that the Federal Reserve placed the median U.S. family wealth the previous year at $81,200, he wrote that it would take 1.7 million families with that amount of net worth to equal the wealth of the Waltons, he said. The Walton wealth has not been static since 2013. Forbes this year published figures showing the family’s wealth has declined to $121.9 billion -- a drop of $23.1 billion. Forbes explained it lowered the net worth held by Christy Walton after new information surfaced showing that her late husband, John - Sam Walton’s son - left some of his fortune to charity. We wondered whether that reduced $121.9 billion figure still would leave the Waltons’ wealth equal to about 40 percent of U.S. families. Allegretto was unavailable to run a new set computations for us. So we turned to the Urban Institute, a Washington non-profit specializing in economic social research. Its numbers show that Sanders’ claim remains correct based on the latest national wealth figures from 2013. Our ruling Sanders said the Walton family "owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people." The latest comparable figures, from 2013, support his claim. We rate it True.

pomt-03101	Wendy Davis is "the most popular politician in Texas."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/sep/23/jason-stanford/contradictory-poll-heart-democrats-claim-about-for/	Texas Sen. Wendy Davis "has a rare opportunity to start her first statewide campaign as the most popular politician in Texas," wrote Democratic political consultant Jason Stanford in a Sept. 16, 2013, opinion column. That day’s "Two Views" feature in the Austin American-Statesman’s opinion section featured Stanford and Republican counterpart Matt Mackowiak weighing in on Davis’ chances if she runs for governor. The Fort Worth Democrat gained global fame for her 11-hour filibuster June 25, 2013, that helped briefly derail GOP-sponsored restrictions on abortions. Mackowiak opined that Texas won’t be blue enough in 2014 to elect a Democrat. But how red can the state be if Davis is tops in popularity, as Stanford asserted? By phone, Stanford told us he was relying on his memory of Davis’ favorability rating in poll results released July 2, 2013, by Public Policy Polling. The Democratic-leaning North Carolina firm said in a press release that in its survey conducted June 28-July 1, 2013 -- days after the filibuster -- Davis was "now the best-liked figure the firm tested statewide, and the third-best-known after (Gov.) Rick Perry and (U.S. Sen.) Ted Cruz," both Republican. "But her standing in a hypothetical matchup with Perry has slipped in the last five months, mainly due to Perry’s own improvement," the release said, and survey data suggested that Davis also would have lost in a one-on-one gubernatorial face-off with Attorney General Greg Abbott, then a likely GOP candidate. Abbott announced his bid for governor after Perry said July 8 that he would not run again. Davis isn’t officially in the race; she has said she’ll announce "what’s next" for her Oct. 3. The survey was carried out via automated phone calls to 500 registered Texas voters, with an overall margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percent. Although only six politicians were compared in that release, other Public Policy releases show the firm tested 10 politicians’ favorability in the June-July survey: five Democrats (President Barack Obama, Davis, former Houston mayor and 2010 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White, San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro and Houston Mayor Annise Parker) and five Republicans (U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, Cruz, Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and Abbott). With all 10 politicians considered, Davis dropped to fifth "best-known" -- behind Obama, Perry, Cruz and Cornyn. Public Policy spokesman Dustin Ingalls told us by phone that with Cornyn’s recognition only one percentage point above Davis’, it would be fair to say Davis was tied for third "best-known" among Texas figures. Davis still had the highest favorability margin, which Public Policy measured by asking, "Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Wendy Davis?" Ingalls said his firm subtracted the percentage of "unfavorable" responses from the "favorable" ones to calculate a margin. Davis’ margin was 10, because 39 percent of respondents replied "favorable" and 29 percent replied "unfavorable." For comparison, Obama’s margin was -14 (41 percent favorable minus 55 percent unfavorable) and Perry’s was -5 (45 percent favorable to 50 percent unfavorable). As those percentages indicate, fewer respondents ventured an opinion on Davis than on Perry. That’s how Public Policy measured name recognition in this survey, Ingalls said -- totaling the favorable and unfavorable opinions. So Obama was "best known" because 96 percent of respondents had an opinion about him, as might be expected for a U.S. president partway through his second term. Similarly, 95 percent of respondents had a viewpoint on Perry, who’s been governor since 2000. For both Cornyn and Davis, about a third of respondents had no opinion or said they were unsure; Public Policy rated their name recognition at 69 percent and 68 percent, respectively, though Cornyn has represented Texas in the U.S. Senate since 2003 and Davis was elected to the state Senate in 2008. Those figures suggested to us another way to view the poll results: looking at the raw number of people who had positive or negative views on the politicians. For example, with 500 respondents in the poll, Davis’ 39 percent positive reviews should equal about 195 Texans with a favorable opinion of her. Viewed this way, Perry comes out tops, with 45 percent "favorable" answers equating to 225 people; Cruz next, with 42 percent positive results representing 210 people; Obama with 41 percent, about 205 people; then Davis’ 195. Ingalls said his firm uses percentages and margins to describe favorability because raw-number counts are affected by how well-known the politicians are and margins factor in how many people dislike the politicians, not just how many people like them. Austin Democratic pollster Jeff Smith, whose opinion we sought via email, noted that although Public Policy described the poll results as measuring Perry’s favorability, they actually asked respondents to rate Perry’s "job performance," not Perry himself. Also, Smith and others we consulted were skeptical about using the poll to determine who’s "most popular" in Texas. Austin pollster Mike Baselice, who has counseled Perry and numerous Republican candidates, told us by email, "Polls are like balance sheets. They measure opinions at a given point in time." Along the same lines, Stanford’s colleague Mackowiak told us by email he thought the poll was "virtually worthless" because it was taken "at the height of the filibuster drama." Smith said, "The only way to fact-check this statement is to look at other recent polls." Anything before the filibuster "is irrelevant," he cautioned. Stanford agreed: "Using the polls from before the filibuster is as accurate as measuring my height when I was a child." We found no other post-filibuster surveys checking Davis’ popularity. Two conducted earlier in 2013 showed, unsurprisingly, a lower statewide profile for her. A Public Policy survey conducted Jan. 24-27, 2013, sampling registered Texas voters and Texas GOP primary voters, ranked Davis’ popularity margin ninth among 11 politicians and her "name recognition" 10th out of 11. Parker was 11th in recognition; by favorability margin, Obama tied Davis for ninth and Perry was 11th. A University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll conducted May 30-June 9, 2013, asked 1,200 registered Texas voters whether they had "a very favorable, somewhat favorable, neither favorable nor unfavorable, somewhat unfavorable, or very unfavorable opinion of" Cruz, Cornyn, Dewhurst, Perry, Abbott, Republican House speaker Rep. Joe Straus, Davis and Castro. Here, pre-filibuster Davis got 77 percent neutral answers ("don’t know/no opinion" and "neither favorable nor unfavorable"), more than any other politician. Among respondents who did offer an opinion of her, 11 percent were positive ("very" and "somewhat" favorable) and 12 percent were negative ("very" and "somewhat" unfavorable). Perry had the most positive responses (41 percent), but also the most negative responses (42 percent). Cruz was next with 40 percent positive and 31 percent negative responses. Using such totals to approximate the way Public Policy calculated favorability margins, we found Abbott and Cruz had the highest (9) and Perry tied with Davis in the bottom half of the pack (-1). Bits of anecdotal evidence were intriguing. For example, the Texas Tribune reported in an Aug. 28, 2013, news story that Davis "saw her followers on Twitter rise from 1,200" before the filibuster "to more than 140,000 today." Without trying to separate Texas followers from U.S. or worldwide followers -- Does Davis have more "likes" in London? Do other red-state tweeters follow Abbott? -- we aren’t sure what the heck social stats show about politicians’ popularity in Texas, but we gathered a few just to see what they were. Davis’ Twitter and Facebook stats look high at first glance, but she has only one account on each platform. Abbott, Cornyn, Cruz and Perry have campaign and official accounts on both; that means their followers could be spread out and also means there is likely some degree of overlap. Social media connections: Facebook likes and Twitter followers As of mid-September 2013 Personal and/or campaign Twitter Official Twitter Personal and/or campaign Facebook Official Facebook Abbott 22,943 5,794 172,481 3,151 Cornyn 441 campaign 49,090 59,314 29,936 Cruz 123,281 126,115 218,575 115,021 Davis 143,088 No account 282,251 No account Perry 199,257 personal 28,154 campaign 31,732 220,109 12,999 Sources: @GregAbbott_TX, @TXAGsOffice, facebook.com/TexansForAbbott, facebook.com/TexasAttorneyGeneral, @TeamCornyn, @JohnCornyn, facebook.com/tedcruzpage, facebook.com/SenatorTedCruz, @WendyDavisTexas, facebook.com/WendyDavisTexas, @GovernorPerry, @TeamRickPerry, @TexGov, facebook.com/GovernorPerry, facebook.com/TexasGovernor Two conclusions are clear: Perry’s personal Twitter account has nearly 200,000 followers to Davis’ 143,000 on her campaign Twitter feed. And on either Facebook or Twitter, Davis’s single account has more followers than Abbott’s and Cornyn’s campaign and official accounts combined. If viewed separately, Cruz’s accounts don’t outweigh Davis’ accounts, but add together his campaign and official Facebook likes or Twitter followers and he would outpace Davis. Without knowing how much the Cruz accounts overlap, the safest assumption is that Davis lately trumps some of her colleagues on social media, but not all of them. Another unscientific measure: As of Sept. 16, 2013, Cruz was leading Davis in the Dallas Morning News’ online poll asking readers which one newspaper’s editors should choose as "Texan of the Year" for 2013 (the choices were Cruz, Davis and "Other"). Cruz had more than 11,000 votes, Davis nearly 9,000. The next-biggest personality: A small sliver of voters wrote in "Johnny Football." Stanford said, "Is she the best-known politician in Texas? No. Is she the best-liked, as defined by her popularity relative to her unpopularity? Yes, according to this poll." Our ruling Stanford said Davis is "the most popular politician in Texas." Based on a single summer 2013 survey taken shortly after the senator’s star-making filibuster, a polling firm called her "best-liked" of 10 politicians in Texas. But the poll’s results also suggested she would lose to Perry and Abbott in one-on-one gubernatorial face-offs, which raises red flags about Stanford’s statement. Also, the lack of other firm indicators -- perhaps understandable considering Davis has not yet said she’s running for governor -- leaves this claim on shaky ground. We rate this statement as Mostly False. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-07700	Georgia legislation on immigration is a "copycat" of an Arizona immigration bill.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/07/georgia-association-latino-elected-officials/immigration-bill-foes-label-legislation-arizona-co/	Foes of a tough illegal immigration bill that recently passed the state House of Representatives say it gives them a case of deja vu. One day before House Bill 87 sailed through the chamber, the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials, one of the bill’s major opponents, rallied its members with an e-mail. "YOUR voice is needed ASAP," it said. "The Georgia House of Representatives will vote on the newly revised HB 87, a copycat version of the Arizona law SB 1070 with additional provisions." Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070 is the illegal-immigration measure that stirred so much furor when it passed last year. Some groups boycotted the state. The U.S. Department of Justice sued. But the law was so popular among Georgians that Democrat Roy Barnes and Republican Nathan Deal backed an Arizona-style crackdown during last year’s governor’s race. Arizona’s law is now being considered by a federal appellate court. So is Georgia’s bill Arizona all over again? HB 87 passed the state House of Representatives on Thursday by a largely party-line vote. Among other things, it would authorize state and local police to verify the immigration status of suspects, make it a crime to harbor or transport an illegal immigrant or encourage one to come to the state, and require certain businesses to verify their new employees can work legally in the U.S. It also would let legal residents sue if a government or agency is not adequately enforcing the law. Arizona’s law requires police to verify immigration status in some cases. It makes it a crime to harbor or transport an illegal immigrant or encourage one to come to the state, and it lets legal residents sue for inadequate enforcement. SB 1070 includes provisions not in Georgia’s bill that make it harder to hire day laborers and strengthen Arizona law on barring employers from knowingly hiring illegal immigrants. We called up Jerry Gonzalez, the executive director of GALEO, who noted that Arizona’s law turned that state into a constitutional battleground. His group thinks the Arizona bill leads to racial profiling. Gonzalez referred us to GALEO board member Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-area immigration lawyer and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which opposes the Arizona bill. He cited three key provisions of HB 87 that he said echo portions of Arizona’s law. Both measures have provisions that increase law enforcement officers’ role in verifying the citizenship of suspects. Like Arizona’s law, the Georgia bill would also make it a crime to transport or harbor illegal immigrants, or encourage them to enter the state. But Georgia’s bill does include language its sponsor thinks will avoid the kind of constitutional challenge SB 1070 faced, Kuck acknowledged. But Kuck believes the law will be struck down. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Matt Ramsey, called the "copycat" accusation "silly." The Peachtree City Republican changed the original draft after receiving input from Georgians and said he designed it to ensure it is constitutional. There are obvious differences. For instance, Georgia’s bill would require businesses with five or more employees to use the federal E-Verify system, which checks whether employees are authorized to work in the U.S. Arizona already has an E-Verify law. It’s being challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court. GALEO’s e-mail calls HB 87 "a copycat version of the Arizona law SB1070 with additional provisions." We think the E-Verify requirement counts as an "additional provision" and doesn’t impact on our ruling. We’ll go with a dictionary definition of "copycat," which means two things that closely mimic or imitate each other. Since GALEO is primarily concerned with racial profiling and constitutional concerns, we’ll focus on these issues. First, let’s consider racial profiling. Georgia’s HB 87 says that officers who have "probable cause to believe that a suspect has committed a criminal offense" would be authorized to verify that suspect’s immigration status. HB 87 also would prevent an officer from considering "race, color, or national origin in implementing the requirements of this Code section except to the extent permitted by the Constitutions of Georgia and of the United States." That provision appears to ban racial profiling, but it might have the opposite effect, said Gabriel "Jack" Chin, a University of Arizona law professor who has studied SB 1070 and thinks that it is unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1975 that it is constitutional for the Border Patrol to factor in whether occupants appear to be of Mexican ancestry when they stop vehicles near the U.S.-Mexico border -- so long as it’s not the only consideration. Chin and three other Arizona professors raised this issue in a paper in August. Since officers would not be able to engage in racial profiling "except to the extent permitted by the Constitution of Georgia and of the United States," and the U.S. Constitution does allow for some racial profiling, Georgia’s bill does, too, Chin argues. There are also concerns Georgia’s bill might conflict with federal immigration policy. Arizona’s law requires officers to determine immigration status in some circumstances. A federal judge blocked that provision from taking effect, saying it likely interferes with the U.S. Congress’ aim to regulate immigration in a uniform, national fashion and prevent people here legally from "inquisitorial practices and police surveillance." Georgia’s bill is different. It wouldn’t require officers to check immigration status; it would only authorize them to do it. And they would only be able to do so if they have "probable cause" to think that another offense has taken place. In Arizona, officers need only to have "reasonable suspicion" that a person is an illegal immigrant for them to check. This might improve HB 87’s chances at being constitutional. This is by no means an exhaustive comparison of the two bills. However, we did determine that HB 87’s backers have tried to address constitutionality concerns. But Georgia’s bill won’t avoid Arizona’s troubles entirely. Important issues remain unresolved, and critics are watching closely. If the bill passes as is, Georgia’s in for a fight. GALEO’s statement is accurate but does not acknowledge important details about efforts to make HB 87 constitutional. We therefore rule GALEO’s statement Half True.

pomt-10301	Barack Obama promises higher taxes on "the sale of your home."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/08/john-mccain/only-the-wealthy-make-big-profits-/	In a Spanish-language radio ad, John McCain makes the case that Obama will raise taxes on the middle class. Translated into English, the ad asks, "Are you ready for the higher taxes on income, savings and the sale of your home that Barack Obama promises?" We checked out some of the ad's other claims in a story we wrote . Here, we'll look at the claim that Obama wants to raise taxes on home sales. We've seen this claim before in anonymous chain e-mails that attack Obama's tax policies. We ruled those claims false. There's only one scenario in Obama's tax plan that we can find in which taxes on home sales would go up. You would have to be a wealthy person, making more than $200,000 if you're single and $250,000 as a couple, and you would have to make a substantial profit on your home -- more than $250,000 in profit. Here's how it would work. Obama proposes to increase the capital gains tax on upper incomes. There are exemptions to the capital gains tax, however, and one of the best-known exemptions is on home sales. In general, if you own your home and sell it for a profit, you are not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit if you are single, or on the first $500,000 of profit if you are a married couple. Neither McCain nor Obama have proposed changing this exemption. Most home sales under Obama's plan would also be taxed at 0 percent, unless, as we explained, profits on the home sale are more than $250,000 for a single person or $500,000 for couples. To present this detail of Obama's plan as wholesale tax increase on home sales is deceptive. Obama promises no such thing. We rule this statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13500	Says "Joe Heck voted 10 times to defund Planned Parenthood ... and Heck opposes a woman's right to choose, even when her health is at risk."	mostly true	/nevada/statements/2016/sep/06/catherine-cortez-masto/catherine-cortez-masto-largely-right-say-opponent-/	Republican Rep. Joe Heck’s record on abortion is fast becoming the subject of many salvos in the unending television ad wars in Nevada’s competitive Senate race. Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto has run several ads attacking Heck on the issue, most recently one featuring a Las Vegas-area gynecologic oncologist who opposes Heck because he voted to strip funding for Planned Parenthood. "Joe Heck voted 10 times to defund Planned Parenthood, which thousands of women depend on for cancer screenings," she says in the ad. "And Heck opposes a woman's right to choose, even when her health is at risk." Heck is no stranger to ads attacking his stance on abortion, as Democrats have sought to highlight the Republican military doctor’s adamant anti-abortion stance in both his current Senate race and past congressional races. A review of Heck’s voting record and public statements over the past six years shows that Cortez Masto’s ad is largely accurate, though over-simplified. Ten votes? Heck himself freely admits he voted to defund Planned Parenthood, and his voting record since entering Congress in 2010 reflects that position. It’s more difficult to argue that Heck has voted 10 separate times to defund the program, as that number relies on counting several procedural motions that weren’t strict up-or-down votes on funding for Planned Parenthood. For example, the ad cites five votes taken by Heck in September 2015 to "shut down the government over Planned Parenthood," but not all of them are the same, including: Two procedural votes on Sept. 17 to end debate and adopt rules for floor consideration on a measure defunding Planned Parenthood. A Sept. 18 vote on a bill (Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015) barring federal funding to the organization for one year and redirecting the funding to community health centers. A Sept. 30 procedural vote allowing for floor consideration of continuing resolution to fund the government that would also defund Planned Parenthood, and a subsequent vote on that bill itself. All of the votes mentioned in the ad were taken as part of a legislative attempt to strip funding from the program, but they aren’t all strict up-or-down votes. Of the five votes listed above, two are actual roll call votes on barring federal funding the program, while the other three are procedural votes that certainly moved the legislation forward but, again, aren’t direct votes on the bill. Cortez Masto spokesman Zach Hudson said the campaign referenced every vote listed in Congressional Quarterly that references defunding Planned Parenthood. Heck campaign spokesman Brian Baluta told PolitiFact that counting procedural votes unfairly inflates the number. The other votes mentioned in the ad are a mix of procedural and more straightforward votes to defund the program. The ad cites three votes related to the same piece of 2015 defunding legislation, including the initial House vote, a reconciliation vote agreeing to changes made by the Senate, and a veto override vote. And it cites two votes on amending 2011 spending bills clearly designed to bar federal funding from the organization. Our friends at PolitiFact New Hampshire took similar issue with a claim about endangered Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte voting to defund the group six times, ruling that counting procedural votes is "accurate but needs clarification." Health exemptions The second part of the ad claims that Heck opposes "a woman's right to choose, even when her health is at risk." Generally, Heck opposes abortion. His campaign said he supports exemptions in cases of rape, incest and if the pregnancy threatens a mother’s life. The Cortez Masto campaign argues, however, that Heck opposes abortion even when the mother’s health is "at risk." There is a difference between situations where continuing a pregnancy threatens the life of the mother and pregnancies with serious future health concerns for the mother. Cortez Masto’s campaign pointed PolitiFact to a 2008 Newsweek article detailing the health exemption, in part citing a Supreme Court ruling in Doe v. Bolton that says health can be defined as medical judgment on factors including "physical, emotional, psychological, familial and the woman's age." The National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL), a pro-abortion rights group, provides several examples in a 2016 fact sheet of women whose pregnancies, while not life-threatening, would endanger their future ability to have children or seriously harm the mother if the pregnancy was brought to term. The ad cites as evidence Heck voting for a measure banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exemptions for abortions necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman "in reasonable medical judgment," and limited cases of rape and incest. Heck voted against a Democrat-led "motion to recommit" the bill that sought to add an exception to the 20-week ban by allowing abortions that would preserve the health of the mother. Our ruling A Catherine Cortez Masto campaign ad claims Joe Heck "voted 10 times to defund Planned Parenthood," and "opposes a woman's right to choose, even when her health is at risk." Heck has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, a fact he publicly admits. The harder question to answer is whether to count procedural votes leading up to formal votes on the defunding measures as votes to defund the group. The ad is mostly accurate, but needs some clarification on the actual number of votes. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ab6a58e3-8036-4024-b176-c218b2187d5b	None	Catherine Cortez Masto	None	None	None	2016-09-06T17:47:13	2016-08-29	['Joe_Heck', 'Planned_Parenthood']
pomt-00951	"Georgia lawmaker pushes bill banning creation of ‘glow in the dark’ human-jellyfish hybrids."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/feb/20/raw-story/human-jellyfish-headline-misleading-spawned-real-b/	Let’s be honest. The headline looked like it belonged in Florida. "Georgia lawmaker pushes bill banning creation of ‘glow in the dark’ human-jellyfish hybrids," it screamed over a photo of a contorted face adorned in fluorescent paint. Sure, back in 2010, the state Senate was roundly mocked for voting to oppose forcing microchips into people. (That measure died, maybe from embarrassment). So certainly Peach State lawmakers learned their lesson about drafting bills based on internet rumor and speculation. So PolitiFact Georgia set out to right this gross error, easy peasy. Except … Well, first the good news. The headline makes a giant leap based on a strict reading of House Bill 287. The bill makes no mention of jellyfish. The "Ethical Treatment of Human Embryos Act" would, however, ban human embryos with non-human cells injected into them as well as ... wait for it … any "human-animal hybrid." The specifics about the gelatinous sea creatures come from the website of the bill’s lead sponsor, state Rep. Tom Kirby, R-Loganville. The bill is one of his priorities, which his office webpage describes this way: "The mixing of Human Embryos with Jellyfish cells to create a glow in the dark human, we say not in Georgia. " What in the name of SpongeBob Squarepants is happening here? Kirby points to news articles, touting scientists’ latest successes in introducing jellyfish genes into various mammals who grow up to glow under a black light. Of particular concern to Kirby is a 2008 New York Times article that details researchers who successfully put the jellyfish’s fluorescent protein gene into a single-celled human embryo. That test-tube embryo was described as nonviable, which scientists said would never have resulted in a baby. Kirby – who once used his agricultural economics degree to implant cattle embryos to breed stronger cows – isn’t so sure. His proposal would be proactive, to draw an ethical line in the sand for such research in Georgia. "I’m not trying to hurt good, valid research that helps people, but I don’t think we should create life like this, just for research," Kirby said. "I don’t think Georgians want what they did, creating a human-jellyfish hybrid, here." So maybe the bill is not explicit in its language. But the driving force is a concern about mixing humans with what makes jellyfish illuminate. There is no evidence of any abuse of this technology. Federal guidelines, not to mention the reputation of research facilities, would quash even the idea for the most part. Of course, injecting a fluorescent gene to make a designer glowing baby could be done in theory. And to an ethicist, that is enough to warrant at least discussion, no matter how silly. "Could someone who is crazy enough, with enough money, say ‘I want a glow-in-the-dark baby?’ Sure," said Kevin FitzGerald, a professor of oncology at Georgetown University and chair of the Catholic Healthcare Ethics. "You or I would consider that crazy. But there are some who would claim it as a right to free expression. That’s why there is value in discussing how protective the state needs to be." Those debates about human-critter hybrids are all fun and games, until a centaur loses an eye. Or until scientists and researchers push back on the speculation. Experts helped kill a previous version of Kirby’s bill, House Bill 481 in the 2013-2014 legislative session, with testimony that it would harm their ability to save lives. Those objections remain, especially given what is a fundamental misunderstanding about the role of jellyfish in medical and scientific research. Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2008 for their work in finding jellies’ green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene, and developing it for research. It’s now commonly used to track genetic changes as cells divide, giving researchers insight into ways to treat genetic diseases. Explained that way, injecting some jellyfish into cells doesn’t seem so wacky. But fears about the "what if" abuses have created a proposal that could stymie other legitimate research, said Dr. Mark A. Kay, a professor of pediatrics and genetics at Stanford University. For example, the bill would allow a human embryo to be created only through fertilization from a sperm and egg. Scientists, though, are able to and often create them for research purposes (not viability) by using a cellular nucleus –where the genes live. Kirby’s bill would put an end to that, and halt approaches being tested to develop human organs for transplants and other efforts. "This is an example where you’re trying to make a law to stop something quite ridiculous and end up limiting the legitimate efforts to understand genetic developments that can save people," Kay said. If that’s not enough for Georgia to be embarrassed, there’s more. The proposed bill does not stop animal genes from being introduced to human embryos. Kay describes genes as the equivalent of a sentence buried in an encyclopedia. Cells, which Kirby’s bill bans, are the equivalent of the house where those volumes sit on the shelf. "It does not explicitly state you can’t transfer a gene into a human chromosome, so it doesn’t even stop the ridiculous idea it claims is the threat," Kay said. Why? Because the GFP, which can be created synthetically or extracted from a jellyfish, is a gene that would still be permitted. And wouldn’t that set the stage for Perimeter road rage incidents where people look like the Hulk, not just act like him? If it seems we’re getting silly, it’s only because we are. The headline about glow-in-the-dark Georgians overstates the bill itself. But it captures the intent of the proposal -- to ban human embryos with non-human cells injected into them as well as any "human-animal hybrid." And, weirdly, it captures some of actual discussion happening under the Gold Dome. We rate the headline Half True.	None	Raw Story	None	None	None	2015-02-20T00:00:00	2015-02-11	['None']

pomt-01342	Says Scott Walker cut funding to local governments in Wisconsin, contributing to the "second-largest increase in violent crime" in the Midwest.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/23/mary-burke/citing-scott-walker-budget-cuts-mary-burke-says-wi/	Compared to jobs, crime has earned scant attention in the weeks leading up to Wisconsin’s Nov. 4, 2014 gubernatorial election. That is, until challenger Mary Burke made a striking statistical claim on Oct. 17, 2014, during her second and final debate with Gov. Scott Walker. "He cut shared revenue to municipalities, which really strained their budgets in terms of providing police and fire and local services," Burke said. "And in fact, according to the latest FBI reports, we have seen an increase in violent crimes that's second in the Midwest. So, out of 10 Midwestern states, the second largest increase in violent crime. So, we are not doing enough." Is Burke right that funding cuts to local units of government contributed to such an increase? Similar claim Earlier this month, we rated Mostly False a similar but broader claim by the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. The union, which has endorsed Burke, said Wisconsin "has become less safe than it was when" Walker took office. As Burke did, the union cited Walker’s reduction of shared revenue -- which is general state aid to local governments not tied to a specific purpose -- by $76 million, or 9 percent. That move, made in Walker’s first state budget, was the largest such cut in at least a decade. Walker also put strict limits on how much local governments could raise property taxes. At the same time, Walker’s Act 10 collective bargaining reform law helped many local governments absorb at least some of the shared revenue cuts by forcing most public employees to pay more for their health and pension benefits. And Walker’s campaign argued that the state has taken other anti-crime measures, such as increased funding to fight domestic violence. And ultimately, local governments, using local as well as state funds, decide how much to spend on law enforcement. So, Burke is correct that Walker cut shared revenue to local governments. But she doesn’t provide evidence that led to significant cuts in law enforcement agencies. The size of Milwaukee’s police force, in fact, has remained steady, as we found in an August 2014 factcheck. There were 1,362 officers in 2010, the year before Walker took office; a dip to 1,348 in 2011, then an increase to 1,384 in 2012. Crime data As for the statistical part of Burke’s claim, the FBI includes four offenses in its count of violent crimes: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. The latest available figures are for 2012. We checked FBI figures for Wisconsin and the nine other states Burke has cited when she has made comparisons on how the state ranks in the Midwest. We found that Wisconsin’s violent crime rate in 2012 was higher than in 2010, the year before Walker took office, and higher than in 2011, his first year in office. State 2010 violent crimes per 100,000 residents 2011 violent crimes per 100,000 residents 2012 violent crimes per 100,000 residents Percentage change 2010 to 2012 Percentage change 2011 to 2012 Illinois 435.2 429.3 414.8 -5% -3% Indiana 314.5 331.8 345.7 10% 4% Iowa 273.5 255.6 263.9 -4% 3% Michigan 490.3 445.3 454.5 -7% 2% Minnesota 236 221.2 230.9 -2% 4% Nebraska 279.5 253.2 259.4 -7% 2% North Dakota 225 247 244.7 9% -1% Ohio 315.2 307.4 299.7 -5% -3% South Dakota 268.5 254.1 321.8 20% 27% Wisconsin 248.7 236.9 280.5 13% 18% So, whether comparing 2012 to 2010, or 2012 to 2011, the increase in Wisconsin’s violent crime rate was the second-highest among 10 Midwestern states, behind South Dakota. Although it isn’t part of Burke’s claim, we also found a slight increase in property crimes -- such as burglaries -- in Wisconsin in that period. The rate was 2,453.8 per 100,000 residents in 2012, the year Walker’s budget moves affecting local government took effect, up from 2,432.7 in 2011. As we noted in rating the police union claim, many factors -- demographics, rates of incarceration, even police misreporting offenses -- can contribute to fluctuations in the incidence of crime, which is typically viewed more as a local issue than a statewide one. At the same time, there is evidence that more police can be correlated with a reduction in violent crime. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, studied police departments and crime in medium and large cities from 1960 through 2010. The data suggested cities "employ too few police" and "confirm a controversial finding from the previous literature that police reduce violent crime more so than property crime." Our rating Burke said Walker cut funding to local governments in Wisconsin, contributing to the "second-largest increase in violent crime" in the Midwest. Walker did significantly reduce general-purpose shared revenue, which local governments use to help pay for a variety of functions, including law enforcement. And the increase in Wisconsin’s 2012 violent crime compared to the previous two years was higher than all but one other Midwestern state. But Burke doesn’t provide evidence that the shared revenue cuts significantly reduced funding for local law enforcement, nor evidence that funding reductions necessarily lead to an increase in violent crime. For a statement that is partially accurate but needs more information, our rating is Half True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-10534	Barack Obama said in 2004 "that he basically agreed with the way George Bush was conducting the war."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/27/hillary-clinton/obamas-iraq-remark-taken-out-of-context/	In a Feb. 26, 2008, debate in Cleveland, Sen. Hillary Clinton attacked Sen. Barack Obama's record on opposing the war in Iraq, saying that once the invasion ended, he didn't oppose the policy as strongly as he did in 2002. "By 2004, he was saying that he basically agreed with the way George Bush was conducting the war," she said. The 2004 remark comes from an interview Obama gave the Chicago Tribune on the eve of the 2004 Democratic convention to nominate John Kerry for president. The invasion had long since ended. Troops there were attempting to stop insurgent attacks and prevent kidnappings in the face of concerns from the American public that the situation in Iraq was starting to deteriorate. "On Iraq, on paper, there's not as much difference, I think, between the Bush administration and a Kerry administration as there would have been a year ago," Obama said. "There's not much of a difference between my position and George Bush's position at this stage." "How do you stabilize a country that is made up of three different religious and in some cases ethnic groups with a minimal loss of life and minimum burden to the taxpayers?" Obama said later in the interview. Taking the interview in its entirety, it's clear Obama was speaking about the need to bring a satisfactory conclusion to the Iraq invasion once it had commenced, not diminishing his initial opposition to the war. In the debate with Clinton, he made the same point a little more succinctly: "Once we had driven the bus into the ditch, there were only so many ways we could get out."

pomt-05800	"When I was born, less than 10 percent of the federal budget was entitlement spending. It's now 60 percent of the budget."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/23/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-charts-explosion-federal-entitlement/	During the Feb. 22, 2012, presidential debate in Mesa, Ariz., Rick Santorum offered some historical comparisons of the federal budget. "When I was born" -- which was 1958 -- "less than 10 percent of the federal budget was entitlement spending. It's now 60 percent of the budget. Some people have suggested that defense spending is the problem. When I was born, defense spending was 60 percent of the budget. It's now 17 percent. If you think defense spending is the problem, then you need a remedial math class to go back to." We’ll split these claims into two separate items. Here, we’ll look at whether in 1958, "less than 10 percent of the federal budget was entitlement spending. It's now 60 percent of the budget." We turned to data from the Office of Management and Budget. OMB provides historical figures for federal payments to individuals, including payments for such entitlement programs as Social Security and Medicare. In 1958, such payments accounted for 25.4 percent of the federal budget -- more than double what Santorum said. In fiscal year 2011, the comparable percentage was 65.1 percent, which is in the ballpark for what Santorum claimed. This growth is not too surprising, since Medicare and Medicaid were signed into law in 1965 -- when Santorum was 7 years old -- and now occupy an increasing share of the federal budget. During that time, the U.S. population has grown significantly, as well. Our ruling Santorum is close on the current percentage of the federal budget going to entitlements, but he understates the figure for his birth year. This makes the expansion, which is dramatic in any case, seem even more so. With one statistic right and one wrong, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-11696	"Check out the record of #jobs created by #TaxCuts 7.8 million new jobs after Bush’s 2003 tax cuts 12 million new jobs after Kennedy's 1964 tax cuts 14.8 MILLION new jobs after Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts in 1981."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2017/dec/24/jason-smith/no-solid-evidence-tax-cuts-created-jobs/	U.S. Rep. Jason Smith sent out a tweet last month paralleling job growth with tax cuts, citing the George W.Bush, Reagan and Kennedy administrations. The tweet, sent Nov. 13, championed the House’sTax Cut and Jobs Act: "America needs the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct. Check out the record of #jobs created by #TaxCuts 7.8 million new jobs after Bush’s 2003 tax cuts 12 million new jobs after Kennedy's 1964 tax cuts 14.8 MILLION new jobs after Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts in 1981." We reached out to Smith’s office to see where he got his information, and spokeswoman Maggie Starks said the numbers came from the White House. The White House looked at how jobs grew over a five-year period after each president signed tax legislation. We wanted to know if the administrations’ respective tax cuts really created this many jobs. How did they get their numbers? The White House started calculating job growth in January of the year the tax cuts were enacted, regardless of the laws not being signed until February 1964, August 1981 and May 2003. Bush’s tax cuts President George W. Bush signed two large tax cuts into law during his time in office: The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. Smith cited onlythe latter tax reform law, which cut taxes on individual rates, capital gains, dividends and estate, among other changes. The law went into effect at the end of May 2003, but the White House started its calculations in January. In the first month of 2003, U.S.employment numbers were at 130.6 million jobs; five years later, there were 138.4 million jobs. This is an increase of about 7.8 million jobs, which is what Smith (and the White House) said were created. Kennedy’s tax cuts President John F. Kennedy's brainchild, the Revenue Act of 1964, was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on Feb. 26, 1964. It reduced individual tax rates and top corporate tax rates, phased in a faster corporate estimated tax payments and created a minimum standard deduction. We started looking at job growth beginning in January of that year like the White House did. In January 1964, there were 57.5 million jobs available. Fast forwarding five years, there were 69.4 million jobs, showing an increase of about 12 million jobs, right on par with Smith’s claim. Reagan’s tax cuts In August 1981, President Ronald Reagan signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 into law. A main component of the law was a phased-in 23 percent cut in individual tax rates over three years, which brought the highest marginal tax rate from 70 to 50 percent. In January 1981, the start of the year the tax cuts went into effect, there were about 91 million jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The same time five years later, the number was at 98.7 million jobs. This is an increase of 7.7 million jobs, over 7.1 million less than Smith claimed. Other considerations Taxes aren’t the only aspect that affect an economy, and it’s hard to prove if they can have that big of an impact on jobs, said Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute. "At any particular time there are many forces affecting the economy — tax policy, regulations, monetary policy, the economic growth of our trading partners, energy prices, etc.," he said. Edwards said the tax cuts probably did help businesses create jobs, but there was so much else going on during those time periods that no economist could pinpoint the overall jobs picture to one policy change. Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar at American Enterprise Institute, echoed Edwards’ statement, and said, "it’s hard to establish between tax cuts and the number of jobs created because there are too many confounding factors associated with tax changes that could have led to the job growth." She also said that putting a precise number to job growth associated with any particular tax reform or tax change is fraught with uncertainty. Lee Price, former chief economist of the House Appropriations Committee and fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, said although jobs went up in the years after the named tax cuts, one could also argue that the tax hikes of 1993 and 2010 were responsible for the creation of millions of jobs for the following several years. The Institute for Policy Studies is a progressive think tank in Washington D.C. Price also noted that the 1981 Reagan tax cut was followed by substantial tax hikes in subsequent years that didn't appear to slow job growth. Our ruling Smith claimed that the Bush, Kennedy and Reagan administrations signed into law tax cuts that created millions of jobs by saying, "America needs the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct. Check out the record of #jobs created by #TaxCuts 7.8 million new jobs after Bush’s 2003 tax cuts 12 million new jobs after Kennedy's 1964 tax cuts 14.8 MILLION new jobs after Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts in 1981." Jobs were created after each of the laws went into effect, but some of Smith’s numbers were off, and experts agree that there are too many factors that create jobs to simply say tax cuts are the reason.

pomt-09841	"As many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don’t have health insurance."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/20/bill-pascrell/pascrell-says-22000-americans-die-yearly-because-t/	On July 30, 2009, PolitiFact rated as True a statement by Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey that "as many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don’t have health insurance." We based that ruling on the same study that Pascrell did. Subsequently, a reader pointed out a paper published last spring in the online edition of the journal HSR: Health Services Research that contradicts the study Pascrell relied on. So we are changing our rating to Half True and providing this new analysis. Much of the push for reforming the nation's health care system has been driven by concerns about uninsured Americans. So it's no surprise that a statistic on the number of Americans who die every year due to lack of health insurance has been used frequently in speeches and opinion columns. However, this statistic, which stems from a report by an influential, quasi-governmental institution, is quietly coming under academic attack. When Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey said on July 30 that "as many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don’t have health insurance," the number he cited was an updated version of one originally calculated by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine. In 2002, an IOM panel of more than a dozen medical specialists estimated that 18,000 Americans died in 2000 because they were uninsured. They came up with this figure by looking at long-term studies that measured the links between insurance status and death rates. The IOM then used annual statistics on insurance rates and deaths to determine an estimate of extra deaths attributable to the lack of insurance. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that sought to update the IOM's study with newer data. Replicating the Institute of Medicine's methodology, Dorn concluded that the 18,000 figure should be increased to 22,000 — the figure later cited by Pascrell. Given the Institute of Medicine's prestige and Pascrell's caution in saying that "as many as" 22,000 Americans die annually from a lack of insurance, which signaled some uncertainty about the exact number, we gave the congressman a True rating. But a more recent paper raises questions about the IOM's conclusions. The paper, published online in April in HSR: Health Services Research, is by Richard Kronick of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California (San Diego) School of Medicine. Using data on adult health and mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics, which is a part of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Kronick concludes that the Institute of Medicine's estimate (or any that replicates its methodology, such as Dorn's) is "almost certainly incorrect." Pascrell's office was not aware of the paper when he made his statement and we did not find it when we researched his claim. The most notable difference between the Institute of Medicine's data — which were drawn from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey as well as the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey — is that Kronick adjusted it for a number of demographic and health factors, such as status as a smoker and body mass index. When he did that, "the risk of subsequent mortality is no different for uninsured respondents than for those covered by employer-sponsored group insurance." In other words, once you compare death rates in an apples-to-apples fashion — comparing insured smokers to uninsured smokers, for instance — the likelihood of dying evens out. This, in turn, would mean that IOM's estimate of 18,000 deaths would drop essentially to zero. In his paper, Kronick acknowledges that this is a "counterintuitive" result, possibly resulting from the safety net of public hospitals and community clinics providing "'good enough' access to care for the uninsured to keep their mortality rate similar to that of the insured." Either way, he writes, "there would not be much change in the number of deaths in the United States as a result of universal coverage, although the difficulties of inferring causality from observational analyses temper the strength of this conclusion." We ran Kronick's paper by a number of health care policy experts to see whether they thought it undercut the Institute of Medicine's death estimate. Everyone agreed that both Kronick personally and the journal that published him are credible. Because the significance of his finding could also have political consequences — on June 24, for instance, John Goodman, president of the conservative National Center for Policy Analysis, testified to the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health that we "do not know how much morbidity and mortality is attributable to lack of health insurance" — we also wanted to determine whether there may be any ideological bias at work. But we found no evidence of it. In fact, far from having ties to the conservative movement, Kronick served as a senior health care policy adviser in the Clinton administration, where, according to his biography, he contributed to the development of the Clinton health care reform proposal. Kronick's articles have appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association , and his work has at times been funded by the Commonwealth Fund, whose mission is "to promote a high-performing health care system" that aids "society's most vulnerable," including "the uninsured." Kronick even told PolitiFact that his finding was "not the answer I wanted" and, as a result, he agonized over whether to publish it or not. He said he's "grateful" that it has so far been unnoticed in the increasingly hostile debate over health care. "I don't have a whole lot of friends, and will probably lose a few over this," he told us. "And I might make some friends I didn't want." But a number of experts we spoke to are glad that Kronick did publish it. Henry Aaron, a health policy specialist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, said that he was impressed by Kronick's research from the time Kronick presented an early draft of it at a Brookings lunch seminar. "I found his reasoning compelling," said Aaron, himself a member of the Institute of Medicine. "In fact, after listening to his presentation, I had a hard time believing that the IOM had done what they had done." In interviews, Aaron and other health care scholars agreed with Kronick that uninsured and insured Americans differ in many ways other than their insurance status. "To estimate the impact of the lack of insurance on mortality rates, one has to control statistically for all of those differences," Aaron said. That, he added, is exactly what Kronick has sought to do so. Robert Book, a senior research fellow in health economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, agrees with Aaron. "I would be more inclined to believe Kronick's than other studies," he said, "I'm just surprised the IOM did their study without controlling for other factors." Book also praised Kronick’s decision to run calculations with numerous alternative models, and to remove various factors, one at a time, from the calculations. "From the standpoint of a careful econometric study, Kronick’s paper is excellent," Book said. "I’ve seen few papers that are this thorough in terms of seeking alternate explanations for their conclusions." Other health policy specialists we talked to were open to the idea of Kronick being right, while urging caution before overruling the Institute of Medicine estimate. Dorn, the Urban Institute researcher, pointed to a second study published by the Institute of Medicine on Feb. 24, 2009. This 268-page volume, America's Uninsured Crisis: Consequences for Health and Health Care, provides a detailed analysis of subsequent studies on the topic. While it didn’t provide a new estimate of extra deaths from uninsurance, the new Institute of Medicine study concluded that "the body of evidence on the health consequences of health insurance is stronger than ever before." Karen Davis, the president of the Commonwealth Fund and an Institute of Medicine member, said that the existence of Kronick's study "doesn't convince me yet not to use the IOM study," but she added that "if I saw a few more, I might be convinced. I tend to believe things when I see multiple studies using different databases and methodologies come to the same conclusion." (Aaron said he agreed with Davis on this point.) For the record, an IOM spokeswoman said the institute has not assessed Kronick's paper and thus had no comment on its assertions. On one key point, the Institute of Medicine and Kronick actually aren't that far apart. Kronick said he doesn't doubt that individuals' health suffers when they're uninsured — he just hasn't found evidence that they die sooner. "No one would choose not to have insurance if they could afford it," Kronick said. "There's no benefit to having 47 million Americans uninsured." When we asked Pascrell’s office whether the Kronick study would change their view, spokesman Paul Brubaker said it would not. "The point of the congressman’s statistic is to show a direct correlation between one’s ability to pay and the ability to have insurance, and therefore on their ability to be healthy,” Brubaker said. But for us, Kronick’s study raises questions about the reliability of the Institute of Medicine’s death estimate. We acknowledge that there is not yet a consensus among the experts. But in re-evaluating Pascrell's claim, we can no longer rate it True. We recognize that the Institute of Medicine is still widely respected, but an ideologically diverse group of experts is giving credence to Kronick's findings. That leaves us with something of a split decision, and so we downgrade our rating to Half True.	None	Bill Pascrell	None	None	None	2009-08-20T16:59:21	2009-07-28	['United_States']
pomt-10754	"I had prostate cancer, five, six years ago. My chance of surviving prostate cancer, and thank God I was cured of it, in the United States, 82%. My chances of surviving prostate cancer in England, only 44% under socialized medicine."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/31/rudy-giuliani/wrong-numbers-off-point/	Rudy Giuliani was seeking to make a point about socialized medicine by drawing upon his own experience of having been diagnosed with prostate cancer. But his statement caused an instant controversy as medical experts disputed his statistics and declared his comparison unfair. In fact, the numbers are wrong. According to the National Cancer Institute, the five-year survival rate in the U.S. actually is above 99 percent. In the United Kingdom, it's nearly 75 percent, according to their Office for National Statistics. Giuliani's campaign defends the numbers it used from City Journal, a quarterly magazine funded by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank in New York. "The bottom line is, the mayor is illustrating a point that you are essentially better off in the U.S. system than the European system,'' said campaign spokesman Elliott Bundy. "You are better off in a system of competition and choice rather than a government-mandated health care system." Cancer experts say there are two big problems with the City Journal article. For one thing, the numbers quoted in the story are an extrapolation of statistics from the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that supports health policy research, and that group says its numbers were misused in the City Journal article. The Commonwealth Fund issued a statement saying that its study of incidence of cancer and mortality rates should not be used to compute survivability rates. "The numbers basically aren't right," said fund president Karen Davis. But a gap still exists in the five-year survival rate between the U.S. and the UK. Even if Giuliani's numbers are wrong, could his point still be right? No, according to cancer experts. The difference between the two countries comes down to a matter of medical philosophy, experts said. U.S. officials believe in aggressive testing to find early cases of prostate cancer, while some cancer experts say that since that many cases of prostate cancer develop late enough in life that patients are likely to die of something else, screening everyone for cancer isn't worth the difficulties those treatments can cause. U.S. men are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer as men in the U.K. because they are more likely to be screened for the disease. That artificially inflates the survival rate, since many of the U.S. men treated would never have developed symptoms of disease. A more accurate comparison would be to look at mortality rates, said prostate cancer epidemiologist Lorelei Mucci, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health. In the U.S., about 15.8 of every 100,000 men die of prostate cancer, while in the U.K., the figure is 17.9 deaths. "They're essentially quite similar," she said. The statistics Giuliani uses are wrong. The Giuliani campaign insists that it's making a legitimate point about the merits of health care in the U.S. over Britain, but the statistics that say the chances of surviving prostate is higher in America also say the chances of having it are higher in the U.S., too. We find his statement false.	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2007-10-31T00:00:00	2007-10-31	['United_States', 'England', 'God']

When he ran for office in Massachusetts -- unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 1994 and successfully for governor in 2002 -- he often said he supported abortion rights. There are numerous examples to choose from, we'll look at two of his more plain-spoken statements here: "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country," Romney said in a 1994 debate with Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy. "I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years we should sustain and support it." In a 2002 debate, Romney said there was no difference between his views and that of his Democratic opponent, Shannon P. O'Brien. "I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose. I will not change any provisions of Massachusetts pro-choice laws,'' he said. In 2007, Romney says his views have changed. "And I get tired of people that are holier than thou because they've been pro-life longer than I have," he said at a Republican debate on Aug. 5, 2007. ( Politifact looked at Romney's abortion record previously; check out that story here .) The sly TV ad from the Log Cabin Republicans merely states, "A pro-choice record," leaving out a verb like "has" or "had." The ad could do a better job at pointing out that Romney no longer stands by his pro-choice record, but it doesn't want to. The whole point is to shine a light on where Romney once stood on abortion. His record on abortion is not entirely pro-choice, given his current position opposing abortion rights. That's why we find this attack Mostly True.

pomt-08391	Says Leah "Vukmir supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons into day care centers, churches, health care clinics and playgrounds."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/23/jim-sullivan/jim-sullivan-says-leah-vukmir-wants-allow-conceale/	In his 2010 bid for re-election to the Wisconsin state Senate, Jim Sullivan, D-Wauwatosa, is using a slogan that doesn’t even mention his own name. "Representative Leah Vukmir," he says in a series of direct-mail pieces to voters, "she’s just too extreme." At least five Sullivan mailers label Vukmir too extreme, on everything from health care for senior citizens to state funding for public safety to tracking sex offenders. A recent one focuses on guns, declaring: "Vukmir supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons into day care centers, churches, health care clinics and playgrounds." When paired with an image of a handgun and bullets, and the suggestion there would be no limitations, that’s a pretty strong statement. Would anyone have been able to carry a gun into all of those places? As evidence, Sullivan’s campaign points to a series of votes from Vukmir, a Wauwatosa Republican, in the state Assembly. The Vukmir votes were in support of Senate Bill 403, a measure introduced in 2005 that would have allowed individuals to apply for a license to carry concealed weapons. Applicants would have had to complete a firearms safety course or similar training. (At the time, only Wisconsin, Illinois and Nebraska did not have laws allowing concealed carry; today, only Wisconsin and Illinois don’t permit it.) The bill, after being passed by both houses of the Legislature, was vetoed by Gov. Jim Doyle. The Senate voted to override the veto, but an override vote in the Assembly failed. Vukmir voted for the bill and to override Doyle’s veto. Let’s look at each of the places Sullivan cites and what the bill said about them: Churches and health care clinics: The owner or authorized representative of a church or clinic could have given permission to a person who has a concealed carry license to bring a concealed weapon inside. Day care centers: Concealed carry would have been allowed only for the owner of a day care facility and, for day cares operated out of a home, the residents of the home. Playgrounds: Concealed carry would have been allowed at parks and playgrounds. That means of the four places cited by Sullivan, Vukmir supported allowing a limited number of people into three of the them. In some cases, such as a church or health care center, the pastor or operator would have been able to bar concealed weapons from the building. Only with playgrounds would Vukmir have allowed a wider group -- those who completed training and had received a permit. So let’s take stock. In a campaign flier, Sullivan says Vukmir, "supports allowing people to carry concealed weapons" into day cares, churches and other places. As stated, Sullivan suggests Vukmir wants to allow most anyone to do so. In reality, the bill in question would have been limited to those who obtained permits and -- in three of the four public places described -- applied to a very limited number of people. That is an important detail left out. We rate Sullivan’s statement Half True.	None	Jim Sullivan	None	None	None	2010-10-23T09:01:00	2010-10-22	['None']
pomt-03910	"There's going to be a slowdown and delays in flights" as a result of the sequester.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/27/raymond-lahood/ray-lahood-sequestration-will-delay-air-travel/	President Barack Obama and his Cabinet secretaries are running a full-court press warning Americans about the consequences of sequestration and goading Republicans to act to prevent it. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has been making the rounds on political talk shows and appeared at a White House press conference. He says the sweeping spending cuts will force the Federal Aviation Administration to furlough employees, and that will mean headaches for travelers. "Flights to major cities like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco and others could experience delays of up to 90 minutes during peak hours because we have fewer controllers on staff. Delays in these major airports will ripple across the country," LaHood said at the White House on Feb. 22, 2013. "There's going to be a slowdown and delays in flights," he said on MSNBC on Feb. 25. We have examined claims about how sequestration will affect everything from child care to criminal prosecutions. In many cases, the warnings from the Obama administration are portraying worst-case scenarios. That’s the case with air travel, too. Cuts, then furloughs Sequestration will force the FAA to carve $600 million from its budget, and LaHood says furloughing air traffic controllers is the last step after every other cut has been made. But air traffic controllers make up a big chunk of the FAA’s workforce: 15,000 of its 47,000 employees. "We’re looking at everything possible; and everything possible that’s legal, we will do," he said at the White House. That includes cutting travel, cutting overtime, freezing hiring, cancelling conferences and reducing contracts. Low-traffic airports are also a main target for cutbacks. The FAA has identified about 250 less-used airports and may shut down 100 or so of those towers completely. Airport operators can choose to staff the towers in other ways in order to keep the airports open. "We want to minimize the impact on the largest number of travelers," FAA chairman Michael Huerta told an American Bar Association conference this week. "It's for that reason that we need to start at the lowest-level facilities, meaning the smallest facilities that have the fewest operations." Huerta also noted that many airports have comparatively little activity during the midnight shift, so the FAA has identified locations where that shift can be cut. But ultimately, officials say, sequestration leaves little room for flexibility. "The sequester language does not allow us to move funding from account to account, and we simply can’t make the required cuts without facility closures and furloughs," DOT spokesman Justin Nisly told PolitiFact. In addition, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has said the cuts would force the Transportation Security Administration to furlough its 50,000 security screeners for up to seven days. ‘Controllable event’ It may not be time to cancel your vacations plans yet, however. Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with the advisory firm Hudson Crossing, said much of the real effect of the sequester is unknown. "We don't know whether airlines will cancel flights and, if so, how many, the routes, time of day, and so on," he said. Even with those unknowns, the FAA has wiggle room. "I view this as a ‘controllable’ event, in that government is opting to reduce the number of on-duty air traffic controllers and TSA airport security screening officers rather than take other steps to manage their reduced budgets," Harteveldt said. "I distinguish this from an ‘uncontrollable’ event, like 9/11." Sequestration does not allow federal agencies to shift money between departments -- say delaying an equipment order to keep pay air traffic controllers. But they can still prioritize under their reduced budget, cutting more deeply in administrative staff or contracting staff. "They’re not moving money, but they have some flexibility in where the reductions would take place," said John Cox, an aviation safety consultant and former US Airways pilot. And precedent, he said, points to some insulation for air traffic controllers. "There are certain essential jobs that get funded regardless," Cox said. "Air traffic controllers are very high on the list of priorities." Clifford Winston, an economist with the centrist Brookings Institution, praised the FAA’s effort to start by cutting at low-traffic centers. Federal airport dollars are spread around to thousands of airports, big and small, instead of sending the most money to places with the most travelers. "The interesting point is the inefficiency by which money is allocated for transportation in this country -- which is not proportionate to where the traffic is," Winston said. "That inefficiency can be exploited in a good way." 90 whole minutes? About that groan-worthy notion of 90-minute delays in major cities: Nisly said officials went into the field and asked district managers at airports how they would manage furloughs and what the impact would be. They found that at many airports, the work of getting airplanes to take off and land safely couldn’t function at full capacity if there were furloughs. That means "delays of up to 90 minutes during peak hours for travelers to major cities like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco," Nisly said. Erik Hansen, director of domestic policy at the U.S. Travel Association, which promotes increased travel to and within the United States, said sequestration will inevitably make an already cumbersome process worse. "This could be the one place that most Americans see the impact of sequestration," Hansen said. "It’s going to have a real impact on communities and the defense industry, but I think for everyday Americans -- we have almost 2 million people fly in the country every day. We’re going to have a lot of people understand quickly the impact." Our ruling LaHood is warning that once sequestration hits, travelers will experience flight delays. Experts we interviewed said the Obama administration has a fair amount of leeway to reduce the impact on some travelers. That said, the FAA has made clear that air traffic controllers consume so much of the agency’s budget that some will have to be taken off the job, and that will diminish the functioning of the nation’s airports. The rating: Mostly True.	None	Raymond LaHood	None	None	None	2013-02-27T15:41:25	2013-02-25	['None']

pomt-10383	"We must deal with the here and now and assure affordable fuel for America by increasing domestic production."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/19/john-mccain/no-relief-at-pump-here-and-now/	When Sen. John McCain dropped his energy bombshell, calling for the federal government to lift restrictions on offshore drilling for oil, he began by noting the high price of gas these days. "With gasoline running at more than four bucks a gallon, many do not have the luxury of waiting on the far-off plans of futurists and politicians," McCain said in a speech on Tuesday in the oil hub of Houston, Texas. "As a matter of fairness to the American people, and a matter of duty for our government, we must deal with the here and now," McCain said, "and assure affordable fuel for America by increasing domestic production." The political momentum for offshore drilling has always risen and fallen along with gas prices. But while there are strong arguments that can be made in favor of offshore drilling, reducing the cost of gas "here and now" isn't one of them, according to oil experts and economists - many of whom support the plan. For starters, the lead time for oil exploration takes years. Even if offshore drilling areas opened up tomorrow, experts say it would take at least 10 years to realize any significant production. And even then, they say, the U.S. contribution to the overall global oil market would not be enough to make a significant dent in the price of gas. "Drilling offshore to lower oil prices is like walking an extra 20 feet per day to lose weight," said David Sandalow, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and author of Freedom from Oil. "It's just not going to make much difference." It takes years to bring new oil wells online, said Mike Rodgers, a leading oil expert with PFC Energy in Washington. Companies need to drill exploratory wells, then discovery wells around the exploratory wells that show promise. Shipyards that build platforms, a two to three year endeavor, are already booked solid. "It's foolish to sell it as a short-term solution to high gas prices," Rodgers said. "Opening off-shore drilling would have no impact whatsoever on gas prices today." That being said, Rodgers is a proponent of offshore drilling. Most forecasters believe we are in for more dramatic prices hikes as international demand grows, particularly in rapidly developing countries such as India and China. As demand rises, Rodgers said, it would be good for the U.S. to have more of its own supply. If there is a larger domestic supply of oil in the future, he said, "you would hope" it might soften prices some. But even long term projections on the impact of offshore drilling don't promise much relief at the pump. An analysis performed by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the independent statistical and analytical agency within the U.S. Department of Energy, found in a report published in 2007 that opening up the outer continental shelf in the Pacific, Atlantic and eastern Gulf regions would result in production no sooner than 2017, and would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil production before 2030. "Because oil prices are determined on the international market, however, any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant," the report concludes. The EIA also researched the impact of crude oil production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. To put it in scale, ANWR is believed to have a potential for 10.4 billion barrels of crude oil, a little more than half of the projected potential for the offshore areas McCain has proposed opening. ANWR would add only 1 to 2 percent to the overall world oil supply, said Philip Budzig, who authored the report for the EIA. The report concluded drilling there would subtract anywhere from 41 cents to $1.44 per barrel of crude oil around 2025. That translates to a savings of just a couple pennies per gallon at the pump. Again, in 2025. Budzig noted that the report was prepared when oil was going for about $65 a barrel. It's now double that. So, in theory, savings might be double what he projected last year. The case for offshore drilling becomes more compelling when you look long term, Budzig said. Increasing domestic oil production will lower the U.S. trade deficit, he said, putting less stress on the dollar. "It's sort of like investing in your kid's education," Budzig said. Former Florida Sen. Bob Graham told the St. Petersburg Times he was horrified by McCain's plan. "I doubt there's an economist alive that would make the case that there's a near or longer term relationship between the moratorium and the price of gasoline," Graham said. Several economists who spoke to PolitiFact backed that up. "Obviously, if you do offshore drilling now it's not going to give any short term help on the supply of oil," said Paul A. Samuelson, a professor of economics at MIT and winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Economics. "That's far away." "Getting oil from the tundra and arctic isn't going to solve the problem," Samuelson said, adding that the potential for environmental damage needs to be factored in as well. Dr. A.F. Alhaji, an associate professor of economics at Ohio Northern University and an international expert on oil markets, said he supports offshore drilling as a long-term way to lower dependence on foreign oil and thereby improve national security. However, he said, "I have a problem linking the drilling to current gas prices for political reasons. The reality is there is no correlation between today's prices and what gasoline will be discovered in the outer shelf." In fairness, McCain made many arguments when making his case for lifting offshore drilling bans - including enhanced national security. But he left little doubt that the fundamental impetus was to provide some relief to the high prices Americans are paying for gas "here and now." And that argument holds little weight. We rule it False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-19T00:00:00	2008-06-17	['United_States']
pomt-04658	"We’re seeing now 30 straight months of private-sector job growth, 4.6 million jobs created."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/sep/10/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-united-states-has-had-30-straig/	Julián Castro did not run home to Texas after delivering the keynote at the Democratic National Convention. Rather, the San Antonio mayor stumped for President Barack Obama in the battleground state of Virginia and made another national TV appearance. On the Sept. 9, 2012, edition of NBC’s "Meet the Press," host David Gregory asked Castro if "Americans blame this president for the job situation or do they listen to President (Bill) Clinton who said nobody could have fixed it faster, not even me? I mean that seems to be -- if Americans believe that, then maybe they give him a chance." Castro replied: "I think President Clinton did a stellar job, as usual, making the case that we see now 30 straight months of private sector job growth, 4.6 million jobs created. and I believe that folks see that kind of progress around the country. And so for (Republican presidential nominee) Mitt Romney to say, well, there's been no progress whatsoever, folks can tell the difference between what they see out there, and what he's saying." Castro was referring to Clnton’s convention speech nominating Obama for a second term. In the speech, Clinton repeated a talking point often used by Democrats to tout Obama’s record on job creation. "In the last 29 months," Clinton said, "our economy has produced about 4.5 million private-sector jobs." Afterward, PolitiFact rated Clinton’s claim as Mostly True, saying that while Clinton had cherry-picked the job numbers to paint Obama’s record in the most favorable light, his wording held up. Castro spokesman Jaime Castillo told us the mayor used the same methodology as Clinton. Still, he spoke a couple days after the government’s release of August employment numbers, making his counts slightly different from what Clinton aired during the convention. In both cases, other ways of tabulating employment changes suggest less impressive growth in jobs -- even declines. By using private-sector job figures, for instance, Clinton and Castro overlook total job changes. Right off the bat, that paints Obama’s numbers favorably, since government jobs have declined during much of his term. We consulted regional economist Cheryl Abbot of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics who said that if you count from the start of Obama’s term in January 2009 through August 2012, private-sector jobs have increased by 415,000, but total jobs decreased by 261,000 due to losses of government jobs. Since this timeframe includes the start of Obama’s term -- when the economy was in freefall and before Obama’s policies had time to take effect -- we don’t think this is the best way to measure it. The way Clinton did it is another way to count it. He started counting from the low point of jobs in February 2010. The latest month-to-month dip in private-sector jobs occurred between January and February 2010 when the number of those kinds of jobs dropped by 27,000 to nearly 107 million jobs. Over the 30 months from February 2010 through August 2012, private-sector jobs increased by a little more than 4.6 million, totaling 111.4 million of late. However, starting the count at the low point is a bit of cherry-picking. If you instead start at the official end of the recession in June 2009, private-sector jobs increased by nearly 3.5 million. That’s well below Clinton’s 4.5 million figure and Castro’s 4.6 million figure. Finally, as we’ve written previously, presidents are not the only factor in job creation. The national, and world, economies are too big for any one person to control. So crediting Obama’s policies is at best partially correct because there are so many other factors -- such as policies of the Federal Reserve, the willingness of banks to lend money, and global business trends -- that play a role. Our ruling By most measures, the number of jobs in the United States has increased on Obama’s watch, though Castro did some cherry-picking in coming up with the 4.6 million number. Still, his statement reflects private-sector job gains since the last month with a loss in that category. We rate the claim as Mostly True.

pomt-14859	500,000 U.S. troops came home from Iraq and Afghanistan "with PTSD and traumatic brain injury."	mostly true	/iowa/statements/2015/nov/14/bernie-sanders/sanders-says-500000-troops-came-back-ptsd-tbi/	During a discussion of American foreign policy and military involvement in the Middle East at the Democratic debate in Iowa, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders turned the discussion to the care provided to American veterans with a startling statistic: 500,000 returned service members have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries. "When you talk about the long-term consequences of war, let's talk about the men and women who came home from war," Sanders said. "The 500,000 who came home with PTSD and traumatic brain injury. And I would hope that in the midst of all of this discussion this country makes certain that we do not turn our backs on the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us." Sanders has been making this claim for more than a year, including on Twitter in 2014, in a 2014 CNN interview and at a Minnesota campaign event last summer. But is it true? Have 500,000 American veterans really returned home from recent conflicts with PTSD and brain injuries? Sanders’ claim is at the higher end of the range of estimates available. The U.S Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that between 11 and 20 percent of veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) have PTSD in a given year. As of late 2014, about 2.7 million troops had served in Iraq or Afghanistan. That’s a wide range: 11 percent of 2.7 million is 297,000; 20 percent is 540,000. Additionally, a U.S. Senate resolution identifies "more than 390,000" cases of PTSD among veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn in Afghanistan, citing the secretary of Veterans Affairs as its source. Those figures only account for PTSD, not traumatic brain injury, or TBI, which Sanders also referenced. A 2013 Congressional Research Service paper on traumatic brain injury found that almost 57,000 Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans were evaluated or treated for "a condition possibly related to TBI" by the VA. That number is slippery though. It’s not clear that all of those nearly 57,000 actually received a TBI diagnosis, and it doesn’t account for the potentially thousands more veterans who experienced a traumatic brain injury but did not receive care through the VA. The VA also estimates that brain injuries account for 22 percent of all combat casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department, meanwhile, identifies 333,169 instances of traumatic brain injury among service members between 2000 and 2015. That’s a big number, but there are some caveats that come with it: It includes all U.S. forces, not just those deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and is overwhelmingly comprised of concussions and "mild TBI" that by definition lasts less than 24 hours. Also worth noting: that same U.S. Senate resolution noting 390,000 PTSD cases also references "more than 615,000" veterans of recent conflicts who have been diagnosed with "at least 1 mental health disorder." Our ruling Sanders said 500,000 U.S. troops came home from Iraq and Afghanistan "with PTSD and traumatic brain injury." No firm numbers exist for the number of veterans who have returned from America’s most recent conflicts with post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries, but Sanders’ claim of 500,000 does fall within the range of estimates provided by the VA and other sources. Sanders’ statement needs that caveat. As such, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-13208	Says Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally, has "paid to export throughout the world" Wahhabism -- "an extreme form of Islam" that basically teaches "Americans are the devil."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/21/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-says-us-ally-saudi-arabia-exports-ex/	Near the end of an hourlong interview at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Oct. 7, 2016, Russ Feingold was asked about his criticism of Saudi Arabia in the fight against international terrorism. The Wisconsin Democrat, who is seeking to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, gave this answer: "Here is a country that is a friend; at least an ally. A country that we have a good relationship with, that can help us in a lot of ways -- not just with oil, but in military situations such as what’s going on in a number of places in the Middle East. "Having said that, though, this regime has embraced Wahhabism. Wahhabism is an extreme form of Islam that they have paid to export throughout the world. "This Wahhabism is the principle force -- going from Pakistan to Ethiopia to Mali and now to Kosovo -- that is turning perfectly moderate Muslim peoples, peace-loving peoples, into people who adopt an extreme religious approach where the women are all covered up and they are basically taught that Americans are the devil. "How can we allow a country to be perceived as a friend -- across the board, without any questions -- when they are doing such a terrible thing?" So, has a U.S. ally "paid to export throughout the world" Wahhabism -- "an extreme form of Islam" that basically teaches "Americans are the devil"? Saudi is an ally As Feingold intimated, Saudi Arabia is a U.S. ally, even if the relationship is sometimes uneasy. Saudi Arabia has been a close ally in the Middle East since World War II, the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in April 2016, even as differences on issues such as Iran have strained the relationship. In testimony before a congressional committee in May 2016, a Middle East scholar from the Brookings Institution led off by saying: "On the one hand, the Saudi government is a close partner of the United States on counterterrorism. On the other hand, Saudi support for an array of preachers and non-government organizations contributes to an overall climate of radicalization, making it far harder to counter violent extremism." Politico Magazine was more blunt. In 2014, it named Saudi Arabia No. 2 on its list of America’s 25 most awkward allies, saying: "No country buys more U.S. weapons than the autocratic, oil-rich Persian Gulf monarchy, and no country — with its obscurantist interpretation of Islam, medieval punishments and harsh treatment of women — makes for a more embarrassing U.S. ally." It paid to export Wahhabism Estimates on the dollar amount vary, but there is widespread agreement that Saudi Arabia pays to export Wahhabism. UCLA history professor James Gelvin, whose research specialties include Social and cultural history of the modern Middle East, told us it’s been estimated that since the 1960s, Saudi Arabia has spent $100 billion spreading Wahhabism through schools, mosques, the media and other means. Saudi expert David Andrew Weinberg, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focused on foreign policy and national security, told us he’s not convinced the amount is that high but there’s no question billions have been spent. And an August 2016 news article in the New York Times, in which three dozen academics, government officials and experts on Islam from multiple countries were interviewed, stated there has been "lavish spending on religious outreach for half a century, estimated in the tens of billions of dollars." Wahhabism is extreme The Times article said Wahhabism, the Islam taught in and by Saudi Arabia, is named after an 18th-century cleric who founded it and is a "literalist, ultraconservative form of Sunni Islam" whose adherents "often denigrate other Islamic sects as well as Christians and Jews." Westerners typically understand Wahhabism to be an austere form of Islam based on a literal reading of the Koran, as PolitiFact National noted in rating as Pants on Fire a claim that a school President Barack Obama attended in Indonesia taught Wahhabism. Indeed, the Islamic State adheres to strict, literal interpretations of the Koran and Islamic teachings that are rooted in Wahhabism, which is the dominant faith in Saudi Arabia, as PunditFact has reported. William McCants, director of the Brookings Institution’s Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World, told us Wahhabism "is one of the most intolerant forms of Islam." And in Gelvin’s view, Wahhabism "has squeezed out other, more moderate forms of Islam and in many places in the Middle East, it is the only game in town." Americans are the devil? Thie final part of Feingold’s claim is more debatable. "I would agree with everything except the ‘Americans are the devil,’" Islamic specialist Khaleel Mohammed, a religious studies professor San Diego State University, told us. "Having studied there, I must say I never found any insinuation as such. But, I would agree that Wahhabism promotes ‘occidentophobia’ (anti-Western sentiments among Muslims)." Weinberg, with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, called that part of Feingold’s claim debatable and other experts use different characterizations. The Brookings Institution’s McCants told us that "official Saudi textbooks teach that Christians are seeking to destroy the religion and must be hated as a consequence." Calling Feingold’s devil reference "a bit of an exaggeration," Gelvin said Wahhabism conflicts with American values such as equal rights for women and popular sovereignty, "and acts as the gateway drug for many who go on to become jihadis." Our rating Feingold says Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally, has "paid to export throughout the world" Wahhabism -- "an extreme form of Islam" that basically teaches "Americans are the devil." Saudi Arabia is a U.S. ally, albeit sometimes with strained relations. It has paid to export Wahhabism and Wahhabism is an extreme form of Islam. But it’s not clear that Wahhabism teaches that Americans are the devil. We rate Feingold’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-02683	It’s warmer on Mars than it is in parts of the United States and Canada during the polar vortex.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/07/tweets/its-colder-us-mars-twitterverse-says/	The polar vortex takes no prisoners. At the start of 2014, the Midwest, East Coast and parts of Canada experienced brutally cold temperatures, some of them record-breaking. We’ve seen pitiable tweets from #ChiBeria and tales of people burning themselves in the name of cold-weather science. But what really caught our eye was the number of people comparing the climates of Earth and Mars. There’s no shortage of claims on Twitter about different cities being colder than Mars: Minneapolis, Toronto, Chicago, you name it. Outlets like Yahoo and Smithsonian magazine also spread the information around with more nuanced reports. PolitiFact is owned by the Tampa Bay Times, which is based in sunny St. Petersburg, Fla., so not everyone on staff is a cold-weather expert. So we touched base with scientists to see whether the United States and Canada really have been colder than Mars. The answer is not cut and dried. "While technically true, it’s a goofy comparison," said Ben Longmier, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Michigan. "The temperatures on Mars fluctuate like they do on Earth." We know that stepping outside in Chicago doesn’t feel the same as in Rio de Janeiro or Stockholm. Mars is no different. The assertion that Earth is colder than Mars is based on temperatures from NASA’s robotic rover, Curiosity, which measured a maximum ground temperature of minus 33 degrees Fahrenheit at the time we wrote this story. That’s roughly on par with one of the coldest U.S. cities. Minneapolis saw minus 23 F, with a wind chill that made it feel like minus 48 F. Winnipeg, Canada, the reference point for Yahoo’s Geekquinox post, which other news sources and tweets referenced, experienced similar temperatures. So the "real feel" is colder in those cities than on Mars -- at least in one sense. But not so fast. The air on Mars is much colder than its surface. Curiosity reports that the air temperature from its location is between minus 193 and minus 76. And again, that’s just at one location on the planet. Samuel Kounaves, a chemistry professor at Tufts University who specializes in planetary sciences, said the average air temperature on Mars is about minus 50. So the coldest places in the United States and Canada can edge out the warmest places on Mars, especially if we look at Mars ground temperature, not air temperature. But on average, there’s no question that Mars is colder. After all, Mars is tens of millions of miles further from the sun than Earth is. That said, let’s not get too carried away in technicalities and lose sight of what really matters here. "Either way, it's darn cold in Michigan right now!" Longmier said. Our ruling We’ve seen a lot of tweets about how it’s colder in the United States and Canada than it is on Mars, due to the frigid weather system known as the polar vortex. But that’s only correct if we cherry-pick the highest Mars temperatures. On average, our hypothetical Martian brethren are still way colder. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-00125	Under the Republican tax reform law, "83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent of individuals and large multinational corporations."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/26/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-partially-accurate-claiming-83-gop-t/	One of the statistical claims Tammy Baldwin likes most, in debates or elsewhere on the campaign trail, is a slam on the tax reform measure that President Donald Trump signed into law in December 2017. Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, is running against Republican Leah Vukmir in the Nov. 6, 2018 election, aiming to win a second term in the U.S. Senate. Baldwin recited the statistical claim again on Oct. 22, 2018 during a rally for Democrats in Milwaukee that featured U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Referring to Vukmir, she said: All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. "You know, my opponent backed that plan, where 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent of individuals and large multinational corporations on the corporate side." Is the GOP-backed law that favorable to the rich? Previous fact checks Our colleagues have three times rated as Half True claims that are similar to Baldwin’s. Each claim cited an analysis of the tax law by the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The analysis found that by 2027, the law would deliver 82.8 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of the income spectrum. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. However, in earlier years, the distribution of benefits would look very different, as PolitiFact National reported: For instance, in 2018, according to the center’s analysis, the bill would deliver 20.5 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent — vastly less than the 83 percent figure the DNC touted. And as late as 2025, the center projected, 25.3 percent of the benefits would flow to the top 1 percent. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. The main reason: By 2027, a number of key tax provisions that benefit middle-income taxpayers will have expired unless Congress extends them. In addition, the new tax law changed how inflation was calculated, in a way that will be less generous to taxpayers as time goes on. (The Tax Policy Center said its work doesn’t allow for figuring out the cumulative gains and losses over the 10 years of the tax law. Its study published only single-year results and only for three years.) Baldwin’s statement more broad Baldwin’s statement is slightly different in that she refers not only to the top 1 percent of individuals but also large multinational corporations as enjoying 83 percent of the benefits of the law. But she, too, relies on the Tax Policy Center’s analysis. As it turns out, Baldwin’s phrasing doesn’t really make her claim materially different than the similar ones we’ve fact checked — at least with regard to how the analysis that she relies on was done. Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, told us: "Corporations legally pay taxes. But a corporation is just an entity that is truly owned by individuals who bear the economic burden of the tax." Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, had a similar take. He told us: "When thinking about the distributional impact of tax changes, you should only look at how it ultimately affects people, as corporations are little pieces of paper in a filing cabinet somewhere — they can’t really feel the burden of any tax." In other words, despite the variation in phrasing, Baldwin’s statement isn’t any more accurate than the previous statements we’ve checked. Our rating Baldwin says that under the Republican tax reform law, "83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent of individuals and large multinational corporations." Even though her statement mentions corporations, it isn’t materially different than three similar statements we’ve checked. In a nutshell, the analysis that all four statements rely on found that by 2027, the law would deliver 82.8 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of the income spectrum. However, in earlier years, the distribution of benefits would look very different, with much smaller percentages of the benefits — 20 to 25 percent — going to the top 1 percent. Baldwin’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details — our definition of Half True.

pomt-11522	"In the 1980s, the state funded 68% of school expenses, and now the state’s share is 38%."	half-true	/texas/statements/2018/feb/16/scott-milder/scott-milder-state-share-education-spending-68-38-/	A statewide candidate says state government has whoppingly slashed its share of spending on public schools since the 1980s. Scott Milder, a former Rockwall City Council member challenging Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick in the Republican primary, poses and answers questions on his campaign website including: "Does Texas spend enough on public education?" Milder’s posted response: "Local homeowners pay too much. The state does not pay enough. Texas has the revenue to adequately fund education without a tax increase, but improper spending priorities at the state level have resulted in a system that places a disproportionate share of the burden on local taxpayers through property taxes." "In the 1980s," Milder wrote, "the state funded 68% of school expenses, and now the state’s share is 38%. Local property taxes have had to make up for this difference, and that is not the proper way to fund schools." We were curious: Was Milder right about a 50 percent plummet in the state’s share of education spending? By phone, Milder told us he drew his percentages from Texas Monthly’s August 2017 obituary for Mark White, the one-term Democratic governor from Houston who signed into law House Bill 72, a landmark measure that led to higher teacher salaries, class-size limits in early grades and the expectation that students pass classes to participate in extracurricular activities, among other changes. The obituary says: "At the end of White’s term," which ran through 1986, "the state paid 67 percent of all education costs in Texas. Today, the state’s share is down to 38 percent." Both percentages have factual roots, we found, but bring along asterisks. Let’s cover current state education aid, then travel back in time. Stand by too for a breakdown of such comparisons from a former legislator versed in school finance. Current state aid to public schools Journalist R.G. Ratcliffe, who wrote the White obituary, told us by email that his declaration that the state currently covers 38 percent of education spending reflects state-posted projections he initially noted in a February 2017 Texas Monthly story, "Are Your Property Taxes Too High? Thank a Legislator." That story says: "If the Legislature does nothing for the next two years other than finance enrollment growth, the state share" of school spending "will go down to 38 percent by 2019. During that time period, local school districts will have increased their share of spending by about $10 billion, while the state’s share will have gone up $1 billion." That story took note of a January 2017 Texas Education Agency presentation on school spending issues including a chart showing the state’s share of the Foundation School Program, the state’s primary way of funding schools, sliding from 46 percent in 2012 to 44 percent in 2016 and an estimated 41 percent in 2017--with the share expected to sink to 38 percent in 2019: SOURCE: Document, "Texas Education Agency Summary of Recommendations," to the Texas Senate, 2017 regular legislative session, Jan. 23, 2017 (noted in an email from R.G. Ratcliffe, politics editor, Texas Monthly, Feb. 7, 2018) That chart was topped with a note stating: "The state share of the total FSP entitlement has decreased in recent years, primarily due to strong property value growth." Our translation: Lawmakers don’t have to budget as much state aid when school districts are expected to reap more revenue locally thanks to escalating property values. We also queried the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on fiscal matters, about the state share of school funding. A staff spokesman, R.J. DeSilva, replied by emailing us a chart specifying state and local spending figures and the state share of FSP funding from 1985 through 2016. In 2016, the chart says the state’s share of education spending was 43.7 percent; the chart projects that to decrease to 38 percent in 2019. Not counting federal aid Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Lauren Callahan pointed us to a December 2017 TEA analysis indicating that state tax revenue in 2015 and 2016 accounted for 41 percent of public school spending in the state though she noted that if you set aside federal aid, the state share of state-local spending rises to nearly 46 percent. Put another way, the full analysis shows federal aid covering 10 percent of school spending each of the years with local spending accounting for 49 percent of all such spending. DeSilva indicated that LBB staff didn’t consider federal funding in its calculations of state shares of school spending. Federal aid isn’t part of the Foundation School Program, he wrote. State education aid in the 1980s According to the LBB chart, the state’s share of such spending hasn’t exceeded 50 percent since 1985--which made us wonder about the basis of Milder’s reference to the state picking up 68 percent of education costs in the 1980s. SOURCE: Chart, "Foundation School Program State and Local Share - History, 1985-2016 with 2017-19 Estimated," Legislative Budget Board, undated (received by email from R.J. DeSilva, communications officer, LBB, Feb. 6, 2018) Landmark legislation in 1984 Ratcliffe told us he drew his figure for state education spending in the 1980s from a 1985 report on the effects of the White-signed HB 72 by students at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. The report includes a passage stating that under the 1984 law, each district’s local share of education costs is calculated "so that the state funds 70 percent of the statewide costs" with that share "falling to 67.7 percent in 1985-86 and thereafter." We spotted similar language in HB 72’s fiscal note, posted online by the Legislative Reference Library. Specific predicted spending in the note broke out to the state’s share of public school aid, hovering around 68 percent from September 1984 through August 1989. Callahan addressed this part of Milder’s claim by providing part of a 1986 TEA presentation to legislators about school spending the year before. According to the excerpt, state spending on the schools, some $4.7 billion, represented 61 percent of nearly $7.7 billion in combined state and local education spending. Adding in $622 million in federal education aid in 1985, Callahan noted, shrinks the state share of school spending to 57 percent. The LBB-provided chart contains a considerably lower estimate of the state’s 1980s share of expenditures. In 1985, the chart says, the state covered what would prove to be a 32-year high of 52.2 percent of the Foundation School Program. DeSilva, asked to discuss why the LBB-determined percentages for the state’s shares of school spending in the 1980s trail the percentages suggested by HB 72’s fiscal note, said by email that the LBB’s percentages consider all state and local revenue spent on maintenance and operations plus debts while the HB 72 fiscal note, in contrast, didn’t count some spending that the LBB’s analyses consider. We noticed that HB 72’s fiscal note says the law’s provision for local district revenue to cover 30 percent of the Foundation School Program excludes "enrichment equalization, experienced teacher and equalization transition allotments." Also, DeSilva pointed out, HB 72 permitted districts to spend revenue raised locally in excess of whatever total comprised 30 percent of the Foundation School Program. For more perspective, we queried Houston consultant Paul Colbert, a former six-term Texas House member steeped in school funding issues. By phone, Colbert concurred that the 1984 law didn’t regulate considerable school revenue raised from local property taxes--a weakness later addressed by lawmakers in response to a Texas Supreme Court directive. Colbert summed up: "Now the Foundation School Program describes pretty much what we spend on education. Back then, nowhere near. We used to pretend that a whole of lot of money districts had to spend wasn’t there." Generally too, Colbert suggested, the LBB-presented percentages don’t appear to consistently consider all the same kinds of school spending--a critique that reminded us of the complexities of school finance and one that DeSilva rebuffed (see their compiled responses here). Colbert noted, for instance, that state-supported charter school districts didn’t exist in the 1980s while such state spending was expected to exceed $2.5 billion in 2017-18. Set that spending aside, Colbert wrote, and the state share of spending on traditional districts shrinks to 34 percent of combined state-local aid. "So, while Milder’s claim that the state was paying 2/3 of the FSP in 1985 is true but doesn’t tell the whole story," Colbert elaborated, "the LBB’s counter-explanation is also true but doesn’t tell the whole story." DeSilva, when we followed up, stood by the LBB’s percentages. The chart, he wrote, "shows funding reflective of statutory parameters in place at the time." Unsaid: Those parameters can change at the discretion of lawmakers. Our ruling Milder said: "In the 1980s, the state funded 68% of school expenses, and now the state’s share is 38%." The state’s share of state-local education spending has slid, we confirmed, though not as much as Milder declared. In the 1980s, lawmakers voted for the state to cover 70 percent of the Foundation School Program yet state aid actually covered a little more than half of state-local costs. State aid covered 44 percent of such costs in 2016; it’s expected to cover 38 percent of such costs in 2019. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02877	"Georgia has lost 14 percent of its jobs paying more than $50,000 a year and added 15 percent to its Medicaid rolls during the recovery."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/nov/13/michael-mule/more-work-needed-georgia-economy-deal-rival-says/	Gov. Nathan Deal’s re-election chances will largely rest on how voters view his economic stewardship of the state. As political strategist James Carville once famously said about the biggest issue of the 1992 presidential race: "It’s the economy, stupid." So it was no surprise that Deal held a campaign rally-type event to announce that Site Selection magazine rated Georgia as the best state to do business. A top adviser to one of Deal’s opponent, though, said Georgians should not be too impressed. "Georgia has lost 14 percent of its jobs paying more than $50,000 a year and added 15 percent to its Medicaid rolls during the recovery," said Michael Mule’, an adviser to the gubernatorial campaign of Dalton Mayor David Pennington. We decided to do some fact checking to see whether Mule’ is correct. Mule’ sent us a report to back up the first part of his claim and an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article to support the latter half of his statement. First, let’s examine the latter part of his claim. In September, the AJC reported that a record 1.8 million Georgians are enrolled in Medicaid and PeachCare, the state’s child health insurance program. The AJC also reported that Georgia’s Medicaid and PeachCare rolls had increased 15 percent since June 2009, or about 240,000 additional people, according to a review of state Department of Community Health data. Since Mule’ mentioned Medicaid, and not PeachCare, we asked the DCH for specific data about Medicaid enrollment. In June 2009, there were approximately 1.36 million Medicaid recipients in the state. As of June 2013, the number of Medicaid recipients increased to nearly 1.59 million Georgians. That’s a 16.7 percent increase, according to DCH figures. On that part of the claim, Mule’ is correct. Now back to the job-loss portion of his claim. Georgia State University’s Fiscal Research Center released a report in December that examined the job climate in all of Georgia’s counties between 2000 and 2009. The report classified premium jobs as those that paid more than $50,000 a year. "The state of Georgia experienced a decline in both premium (-13.59 percent) and low-paying (-2.74 percent) jobs over the last decade," the report said. The study defined low-paying jobs as those with an annual salary of less than $35,000. Mule’ was correct about the 14 percent decrease, but there was something that confused us. As we noted, the report studied 2000 through 2009. Federal economists say the recovery began in June 2009. State and federal labor officials say they do not have data detailing the percentage of Georgians making $50,000 or less since 2009. We followed up with Mule’ since his statement suggested he was referring to the number of Georgians earning more than $50,000 since the recovery. "The Medicaid link I sent you explicitly shows that figure was ‘during the recovery.’ Perhaps inserting a comma separating the two statistics would have dismissed any confusion on your end," he said via email. To sum up, Mule’, in an attempt to curb the credit Deal is claiming over the report, claimed "Georgia has lost 14 percent of its jobs paying more than $50,000 a year and added 15 percent to its Medicaid rolls during the recovery." His claim is partially based on accurate numbers. He is correct about the Medicaid numbers. But his statement also leaves the impression Mule’ was saying Georgia has lost 14 percent of its jobs paying more than $50,000 since the recovery began. PolitiFact Georgia could not find anything to back up this part of his statement. And we think it would take more than a comma to clear that up. Overall, his statement is partially accurate. But it takes things out of context when read as a whole. That’s our definition of Half True.	None	Michael Mule'	None	None	None	2013-11-13T00:00:00	2013-11-04	['None']

pomt-01895	The Wisconsin unemployment rate was higher than the U.S. rate during only three months when Mary Burke was state commerce secretary.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/06/joe-zepecki/wisconsin-unemployment-rarely-above-us-when-mary-b/	In February 2014, ramping up efforts to tie Democratic gubernatorial front-runner Mary Burke to former Gov. Jim Doyle, the Wisconsin Republican Party declared: "The only time over the last 25 years when the state’s unemployment rate exceeded the U.S. average was when Burke was commerce secretary." We rated the claim Mostly True. Dating back to 1988, there were 15 months when Wisconsin’s unemployment rate was higher, all during Burke’s time running Commerce under Doyle. The GOP’s claim only indirectly blamed Burke and we noted that other factors, such as trends in the U.S. economy, affect state unemployment rates. In an interview on June 23, 2014, however, Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki said the state unemployment rate exceeded the national rate for only three months while Burke ran Commerce. So, let’s reboot. Reviewing the rates During Zepecki’s interview on "The Devil’s Advocates," a talk show on WXXM-FM (92.1) in Madison, the two co-hosts and Zepecki talked about Burke and Gov. Scott Walker in terms of job creation and unemployment. Here’s a portion of the exchange: Co-host Mike Crute: "Well, back when Mary Burke was the commerce secretary, I believe 2006-2007, Joe, the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent. Of course, they (Republicans) want to say, 'higher than the national average,' for the short time Mary was in that position. But at 4.7 percent, I mean, that is pretty much full employment when she was commerce secretary." (Burke actually was commerce secretary from February 2005 to November 2007.) Zepecki: "It is, and it was three months, three individual months within her two and a half years where I believe the unemployment rate here was about a tenth of a percentage point higher. Again, this is what they’re doing, just trying to play fast and loose and lay out ways to obscure (Walker’s) failures on jobs." When we contacted Zepecki, he began his email response by saying: "I got this one wrong." Zepecki said he made his claim based on his recollection of a chart produced by the state GOP that compared Wisconsin and U.S. unemployment rates during Burke’s time at Commerce. He said the chart seemed to show three periods of time when Wisconsin’s rate exceeded the U.S. rate. But he didn’t disagree, as we found in fact-checking the GOP’s claim, that U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show Wisconsin’s rate was higher for 15 months of Burke’s 33-month tenure. It’s worth noting that, even when Wisconsin’s rate exceeded the national rate, it was by less than one-half of 1 percentage point. Our rating Zepecki said the Wisconsin unemployment rate was higher than the U.S. rate during only three months when Mary Burke was state commerce secretary. Wisconsin’s rate was never more than fourth-tenths of a percentage point higher than the U.S. rate, but it did exceed the U.S. rate for nearly half of of Burke’s 33 months running Commerce.

pomt-01001	"Measles is one of the most common causes of child blindness worldwide."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/04/celine-gounder/measles-leading-cause-blindness-around-world/	An assertion from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that vaccinations are about freedom and should be left to parental choice spawned a raft of reaction from the pundit and political world. One claim we heard a lot is Paul should know better. After all, he is an eye surgeon. In an interview on CNBC on Feb. 2, 2015, Paul hailed vaccines as a medical triumph but said he sees the controversy of whether it should be mandatory as an "issue of freedom." Further, he said he heard of many "tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines." Dr. Celine Gounder, a physician who frequently appears on news channels to analyze health news, addressed his comments on CNN Newsroom the following day. "Frankly, Rand Paul as an ophthalmologist should be out there saying measles is one of the most common causes of child blindness worldwide," Gounder said. "And as an eye doctor, he should be advocating for measles vaccination for that reason." Gounder’s claim, as it relates to Paul’s life as an eye surgeon, got our attention. And it’s correct. Gounder’s point is backed up by sources such as the World Health Organization and a host of academic studies and review papers that she sent us. ‘Worldwide’ is key Conjunctivitis, or pink eye, is a common side effect of a measles infection. "Whoever you are, wherever you are," people with measles can’t stand bright sunlight, said Dr. James Cherry, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. But for children in poor countries, eye damage from measles can be much worse. Blindness by measles in children is not common across North America and Europe, areas with high vaccination rates and access. The leading causes of blindness in those continents are lesions of the optic nerve, according to the WHO. In low-income countries, where access to vaccines that prevent measles is limited and malnutrition is prevalent, corneal scarring from measles and a deficiency of vitamin A are the major causes. In the United States, based on the most recent CDC data from more than 20 years ago, the leading complication (and complications from measles of any sort in the U.S. are not common) was diarrhea followed by middle ear inflammation and pneumonia. "In the U.S., children could potentially develop eye problems during an episode of measles if they are malnourished," said Dr. Richard Semba, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine ophthalmology professor. "This would probably be rare." Vitamin A is important for eyes to function as they should, as well as for the body’s immune system and growth. If your teacher or mom didn’t tell you, the vitamin is found in eggs, whole milk, butter and liver, as well as leafy green vegetables and red, orange and yellow fruits. Measles is most common in countries of sub-Saharan Africa, southeast Asia and south Asia, together home to 85 percent of all blind children. In these places, measles is endemic, according to a 2004 review paper by Semba. That paper found measles blindness accounted for anywhere from 15,000 to 60,000 cases of child blindness per year. Here's how Semba explained blindness happening from contracting the highly contagious measles virus: The cornea, the front transparent layer of the eye, requires vitamin A to work. The retina, which is the back layer of the eye that receives visual images (like the film in a camera), requires vitamin A in order to allow us to see at night. A measles infection can reduce the levels of vitamin A that the body needs for normal health. As a result, during a measles episode, a child can develop ulcers in the cornea during a measles episode that makes it hard to see at night. The end result is "a devastating loss of vision and blindness," Semba said. Dryness in corneas can result in night blindness, corneal ulceration, scarring and resulting blindness, studies show. Countries with vaccination programs for measles have reduced the problem of widespread eye disease, according to WHO. The organization also recommends that children in developing countries who contract measles receive two doses of vitamin A supplements a day apart. "Vitamin A supplements have been shown to reduce the number of deaths from measles by 50 percent," WHO says. Paul’s spokesman sent us a link to a New York Times reporter’s account of watching Paul get his Hepatitis A booster shot Feb. 3, 2015, but did not answer our questions. Our ruling Gounder suggested Paul should be singing a different tune about vaccinations, one that mentions, "Measles is one of the most common causes of child blindness worldwide." She was careful to say worldwide. In developed countries, measles does not typically lead to blindness. But in low-income countries, it is certainly one of the leading drivers of blindness in children, experts agree. We rate the claim True.

pomt-14584	Says CNN reported Ben Carson was "taking a break from campaigning" and the Cruz campaign "forwarded that news to our volunteers."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/06/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-falsely-says-cnn-first-said-ben-carson-wa/	Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign wrongly suggested in the moments before the Iowa caucuses that Ben Carson would suspend his campaign. It wasn’t true, and Carson supporters were furious. Cruz has apologized. But he said at the Feb. 6, 2016, Republican debate that the real culprit was CNN. "Let me tell you the facts that occurred for those who are interested in knowing," Cruz said. "On Monday night, about 6:30 p.m. CNN reported that Ben was not going from Iowa to New Hampshire or South Carolina. Rather he was ‘taking a break from campaigning.’ They reported that on television. CNN’s political anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and Wolf Blitzer said it was ‘highly unusual’ and ‘highly significant.’ My political team saw CNN’s report, breaking news, and forwarded that news to our volunteers." According to CNN, what Cruz said "is categorically false." We agree that Cruz's description is highly misleading. Here’s how it all unfolded on caucus night. Between 6:41 p.m. and 6:43 p.m. central time, CNN’s senior political reporter Chris Moody sent a series of tweets reporting that Carson "won’t go to NH/SC will head home to Florida for some R&R" but "Carson’s campaign tells me he plans to stay in the race beyond Iowa no matter what the results are tonight." Two minutes later, CNN’s Dana Bash and Jake Tapper report Carson’s travel plans during a live broadcast of the caucuses. Bash and Tapper both say that this is "very unusual" and anchor Wolf Blitzer adds that it is "very significant news." But CNN does not say Carson is suspending his campaign. Here’s a transcript: Tapper: "CNN has learned some news about the man who, at least according to polls, is in fourth place here in Iowa. Now, Dana, a week from tomorrow, we’re all going to be doing this again for the New Hampshire primary. So almost every single candidate is going to be going directly from here to New Hampshire to campaign — except for the man in fourth place, who a few months ago was in first place here, Dr. Ben Carson. What have we learned?" Bash: "That’s right. We should say that our Chris Moody is breaking this news, that Ben Carson is going to go back to Florida to his home, regardless of how he does tonight here in Iowa. He’s going to go there for several days. And then afterwards, he’s not going to go to South Carolina. He’s not going to go to New Hampshire. He’s going to come to Washington, D.C., and he’s going to do that because the National Prayer Breakfast is on Thursday. And people who have been following Ben Carson’s career know that that’s really where he got himself on the political map, attending that prayer breakfast, and really giving it to President Obama at the time. And he became kind of a hero among conservatives, among evangelicals especially." Tapper: "But it’s very unusual..." Bash: "Very unusual." Tapper: "...to be announcing that you’re going to go home to rest for a few days, not going on to the next site. Plus, he’s already announced that he’s going to be coming out and speaking at 9:15 local and 10:15 Eastern, no matter whether or not we know the results, because he wants to get home and get ahead of the storm." Bash: "Look, if you want to be president of the United States, you don’t go home to Florida. I mean, that’s bottom line. That’s the end of the story. If you want to signal to your supporters that you want it, that you’re hungry for it, that you want them to get out and and campaign, you’ve got to be out there doing it too. And he’s not doing it. It’s very unusual." Tapper: "Very unusual news that CNN has just learned. CNN’s Chris Moody breaking the story. Wolf, back to you in Washington." Blitzer: "Very significant news indeed, guys, thanks very much." During the discussion, CNN's lower-third graphic does say "CAMPAIGN: CARSON TO TAKE A BREAK AFTER IOWA." At 6:53 p.m., Carson spokesman Jason Osborne tweets that the candidate "will be going back to Florida to get fresh clothes b4 heading back out on the campaign trail. Not standing down." Three minutes later, according to Breitbart, the Cruz campaign sends an email telling supporters, "The press is reporting that Dr. Ben Carson is taking time off from the campaign trail after Iowa and making a big announcement." Here’s an image of the email via the Huffington Post: Things get worse at approximately 7 p.m., when the caucuses opened. Cruz supporters using the campaign’s mobile app received a message informing them that Carson "will stop campaigning after Iowa." At 7:07 p.m., Cruz surrogate and Iowa Rep. Steve King retweets Moody, adding, "#iacaucus Skipping NH & SC is the equivalent of suspending. Too bad this information won't get to all caucus goers." An hour later, King sends another Tweet to the same effect. For what it’s worth, Cruz acknowledged earlier in the week that CNN’s reporting that night was accurate. "CNN got it correct. Miracles happen. But that is part of the democratic process to let Iowa causers know, here is the news that is breaking. And it is relevant," Cruz said Feb. 3. Our ruling Cruz said that it was CNN, not his campaign, that first reported that Carson "taking a break from campaigning," and his campaign forwarded that news to his supporters. Cruz's campaign took a nugget of information from CNN and took it too far. CNN reported that Carson was "to take a break after Iowa," while simultaneously noting that Carson would ultimately continue campaigning. The Cruz campaign sent messages on its app anyway, saying that Carson would "stop" his campaign. A key surrogate said that Carson was doing "the equivalent of suspending." That’s more than simply "forwarding" news. We rate Cruz’s claim False. Update: This item was updated to include a description of CNN's lower-third graphic.

pomt-08845	"[U]nlike every other major transit system in the nation, MARTA has never received any significant, dedicated funding from the state of Georgia."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/10/michael-tyler/marta-chairman-said-system-receives-no-significant/	The Metropolitan Atlanta Regional Transit Authority has said repeatedly that it doesn't get enough money from the state. And unlike any major system in the United States, the money it does receive is far from a sure thing, its advocates have said. Georgia law does not require that the state set aside funds for MARTA. Michael W. Tyler, MARTA's chairman, made the claim once again in a June 9 op-ed piece that appeared in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He argued that MARTA has done well with limited resources. "[U]nlike every other major transit system in the nation, MARTA has never received any significant, dedicated funding from the state of Georgia," Tyler said. But is it true? We asked MARTA to back up its claim. MARTA spokesman Lyle Harris explained that during the past 15 years, the agency has consistently received about $2 million annually from the General Assembly for capital expenses, such as the cost of replacing buses or other infrastructure. But this money is not dedicated to MARTA. "Dedicated" funds are monies that must, by state law, go to a specific purpose. Because this money isn't dedicated, MARTA must ask the state Legislature for money every year. This makes it hard for MARTA to plan its budgets. This isn't MARTA's only funding problem, Harris said. While the $2 million is important to the agency, it's only a drop in the bucket. MARTA's capital budget is usually larger than $250 million. Furthermore, Harris said, MARTA receives no dedicated operating funding from the state or money to run the system day to day. Harris provided PolitiFact Georgia a spreadsheet with operating funds data from the Federal Transit Administration's National Transit Database (NTD), which collects information on the country's transit systems. The data were from 2008, the most recent year available. They showed that MARTA was the country's ninth-largest transit system by "unlinked passenger trips" in 2008, a commonly used measure that counts each time a passenger boards a MARTA vehicle. But the data didn't back up MARTA's claim. Instead, the federal data it sent show that MARTA is a very large agency that receives no operating funds from the state. That, however, is not the same thing as being the only major transit system that receives no dedicated state funding, as Tyler said. We did our own check, which revealed one transit system larger than MARTA that does not receive state-dedicated operating or capital funds: the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. The WMATA operates trains and buses in the Washington, D.C., area and is the fourth-largest transit system in the country. It is nearly three times the size of MARTA by unlinked passenger trips. Federal data, an agency spokesman and a scholar with the Brookings Institution who has studied the Washington system confirm it does not receive state-dedicated operating funds or capital funds. Still, the WMATA receives far more state funding than MARTA does. According to 2008 data, 18 percent of its operating funds came from Maryland and Virginia, or more than $250 million. MARTA received no state funding for operations that year, federal data show. Harris argues that MARTA's situation is unique. When the WMATA asks for state money, it receives hundreds of millions of dollars. MARTA doesn't get anything close to this type of funding from Georgia, Harris said. "Whether we ask or not, we don't get anything akin to what WMATA is getting," Harris said. That may be correct, but that's not what Tyler said. His op-ed argued that MARTA is the only major transit agency in the country that receives no "significant, dedicated" funding from the state. Not that it's barely getting anything from the state or that state funding makes up only a tiny percentage of its budget. We rule Tyler's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06428	"During Sherrod Brown’s past decade as a D.C. politician, more than one out of every four jobs that has left America, left from Ohio. ... Sherrod Brown will own these horrendous Ohio job numbers next year."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/oct/24/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-campaign-says-sherrod-brown-owns-ohios/	Throw the bums out, because they’ve had enough time and this country (or state) is still a mess (if not more of a mess). There it is in a nutshell: The case against any politician in office for the last four years or more. Josh Mandel, Ohio’s treasurer who aspires to be in the U.S. Senate, will use it repeatedly in the next year against incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Mandel spokesman says. The mess, of course, is the state of employment. Non-farm employment fell dramatically over the last few years, and although the trend is reversing, the recovery is painfully slow. Or as Mandel spokesman Joe Aquilino said in a news release on Sept. 28, 2011, "Perhaps most staggering: during Sherrod Brown’s past decade as a D.C. politician, more than one out of every four jobs that has left America, left from Ohio. This is a shocking statistic. Sherrod Brown’s policies are not working for Ohio." Promising that this message will not go away, Aquilino said, "Simply put, Sherrod Brown will own these horrendous Ohio job numbers next year." PolitiFact Ohio is all for ownership, as is the print side of this operation, The Plain Dealer. That’s only fitting, because Aquilino says that The Plain Dealer is a primary source for the statistic. So let’s check out the components of the claim: The jobs picture The Plain Dealer on Sept. 5 published a Labor Day weekend story on Ohio’s loss of jobs over the course of a decade. The story focused heavily on a new report by Policy Matters Ohio, a liberal-leaning think tank that studies economic and social justice issues. Titled "The State of Working Ohio 2011," the report examined a number of economic measures, concluding that "wages are shrinking, jobs are elusive, and workers are being left behind." Aquilino cited this report as well as The Plain Dealer in his criticism of Brown. It is quite a day when a spokesman for a conservative Republican cites Policy Matters, and Aquilino appreciates this as much as anyone. Rest assured that Mandel disagrees with the group’s proposals to use tools such as more stimulus spending to turn things around. Aquilino also pointed to a chart that went with the Plain Dealer story. The chart listed a number of metrics related to jobs and wages over the course of a decade, none of them positive for a majority of workers, and said, "Between July 2000 and July 2010, Ohio lost nearly 600,000 jobs, accounting for more than one-fourth of all jobs lost in the nation." PolitiFact Ohio went back and checked the numbers with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They were correct: Ohio lost 590,300 jobs during that 10-year span when the nation lost 2.07 million. Keep in mind that these were net job losses, based on the number of people working at given point in time. If 100 people lose their jobs at Company A, while Company B hires 20 people who were unemployed, the net job loss would be counted as 80. Also note the time frame measured in the September 2011 newspaper article -- a 10-year period from July 2000 and July 2010. This made sense for the newspaper story because a number of other measures being examined also came from this period and were not yet available for more recent months, according to a reporter and editor who assembled the data. It was a way to make sure that all the economic comparisons covered identical periods. Yet job numbers change month by month. So we moved the time frame forward, comparing 10 years worth of net job losses from January 2001 through December 2010, and then through January 2011, to see if the earlier measure was an aberration. It was not. Ohio’s job losses still represented about a quarter of those nationwide, with 570,400 Ohio jobs lost using one of the periods (out of 2.2 million nationwide) and 563,300 in the other (out of 2.1 million nationwide). However, the job picture has grown a bit rosier as 2011 progresses, even if it lags demand as more people enter the workforce. If the comparison were made using August 2011 as the end point, Ohio’s 10-year job losses would be 407,000. But wait a minute. Suppose Mandel, The Plain Dealer or anyone else wanted to compare Ohio’s job losses with the nation’s during that most recent 10-year period. Let’s see how Ohio stacked up: Ohio lost 407,00 jobs out of the nation’s loss of 531,000. That’s an astounding ratio -- and if you used it (you should not), you’d say that four out out every five jobs lost in the United States came from Ohio. How is that possible? We asked BLS, and the answer leads us to the problem with these comparisons: Data examining one state’s decline over the years is useful when examining trends, such as Ohio’s loss of its manufacturing sector (a primary focus of the Policy Matters study and The Plain Dealer story). But simultaneous events in just a few large states can bring the state-to-national ratios down or up and skew the comparisons. Take Michigan and California. Each lost more jobs than Ohio. If you compared their combined job losses during the most recent 10-year period available, their totals would actually exceed the nation’s job losses. That would be impossible, of course, were it not for the fact that some other states were gaining jobs during that time. Rick Perry will gladly discuss what some call the Texas miracle and how Texas added jobs, although we’ll leave it to PolitiFact Texas to assess whom should get credit. You can play with these numbers until your head spins. The point is that it really helps to understand what was going on elsewhere before using a single comparison to compare one state with the nation. So OK, Ohio lost a lot of jobs. Mandel cited a September 2011 Plain Dealer story that, for reasons mentioned already, used a job-loss measure ending in July 2010. We accept ownership; the data showed a trend that was correct, and the raw numbers were accurate. Is Brown to blame? Should Brown "own these horrendous job numbers," as the Mandel spokesman says? We asked Aquilino to specify what Brown did that contributed to the job losses. In an email exchange, he mentioned ongoing controversies over the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions; over the National Labor Relation Board’s power to tell a company whether it may open a factory in South Carolina if it believes the location was chosen to bypass unions in another state, and over efforts to change labor laws in a way that would make it easier for unions to increase membership. Brown also supports raising taxes on millionaires. Aquilino said entrepreneurs fear that each of these will damage the business climate or hamper their ability to grow and hire. Brown has refused to join Republicans in pushing back against these measures. We have little doubt that these fears are real. Business owners and managers have told as as much. But for the most part, these are prospective fears. While fear about the direction ahead may drive the election, Aquilino’s claim here relies on job losses as far as 10 years back. Aquilino had more on his list: Brown voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, casting what many consider to be the single vote that enabled the stimulus bill to pass. Republicans said it has washed $1 billion down the drain, but many economists say it helped pull the country out of a tailspin. Whether it was properly focused or partially wasted or could have achieved more is what’s still hotly debated. Brown also voted to revamp the nation’s health insurance laws, which Republicans say will create another drag on the economy. Although portions of it are already in place, the law’s main features won’t kick in until 2014. Brown has voted against free trade deals consistently, saying they lead to higher unemployment, but he has been on the losing side. While Republicans say positions like Brown’s slowed passage and stood in the way of growth, the most far-reaching trade bills were Clinton-era deals for trade with China and Mexico. They passed despite Brown -- and during a time frame preceding the job losses mentioned in the Mandel news release. Republicans have other raps against Brown: He backed the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, which required more stringent consumer financial regulation. Some businesses see these measures as creating bureaucracies that will stand in the way of hiring. So Brown has caused these job losses, yes? No, says Amy Hanauer, executive director of Policy Matters Ohio. It might seem odd to ask the head of a liberal think tank to comment on criticisms made by a conservative opponent of a liberal senator. But the Mandel campaign credited Policy Matters, of all organizations, with pointing out Ohio’s big job losses. What does Hanauer think? "I think the Ohio job loss is primarily due to the recession, which in turn is attributable to the housing bust, brought on by excessive deregulation," she said in an e-mail. "I think if we'd had more regulation of the financial sector we'd be in much better shape. In general, I'd view Sherrod Brown as appreciating the role of regulation in helping markets function better. Secondly, job loss in Ohio, particularly in manufacturing, stems from more reliance on trade with China and other low-wage countries. Here, Senator Brown is clearly among the strongest voices for a different approach." We are not taking Hanauer’s side, nor are we taking Aquilino’s. The blame game requires deeper analysis. For example, of the 10 years measured, Brown spent six and a half of them in the U.S. House of Representatives. It was under Republican control that entire time, with Dennis Hastert as House speaker. Brown and his fellow House Democrats simply lacked the power to pass anything the GOP didn’t want.. That changed in 2007, when Brown joined the Senate. That chamber’s Democratic majority has since taken the actions listed above. And if elections are about the future, voters will have their say in 2012 as to whether they think Brown or Mandel will offer a brighter one. That leaves us here: Aquilino’s claim on job losses over 10 years is pretty accurate, given the above-mentioned caveats. But he links 10 years’ worth of hurt to a lawmaker who spent more than half that time in the minority party, and that’s where the claim overreaches. BLS data shows that Ohio lost 190,900 of those jobs cited by Aquilino when Brown was a Democrat in a Republican Congress, affording him almost no power. Aquilino backs up the claim by listing recent laws or policies supported by Brown in the Senate. Yet the effects of most of those policies, whether negative or positive, are yet to come. The claim, while mostly accurate on the aggregate job losses, leaves out a considerable amount of information -- veering in large part toward inaccurate -- when saying Brown owns these horrendous numbers. That renders the claim in its entirety Half True.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2011-10-24T06:00:00	2011-09-28	['Ohio', 'United_States', 'Washington,_D.C.']
pomt-09894	The Obama administration has spent millions of taxpayer dollars for roadside signs to tout the economic stimulus.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/17/robert-bennett/bennett-says-stimulus-spending-too-much-road-signs/	Critics of the $787 billion economic stimulus package are up in arms about a particularly visible reminder of the legislation: roadway signs that are sprouting up across the nation, touting construction projects funded by the bill. In June, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., included the signs as an example of questionable spending in his report, “100 Stimulus Projects: A Second Opinion.” In July, Rep. Chris Lee, R-N.Y., issued a statement saying that the signs are “just the most recent in a series of examples demonstrating how dollars from the stimulus are being wasted or misspent.” Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin, mocking the red, blue and green logo of the stimulus, has gone so far as to label the signs “stimulus hype propaganda sporting the mark of the porkulus beast." Democrats, such as Rep. Dan Maffei of New York, have even joined the chorus of critics. On July 15, 2009, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, and Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., took aim at stimulus-touting signs with an amendment that “would prohibit the use of stimulus funds to pay for signage promoting the administration's spending of taxpayer dollars on (stimulus) projects.” (The amendment has not yet been taken up by the Senate.) In a statement announcing the amendment, Sen. Bennett asserted that “the administration is wasting millions of taxpayer dollars on a PR campaign.” We’ll leave it to others to decide whether spending stimulus money on roadside signs is worthwhile. Instead, we’ll look at whether the senator’s assertion is accurate. This requires breaking his statement into two parts. The first portion of Bennett’s statement — his assumption that “the administration” is the primary actor in the signage drama — isn’t entirely correct. It’s true that the federal government is providing the stimulus money for these highway construction projects. It’s also true that the U.S. Department of Transportation has issued three versions of guidance on stimulus-related signs, saying that states are “strongly encouraged” to post the signs. But the department did not make the signs mandatory, and news reports indicate that Texas, Florida and Virginia have opted not to post the signs. Indeed, the feds have delegated most of the responsibility for carrying out stimulus efforts to the states, from choosing the projects to negotiating the contracts. If states want to put stimulus money to uses other than signs, they may do so. The other portion of Bennett’s assertion has to do with whether “millions” of dollars are being spent on these signs. That number is not easy to nail down. Stimulus spending is decentralized and the states have broad discretion; there’s also no specific budget line for signs. No one — including the U.S. Transportation Department — knows for sure how much is being spent on these signs. So we did some calculations to create our own estimate. We found that it's possible that spending on stimulus signs has reached into the millions, but it’s no certainty. One of the challenges in making this determination is the large variation in the cost of a sign. In July, the Associated Press reported that Michigan estimated a sign costs $400 to $500. Illinois officials suggested $300 for the sign and an additional $700 when labor is included, while Colorado officials said materials plus labor would run between $750 and $1,200 per sign. Other estimates ran the gamut. The Tennessean newspaper reported that the cost in its state was $38 per sign from one vendor and $55.16 from another. In New York state, the estimates have been far pricier. The Syracuse Post-Standard reported that published engineering instructions had the largest signs running between $6,000 and $8,300, with smaller versions costing $3,600 to $4,800 and the smallest sizes costing $1,600 to $2,100. After a spate of bad publicity over those numbers, the state Department of Transportation first lowered its costs, according to a spokesman, and then on July 17, 2009, issued an engineering directive suspending the installation of the signs altogether, pending further advice from the U.S. DOT. Meanwhile, in his statement, Bennett himself cited figures of $1,700 per sign in Georgia, $2,000 per sign in Pennsylvania and $3,000 per project in New Jersey. He did not provide sourcing and his office did not return a call and an e-mail. So, excluding the now-dated New York prices, the cost of a single sign ranged from $38 to $2,000, or perhaps $3,000 on the extreme. According to the U.S. DOT, there were 1,995 stimulus-funded highway projects that had “notices to proceed” as of July 10. Many, but likely not all, of these were far enough along to be ready to host a sign, according to DOT. The actual number of signs posted so far is probably lower than that, DOT added, once you eliminate the states that aren’t posting signs at all and the sites that do not yet have signs erected. So, whether stimulus signage is costing “millions,” as Bennett suggests, depends heavily on what you assume to be the prevailing national price of making and posting a sign. Assuming one sign per project and an average installation cost of $1,000 — and without reducing the total number of sites lower than the full 1,995 — the total would be just under $2 million spent for signs, which is the bare minimum for Bennett to be accurate in saying “millions.” Any lower cost per sign would mean that the senator was exaggerating. So let's read the signs for the Truth-O-Meter. The first part of his statement is a stretch because the federal government doesn't actually mandate the signs and some states have opted out. But it's clear the feds are encouraging the signs. The second part of his statement appears to be just in the ballpark based on an average cost of $1,000, but it's an exaggeration if the cost is lower. Add it up and we've got a Half True.

pomt-15061	A "voucher school that closed after 9 days this year collected $5.4 million in taxpayer subsidies since first opening."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/25/jennifer-shilling/sen-jennifer-shilling-says-closed-voucher-school-r/	Less than two weeks into the 2015-16 school year, Milwaukee voucher school Daughters of the Father Christian Academy closed its doors, sending the families of about 150 kids on a scramble to find a new school. In the wake of the closing -- triggered by a state Department of Public Instruction order questioning the qualifications of school administrators -- Democratic opponents of vouchers cited it as evidence that the program needed better oversight. Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse) tweeted: "GOP voucher school that closed after 9 days this year collected $5.4 million in taxpayer subsidies since first opening." Is she right? About the program Voucher schools are private schools, usually religiously affiliated, that receive taxpayer dollars to pay for the tuition of lower-income students. As part of the 2015-’17 state budget, the Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Scott Walker raised the limit on how many students statewide can participate in the program. The program, which began in Milwaukee, had been extended statewide two years earlier. About 26,900 Milwaukee students are enrolled in voucher schools, according to the Department of Public Instruction and the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. In addition, there are about 1,700 students in Racine and 1,000 statewide who were part of the program in the 2014-15 school year. The Milwaukee program cost about $191 million. Other schools statewide cost an additional $22 million Supporters say voucher schools give parents a valuable choice of where to send their children, particularly where local public schools may be low-performing. Critics say the voucher program is a drain on public school budgets and the private schools do not always adhere to the same educational standards. What about Daughters of the Father? Shilling’s claim seems pretty straightforward. But her tweet can read as saying the school had received the money and then quickly closed. In other words, that the school was new and the $5.4 million was immediately lost to taxpayers. But that’s not exactly what happened. Daughters of the Father first opened its doors in 2007-08 and had just begun its ninth year. Records show it had 153 students in 2014-15 and through the state’s voucher program received about $7,200 that year for each student. That tallies out to more than $1.1 million. The school ran into financial trouble that led to canceled bus service at the end of the school year. In a May 14, 2015 press release executive director Doris Pinkley blamed lower-than-expected enrollment. After a change in the school’s leadership, the state Department of Public Instruction determined the school had failed to comply with statutory and administrative rules governing participation in the voucher program. The department issued an order Aug. 4, 2015 banning the school from participating in the voucher program because the school did not have a qualified administrator on staff. The principal had only an expired substitute teacher's license. The $5.4 million represents the total the school has received since its inception. In all, the state has terminated 57 schools from the voucher program since the 2003-04 academic year, although some of them were schools that ceased operating on their own. Those schools had been paid a total of $176 million. Our rating Shilling tweeted that the Daughters of the Father Christian Academy "closed after 9 days this year collected $5.4 million in taxpayer subsidies since first opening." The school did not just open its doors, receive $5.4 million and quickly close. The school had operated for eight years. The money represents the amount received since it opened.

pomt-08815	"We could cut unemployment in half simply by reclaiming the jobs taken by illegal workers."	false	/texas/statements/2010/aug/15/lamar-smith/us-rep-lamar-smith-says-united-states-could-cut-un/	Woe is unemployment. And undocumented workers aren't helping the sorry jobless rate — 9.5 percent in July — according to U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, the co-chairman of the Reclaim American Jobs Caucus. "Illegal immigration and unemployment are directly linked," Smith said on the House floor July 1. "There are 15 million unemployed Americans in the United States and 8 million illegal immigrants in the labor force. We could cut unemployment in half simply by reclaiming the jobs taken by illegal workers." Lainey Melnick, the Democratic nominee for Smith's seat, brought the statement to our attention. We wondered if Smith's claim was true. Smith later said his assessment reflects "simple logic." "If our immigration laws were enforced, illegal immigrants will not be able to get or hold jobs," he told us in an e-mail, "and they would be available for citizens and legal immigrants." Smith didn't offer studies backing up his conclusion that reclaiming those jobs could cut unemployment in half. But, he told us, in case after case, following a raid, citizens and legal immigrants line up for jobs vacated by illegal immigrants. We wanted to know more about those cases. He pointed to a Sept. 15, 2009, USA Today article citing a report by the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group critical of illegal immigration. The center looked at six meatpacking plants owned by Swift & Co., where federal agents arrested nearly 1,300 illegal workers in December 2006. Those workers accounted for 10 percent of the plants' labor force. The center's study concluded the raids didn't cripple the company or the plants, which within months had full staffs of legal U.S. residents as workers. However, Jessica Vaughan, the center's director of policy studies, told us she doesn't know of any studies — including the center's study — that substantiate Smith's claim. "I am not aware of any studies that would support his claim if it was taken literally... but we have found that immigration law enforcement targeting the workplace does have a beneficial effect on employment opportunities for legal workers." "The general idea is right, but in practice it's not that simple," she said. Why? "Because in real life there might not be a legal worker in the same place to immediately replace the illegal workers. However, over time many of the vacancies in such a scenario would be filled by legal workers, perhaps even at a higher rate of pay, or some of the jobs might just fade away as employers decide on mechanization or some other way to get by." Separately, we hunted for data relevant to Smith's statement. Back in December, we rated Mostly True Smith's claim that illegal immigrants now hold 8 million U.S. jobs. Smith was citing a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, Jeffrey Passel, who estimated, relying primarily on U.S. census data, that 7.8 million undocumented residents worked here as of March 2008. When we reached him this month, Passel said the number of workers who are illegal immigrants probably amounted to about 7 million as of late because the unemployment rate among undocumented workers "has gone way up." At the same time, there were about 14.6 million unemployed legal residents as of July, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. So there's at least one clear-cut way to conclude, as Smith does, that if the undocumented workers were barred, half the nation's unemployed legal residents could fill resulting vacancies. Then again, that presumes that every unemployed American would leap for the newly available jobs — and that those jobs would still be available when an undocumented, potentially underpaid worker couldn't fill them. Most experts raised doubts. Jack Martin, special projects director at the conservative-leaning Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), said "there would not necessarily be an immediate one-to-one replacement of illegal (workers) by legal workers, but we assume that would largely occur over time." Yet Martin noted complications, telling us that of the nation's undocumented workers, about half are paid under the table, according to a 2003 study by the centrist-to-liberal Urban Institute. In a nutshell: employers can pay these workers less than minimum wage because as illegal residents, they're less likely to land well-paying jobs. He said FAIR "assumes that virtually all" on-the-books' jobs could be filled by unemployed legal workers. Martin elaborated: "Jobs in the underground economy, on the other hand, sometimes are exploitative jobs — like (jobs in) sweatshops — and exist only because of the presence of the (illegal workers) ... We do not have an estimate of how many of those 4 million jobs might disappear rather than offering the wages and working conditions necessary to attract a legal work force." James Sherk, a policy analyst in labor economics at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation, said "economic research does not back up" Smith's claim. Giovanni Peri, an associate professor in economics at the University of California, Davis, said that "if you look at any sort of long-term data, there is no association whatsoever between American unemployment rates and undocumented workers," as opposed to a direct link, like Smith says. We found limited research on what would happen if we could suddenly reclaim all U.S. jobs held by undocumented workers, though in 2006, then-state Comptroller Carole Keeton Strayhorn analyzed the impact of undocumented immigrants on Texas' budget and economy. That report cautions that "calculating the impact of undocumented immigrants on the Texas economy and state budget is at best an educated guess... It is difficult to count a population that does not want to be counted, particularly when the law allows them access to to many government services without regard to citizenship, such as those delivered by public hospitals and public schools." Still, the study assesses the possible economic impact of removing the estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants in Texas as of 2005. Pew estimated the U.S. had 11.1 million undocumented immigrants in 2005, with between 1.4 and 1.6 million living in Texas. Wages for the remaining legal workers would increase by 0.6 percent in the first year, the study says, and stay above an estimated wage baseline through 2025. However, "while pay increases can be viewed as positive social and economic development, when they rise due to labor shortages they affect economic competitiveness," the report says. "In this case, it would be expressed as a modest decline in the value of Texas' exports." Using an economic model, Strayhorn estimated that overall employment would decline 2.3 percent, and "employment would remain 2 percent below the baseline forecast 20 years later. The impact lessens over time, but remains sizable throughout the 20-year forecast period." The study doesn't say how many of those 1.4 millions jobs would be filled by remaining residents. In December 2008, the Perryman Group, a Waco-based economic research firm, prepared an analysis of the economic impact of undocumented workers on business activity for Americans for Immigration Reform, a Houston group founded by "Americans concerned with the destructive measures being taken and considered regarding immigration and its impact on the business community, employees and consumers." Upshot: Eliminating the undocumented workforce would result in an immediate loss of 8.1 million jobs, according to the report, and a total eventual loss of 2.8 million jobs after the market has had time to adjust. "If all undocumented workers were removed from the workforce, a number of industries would face substantial shortages of workers, and Americans would have to be induced into the labor pool or provided incentives to take jobs far below their current education and skill levels," according to the report. "For this phenomenon to occur to a meaningful extent, substantial wage escalation would be necessary." Ray Perryman, the economist behind the Perryman Group, told us that skill level is a key factor. "A lot of the unemployed people right now are highly skilled professionals, and would have no experience with these primarly manual labor-type jobs that the undocumented workers perform," he said. Plus, he said, the demand for jobs that undocumented workers often hold, like construction and hospitality gigs, is low thanks to the recession. Perryman said he has "never seen an academic study that would support" Smith's claim. We found more studies that showed how undocumented workers affect employment, as opposed to unemployment. Summing them up: immigrants don't exacerbate unemployment. This May, FactCheck.org, a nonpartisan fact-checking project at the Annenberg Public Policy Center in Pennsylvania, looked into whether legal and illegal immigration deprives Americans of jobs. Citing experts, it said that "study after study has shown that immigrants grow the economy, expanding demand for goods and services that the foreign-born workers and their families consume, and thereby creating jobs. There is even broad agreement among economists that while immigrants may push down wages for some, the overall effect is to increase wages for American-born workers." What's more, experts told us that if all illegal workers vanished, there almost certainly wouldn't be a one-to-one replacement of the workers with legal residents because many of those jobs wouldn't appeal to legal workers or unemployed workers might not live near the newly available jobs. In its 2009 report on the Swift Raids, the Center for Immigration Studies cited the Congressional Research Service, which outlined factors explaining why illegal immigrants fill jobs that legal workers generally find objectionable: "Some have argued that work involving 'blood, unpleasant odors and repetitive tasks, is not attractive' to U.S. workers. But other factors including low wages, high line speeds, little job security, rural-sited facilities, and diminished union protection may also make domestic recruitment difficult." Where does all this leave us? Smith offered no studies backing up his statement, while we found two studies that found that employment would actually decline if undocumented workers were suddenly deported. Meantime, for various reasons experts across the spectrum said it's not believable that unemployment would halve should illegal workers vanish. Smith's simple logic is too simplistic. We rate his statement as False.	None	Lamar Smith	None	None	None	2010-08-15T06:00:00	2010-07-01	['None']

pomt-07572	The "House-passed budget proposal could cut funding for programs that help keep local neighborhoods safe, slash more than $1.7 million in anti-terror funds for Ohio."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/30/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-cuts-proposed-house-gop-cou/	The House of Representatives passed a bill in February that would keep the United States government operating through this fiscal year while making a small dent in the federal debt. Democrats say it's a bad bill that slashes important programs; Republicans say the cuts are necessary. We're not going to pick apart the bill’s merits or shortcomings. PolitiFact Ohio was interested in claims about the bill’s impact made on March 7 by Sen. Sherrod Brown and seconded by Cleveland's mayor, Frank Jackson. Brown and Jackson, in a news release and at a news conference with public safety officials in Cleveland, said the spending cuts could harm public safety and security in Cleveland and across Ohio. Specifically, they spoke of cuts to grants that would affect local law enforcement. "House-passed budget proposal could cut funding for programs that help keep local neighborhoods safe, slash more than $1.7 Million in anti-terror funds for Ohio," read a headline on Brown's news release. This made us wonder: These cuts would be in grant programs. Many federal grants are awarded competitively, making it impossible for any city to count on getting one every single year. So how could Brown and the city of Cleveland consider the end of a grant to be a "cut?" Put it another way: If you get a bonus sometimes but not every year, can you really say your pay was cut in the years you didn’t get one? In Brown's case, the answer turns out to be yes. Two of three programs he mentioned are funded by a narrow category of safety grants that Cleveland and Ohio have been guaranteed to get historically. These are what Brown was refering to as "programs that keep local neighborhoods safe." As for the other program and potential cuts, Brown worded his concern cautiously and accurately. Let's take a look. Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS grants This Justice Department program for keeping neighborhoods safe is competitive. The program helps police departments get federal money to hire and train officers. But it has a stipulation: Cities must pick up the officers' salaries when their grants end. Critics question whether the program is effective. The House was poised to eliminate COPS, but ended up retaining money for officer hiring and training. But the House bill would eliminate other programs under the COPS umbrella, such as those that have helped departments pay for technology and another that helps local police fight methamphetamine distribution. These latter two "could be eliminated entirely," Brown said. Brown was accurate by saying "could." And while some news reports left the mistaken impression that Cleveland patrol officers hired with COPS dollars are now at risk -- a fallacy that first caught our attention and prompted this very PolitiFact -- we see no evidence that Brown made that specific linkage. Byrne Justice Assistance Grants Cleveland has used the money from these grants for regional police dispatching, crime analysis, and task forces to combat violent crime and drugs. Ohio "could" lose more than $4.4 million under House budget cuts, Brown said. The Byrne grants are largely based on a formula that factors in population and crime levels, according to information provided to us by Michelle Person, a spokeswoman in the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs. It is clear from the formula that if the funding for the federal program remained level, Ohio would still qualify. Brown was correct when referring to a possible "loss." As for quantifying it at $4.4 million, Brown's office referred us to a state-by-state analysis by the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, a liberal group that frequently examines the effect of spending cuts. The center's analysis was based on an estimate that the Byrne grants will be cut by about 29 percent. It is impossible to know the precise scope of Byrne cuts, if they occur, because they are part of a larger Justice Department grant pool that would be trimmed; it is unclear whether all grants would be cut equally. Yet the 29 percent estimate is consistent with other estimates, and "it certainly is assumed that Byrne would take its fair share" among other programs, said Elizabeth Pyke, director of government affairs at the National Criminal Justice Association, which represents cities and states. The COPS program and Byrne Justice Assistance grants are the two programs that Cleveland and Ohio historically have been guaranteed to get and both can impact policing in neighborhoods. Urban Areas Security Initiative grants The Department of Homeland Security gives these grants to help metropolitan areas plan for potential terrorist attacks and mass emergencies. Ohio could "stand to lose more than $1.7 million" if these grants were cut, and "Cleveland alone could lose more than $500,000," Brown said in his news release. These grants are awarded through a formula that factors in each metro area's population and its potential for a terrorist strike or mass emergency. Sixty-three metro areas now get funding, according to the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that believes that the program has expanded too far. The House spending bill would cut the amount of money available to the whole program, and Brown based his figures on a calculation of how that would affect Ohio’s portion, said Meghan Dubyak, Brown’s communications director. However, under an amendment to the House spending bill, only the top 25 metro areas -- measured by their perceived level of threat and related factors -- would qualify for money. No Ohio cities are currently in the top 25, so the loss to Ohio under this circumstance would be higher than Brown calculated. Brown was correct, then, that Cleveland "could" lose "more than" $500,000. All of his claims were based on a House bill that the Senate is expected to change. But the House bill sets the stage for whatever happens next; for now, at least, it is the bill the Senate must work with. And Brown was careful to say it "could," not "would" when discussing all the proposed cuts. We rate his claims as True.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2011-03-30T06:00:00	2011-03-07	['Ohio']

pomt-03602	A Wisconsin bill to limit use of food stamps for junk food would also "prevent -- or limit -- the extent to which" food stamps could be used for organic foods.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/10/fred-clark/wisconsin-bill-limit-junk-food-also-would-restrict/	State Rep. Dean Kaufert said he was after things like soda and nachos when he proposed to limit how much junk food Wisconsinites could buy with food stamps. "Hopefully, people’s health will get better," the Neenah Republican said in March 2013. But when the former potato chip salesman’s bill came up May 7, 2013, for a vote, there were signs of indigestion on the Assembly floor in Madison. "The list of foods that you'd be restricted from buying under this is -- I don't know who came up with it. I think it's kind of shocking," complained Rep. Fred Clark, D-Baraboo. Clark continued by saying "we're going to prevent -- or limit -- the extent to which" food stamps could be used for a long list of foods -- including organic foods. Sure, sugary drinks and melty cheese might sometimes addle our brains. But organic foods are supposed to be better for you, right? So, is Clark correct -- would the junk food bill, approved by the Assembly minutes after his comments, prevent or limit the use of food stamps for organic foods? The program The food stamps program, known formally as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal funds pay for all of the benefits, although the states share the administrative costs with Uncle Sam. Food stamps -- actually, it’s a plastic card you can swipe electronically at the store -- are available to working and non-working people who have a low income. The benefits can generally be used to buy any food or food product, but hot foods cooked in the store, as well as alcoholic beverages, tobacco and pet food, are prohibited. In Wisconsin, the program is called FoodShare. It serves more than 850,000 adults and children, or 15 percent of the state’s residents, at a cost of more than $1 billion per year. Junk-food bill To take effect, Kaufert’s bill would need approval not only from the state Senate and Gov. Scott Walker but also the federal government. That's unlikely (for Wisconsin and South Carolina, which is considering a similar measure), Governing magazine suggests, given the USDA has denied every request like Kaufert’s that's been submitted for a federal "waiver." But let’s get the bill out on the table, anyway. Kaufert’s measure does not define junk food; rather, it would require FoodShare recipients to spend at least two-thirds of their benefits on a list of foods deemed by the state as healthy. The healthy foods list would have two components. It begins with a roster of foods approved by another federal-state food program -- Women, Infants and Children (WIC); then the bill adds some other food types, as well. So, where does that leave organic foods? Well, since the bill wouldn’t make any changes for one-third of a FoodShare recipient’s benefits, they could be used to buy anything from Funyuns to organic specialty onions. A recipient wouldn’t be prevented from spending all of the one-third on organic foods. But for the two-thirds portion of a person’s FoodShare benefits, there would be limits. The bill explicitly says fresh produce, including white potatoes, as well as beef, pork, chicken, and fish, would be on the healthy foods list. So, using the two-thirds to buy organic versions of those foods would be OK, unless the state at some point specifically prohibited them, according to the Legislative Reference Bureau. On the other hand, WIC benefits can’t be used for organic versions of some foods -- such as milk, cereal, bread and canned or dried peas, beans and lentils. (The government wants to encourage cheaper alternatives to stretch the money beneficiaries receive, according to the state Department of Health Services). Likewise, that means a person on FoodShare couldn’t use the two-thirds portion of their benefits toward those organics, if Kaufert's bill takes effect. Got it? FoodShare recipients could still use one-third of their benefits on any kind of organic food (or junk food, for that matter). But they could use the two-thirds portion only for some kinds of organics. Our rating Clark said a bill to limit use of food stamps for junk food would also "prevent -- or limit -- the extent to which" food stamps could be used for organic foods. There would be limits on which types of organic foods a person could buy with two-thirds of their food stamps, but not for the other third. The meat-and-potatoes portion of Clark's statement is accurate, but it needs a garnish or two of clarification -- our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-12816	Says Secretary of State Rex Tillerson got a "government service golden parachute" payment of $180 million "from Exxon Mobil that he would have to forfeit had he taken a job elsewhere."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/10/tammy-baldwin/secretary-state-rex-tillersons-180-million-exxon-g/	In moving from CEO of Exxon Mobil to Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson is getting $180 million from his former company. But is the payment a "government service golden parachute" that Tillerson would not get had he taken a different job? That’s the allegation from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who has railed against people who cash in by moving from the private sector into government jobs. Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat who faces re-election in 2018, made her attack on the Senate floor on Jan. 31, 2017, the day before Tillerson was sworn in as President Donald Trump’s secretary of state. Baldwin referred to President Barack Obama’s administration and a bill she said was aimed at "slowing the revolving door" in Washington, then said: "I was inspired to introduce this legislation when I saw several Obama administration appointees receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for leaving their private-sector jobs to join the government. These ‘government service golden parachutes,’ as they are known, demonstrate how valuable some companies believe it is to have friends in high places." Tillerson, she continued, "received a $180 million payout from Exxon Mobil that he would have to forfeit had he taken a job elsewhere." What we found is that Baldwin is right on the figure. But the payment is a retirement benefit that Tillerson earned after more than 40 years with the company, not extra compensation conditioned on joining the government a few months before reaching the company’s mandatory retirement age. Indeed, experts told us, he likely only risked losing the $180 million had he gone to work for an Exxon Mobil competitor. The money -- yes There was no government requirement, PolitiFact New York found, for Tillerson to divest from his Exxon Mobil stock. But had he kept the stock, he would have had to recuse himself of any State Department business related to the company, or take other steps to avoid a conflict of interest. An agreement he made with Exxon Mobil -- the one that drew Baldwin’s attack -- is aimed at avoiding the conflict of interest. The Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles Times, The Guardian and other news organizations reported on an announcement of the agreement, as well as a filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission that Exxon Mobil made on Jan. 4, 2017. That was a few days after Tillerson’s retirement and a week before his Senate confirmation hearing. Tillerson had been set to receive roughly $180 million in Exxon Mobil shares that would have vested over a decade following his retirement, which was expected to be in March 2017, when he turns 65. Instead, Exxon essentially "cashed out" Tillerson. Under the agreement, the shares were transferred to an independently managed trust, which will pay Tillerson the $180 million over the same 10-year schedule. The deal amounts to about $7 million less than the compensation package that he would have received if he had not been tapped for the post, the Wall Street Journal noted. ‘Golden parachute’ -- no Now let’s turn to Baldwin’s larger point -- that the payment is a "government service golden parachute" Tillerson would not get if "had he taken a job elsewhere." Baldwin’s office sent us information, but no one replied to our requests to speak to someone in the office. The office suggested we contact Jeff Hauser, who is executive director of the Revolving Door Project at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C.. Hauser argued that Exxon Mobil gave "special dispensation" to Tillerson by cashing him out on the stock that otherwise would have taken 10 years to vest. He noted that the company’s policy states that executives risk losing long-term equity awards by retiring early. But the policy also allows for the company to decide that the executive can keep the awards, which is what it did in making the $180 million agreement. Rosanna Landis Weaver, executive compensation project manager for Oakland, Calif.-based As You Sow, a national group that advocates for shareholders, also criticized Exxon Mobil for not sticking to its usual practice of long-term vesting. She told us she expects the cash payout to the trust, rather than receiving the stock over time, will benefit Tillerson financially, though she acknowledged that’s an open question. But Baldwin’s statement isn’t about the impact of Tillerson’s deal on Exxon Mobil stockholders and the $180 million doesn’t come as a result of Tillerson taking the secretary of state job. "It doesn't appear to be a reward specifically for going into government service, but rather a standard agreement in which he gets the payout as long as he does not work in the (oil) industry for 10 years," said Ari Goldberg, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Project On Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog. A "golden parachute" typically refers to severance payments executives get after their companies are acquired or made part of a merger. Indeed, the federal tax code refers to parachute payments as compensation paid as a result of a change in control of a company. But the payment Tillerson is getting isn’t something extra. It’s a retirement benefit he had earned. "Tillerson is clearly getting a large cash settlement, but this reflects payments for services earned over the prior many years, and not a cash reward or ‘parachute’ tied to his resignation," said executive compensation expert Kevin Murphy, a finance and business economics professor at the University of Southern California. We’ll note that Baldwin used the lesser known term "government service golden parachute." But that typically is used by groups such as the AFL-CIO union in reference to Wall Street. It refers to financial incentives Wall Street firms give to senior executives who take government jobs. The concern is whether the companies then expect favorable government treatment from their former executives. Others refer to government-based golden parachutes provided by Wall Street banks as accelerated vesting of equity-based awards for senior executives who resign voluntarily to enter government service -- in other words, compensation that they would otherwise forfeit for failing to meet normal vesting requirements. That’s more similar to Tillerson’s situation. But Murphy and another executive compensation expert Steven Balsam, told us it’s highly unlikely that Tillerson would have lost out on his retirement benefits, a few months before reaching the mandatory retirement age, simply by taking another job -- unless it was with an Exxon Mobil competitor. "This terms of his retirement/separation were agreed upon prior to his being nominated to be secretary of state. He’s not getting it because he took the (secretary of state) job," said Balsam, a business professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. Our rating Baldwin says Tillerson got a "government service golden parachute" payment of $180 million "from Exxon Mobil that he would have to forfeit had he taken a job elsewhere." The amount is correct and the company did opt to "cash out" Tillerson because he would be becoming secretary of state. But on Baldwin's larger point, it’s an earned retirement benefit, not newly added compensation and not something created simply because Tillerson took a government post. He would almost certainly have been in line to receive it even if he had taken a different job, as long as it wasn’t with an Exxon Mobil competitor. For a statement that has an element of truth but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-03037	Any state tax law has to start in the House and the renewal of the state hospital bed tax this year started in the Senate, which is unconstitutional.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/oct/09/david-pennington/deals-rival-says-bed-tax-renewal-flawed/	Dalton Mayor David Pennington is one of the well-known candidates challenging incumbent Nathan Deal for governor. Pennington, along with fellow GOP challenger and State School Superintendent John Barge, have been traveling the state getting out their campaign messages. For Pennington, that message is limited government and limited spending. During one recent campaign stop in the city of Carrollton, before the Carroll County Tea Party, Pennington sought to distinguish himself from Deal by noting some of what he perceived as the governor’s missteps. One example was the extension of the hospital bed tax, legislation pushed by Deal and approved by the General Assembly earlier this year. By shifting the fee collection to an unelected health board, lawmakers subverted the law that governs how tax bills are passed, Pennington said. "This is clearly unconstitutional," Pennington said during the meeting, which was reported by the Times-Georgian. "Any tax law has to start in the House and this one was started in the Senate." Was this levy extension a violation of the law and we missed it? We wanted to determine whether Pennington was correct in his assessment, so we did some research. We asked Pennington about his source for the claim. The mayor said he relied on an article by longtime Capitol reporter Tom Crawford and confirmation of his claims by several legislators who also criticized the bill and process for getting it passed. "The constitution is clear that any tax has to come from the Legislature, but they passed that (responsibility) on to another department," Pennington told us. Since 2010, hospitals have paid a Medicaid provider fee, a 1.45 percent tax on their total patient revenue, which was used to attract federal matching funds for Medicaid. The fee, also known as a "bed tax," was set to expire June 30. The "bed tax" had traditionally been imposed by the General Assembly. The measure passed this year, which began as a Senate bill, would transfer that duty to the board of the Department of Community Health, and extend the fee another four years. Critics said it was an end run to keep lawmakers from having to vote on what they deemed a tax measure. Tracking the bill’s history through the Georgia General Assembly records shows that the legislation did begin in the Senate, where it was introduced on Jan. 14, the first day of the session. Two days later, a Senate committee approved the bill, and the following day, the full chamber passed the bill. It was signed into law a month later. Some lawmakers questioned the constitutionality of the Senate’s actions. By starting the bill in the Senate instead of in the House, "you’re inviting a lawsuit where it can be overturned," Senate Minority Leader Steve Henson, D-Tucker, said at the time. Georgia law requires that "all bills for raising revenue, or appropriating money, shall originate in the House of Representatives." But because the fee would be collected by a board and not by state tax collectors, supporters said the measure did not have to follow the procedure required for tax bills. And why didn’t the criticism get more publicity? Because the lawmakers who were the critics were Democrats, the minority in the Legislature, so they really didn’t have a say in the matter, reporter Tom Crawford told us. Also, the General Assembly’s lawyers said the path through the Senate was acceptable. "From a strict legal perspective the bill does not require that the (community health) department impose any fee but rather gives the department complete discretion as to whether or not to assess a fee," said the Legislative Counsel opinion, issued Jan. 13. "... because the bill only authorizes the imposition of a fee, but does not actually impose a fee, the bill would not be considered a revenue bill" and would not have to originate in the House. Thus far, there have been no challenges to the bills, Henson said. And a favorable ruling in the matter would be difficult based on state law. In other court challenges, the Georgia Supreme Court has held that if an act has been passed by both houses of the Legislature, signed by the governor and recorded, the court has determined that the act was passed in a constitutional manner. So is Pennington correct in his assessment of the hospital "bed tax" extension passed during the most recent legislative session? Pennington said the hospital "bed tax" extension bill was a tax bill and should have started in the House, instead of the Senate as it did. The mayor and gubernatorial candidate is correct that tax laws must begin in the House of Representatives. But because the bill called for a state agency -- and not lawmakers -- to levy the fee, a legislative law opinion deemed the approval process acceptable. Also, challenges to the bill’s constitutionality would be difficult because the Georgia Supreme Court has not overturned legislation that has been duly passed by both houses and signed into law. Pennington and others may not agree with the process, or how the hospital levy is classified, but the law appears not to be on their side. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-08611	Marco Rubio "opposes extending unemployment benefits."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/sep/22/afl-cio/union-attacks-marco-rubio-over-unemployment-benefi/	The AFL-CIO is targeting Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio in a new mailer that calls him anti-worker. The issue: Rubio's supposed opposition to extending unemployment benefits for out-of-work Americans. "How do we know Marco Rubio is a bad choice for workers?" asks the mailer, which began circulating Sept. 20, 2010. "His anti-union voting record says it all. Our jobless rate is almost 12%, but Rubio still opposes extending unemployment benefits to the workers who need it most right now." Does the AFL-CIO detail Rubio's position correctly? First, a little background: When workers lose full-time work through no fault of their own, they are usually eligible for unemployment benefits, small weekly payments intended to partially make up for lost wages. Employers pay taxes to fund the program, and states administer it based on federal guidelines. How much a person gets and how long benefits are paid varies by state. Usually, the benefits last about six months. In tough times, though, Congress often extends benefits, because of the difficulty of finding new jobs when unemployment is very high, as it has been since 2008, when the economy floundered. As a result, Congress has been arguing this summer about extending benefits again after extending them five times since Obama took office in 2009. Recent extensions have been structured so that workers in states where unemployment is higher receive additional weeks of benefits. In the states where unemployment is highest, some unemployed workers have been paid benefits for close to two years. This summer, Republicans in the House and Senate balked at extending jobless benefits to about 3 million Americans without first finding a way to offset the $34 billion cost. Republicans proposed to pay for the extension with unspent funds from the 2009 economic stimulus package. Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky even offered a specific proposal to extend benefits for two months while cutting the deficit $1.7 billion, he said. How? By adjusting Medicaid payments, trimming stimulus-funded food stamps in 2014, cutting $600 million in stimulus-supported programs to expand broadband Internet access and eliminating a provision letting qualified residents receive their earned-income tax credit throughout the year instead of at the end of the tax filing season. Democrats rejected McConnell's proposal, saying that the stimulus money would be needed elsewhere to boost job growth. They also accused Republicans of playing political games and noted correctly that emergency extensions typically never include cost offsets. The Senate passed the extension on July 21, without cost offsets, by a vote of 59-39. Maine Republicans Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins joined all but one Democrat, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, in supporting the extension without a way to pay for it. The House passed the benefits extension the next day 275-152. Six Florida Republicans supported the extension in the House -- Gus Bilirakis, C.W. Bill Young, Mario Diaz-Balart, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Bill Posey and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. How would Rubio have voted? No, spokesman Alex Burgos told us. "Marco opposes Washington's continued borrow-and-spend binge that is growing our debt and threatening to diminish America," Burgos told PolitiFact Florida. "While he believes unemployment benefits are legitimate government safety net programs, he would only have supported the last round of extensions if specific cuts were identified to offset the cost." Burgos' explanation mirrors the one Rubio gave to the St. Petersburg Times' Adam C. Smith back on July 20, when the debate over extending unemployment benefits was raging. Smith wrote that Rubio would support extending benefits "only if specific cuts were identified to offset the $34 billion cost." He then quoted Rubio as saying, "At some point someone has to draw a line in the sand and say we are serious about not growing debt." For the record, Charlie Crist and Kendrick Meek both supported extending unemployment benefits without a cost offset. The key to Rubio's position appears to have gotten lost in translation by the AFL-CIO, which said in a mailer that Rubio "opposes extending unemployment benefits." Really, Rubio opposed extending benefits without a way to pay for it, which was the main Republican argument in Congress. We rate the AFL-CIO claim Half True.

pomt-06356	Says Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on abortion rights.	true	/texas/statements/2011/nov/05/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-mitt-romney-flip-flopped-abortion-/	On Fox News Sunday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said fellow Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has changed positions on pivotal topics, including abortion rights. "You go back through my record for 20-plus years, I have been a consistent conservative," Perry told Chris Wallace on Oct. 30, 2011. Perry said he has "always been pro-life," while Romney has "been on both sides" of that issue. "He’s been ... pro-abortion," Perry said. Perry has lobbed flip-flop charges at Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, since soon after entering the presidential race. During a Sept. 22 Republican presidential debate, Perry, in a halting verbal attack, hit that idea hard, saying that Romney previously had stood up for Roe v. Wade "before he was against" it. Perry was referring to the 1973 landmark Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before a fetus is viable, the time at which it can survive outside a woman's body. So, has Romney flip-flopped on abortion rights? For another fact-check, PolitiFact National looked into that question. Romney made several statements about abortion rights earlier in his political career. Here are two of his clearest statements about his position: • In a debate during his unsuccessful 1994 challenge to U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., Romney said, "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country." He added: "I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice." • In his successful 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, "I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard." Those comments — made in public forums eight years apart — struck us as solid evidence that Romney was then an abortion-rights supporter. What about his views today? The "issues" portion of his website doesn’t have a section on abortion, but Romney wrote an op-ed that was posted on the National Review’s website June 18, 2011, presenting his abortion views. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. The pledge includes a promise that if the signer becomes president, he will appoint "pro-life" candidates to head certain federal agencies such as the Justice Department and to advance legislation cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood clinics and other abortion providers. In the op-ed, Romney wrote: "I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood." Romney goes on to say that if he is elected president, he will push for a law "to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion" and "appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written." Our ruling Romney’s views on abortion rights today are clearly different from what he expressed in 1994 and 2002. Most significantly, Romney earlier voiced support for the Roe decision; now, he says it should be reversed. We rate Perry’s claim that Romney flip-flopped on abortion rights True.

pomt-14666	"I helped write" the Affordable Care Act.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/18/bernie-sanders/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-claim-he-helped-write/	Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sparred over health care policy during a debate in Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 17. At one point, Sanders rejected assertions by Clinton that a Sanders presidency could imperil President Barack Obama’s signature legislative initiative, the Affordable Care Act. Clinton said, "There are things we can do to improve (the Affordable Care Act), but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think is the wrong direction." Sanders countered, "We’re not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act. I helped write it." We decided to check whether Sanders has a solid claim to have "helped write" the Affordable Care Act. As our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have noted, Sanders pushed hard for a more liberal version of health care reform -- the American Health Security Act of 2009, which would have implemented a national single-payer system. (Under a single-payer system, the government, rather than private health insurers, pays all medical bills, along the lines of Medicare.) Sanders backed down after Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., used a procedural move to force a full reading of Sanders’ bill, a move that would have taken hours of floor time and imperiled passage of a more moderate bill backed by Obama and his allies. However, as negotiations were in their final stage, Sanders successfully pushed for the inclusion of $11 billion in funding for community health centers, especially in rural areas. The insertion of this funding helped bring together both Democratic lawmakers on the left and Democrats representing more conservative, rural areas. "There was no one who played a more important role than Sen. Sanders" in securing that funding, Daniel Hawkins, vice president of the National Association of Community Health Centers, told the Intercept last year. (Sanders’ camp forwarded PolitiFact the Intercept article as evidence for his statement.) So there’s a good case to be made that Sanders made an important contribution to the final legislation. Still, when Sanders says he "helped write" the bill, it would be reasonable to imagine that Sanders was an integral player in the crafting of the bill over a long period of time -- an insider in the process. And that’s not the reality. Before the final bill was enacted, Sanders and his allies on the party’s left flank regularly expressed frustration at the concessions they had to make during the legislative process. "Public-option proponents, including Sanders and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, say they already have given up enough," Politico reported in late November 2009. "They agreed to forgo a single-payer system. They decided not to push a government plan tied to Medicare rates. And they accepted (Harry) Reid's proposal to include the opt-out provision. That's it, they say." Politico went on to quote Sanders saying, "I have made it clear to the administration and Democratic leadership that my vote for the final bill is by no means guaranteed." A few weeks later, Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank reported that Sanders was still undecided on supporting the primary Democratic bill. "I am talking to the Democratic leadership, trying my best to salvage some positive things in this bill, so I am not on board yet." And on Dec. 18, the New York Times quoted Sanders saying, ''I don't sleep well. I am struggling with this issue very hard, trying to sort out what is positive in this bill, what is negative in the bill, what it means for our country if there is no health insurance legislation, when we will come back to it. … And I have to combine that with the fact that I absolutely know that the insurance companies and the drug companies will be laughing all the way to the bank the day after this is passed.'' Sanders eventually voted for the legislation. Our ruling Sanders said he "helped write" the Affordable Care Act. He deserves credit for one provision of it -- worth a not-insignificant $11 billion. But overall, he was hardly an inside crafter of the bill. Until his effort was blocked by a GOP procedural move, Sanders supported a more aggressive single-payer system, and multiple news articles quoted him as being undecided about supporting the main Democratic bill until late in the process. Sanders’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That meets our definition of Mostly False. UPDATE, March 28, 2016: After we published our story, Sanders’ staff provided PolitiFact with several additional examples of provisions the senator helped insert into the Affordable Care Act, sometimes with the cooperation of other lawmakers. According to his staff, these include $1.5 billion in mandatory spending for the National Health Service Corps, a negotiated rule-making process to redefine the criteria for designating medically underserved areas, a waiver for states that want to experiment on health care policy, a provision to double penalties for health care fraud, a provision strengthening the False Claims Act, language to make volunteer ambulance personnel and firefighters who perform emergency medical services eligible for grants and loans, a provision to ease payments to alternative medicine practitioners, higher funding levels for the Public Health and Prevention Fund, and a formula increase in Medicaid funding that benefited his home state of Vermont. While this list does provide a more detailed picture of Sanders’ role in the bill’s crafting, none of these provisions involve core elements of the law, such as the exchanges and subsidies, the individual and employer mandates, the Medicaid expansion, the tax changes, the essential benefits package, and the provisions on cost containment. We stand by our original conclusion that, despite making contributions to the final legislation, Sanders was, for most of the process, an outsider pushing for a more aggressive single-payer system rather than an insider negotiating and crafting the final design of the bill. While saying that he "helped write" the Affordable Care Act contains an element of truth, Sanders ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. So we still rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-01-18T00:51:05	2016-01-17	['None']
pomt-12698	"‘TrumpCare’ would allow insurance execs to personally make millions off your health care."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/13/tammy-baldwin/would-trumpcare-gop-replacement-obamacare-allow-in/	U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin greeted the Obamacare replacement bill -- she calls it "Trumpcare" -- with a sharp retort. This was the Wisconsin Democrat’s tweet on March 8, 2017, two days after the unveiling of the the House GOP bill: #ReadtheBill & you’ll see #TrumpCare would allow insurance execs to personally make millions off your health care. To be sure, the top executives at five major insurers -- Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealth, Anthem and Humana -- already make millions, with each CEO earning between $10.3 million and $17.3 million in 2015, according to the latest figures. Could the CEOs make millions more as a result of the GOP bill? There would be an opportunity for that: A proposed tax break in the bill connected to executive compensation would be worth millions of dollars to the health insurers. But the tax break would go to corporations, not personally to the executives. And Baldwin’s claim assumes the corporations would give millions of dollars in raises to the executives. A tax deduction change Baldwin’s attack centers on a provision of the bill, which is supported by President Donald Trump, that would change a tax deduction: Currently, Obamacare limits to $500,000 the amount of an individual executive's compensation that a health insurance company can deduct as a business expense. The aim, as U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., has noted was to prevent health insurers from passing along profits they made via Obamacare to their executives, and then deducting the cost of those raises on the company’s taxes. The GOP replacement bill would repeal the $500,000 limit, generally making the cap $1 million, the same amount that applies to other types of businesses. In other words, health insurance companies could increase their tax deduction. The upshot for the federal government, as estimated by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation: $400 million in lost tax revenue over 10 years. The effects So, as Baldwin suggests, the GOP proposal would allow health insurers to claim a greater tax deduction for the pay it gives its top executives. A CNN/Money news report said that of the $73 million paid to the CEOs of the five major insurers in 2015, only $2.5 million was deductible under Obamacare tax laws, but more than $70 million of it would be deductible under the Republican legislation. But there are other important facts to consider: It’s misleading to say that executives would "personally" benefit from the change, given that the tax break is for corporations, not individuals. The health insurance companies would have more of a financial incentive, in terms of tax deductions, to give raises to their executives. But even if the companies opted to provide bigger raises, there’s no evidence that the executives would reap "millions." As Matthew Gardner, senior fellow at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told us: "A more accurate version of Baldwin’s statement would be that Trumpcare would make it easier for insurance companies to increase their CEO’s pay." Our rating Baldwin says "‘Trumpcare’ would allow insurance execs to personally make millions off your health care." One provision in a Trump-supported Republican bill to replace Obamacare is a tax break worth an estimated $400 million over 10 years. It’s possible that money could fund raises for health care company executives. But the tax break is for the companies, not individuals; the companies could use the savings for other purposes; and even if the savings were used for raises, there’s no evidence that executives would get millions. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2017-03-13T05:00:00	2017-03-08	['None']

Chuck Schumer was busted by his own daughter for having an affair with a teenager, according to a fake news story making the rounds on Facebook. "Update: Chuck Schumer’s steamy affair with a high school cheerleader confirmed," stated a headline in USA In Front Dec. 10. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This fake story had been shared more than 30,000 times on Facebook within just a few days. Schumer’s spokesman declined to comment to PolitiFact, and no one from the website responded to our email. The story stated that Schumer, a New York Democrat, had an affair with his daughter Lisa’s best friend from high school, a 16-year-old who later committed suicide. Schumer’s wife, Kaitlyn, paid the girl’s mother $2 million, the article stated. In reality, Schumer’s wife is named Iris and his daughters are Jessica and Alison. USA In Front claims proof via the cheerleader’s mother and Planned Parenthood records, but offers no actual evidence. The article portrays Schumer as a hypocrite for opposing the candidacy of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, who lost the Alabama race Dec. 12. In November, the Washington Post reported that Moore, while he was in his 30s, had pursued relationships with teenage girls, according to the women. Several fake news stories have made up claims related to Moore. This article appears to be a rip off of an earlier version on Last Line of Defense, a notorious fake news website that identifies itself as satire. That version had some more fictional details such as that Schumer spent a ton of money on the girl at Steak and Shake and Victoria’s Secret. These fake news stories about Schumer having an affair with a teenage teenager were posted a few days before an unrelated story in the New York Times about false allegations by a former Schumer staff member of sexual harassment by Schumer. Schumer’s staff filed a report to the Capitol Police that a fraudulent document that resembled a court filing described false allegations. The former staff member told the New York Times that the harassment claims were "completely false." The former staff member spoke to the New York Times on the condition of anonymity. A headline stated that "Chuck Schumer’s steamy affair with a high school cheerleader confirmed." There actually is no confirmation of such an event.

pomt-00006	Says "85 percent (of immigrants) don’t show up for a scheduled court hearing or call to schedule a court hearing."	false	/virginia/statements/2018/nov/13/rob-wittman/rep-rob-wittman-says-85-percent-immigrants-skip-th/	Rep. Rob Wittman, R-1st, says the United States’ process for screening migrants at the Mexican border and granting asylum is "broken." Under laws, migrants who enter the U.S. can prolong their stay by contesting deportation orders or requesting asylum. They are often assigned court dates for the disposition of their cases and released in the United States. Most of them go on the lam, Wittman contends. "As you know, 85 percent of them don’t show up for a scheduled court hearing or schedule a court hearing," he said during a Nov. 2 radio interview on the John Fredericks Show from Portsmouth. Wittman’s statement comes as thousands of Central Americans are moving in caravans through Mexico with hopes of getting asylum in the United States. President Donald Trump has deployed 5,600 troops to the U.S.-Mexican border and ordered that asylum be denied to migrants who do not enter through official border crossings. We wondered if Wittman is right that 85 percent of immigrants don’t show up for their court dates. Data kept by Department of Justice refutes his claim. Twenty-eight percent of migrants released in the U.S. didn’t show up for their hearings during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2017, according to the latest DOJ records. Of the 149,436 immigrants that were released in the U.S. during that time, 41,384 were no-shows. Over a five-year period through the end of September 2017, the records show 23 percent of undocumented migrants released in the U.S. didn’t show up to legal hearings. Of the 665,930 immigrants who were released,151,492 were no-shows. Not all of these people sought asylum. Some were unaccompanied children who came to the border, and others were migrants seeking to join family members already in the U.S. And many of the no-shows were people who were detained at the border and then released in the U.S. because three weeks later because severely strained immigration courts couldn't get to their cases. Those seeking asylums - also called asylees - have been the most cooperative group; 11 percent of them didn’t go to their hearings in fiscal 2017. DOJ records show that 43,013 people seeking asylum had court hearings scheduled in 2017, and 4,776 didn’t show up, Over a five-year period, 10.1 percent of asylees were no-shows. There were 130,092 hearings scheduled, and 13,130 people didn’t come. Not everyone accepts the DOJ figures. The Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors stricter immigration laws, says the federal government is undercounting the no-shows and, in a 2017 study, contended that 37 percent of immigrants during the previous 20 years missed their court dates. We called Wittman’s office and asked where he got his 85 percent figure. The next day, he appeared again on The John Fredericks Show and retracted his claim, offering the center’s figure in its place. Wittman said he got the 85 percent statistic in 2014 from Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., also cited Goodlatte in 2014 as the source of his statement that 90 percent of immigrants who cross the border don’t attend their court hearings. PolitiFact rated that claim False. Goodlatte’s office has cited an article in Newsmax, a conservative online publication, as the source of the four-year-old "anecdotal" statement. The article referred to an anonymous "senior Los Angeles County Sheriff’s detective who routinely deals with illegal immigrants" and said "a massive number — 80 to 90 percent" don’t show up for deportation hearings. Despite its debunking, the high figures are frequently cited. Trump, during Oct. 31 remarks at the White House, said "a level like 3 percent" of immigrants show up for their trials. Our ruling Wittman said "85 percent" of immigrants in the U.S. don’t show up for their court hearings. The actual percentage is far lower. DOJ statistics show 28 percent of migrants didn’t keep their court dates in 2017 and 11 percent of asylees didn’t show up. Even a think tank that says DOJ undercounts the no-shows comes nowhere close to the 85 percent figure. Wittman deserves credit for acknowledging his mistake - the day after we contacted him - on the same radio show that he made the statement. But his original claim of 85 percent has been circulating for years and we rate it False.	None	Rob Wittman	None	None	None	2018-11-13T02:00:00	2018-11-02	['None']

Democrat Kendrick Meek, on the other hand, favors President Barack Obama's plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans. After Rubio defended the tax cuts, Meek made the case that raising taxes on the wealthy reduces government debt, and that actually helps the middle class. "Middle-class families throughout America have to pay $6,000 per year to pay for the tax cut that he's talking about," Meek said. "That's before the finance charge from China, Japan, or India. I think it's important that we look at leveling with the people of this state, not just the cake-and-ice-cream, deregulation, everyone-should-get-a-tax-cut kind of way. If we are going to govern, we must govern in a responsible way, because we are putting our children in a position that no other nation's children will be in as it relates to paying back this debt." We were interested in fact-checking Meek's statement that "Middle-class families throughout America have to pay $6,000 per year to pay for" tax cuts for the wealthy. A little background about tax cuts: In 2001, President George W. Bush promoted tax cuts as a way to return money to citizens because the federal government was running a surplus. In 2003, Bush promoted the extension of some of those tax cuts as a necessary economic stimulus after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. But Bush lacked the votes in Congress to permanently change the tax code, so the laws that passed stipulated that the new, lower tax rates would expire in 2010. That means the rates for everyone will automatically go up in 2011 unless Congress takes action. President Obama campaigned on a platform to renew tax cuts for the middle class and to let tax cuts expire for individuals who make more than $200,000 and couples who make more than $250,000. Meek, currently a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives, supports that plan. The Obama administration has released detailed budget estimates showing that higher tax rates on the wealthy will generate $678.3 billion over 10 years. Obama's proposal raises the income rates on the top brackets from 33 and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent. But he also proposes a few other provisions affecting high earners, such as increasing their dividends taxes and capping tax exemptions. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center crunched the numbers on the proposals in Obama's 2011 budget and found the following: For taxpayers who reported income between $200,000 and $500,000, the average tax increase would be $1,422. Their average federal tax rate, including payroll taxes, would go up from 24.4 percent to 24.9 percent. For taxpayers who reported income between $500,000 and $1 million, the average tax increase would be $17,627. Their average federal tax rate, including payroll taxes, would go from 25.5 percent to 28 percent. For taxpayers who reported income over $1 million, the average tax increase would be $148,970. Their average federal tax rate, including payroll taxes, would go from 29.6 percent to 34.4 percent. Getting back to Meek's statement, Meek said that tax cuts for the wealthy would "cost" middle-class taxpayers $6,000 each. We should note that keeping the lower tax rates in place doesn't technically "cost" the government anything. Rather, it's money that the government doesn't collect. Given the current fiscal imbalances, though, any reduction in tax revenues without cutting spending puts the country more into debt. Meek said he wasn't counting interest on the debt, and that it would cost middle-class taxpayers $6,000 per year. We know that over 10 years, the tax increase for the wealthy totals $678.3 billion, so $6,000 per taxpayer per year means there are ... (hold on a minute, we're punching the numbers into our calculator) ... 11.3 million middle-class taxpayers -- a laughably small number. There are about 157 million taxpayers in total, so using this math, Meek's middle class would be disturbingly small -- less than 10 percent of all taxpayers. Democrats like to say that the middle class is shrinking, but we don't think even Meek would suggest it's less than 10 percent. We suspected Meek meant $6,000 per family over 10 years. And in fact, when we ran our analysis by the Meek campaign, they admitted he misspoke, that he meant to say over 10 years. They used a 2007 Census estimate of 116 million households in the United States. In rating our item, we should note that some Republicans object to saying that tax cuts "cost" anything. It's not spending, they say, it's money that belongs to the people. Still, if the country is deficit-spending, it's foregone revenue that will have to be made up for some way. But this philosophical debate is a side note to our fact check because Meek said the tax cuts for the wealthy would cost middle-class families "$6,000 per year." That number is way off, by at least a factor of 10. Meek's campaign admitted he flubbed it. We rate Meek's statement False.

pomt-15109	"The top man at Yale Law School came out ... with just a raging report" about former HP CEO Carly Fiorina, saying she is "one of the worst executives in his memory in history running the company."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-yale-laws-top-man-criticized-for/	Donald Trump is again defending his disparaging comments about a woman on national television. This time it’s about Carly Fiorina, a rival for the Republican nomination whom Trump mocked by saying "Look at that face!" in front of a Rolling Stone reporter who published his remarks. Appearing on CBS’ Face the Nation, Trump contended that his remarks were not about her appearance, but about "her persona" and her track record as the CEO of Hewlett-Packard. "She hasn’t done a good job in, you could call it, the private sector. The companies, take a look at the record," he said Sept. 13. "The top man at Yale Law School came out, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, with just a raging report. She’s one of the worst executives in his memory in history running the company." Trump rarely cites his sources, so we were curious about the "raging report" by a top dog at Yale University’s law school. The Trump campaign did not get back to us by deadline, but we think he is likely referring to an Aug. 14, 2015, column in Fortune by Yale’s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. The piece did criticize Fiorina’s record at HP, but Trump misstated a few things. First, Sonnenfeld is a professor and senior associate dean for leadership programs at the Yale School of Management, not "the top man" at Yale Law. Second, Sonnenfeld didn’t name Fiorina as one of the worst executives in his memory. But he told PolitiFact in an interview that "these complaints over her leadership are facts, which she cannot erase by attacking messengers." "Fired in 2005, after six years in office, several leading publications titled her one of the worst technology CEOs of all time," he wrote in Fortune. Here’s a laundry list of Fiorina’s failings, according to Sonnenfeld (which includes a nod to Trump himself): Forcing through a "massive, ill-conceived, controversial" merger with Compaq Computer in 2002 by using "hardball tactics that would make Donald Trump wince," Completely reversing her stated strategy to emulate competitor IBM’s move into IT services, Slicing shareholder wealth in half in five years, Hurting employee morale and poisoning company culture, Cutting 30,000 U.S. tech jobs, Pocketing in $100 million despite everything. "She was not a criminal nor one of the rogue CEOs of another era and may deserve another chance, but it is telling that in a decade, she has never been given another major company to lead," Sonnenfeld told us. "Experience can be a badge of honor or a badge of shame." Sonnenfeld’s assessment of Fiorina is echoed by several others, but he stands out as one of her most prominent critics (so much so that Fiorina dismissed him as a Clinton adviser on NBC, which Sonnenfeld denies, and her Super PAC has featured him and his "disreputable past" in a blog post). He deemed Fiorina’s tenure at HP a "colossal failure" in Bloomberg in April 2015 and "a reign of terror and poor performance" in a 2006 Associated Press story. "You couldn’t pick a worse, non-imprisoned CEO to be your standard-bearer," he told the New York Times in 2008. A Fiorina spokeswoman contended that Fiorina "was a successful CEO by any metric" and said that Sonnenfeld "is a Clinton ally with dubious motives." "This is a blatantly absurd statement which holds no factual or empirical basis," Leslie Shedd, press secretary for Fiorina’s Super PAC, said. Shedd also pointed out that Trump has disparaged Sonnenfeld in the past (and got his title right) when the latter criticized his NBC reality show, The Apprentice, in 2004. "I would have to say that he lacks the insight required to understand the architecture of a corporation, and his review reflects that lack of knowledge," Trump wrote in a letter to the Wall Street Journal. "Perhaps that is why he is a professor at Yale instead of the Wharton School of Finance (my alma mater)." Since Sonnenfeld and the real estate mogul traded jabs, Trump apparently invited Sonnenfeld to lunch at Trump National Golf Course and charmed Sonnenfeld's wife and colleague, much to the Yale professor’s horror. Our ruling Trump said, "The top man at Yale Law School came out, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, with just a raging report" about former HP CEO Carly Fiorina, saying she is "one of the worst executives in his memory in history running the company." Trump misses minor points about the Yale man and his message. Sonnenfeld teaches at Yale’s business school. He is not the law school’s "top man. And Sonnenfeld doesn’t exactly say Fiorina is the worst HP CEO in "his memory." However, the gist of Trump’s claim is accurate, as Sonnenfeld has been a vocal critic of Fiorina’s HP record for years. Trump’s claim is missing some detail but is overall on point about Sonnenfeld’s long-running critique of Fiorina. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-08414	Says Maryellen O’Shaughnessy "accepted campaign cash from indicted politician Jimmy Dimora."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/20/ohio-republican-party/ohio-republican-party-flier-tries-tie-maryellen-os/	A massive federal public corruption investigation into Cuyahoga County is center stage in races for the county’s first county executive and 11-member county council, with reform-minded candidates pledging to restore integrity to government and doing everything to distance themselves from two prominent Democrats: County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora and former Auditor Frank Russo. Dimora, known as Public Official No. 1 has been charged with 26 federal crimes and has pleaded not guilty; Russo is Public Official No. 2 and has already pleaded guilty to 23 charges and will serve more than 20 years in federal prison. The federal probe, which is more than 2 years old, inspired Cuyahoga County voters last year to change how the county operates. So it’s not surprising that the probe has played a prominent role in campaign literature and TV ads of the candidates promising to deliver a more honest, open government to Cuyahoga County residents. But the scandal also has become a useful weapon for those seeking state offices, including Republicans who want to see State Sen. and former Ohio House Speaker Jon Husted become the next Secretary of State. The Ohio Republican Party is distributing a piece of campaign literature for Husted that juxtaposes the now iconic photo of federal agents leading Dimora from his home in chains last month with an unflattering image of Husted’s Democratic opponent, Maryellen O’Shaughnessy. Even without words, the ad is playing the guilt-by-association game. (Democrats mastered the game four years ago, tying every Republican they could to the now infamous coin dealer and Republican fund-raiser Tom Noe, who ended up behind bars for theft and corruption charges.) The ORP literature claims O’Shaughnessy "accepted campaign cash from indicted politician Jimmy Dimora." That charge could certainly resonate with voters, especially in Northeast Ohio, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to test its truthfulness. Dimora’s campaign in fact did give money - $100 - to O’Shaughnessy’s campaign. And Dimora has been indicted on 23 federal charges. However the two facts don’t fit together as neatly in reality as they do on the flier. O’Shaughnessy received the donation on June 25, 2008, a month before the federal investigation became public and agents raided Dimora’s home and office. At the time, O’Shaughnessy was not a candidate for secretary of state, but was running for her current job, Franklin County clerk of courts. By using the term "indicted politician," the ad implies that O’Shaughnessy accepted money from Dimora after he was indicted. Dimora, who maintains his innocence, wasn’t indicted until September 2010. And it's worth noting again, the federal investigation was not public when the donation was made. The GOP flier restates the claim with more dramatic flare on the back. "O’Shaughnessy took campaign cash from corrupt politician Jimmy Dimora," a point illustrated by a close up of a thick stack of $100 bills passing between two hands. Husted, though not directly responsible for distributing the advertisement, supports its messaging and believes the ad is fair description of the facts. The ORP also stands by the claim argues that even after O’Shaughnessy learned of the indictments, she never returned the money or donated an equal amount to charity as other Democrats in a similar predicament have done. (O’Shaughnessy argues her campaign account is closed and therefore can’t do anything. But that doesn’t preclude her from donating an equal amount from her current campaign to charity.) Turning back to the claim at hand, O’Shaughnessy did accept a campaign contribution from Dimora. And Dimora has been indicted in a federal corruption probe. Separately those are correct. But the flier’s combines the two facts to make the underlying suggestion that O’Shaughnessy took the money from a politician under federal indicted at the time of the contribution. That underlying message qualifies the claim for a rating of False. Comment on this item.	None	Ohio Republican Party	None	None	None	2010-10-20T15:00:00	2010-10-18	['None']

pomt-05308	"A Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/may/18/us-chamber-commerce/attack-against-alan-grayson-chamber-points-florida/	Remember that time when former Florida congressman Alan Grayson quipped on the House floor that the Republican health care plan plan was "don’t get sick" and, if you do, "die quickly"? The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sure does. The business lobbying group is using Grayson’s words against him in an attack ad. The commercial is part of a broader Chamber campaign targeting Democrats over their support of "Obamacare," including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson. (Read our fact-checks of the Nelson ad here and here). This commercial compares Grayson to a literal broken record (remember records?) entitled Reckless, featuring House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The ad repeats his explosive lines from floor debate. Narrator: "Reckless politicians gave us Obamacare. Alan Grayson was one of Obamacare’s biggest cheerleaders. He’d say anything." Grayson: "Die quickly. The Republicans want you to die quickly." Narrator: "Now we learn Obamacare could cause 20 million people to lose their current coverage." Another record appears with Grayson’s face on it, labeled "Obamacare Unconstitutional." Narrator: "And a Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional. Will Alan Grayson change his tune on Obamacare, or be the same broken record?" PolitiFact Florida already fact-checked the chamber’s claim about 20 million people losing their current coverage in our review of the Nelson ad. We rated it a Pants on Fire, because it cherry-picks a worst-case-scenario statistic and strongly suggests seniors would lose Medicare coverage. Here, we’re checking the ad’s other claim that "a Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional." The Chamber includes this claim in another ad against Democrat Lois Frankel, running in Florida’s 22nd District. Grayson is running in Florida's new District 9 seat, which includes part of Orlando and parts of the district he lost in 2010 to U.S. Rep. Daniel Webster. At this time, Grayson is the only Democrat in the race. From this moment on Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law May 23, 2010. It’s been a long and winding legal path ever since. At issue, for most plaintiffs, is the individual mandate, which requires all citizens to buy health insurance and takes effect in 2014. The ACA Litigation Blog, launched by Santa Clara University law professor Brad Joondeph, keeps a spreadsheet of all lawsuits against the reforms on its website. By its count, 31 parties have filed lawsuits against the law, 12 of which have been dropped. Eight have reached the Supreme Court. On the same day Obama signed the law, then-Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum filed a lawsuit on behalf of 13 states challenging the law. (Ultimately, 26 governors and attorneys general joined the suit.) Two months later, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli sued the government over the law’s implementation. At the end of 2010, a Virginia district judge appointed by Ronald Reagan ruled the individual mandate unconstitutional. Florida re-entered the picture on Jan. 31, 2011. Pensacola-based U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson went further than the Virginia judge, declaring in Florida v. HHS that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and "inextricably bound" to the rest of the law -- meaning the whole thing needed to be tossed out because of that faulty provision. "The act, like a defectively designed watch, needs to be redesigned and reconstructed by the watchmaker," Vinson wrote in his opinion. Vinson’s decision on the individual mandate was upheld by a three-person panel at the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on Aug. 12, 2011, though they reversed his recommendation to throw out the law. The case then moved up to the U.S. Supreme Court. Then a district judge in Pennsylvania ruled against the mandate on Sept. 13, 2011, but said the rest of the law could stand. This brings us to the first misleading aspect of the claim. The tone and visuals of the commercial may lead viewers to think that because a Florida judge ruled it unconstitutional, the fate of Obamacare has been decided. What the commercial doesn’t mention is that the Supreme Court has the final say. The court heard three days of oral arguments in March and could release a verdict by the end of June. Mandate upheld elsewhere Judicial decisions on various challenges have not all been negative on the individual mandate. Three federal district judges -- all appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton -- have upheld the mandate since 2010. A judge in Detroit did so in an Oct. 7, 2010, decision. The next month, a federal judge in Virginia followed suit over a challenge from Liberty University. And on Feb. 22, 2012, a district judge in Washington also deemed the individual mandate constitutional. And even though the U.S. Appeals panel in Atlanta isn’t keen on the insurance requirement, its counterpart in Cincinnati went the other way. A Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals panel, by 2-to-1 approval, declared the provision a "valid exercise of legislative power by Congress under the Commerce clause" on June 29, 2011. That was consistent with a lower court’s decision on a challenge by the conservative Thomas More Law Center. Fighting back Grayson pushed back against the Chamber ad in a May 17, 2012, Orlando Sentinel column. He referenced a D.C. newspaper report saying Republicans have no plan to present a health care alternative this year. "Which means that after almost four years of debate, the national Republican health care plan still is this: Don't get sick," he said, sticking by his old catchphrase. He turned the commercial of "brazen lies" into a fundraising appeal to supporters, asking them to contribute to his "Fight Back" Fund. Our ruling The U.S. Chamber's ad says, "A Florida judge ruled parts of Obamacare unconstitutional." It’s true that a Florida judge ruled parts of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. But the chamber fails to acknowledge that other judges have upheld it, and that the Supreme Court will have the final say this summer. Their statement is accurate but needs additional clarification. We rule it Mostly True.	None	U.S. Chamber of Commerce	None	None	None	2012-05-18T15:18:00	2012-05-08	['None']
pomt-10137	Barack Obama's plan calls for "mandates and fines for small businesses."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/08/john-mccain/small-businesses-exempt-from-obamas-plan/	At the second presidential debate in Nashville, John McCain attacked Barack Obama's health care plan. Obama's plan calls for "mandates and fines for small businesses," McCain said. "If you're a small business person and you don't insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you — will fine you. That's remarkable," McCain said. But we find that when you dig into the nitty gritty of Obama's plan, that's not the case. Obama's plan expands health care coverage for those who don't have it by a number of strategies, such as creating national pools for individuals to buy their own insurance. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. And it aims at reining in costs for everyone by streamlining medical record-keeping and emphasizing preventive care. Obama's plan does not mandate coverage, except for children. Obama said often during the Democratic primary campaign that he did not include a mandate for adults so as not to penalize people with modest incomes. If there's a mandate on anyone to purchase health care, the mandate would be on parents, not small businesses. Obama's plan says that employers who don't offer their employees insurance will be required to contribute to the national pool. Obama's plan exempts small businesses from contributing to the pool. The plan does not define what's a small business and what's not. McCain calls this a "fine," but being required to contribute to a pool is not the same as paying a penalty for some wrongdoing. So even by a generous definition, Obama does not fine "small businesses." Indeed, they are not even subject to the mandate. We rate McCain's claim False.

pomt-01229	The majority of revenue generated by a proposed Kenosha casino would be sent to the Seminole tribe in Florida.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/nov/20/enough-already-wisconsin-inc/anti-casino-group-enough-already-claims-most-reven/	As a decision by Gov. Scott Walker draws near, debate over a proposed $800 million casino in Kenosha is rekindling on social media and the airwaves. The Menominee tribe aims to build on the site of the long-closed Dairyland Greyhound Park dog track. The latest plan, which has received federal approval, calls for a project that would include a casino, hotel, spa and concert venue that would be developed and managed by Hard Rock International, which is owned by the Seminole tribe of Florida. The Kenosha plan has drawn strong opposition from the Forest County Potawatomi, who argue the project would drain revenue from their Milwaukee casino, which recently added a $150 million, 381 room hotel. Walker has the final say and has until Feb. 19, 2015 to make his decision. Anti-casino group Enough Already Wisconsin, Inc. has been active on social media, including regular tweets criticizing the project. The group — which is not required to reveal its funding — is also running a new batch of television ads urging Walker to reject the plan. A Nov. 8, 2014 tweet zeroed in on a key opposition argument — that the casino would benefit out-of-state interests, specifically the Seminoles in Florida: "The Kenosha Casino, backed by the FL. Seminole Tribe, would send a majority of its rev to FL." That’s a lot of money, given that the casino is expected to generate revenue of more than $436 million in its first year of operation, according to figures provided to the state by Hard Rock and the Menominee. Is the group correct? When we asked Enough Already spokesman Brian Nemoir for evidence to back the claim that most of the revenue would flow to Florida, he walked back the statement. "What I should have said is the money is being sent out of state, not just Florida," Nemoir said. The Nov. 8, 2014 tweet was subsequently removed, but the same statement remains in the organization’s feed from the previous two months. The financial picture So what about the numbers? Let’s break down the anticipated spending and see what part of the Hard Rock revenue would go to Florida. Enough Already and the casino backers agree — roughly — on how much revenue the project could generate each year. Nemoir said he used $410 million, based on a Menominee report to the federal government. A more recent figure, $436.7 million, was in a Menominee/Hard Rock report filed with the state in October 2013. So for Enough Already to be right, a majority of that money — some $205 million to $218 million — would have to go to Florida. Management fees: The Seminole-owned Hard Rock would receive an annual management fee. The Menominee-Hard Rock report lists that fee at $34.7 million in the first year that the facility is open — about 7.9 percent of total revenue of $436.7 million. But Nemoir used a figure that was nearly four times higher — that the Seminole would receive $143.5 million a year, or about 33 percent of the gross revenue. He said that figure was based on an estimate made by University of Wisconsin-Madison law professor Richard Monette in a Sept. 19, 2014 story in the Appleton Post-Crescent. The story contained this line: "‘Hard Rock would likely receive 30 to 35 percent of the Kenosha casino's total revenue and as much as 40 percent,’ predicted University of Wisconsin-Madison law school professor Richard Monette, who is director of the Great Lakes Indian Law Center." But Monette told us his comments were basically a guess. "When I was asked, the reporter didn't have the facts and I hadn't researched the matter, so I speculated based on other deals," he wrote in an email. "That said, I would be very surprised if that $34 million were a total," he said, adding that the sum sounded like the "development and management of construction only. Once the casino is opened, operations management is usually greater than that, annually." Construction loan: The Kenosha complex will cost an estimated $800 million, and the Menominee will have to repay with interest whoever lends that money. Nemoir puts the annual repayment amount at $58 million per year and assumes it will go the the Seminole tribe. But there’s been no indication that the Seminole are planning to finance the project themselves. Kenosha project spokesman Michael Beightol said three banks have said they would consider participating in the project, including Green Bay-based Bay Bank, which is owned by the Oneida tribe. He said the other two banks are much larger and neither is in Florida, or connected with the Seminole tribe. The document that the Kenosha group filed with the state lists $50.5 million as the interest payment for the construction loan in the first year that the facility is open. Other considerations Nemoir pointed out the Menominee also owe money to the former owner of the dog track, based in Alabama, and the Connecticut-based Mohegan tribe, a former partner with the Menominee for the Kenosha project. Those payments total about $53 million. That money would go out of state, but not to Florida, as claimed. What’s more, they would be one-time payments. On the other side, Beightol noted that the casino would generate a projected $42.8 million in state and local payments and taxes; have $167.8 million in spending on money and goods purchased in the state, including labor; and $15.4 million in "promotional allowances" such as marketing and advertising. Those expenses alone amount to about $226 million — well over half of the gross revenue. As for what is going to the Seminole tribe, the best figure based on public filings is $34.7 million in the first year. That’s about 8 percent of total revenue -- a far cry from more than 50 percent. Our rating A group opposing the Kenosha casino project tweeted that the majority of revenue from the business would go to the Seminole tribe in Florida. For that to be right, it would have to be at least $200 million. However, the claim is based a guess and a faulty assumption. The group’s spokesman admitted that the numbers fall short. We rate the claim False.	None	Enough Already Wisconsin, Inc.	None	None	None	2014-11-20T05:00:00	2014-11-08	['Kenosha,_Wisconsin']

Joe Scarborough, co-host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, called it "the issue of our time" this week and cited Gallup Poll numbers that say only 30 percent of Americans are satisfied with the distribution of wealth; and 67 percent are dissatisfied. "Since 2009, what's the stat," Scarborough said. "Do we have the stat since Barack Obama became president of the United States, 95 percent of economic gains have been made by the richest 1 percent?" We decided to fact-check Scarborough's statement. (Far be it for us to duck the issue of our time.) Scarborough’s statement goes back to a study from University of California-Berkeley economist, Emmanuel Saez. In the years from 2009 to 2012, Saez found that the income flowing to families in the top 1 percent of families went up by over 30 percent, while for the rest, income grew by less than half a percent. "Hence, the top 1 percent captured 95 percent of the income gains in the first three years of the recovery," Saez wrote. The main caveat with Saez’s work is that he used preliminary data for 2012 and didn’t include two significant kinds of income -- money from the government (Social Security, welfare, food stamps, etc) or the value of health insurance benefits. Saez focused on employment wages, capital gains, dividends and interest. So Scarborough has his figures right by Saez’s figuring, but what you count as income makes a difference. We’ll now walk you through some other ways of looking at this question. Other interpretations, analysis We came across a study that measured income differently than Saez -- by measuring capital gains regardless of whether the owner cashed out and including government assistance programs. That study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found a wide income disparity as well, but noted that the gap actually narrowed between 1989 and 2007. There’s another argument that it makes more sense to calculate consumption rather than income. Economist Aparna Marthur with the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market oriented think tank in Washington, believes what people spend shows you how well people are actually living, and it doesn’t matter if they pay for it using credit cards, their weekly paycheck or their savings. Viewed this way, the situation is not as bad. "We find that consumption inequality is much narrower than income inequality," Marthur said. "And has shown no trend towards widening over the last few decades." Marthur’s perspective is fuel for a policy debate that goes far beyond what we are writing about here, but there is one other criticism of Saez’s analysis. Eugene Steurele, a fellow at the Urban Institute, a D.C-based academic center, warned about using 2009, the very bottom of the recession, as the starting point. "The economic cycle messes up this comparison," Steurele said. "In recovering from a recession, if an unemployed person stays with the same unemployment benefits, and a wage earner doesn’t increase her wages, but the stock market recovers enough so there are more capital gains, then one might get these types of results." Steurele said Saez’s findings are useful but his approach simplifies a complex situation. Work by the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy analysis arm of Congress, goes at least part way toward addressing Steurele’s concern. A 2011 report chose two points at the same place in the economic cycle, 1996 and 2006. It also factored in taxes and if its results are not exactly comparable to the Saez article, they point in the same direction. "The poorest tax filers (the bottom fifth) saw average after-tax income fall by 6 percent between 1996 and 2006," the report said. While "the richest 1 percent of tax filers experienced a 74 percent increase in after-tax income." The main reason for the widening gap was the rapid growth in capital gains and dividends income among the wealthy, the Congressional Research Service concluded. Our ruling Scarborough said that under Obama, 95 percent of the economic gains have gone to the top 1 percent of earners. To be clear, we saw no evidence that Scarborough was blaming Obama, so we're only evaluating the numbers. Scarborough accurately reflected the findings of a much publicized report from Emmanuel Saez, a Berkeley economist. Other studies confirm the overall trend in that report, although the disparities in gains between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else are not always as large as Scarborough said and depend on how you define income. Scarborough’s statement is accurate but in need of clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Joe Scarborough	None	None	None	2014-01-22T18:12:24	2014-01-21	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-01701	"The minimum number of infrastructure (needs) in Atlanta is $900 million."	true	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/12/kasim-reed/mayor-gives-conservative-estimate-city-needs/	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed is talking about going before voters in March with a plan for chipping away at a backlog of repairs to city roads, sidewalks, bridges and buildings. Some of the projects could be retreads from a grab bag of $7 billion-plus in road and sidewalk improvements that were pitched to voters in 10 metro counties in 2012. The transportation sales tax, or T-SPLOST as it was called, was rejected by a majority of voters in nine of 12 regions across the state, but not by Atlantans. Nearly 60 percent of voting city residents supported the 1 percent tax. Details of the proposed March referendum are still being ironed out, including what projects would be funded. But at a news conference July 29, Reed talked of the work that’s waiting. "There is no dispute. The minimum number of infrastructure (needs) in Atlanta is $900 million," the mayor told reporters. We decided a fact check was in order and reached out to the city and Tom Weyandt, Atlanta’s deputy chief operating officer. Weyandt told us $900 million is on the conservative side. At least one forecast puts the costs of the backlog of projects at about $1.02 billion, with $881 million in transportation, $130.8 million for facilities. (Some estimates out there are as high as $1.1 billion.) The $1.02 billion cost projections are based on two reports -- one from 2010 that sized up the condition of city bridges, roads, sidewalks, streetlights, traffic signals and signs; and one completed this year that looked at city buildings in need of repair or replacement. On the long list of potential transportation projects are 1,634 miles of road that need resurfacing and vast portions of sidewalks and curbs that require improved access for the disabled. (In 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice initiated a compliance review of the facilities and policies of the city of Atlanta as it relates to provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. As one of the outcomes, the city’s Public Works Department had to identify and install curb ramps on sidewalks resurfaced since January 1992. The estimated backlog is 31,442 noncompliant intersections at an estimated cost of $52 million.) Also identified as in need of repair or replacement are 14 bridges that have been rated poor to fair. The average age of a bridge in the city is 57 years old, and the oldest has stood for 108 years, according to city records. A recent presentation suggests city officials divvy up the $1 billion-plus this way: $262 million, or 31 percent, in street resurfacing; $259 million, or 30 percent, in bridge replacement and maintenance; and $204 million, or 24 percent, in sidewalks, curbs and ADA ramps. The remaining 15 percent would go to signals, streetlights, signs, unpaved roads, school zone flashers and similar improvements. In terms of facility improvements, tentative plans call for putting $130.8 million into returning some fire stations, police stations and recreation centers to good condition. For some that would mean renovation. For others, it would mean replacement. The referendum is expected to be for a maximum of $250 million in bonds, said Anne Torres, the mayor’s spokesman. The understanding is that more money would be requested from voters down the road, she said. A final list of proposed projects for the referendum is expected by November or December. To summarize: Reed said the city has infrastructure needs that will cost at least $900 million. That’s a conservative estimate based on studies and previous comments by him and others. We rate Reed’s statement as True.	None	Kasim Reed	None	None	None	2014-08-12T00:00:00	2014-07-29	['Atlanta']
pomt-04311	"The truth is David Cicilline voted for tougher laws against child abusers, domestic abusers and abusers of the elderly."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/30/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-he-voted-tougher-laws-/	Republican Brendan Doherty has been mining U.S. Rep. David Cicilline’s legal and legislative resume recently, pointing out unsavory law clients Cicilline represented as a criminal defense lawyer and criticizing him for votes that he took during his eight years in the Rhode Island House of Representatives. In an Oct. 9, 2012, news release, Doherty accused Cicilline, a freshman Democrat, of voting against two bills in the mid-1990s that would have imposed mandatory sentences for certain domestic violence and child abuse offenses. We examined Doherty’s claim and ruled it True. Last week the Cicilline campaign decided two could play that game, releasing a television ad that labeled Doherty’s attacks "outrageous." The ad cited anti-crime bills Cicilline supported in the legislature on behalf of women, the elderly and other victims of crimes, including cases of sexual abuse. We decided to check Cicilline’s list, checking Journals of the Rhode Island House, state statutes, and our own news files. We found that the ad accurately cited the legislation and Cicilline’s votes. The first involved crimes against the elderly. In 1998, Cicilline was among a group of legislators who supported a bill called the Elderly Violence Protection Act. It established that particular crimes should be charged differently if they were committed against a victim older than 60. On July 14, 1998, he made a motion, which was approved, to add breaking and entering to that list. He was the only one of the group of sponsors or seconders to discuss the act on the floor. It passed on a 69-3 vote and ultimately became law. In the 2000 legislative session, Cicilline proposed legislation that would have created a crime of indecent solicitation of a child under 14 for the purpose of sexual molestation. It didn’t pass that year. But in 2004, two years after Cicilline had left the state House for the Providence mayor’s office, a similar bill was enacted, though it set the age at 18, rather than 14. The next year Cicilline introduced a bill that would have eliminated the statute of limitations for lawsuits filed by victims of child sexual abuse. The existing law said someone so harmed had seven years to file a suit. The bill didn’t pass and the seven-year limit remains in effect today. In 2002, he submitted a bill that would have prohibited anyone who has been the subject of a restraining order from owning firearms. The existing law forbade people who had been convicted of a crime of violence, a felony or who were under home confinement from owning a gun. The bill didn’t pass. Our ruling Cicilline campaign TV ad says Cicilline, as a state representative, voted for tougher anti-crime bills. We verified that Cicilline supported the bills cited in the ad, though not all of them became law. We find his statement True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-11858	"Part of this omnibus gun bill that year (was) legalizing machine guns in the state of Missouri."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/nov/03/stacey-newman/ban-gone-owning-machine-gun-missouri-isnt-easy/	Following one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern U.S. history in Las Vegas, State Rep. Nick Marshall, R-Parkville, was critical of the political rhetoric and expressed his discontent in an Oct. 2 Missourinet article. "When it comes to automatic weapons, that’s a federal issue as you know," Marshall said. State Rep. Stacey Newman, D-Richmond Heights, told Missourinet that Marshall was incorrect on automatic weapons being a federal issue. She pointed to House Bill 294, which passed in 2011. "Part of this omnibus gun bill that year (was) legalizing machine guns in the state of Missouri," Newman said. "We legalized them here. And ever since then, continually my whole time in the legislature, we have loosened restriction." We were wondering, are machine guns legal in Missouri? Are they under federal or state jurisdiction? And, has Missouri loosened restrictions on them? We tried to reach out to Newman to clarify her statement, but received no response. We spoke with people knowledgeable on gun laws in Missouri, who said that when it came to Newman’s statement, there’s context missing and multiple ways to interpret it. Regulating machine guns Basically, a machine gun is an automatic weapon that is capable of firing more than one round per trigger pull, Allen Rostron, law professor at University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, said in an email. A semi-automatic requires a finger pull for each round but automatically loads the chamber after a shot. The sale of automatic weapons has been restricted since the National Firearms Act was enacted in 1934. The act was inspired, in part, because of frequent use of machine guns in crime, including the 1929 St. Valentine’s Day Massacre in Chicago and the 1933 Union Station Massacre in Kansas City. The original act imposed a tax on automatic weapons and required they be registered with the Secretary of the Treasury, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. "It essentially amounted to a ban, because it became a crime to possess a machine gun without having it properly registered with the government," Rostron said. "But technically it wasn’t actually a ban, because it didn’t prohibit machine guns. It just made them subject to much stricter regulations than other guns." In 1986, Congress passed additional regulations that cut off the supply of new machine guns to civilian buyers. Any existing machine guns manufactured before May 19, 1986, are still allowed to be purchased and were grandfathered into the law. Essentially, that’s where the federal law stands today. "There are something like 400,000 or 500,000 of these machine guns that are legally possessed by civilians in the United States," Rostron said. State vs. federal Prior to 2011, Missouri prohibited the possession of machine guns in the state. HB 294, which Newman referenced, "Allows a person to possess, manufacture, transport, repair, or sell a machine gun, short barreled rifle or shotgun, or firearm silencer if he or she conforms with federal law," according to the bill summary. The bill passed by a majority in both the House and the Senate and was signed into law by Gov. Jay Nixon. "So in other words, Missouri went from having a stricter law that completely banned machine guns to having a law that said you’re allowed to have a machine gun if federal law permits it," Rostron said. As of April 2017, there were 9,588 machine guns registered in Missouri, according to a 2017 ATF report, said Hannah Shearer, staff attorney and Second Amendment litigation director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that advocates for more restrictive gun regulation. So is Marshall or Newman correct that machine guns are a federal or state issue? Well, it depends. Marshall is correct that federal law has the ultimate jurisdiction over machine guns. However, states can impose stricter laws that go beyond federal law, such as Missouri did prior to 2011. "Rep. Marshall’s statement is incomplete or inaccurate to the extent it suggests state law is completely irrelevant to this," Rostron said. "So it is not purely a federal issue as he seemed to suggest." However, Newman’s statement could also be misleading. She is correct that machine guns were legalized in Missouri, but they must still comply with federal law. "If her statement gives people the impression that machine guns have been legalized in Missouri and so now they’re not subject to any special restrictions, then that is not correct, because machine guns remain subject to the federal (National Firearms Act) restrictions that apply throughout the nation," Rostron said. However, other experts disagreed, and claimed that machine guns are solely a federal issue. "This is theater," St. Louis University School of Law Professor Anders Walker said in an email about Newman’s statement. "Machine guns are controlled by federal law, full stop," and linked to a Giffords Law Center webpage. An NRA spokeswoman agreed. Kevin Jamison, attorney and president of the Western Missouri Shooters Alliance, pointed to the fact that no state agency regulates machine guns, and said that the only difference is that the Missouri law allows prosecutors to try a case in a Missouri court. "Doesn’t happen very often, but it could possibly happen," Jamison said. Loosening restrictions? Newman also said, "Ever since (House Bill 294 passed), continually my whole time in the Legislature, we have loosened restriction." Experts said the accuracy of Newman’s statement depends on whether she was referring to machine guns specifically or gun laws in general. When it comes to machine guns, experts said Missouri has not loosened restrictions since 2011. However, Shearer pointed out that the state has loosened restriction on gun laws more generally. "Rep. Newman is also correct that Missouri has weakened its gun laws over time, including last year, when state lawmakers overrode the governor’s veto to enact permitless concealed carry," Shearer said. "Missouri’s weak laws correlate with a comparatively high gun death rate. In 2016 Missouri had the ninth highest per capita gun death rate among all the states," pointing to a Giffords Law Center scorecard. Our ruling Newman said, Missouri legalized machine guns. There’s some truth to that, but also some caveats. In 2011, the Missouri legislature overturned a full ban of automatic weapons. But all that did was make state law comply with federal law. Federal law doesn’t outright ban machine guns, but it does heavily regulate them. Generally, machine guns are hard to acquire. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-11643	The Republicans and President Donald Trump "passed a tax bill that gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/16/democratic-national-committee/dnc-offers-one-sided-view-who-gets-tax-bills-benef/	The Democratic National Committee said one of President Donald Trump’s proudest achievements from his first year is really a giveaway to the country’s wealthiest people. "Trump and his party spent the better part of the year trying to take away health care from tens of millions of Americans to pay for a tax cut for the rich, and when that failed, they passed a tax bill that gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent," said a Medium post that the party published Jan. 16. A reader asked us to look into a couple of claims from the post. In this fact-check, we wondered whether it is correct that the Republican tax bill "gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent." The source footnoted in the post is an analysis of the final version of the tax bill by the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The Tax Policy Center analysis found that by 2027, the tax bill would deliver 82.8 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of the income spectrum. However, in earlier years, the distribution of benefits would look very different. For instance, in 2018, according to the center’s analysis, the bill would deliver 20.5 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent — vastly less than the 83 percent figure the DNC touted. And as late as 2025, the center projected, 25.3 percent of the benefits would flow to the top 1 percent. The main reason: By 2027, a number of key tax provisions that benefit middle-income taxpayers will have expired unless Congress extends them. In addition, the new tax law changed how inflation was calculated, in a way that will be less generous to taxpayers as time goes on. "How much of the benefit of the tax bill goes to the top 1 percent income group greatly depends on what year you are looking at," said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center. Our ruling The DNC said that the Republicans "passed a tax bill that gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent." That’s the case by 2027, due to the expiration of several important middle-income tax cuts and a change in how inflation is calculated. However, through 2025, the share of benefits going to the top 1 percent is much smaller, at roughly 20 percent to 25 percent. The DNC is cherry-picking by focusing on the tax bill’s impact by 2027, rather than the impact for the nearly a decade leading up to then. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-09344	"Early census returns are showing that conservatives have been measurably less likely than liberals to return their census forms."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/07/patrick-mchenry/rep-patrick-mchenry-claims-early-census-returns-ar/	Rep. Patrick McHenry, the ranking Republican on the House subcommittee that oversees the census, says he's worried that disparaging comments about the census by some Republican leaders is translating to lagging conservative participation. And the result, he warned, could be a competitive advantage for Democrats. "Early census returns are showing that conservatives have been measurably less likely than liberals to return their census forms," McHenry wrote in an op-ed for the conservative Red State. "Few things will make Nancy Pelosi happier than large numbers of conservatives failing to respond to the census," McHenry wrote. "If we do not respond, we will not be counted, and if we are not counted, then we effectively will not exist. That would reduce conservatives’ power in elections, allow Democrats to draw more favorable congressional boundaries and help put more tax-hiking politicians in office." McHenry said he is worried about "blatant misinformation (about the census) coming from otherwise well-meaning conservatives. They are trying to do the right thing, but instead they are helping big government liberals by discouraging fellow conservatives from filling out their census forms." McHenry didn't name names, but the census-bashers are well known. Back in June 2009, PolitiFact fact-checked two census claims made by Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn.: that ACORN would be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public; and that the Constitution doesn't require people to give information beyond how many people are in their home. We rated both claims Pants on Fire! "Unfortunately, the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked," Bachmann said then. "And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that." And on March 3, 2010, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, cast the lone vote in the House against a resolution to encourage participation in the 2010 census to ensure an accurate and complete count. (Bachmann, we note, voted for it). Explaining his vote, Paul said, it was "for the simple, obvious reason that the census- like so many government programs- has grown far beyond what the framers of our Constitution intended. The invasive nature of the current census raises serious questions about how and why government will use the collected information. It also demonstrates how the federal bureaucracy consistently encourages citizens to think of themselves in terms of groups, rather than as individual Americans. The not so subtle implication is that each group, whether ethnic, religious, social, or geographic, should speak up and demand its 'fair share' of federal largesse." Higher levels of mistrust in the census among Republicans was borne out in a Pew Research Center survey in mid-March that found nearly one in three Republicans did not think the Census Bureau would keep personal information confidential (slightly higher than the mistrust among Democrats). It also found that Republicans are more likely to believe the census will cost the government too much money; and that it will ask more than the government really needs to know. Still, we wondered if it was actually true that government distrust among some conservative Republicans really translated, as McHenry said, to early census returns showing that "conservatives have been measurably less likely than liberals to return their census forms." McHenry based that claim on a March 27, 2010, article in the Houston Chronicle which noted that conservative Texas was behind the national average in returning census forms and some of the lowest rates were in Texas’ most conservative counties. The article cites low return rates in Republican-dominated counties like Briscoe County in the Panhandle; King County, near Lubbock; Culberson County, near El Paso; and Newton County, in deep East Texas. It's true that, with a state participation rate of 56 percent as of April 6, 2010, the decidedly Republican Texas lagged behind the national average of 62 percent. Texas participation in returning the mail-in census forms also lagged behind the national average in 2000 too. And it's true that within Texas, all four of the counties mentioned in the Houston Chronicle article lagged well behind even the state average. But is that enough evidence to support McHenry's claim about an alleged national trend? Not according to several demographers we spoke to. First, all four of those counties are small. In 2008, King County had a whopping 202 registered voters. Together, the four counties comprise less than a tenth of 1 percent of the registered voters in Texas. Several census experts we spoke with said it would be a mistake to make any kind of conclusion about a state trend, let alone a national one, based on such a small sample. And we found that all four counties significantly trailed the state and national averages for returns in 2000 as well. "If they were low in 2000 and they are low now, it's not the effect of a new change," said Isaac W. Eberstein, a professor of sociology at Florida State University and director of the FSU's Center for Demography and Population Health. Eberstein also cautioned against concluding that because participation rates in those counties are low, and they are highly conservative, that means conservatives there are less likely to send the census back. In demographic circles, they talk about something called the ecological or aggregate fallacy, Eberstein said. The short version is that it's an error in interpreting statistical data to assume that everyone in a group -- in this case a county -- has all the same characteristics. In other words, it could be that conservatives in those counties are participating at average levels, but that liberals are not. Moreover, the counties appear to have been largely cherry-picked. We were easily able to locate numerous other counties in Texas that voted overwhelmingly in favor of Barack Obama in the 2008 election, but have participation rates similar to or lower than those four counties. At our request, Frances Deviney, senior research associate at the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Texas, prepared a spreadsheet that correlated voting records by Texas county in the 2008 presidential election with participation rates in the census so far. And contrary to the claim by McHenry, the statewide data showed that counties that had higher vote tallies for Republican John McCain have slightly higher participation rates in the census. "The short version is that what he's saying doesn't correlate with the data," Deviney said. Moreover, that Pew survey we mentioned earlier, while it did find partisan differences in attitudes about the census, it also found that a slightly higher percentage of Republicans (90 percent) than Democrats and independents (85 percent each) said they intend to participate in the census. And a slightly higher percentage of Republicans believe participating is a civic responsibility. "We are not seeing that there is any sign of a partisan difference in intention to participate," said Scott Keeter, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center. "Anti-government sentiment is not translating into the bottom line, according to our survey." We also looked at the participation rates of various states across the country, and found numerous examples of historically red states that have participation rates above the national average, as well as some below. Demographers we spoke with said they couldn't discern any pattern indicating that states with higher percentages of Republicans were sending forms back at lower rates than Democratic ones. In fact, Bachmann's Minnesota has one of the highest participation rates. Citing the participation rates of four small counties in Texas to make a generalization about a national trend is "reading more into selected information than is warranted," said demographer William O'Hare. "I can't think of any evidence I've seen that there are such widespread concerns that Republicans are being under-counted in the 2010 Census." Here's the thing about McHenry's statement: it seems plausible. There has been a good bit of media attention on anti-government sentiment and skepticism from some conservative leaders relating to the census. It seems intuitive, then, that that might lead to lower participation rates among some segment of the conservative population. But so far, we haven't found any objective evidence that that's happening to any great degree. For McHenry to make a conclusion about a national trend based on low participation rates in four small Texas counties is a stretch. Especially when one considers that these were low-participating counties in the last census too; and that there are lots of other low-participating counties in Texas that are not conservative. On top of that, the Pew survey shows that while Republicans may be more distrustful of the census, they are by and large planning to participate, even at slightly higher rates that Democrats. Also, an independent review of all the counties in Texas showed that not only is McHenry's claim unfounded, the opposite is more likely true -- as counties that voted for McCain over Obama in 2008 have had slightly higher participation rates. And while decidedly conservative Texas has lagged behind the national average, there are lots of red states performing above the national average as well. A spokeswoman from McHenry's office told us he was just trying to be proactive and encourage all Americans to be counted. It's hard to find fault with that. Still, we just don't find any evidence that his premise that conservatives have been less likely to return their census forms than liberals is true. We rule McHenry's statement False.

pomt-12966	"Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All Book"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/27/newsexaminernet/fake-news-site-falsely-claims-obama-gay-muslim/	Social media users continue to be fooled by a fake news story touting a book allegedly written by a Secret Service agent claiming President Barack Obama is both Muslim and gay, but the entire claim should be cataloged under fiction. "Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All Book," the headline on a story from the site NewsExaminer.net reads. The post is dated only "six months ago," but there’s evidence the fake story goes back to 2015. Social media users flagged the story as being potentially fake as part of the Facebook’s efforts to battle fake news. This one certainly qualifies. The story says a former agent named Paul Horner had written the book, titled The Black House: A 12-year former Secret Service agent explains why Obama and the First Lady are ruining this country. The book was "quickly climbing Amazon’s best-seller charts," according to the post. The article says that Horner confirmed the lascivious details of the book to an NBC senior political analyst named Tom Downey. Everything about the story — the book, the author, the interview and certainly the details contained therein — is fake. NewsExaminer.net describes itself as "the place to find what's shaping your world. We curate the most important and engaging news so you don't have to." The site is filled with fake news articles, but there’s no apparent disclaimer that the writing is supposed to be satirical. The same story circulated on fake news site NBC.com.co on Oct. 2, 2015, and was resurrected at ABCNews.com.co on Nov. 16, 2016. Neither site is affiliated with the networks they attempt to represent. The stories cite the Associated Press as the source of a photo of the book used in the posts. Paul Horner is an oft-used name in satirical and joke articles, but is also the name of "a serial hoaxer and lead writer for National Report," a fake news site, as described by the Washington Post. There is no NBC analyst named Tom Downey, and there also is no such book on Amazon, although there are other books with similar titles. The absurd nature of the allegations should be a tip-off that the story is fake, although many of the commenters do not seem to understand the content is fabricated. In the make-believe interview, Horner tells Downey that Obama constantly berated Christians, forced the pretend agent to listen to Diana Ross and had staff harass a Facebook page about a masturbating dolphin. This is a fake story that has been circulating for more than a year without any indication that it is bogus.

pomt-12421	Says Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez "declared that she would not detain known criminals accused of violent crimes."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2017/may/18/greg-abbott/torching-greg-abbotts-claim-travis-county-sheriff-/	Greg Abbott gave a backhanded howdy (or the back of his hand) to a Democratic sheriff in May 2017 before he approved the Republican-driven proposal intended to keep local communities from shielding unauthorized immigrants from deportation. The governor explained his support of Senate Bill 4 during what may have been the planet's first exclusively Facebook Live signing of legislation into law: "This law cracks down on policies like the Travis County sheriff who declared that she would not detain known criminals accused of violent crimes. Those policies are sanctuary city policies and won’t be tolerated in Texas. Elected officials and law enforcement agencies, they don’t get to pick and choose which laws they will obey." Three days earlier, the referenced sheriff, Sally Hernandez, issued a statement suggesting that while SB 4 wouldn’t enhance public safety, she'd go along: "While I hate seeing a state law like this come to pass," Hernandez said, "I have always followed the law and that will not change." We previously found False an Abbott claim that Hernandez was refusing to enforce a federal law regarding communication about jailed immigrants. The sheriff's published policy declares otherwise. Still, did Hernandez declare that she wouldn’t detain known criminals accused of violent crimes, as Abbott said? Abbott offers no backup We asked Abbott’s office for the basis of his fresher claim and didn’t hear back. You could read the governor to have said that Hernandez, who was sworn in as sheriff in January 2017, put in place rules against keeping convicts accused of violent crimes behind bars — a broad unsupported charge given that the county continues to prosecute crimes of all kinds. But in the context of Abbott's mention of "sanctuary city policies," he surely was referring to Hernandez’s announced policy, effective Feb. 1, 2017, that the county would no longer automatically grant requests by federal authorities to "detain" specified suspects for up to 48 hours so agents could investigate and possibly hasten deportation. Hernandez, in her January 2017 announcement of the policy, said the department would honor ICE detainer requests only if an inmate was charged with or convicted of capital murder, murder, aggravated sexual assault or human smuggling — or if federal agents obtained a court order or arrest warrant for a suspect. Otherwise, inmates would be able to post bail and be released, no matter their immigration status. Hernandez said before the policy took effect: "Our community is safer when people can report crimes without fear of deportation. I trust the court system and our judges to assess the risks and set appropriate bonds and conditions for all who are incarcerated." Policy says… Let’s look at the wording of the policy, then gauge whether, as Abbott said, Hernandez was saying she wouldn’t detain known criminals charged with violent acts. The policy states the sheriff’s office "shall comply with ICE detainer requests under the following circumstances: (a) when the detainer request is accompanied by a judicial warrant or court order for continued detention or notification, to the extent required by the judicial warrant or court order; or (b) when the individual who is the subject of the ICE detainer is charged with or has been convicted of the following felonies under Texas law: (1) Capital Murder, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 19.03; (2) Murder -- First Degree, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 19.02; (3) Aggravated Sexual Assault, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 22.021, and (4) Continuous Smuggling of Persons, Tex. Penal Code Sec. 20.06." Separately, we noticed, the policy leaves wiggle room for the sheriff to hold inmates facing other charges. A portion states the office "reserves the right to exercise discretion in any individual case to ensure that justice is served." Policy in practice When we asked the sheriff’s office about Abbott’s claim, spokeswoman Kristen Dark said by email that no inmates placed in the Travis County Jail "will be released without making bond or having his or her charges disposed by a judge." Abbott’s description of the sheriff’s detainer policy, Dark wrote, wasn’t accurate because the policy provides for detainers to be granted automatically for several violent crimes and also gives the office discretion to "ensure that justice is served." Dark wrote: "In each and every case," the office’s "command staff reviews an inmate’s current charge/s as well as criminal history. If there is any indication of violence in that data, the ICE Detainer Request is honored," she said. A spreadsheet We asked Dark if the agency had recently analyzed when jail personnel approved or rejected ICE detainer requests. In reply, Dark emailed us a spreadsheet, covering department decisions from March 1, 2017 through May 5, 2017, which she described as its May 5, 2017, response to an open-records request by KUT News. The sheet doesn’t show past convictions for any crimes, so we didn’t see a way to reach conclusions about individuals not being detained despite their criminal histories. But what about letting individuals go despite current violent-crime charges? Over the two-plus months, according to the sheet, ICE detainer requests were approved by the department for around 200 individuals charged with crimes, with many individuals listed as remaining in jail. Charges filed against the detainer-approved individuals include sexual abuse of a child; manslaughter; aggravated sexual assault; and driving while intoxicated, according to the sheet. The sheet identifies 15 individuals already released to ICE in response to detainer requests. Related charges include DWI; assault causing bodily injury; aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (two men); terroristic threat of a family member; manufacture of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver; possession of marijuana; burglary of a habitation; sexual indecency with a child; and aggravated sexual assault of a child. On the flip side, the sheet lists about 90 individuals mostly released by the county after detainer requests were denied. Many of the people were arrested for allegedly driving while intoxicated or possessing small amounts of marijuana, neither of which would necessarily signal a violent crime. We counted nine individuals among the 90 who were each arrested for an alleged assault causing bodily injury to a family member--domestic violence, Dark told us by phone. Eight of these inmates were released on personal recognizance bonds, the sheet states, after the sheriff declined to approve a detainer requested by ICE; the ninth was released by a judge’s order, the sheet says. We asked Dark about the rationale for declining detainers on those individuals. By email, Dark replied: "The nature of the behavior that resulted in the arrests was not aggravated and therefore, did not meet the threshold required for" the office to automatically "honor the ICE detainer request." Dark said by phone that further research revealed that five of the individuals had previously been released to ICE, possibly even deported. Dark’s email said: "If ICE has past experience with the individuals, they should know the status and be able to quickly get a warrant or court order. If presented with a warrant," the sheriff’s office "would gladly have turned these inmates over to ICE upon the disposition of their charges by a judge," Dark said. The sheet shows too that a man who allegedly made a terroristic threat was released on a personal recognizance bond after the sheriff denied a detainer request. Dark said by email the individual had allegedly told a security guard at a bar, "I’m going to shoot you." Dark said no weapon was found in his possession. Our ruling Abbott said Hernandez "declared that she would not detain known criminals accused of violent crimes." That’s a distortion of Hernandez’s statements and her announced policy. The sheriff made it clear she wouldn’t automatically honor all requests to hold suspects for ICE. But the policy specifies several violent crimes for which the department directly grants the hold requests and it reserves the office’s right to exercise discretion in the interests of justice. Abbott, a seasoned judge and former state attorney general, should know better. We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-10161	"There are so many loopholes ... our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/30/barack-obama/obama-oversimplifies-corporate-taxes/	In the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, 2008, Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama sparred briefly over corporate tax rates. One of the hallmarks of McCain's tax platform is his plan to reduce the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. McCain often compares that 35 percent rate to those in other countries to bolster his point that America competes for businesses and jobs internationally, and he did so again in the debate. "Right now, the United States of America’s businesses pay the second-highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent," McCain said. "Now, if you’re a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where it’s 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, you’re going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera. "I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in the United States of America and create jobs." Obama challenged McCain for presenting misleading numbers. "Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he’s absolutely right," Obama said. "Here’s the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world." Who’s right? McCain accurately cites the United States’ top corporate tax rate. Combined with state corporate taxes (which vary), the statutory corporate tax rates for the United States are among the highest in the world. Three years ago, the Congressional Budget Office compared U.S. corporate tax rates to other countries to get a sense of where we stand. They found that the United States’ statutory corporate tax rates in 2003 came to 39.3 percent. Only Japan (40.9) and Germany (39.6) were higher. Among the top industrialized countries, the United States ranked third of seven. But the corporate tax picture is more complex than McCain — and that statistic — makes it seem. Note the word "statutory" in the last paragraph. It excludes other very important factors such as a country’s depreciation system (how quickly businesses are allowed to write off investment in equipment and buildings); how much companies can write off from debt; and investor-level taxes such as capital gains, dividends and interest. That’s why many economists like to cite "effective marginal tax rates," the percentage of the income from an investment that must be paid as corporate income tax. The United States fares much better in these tables, although it varies by industry and other factors, such as how much a company borrows for equipment or structures (generally, the more debt a company carries, the more it can write off). The United States has fairly generous depreciation rules, but is less generous when it comes to investment in structures. So, for example, the United States ranks second lowest in the world among industrialized nations when it comes to the effective corporate tax rates for debt-financed investments in machinery. For equity-financed investments in machinery, the rates are closer to the upper middle of the pack. And for equity-financed investments in industrial structures (buildings, factories, etc), the effective corporate tax rates were second highest in the world (behind Japan). As an aside, it is precisely this tax system, weighted to favor debt-financed investments, that's part of why the current credit crisis is seen as so dire. The nonpartisan, business-backed Tax Foundation noted in a news release this summer that "while America has left the major features of its business tax system unchanged over the past 15 years, virtually all developed nations have lowered their corporate tax rates, potentially hurting the competitiveness of the United States." The statutory rates — nearly the highest in the world — should not be discounted, they argue. And while marginal "effective" rates put the United States more around the middle of the pack, they say, America's effective tax rate has largely stayed the same while other countries have lowered theirs. But the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center tends to agree with Obama's acounting. "In any company, these deductions reduce the tax rates well below what the statutory rule is," said the center’s Bob Williams. "It depends on the type of company and the kinds of investments you are making." While the Tax Foundation and the Tax Policy Center disagree somewhat on how important the statutory tax rate is and where the United States ranks among nations based upon the marginal "effective" rates, they do agree that the statutory rate is only part of the story for what U.S. companies pay in taxes. McCain’s repeated citation of statutory corporate tax rates is misleading because it does not take into account various deducations to which businesses are entitled. But we also think Obama’s assertion that these deductions result in the United States having one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the world similarly oversimplifies things. It’s true for some business, particularly ones that can write off a lot of debt payments. But it’s not true for others. So we rate Obama’s statement Half True.

pomt-04249	Barack Obama is "only the second Democrat in the last 75 years to win Ohio twice with more than 50 percent of the vote."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/16/chris-redfern/chris-redfern-says-obama-first-democrat-75-years-g/	As the kids like to say nowadays, Chris Redfern had swag. A mere 12 or so hours removed from Barack’s Obama’s crowning win in the pivotal Buckeye state, the head of the Ohio Democratic Party was basking in the glow of the Democratic victory during a Nov. 7 news conference. While Obama’s victory in Ohio was a big win for Democrats, Republicans had won their share of down ballot races maintaining overwhelming majorities among Ohio’s congressional delegation, at the Statehouse as well as on the Ohio Supreme Court. But Redfern would hear none of it, saying he laughs when he hears his Republican counterpart, GOP Chief Bob Bennett, call Ohio a "centrist-right" state as he is frequently quoted as saying. "Ohio today is not a centrist-right state," said Redfern. "Barack Obama won this state for the second time and becomes, I believe, only the second Democrat in the last 75 years to win Ohio twice with more than 50 percent of the vote. There is nothing center-right about that." Setting aside the debatable question of whether Ohio is center-right or not, Redfern’s statement about the historic majority of Obama’s back-to-back wins in Ohio was intriguing. Did it really place Obama in such rarified Democratic air? While the digging for Politifact usually involves asking the source for citations to back it up, we knew right where to find the official record for this—the Ohio Secretary of State’s office where historical data on elections is kept. The records on Secretary of State Jon Husted’s website show that Obama unofficially has been credited with receiving 50.2 percent of the vote against Mitt Romney, and received 51.5 percent of the vote in 2008 against Republican John McCain. So as Redfern has crowed, Obama did achieve a majority in two elections in a row. Before Obama this year, the last Democrat to win Ohio twice in a run for president was Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. But while winning Ohio twice on his way to eight years in the White House, Clinton only managed 47.4 percent of the vote in 1996 and 40.2 percent in 1992. As you may recall, the 1992 election was a spirited three-way race with George Bush Sr. getting 38.3 percent of the vote and independent H. Ross Perot grabbing 21 percent in Ohio. Democratic president Jimmy Carter narrowly carried Ohio in 1976 by 11,000 votes on his way to a victory over Gerald Ford but lost it in 1980 by a landslide to Ronald Reagan. Democratic president Lyndon Johnson won Ohio in 1968, but was only on the ballot once as the presidential candidate as was the case with Democrat Harry Truman in 1948. In 1944, Democrat Franklin Roosevelt lost Ohio to Thomas Dewey by 12,000 but still won the presidency, but in 1940 Roosevelt did knock off Wendell Willkie in Ohio by a healthy margin. That was 72 years ago and the last time prior to Obama’s victory Nov. 6 that a Democrat got a second presidential win in Ohio by a majority.. Roosevelt’s first win with more than 50 percent came in 1936, 76 years ago. That’s when he beat Kansas Gov. Alf Landon by roughly 600,000 votes, easily a majority in Ohio. (He carried Ohio in 1932 but didn't quite reach 50 percent of the vote.) So what are we left with here as we turn back from the history books? Following Obama’s win in Ohio on Nov. 6, Democratic Party Chief Chris Redfern argued that Ohio was not a "centrist-right" state despite that characterization by Ohio Republican Party Chairman Bob Bennett. To make his argument, Redfern said Obama was only the Democrat to twice carry Ohio with a majority in the last 75 years. It turns out Redfern is right. Franklin Roosevelt was the last Democrat to carry Ohio twice with a majority, which he did in 1936 and 1940. And his second win did fall within the last 75 years. On the Truth-O-Meter, Redfern’s claim rates True.	None	Chris Redfern	None	None	None	2012-11-16T06:00:00	2012-11-07	['Ohio', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Barack_Obama']

"She stood by ground zero workers who sacrificed their health after so many sacrificed their lives and kept standing till this administration took action," the announcer says. As you might expect for a senator from the state where the deadliest attack occurred, the record indicates she has been a consistent advocate for workers who responded to the World Trade Center and cleaned up the debris after the two buildings were destroyed. Soon after the attacks, Clinton and fellow New York Sen. Charles Schumer pushed legislation to aid New York City's recovery. She also has been a proponent of government programs to track the health of workers who were exposed to smoke and dust at the site. The doctors who monitored the workers' health credited Clinton with steering $12-million to a Centers for Disease Control program for that work. Clinton has testified at hearings on the health status of 9/11 workers, and she has publicly criticized the Environmental Protection Agency for its early statement that the air at the World Trade Center site was safe. There is considerable evidence that she has been active on issues to help and protect the workers, so we find her claim to be True.

pomt-04370	"The poverty rate amongst women is the worst it’s been in 17 years and the extreme poverty rate is the worst it’s ever been."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/oct/22/george-allen/george-allen-says-womens-poverty-rate-highest-17-y/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen recently lamented the financial hardships facing women and said they would benefit from his general formula for fixing the economy: cut government spending, regulation and taxes. "The poverty rate amongst women is the worst it’s been in 17 years and the extreme poverty rate is the worst it’s ever been," he said. We asked the Allen campaign to back up its statistics. In a response on its website, the campaign cited a number of articles about the difficulties women encounter in seeking work and making ends meet. Among them was a story from The Daily Beast that details how women, single women and female-headed households were worse off in the Census Bureau’s 2010 survey of households than in the previous year. Women in Poverty The story, written in September 2011, accurately notes that the 2010 census survey found that 46.3 million of all Americans -- 15.1 percent -- lived in poverty. It found that 25.5 million women -- 16.3 percent -- lived in poverty. In 2010, the Census Bureau standard for poverty was $22,113 in earnings for a family of four with two children or $11,139 for an individual. The bureau has data reaching back to 1966. As the article claimed and Allen correctly repeated, the poverty rate for women in 2010 was the highest since 1993, or 17 years, when it reached 16.9 percent. The rate fell to 12.6 percent in 2001 and has been trending up every since. The census bureau, which releases its poverty report every September, has updated its data since the story Allen cited was published. In 2011, the poverty rate for women continued at 16.3 percent, while for all Americans, it fell slightly to 15 percent. Women in Extreme Poverty Extreme poverty is defined as living at half the poverty rate. In 2011, that meant earnings of $5,742 or less for an individual and $11,405 for a family of four with two children. In 2011, 6.6 percent of Americans and 7.2 percent of women fell into that category. That’s the highest figure since the Census Bureau started tracking extreme poverty in 1988. So Allen is right. Why are there more women in poverty than men? Much of the reason is related to a wage gap, said Joan Entmacher, vice president for family economic security at The National Women’s Law Center. A large reason in the difference between poverty among men and women is primarily related to the wage gap, she said. As we’ve previously written, full-time employed women make 77 cents to every dollar full-time employed men make. Several studies have concluded that only a small portion of the difference is caused by sexism. Women generally choose occupations that have relatively low wages and take more time off than men for childbirth and child care. "Women remain disproportionately in traditionally female occupations, which pay low- and very-low wages, certainly as compared to more integrated and traditionally male occupations," said Wendy Pollack, director of the Women’s Law & Policy Project at the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, a nonprofit in Chicago that develops programs and advocates for policies to help the poor. Entmacher said cuts in public spending during recent years have particularly hurt women. "Teachers were the largest group of public sector employees affected and teacher jobs are held at a rate of about 70 percent by women," she said. "So public-sector job losses have been a real drag on the recovery for women." Our ruling Allen said, "The poverty rate amongst women is the worst it’s been in 17 years and the extreme poverty rate is the worst it’s ever been." The numbers back him up. We rate his statement True.	None	George Allen	None	None	None	2012-10-22T06:00:00	2012-10-08	['None']

In this context, it's impossible to define incivility, although there have been highly publicized incidents of conflict among the justices. And whether incivility affects the court's productivity is a matter of opinion. We can, however, test Fallone's claim that the court is deciding fewer cases. Disorder in the court Perhaps most Wisconsin voters planning to vote in the Feb. 19, 2013, primary for the Supreme Court (attorney Vince Megna is the third candidate) don’t follow the court’s inner workings. But it was hard to ignore headlines in June 2011 that revealed that Justice Ann Walsh Bradley had accused Justice David Prosser of putting his hands around her neck. Other witnesses said Bradley came at Prosser with fists raised and he put up his hands to block her or push her back. The June 2011 confrontation came during a discussion on the day before the high court released a 4-3 decision upholding Gov. Scott Walker's highly controversial bill to curtail the collective bargaining rights of public employees. A special prosecutor investigated the incident and decided not to file any criminal charges. On Feb. 13, 2013, news surfaced that Bradley had received stepped-up security from law enforcement more than two months before the incident.) Rancor on the court had already been an issue. In March 2011, it was revealed that 13 months earlier, Prosser called Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson a "bitch" and threatened to "destroy" her. And in June 2010, the justices deadlocked 3-3 on whether Justice Michael Gableman violated judicial ethics with an attack ad he used in 2008 against his Supreme Court opponent. Roggensack was elected in April 2003 to a 10-year term on the court. That's an important time element in evaluating Fallone's claim, given that he contends that if he replaced Roggensack, relations among the justices would improve. State statistics State court information officer Tom Sheehan told us the most readily available statistics on opinions issued by the Supreme Court cover six terms -- 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. New terms, for purposes of deciding cases, start each September. We found that the court has issued an average of 65 opinions in civil and criminal cases per year during that span: Term '06-07 '07-08 '08-09 '09-10 '10-11 '11-12 Civil 47 49 43 40 44 42 Criminal 17 25 21 23 18 20 Total 64 74 64 63 62 62 So, in five of the past six terms, which cover the majority of the time Roggensack has served on the Supreme Court, the number of opinions issued has not dropped off but rather stayed within a narrow range. Indeed, the court issued virtually the same number of civil and criminal case opinions in the term after the Prosser-Bradley incident (2011-2012) as it did in each of the three previous terms. Fallone's figures Fallone told us that attorneys who have appeared before the state Supreme Court believe tensions among the justices rose notably in 2008 during Gableman’s run for the court. That’s inconsistent with when Fallone said the drop-off in opinions occurred -- following the court’s 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 terms. But let’s take a look. Fallone cited a report that indicates that from January through August of 2005 -- in other words, the latter part of the 2004-2005 term -- the Supreme Court issued 129 opinions. (Fallone spokesman Nathan Schwantes said Fallone focused on the January-through-August period because that's when the vast majority of opinions are issued during a term.) Fallone also cited a report that indicates that from January through August of 2006, the latter part of the 2005-2006 term, 98 opinions were issued. Both figures are considerably higher than the figures we listed above for the six most recent terms. But Fallone is mixing apples and oranges -- and ending up with an overcount. Sheehan, the state courts spokesman, told us that older reports, such as the two Fallone cited, combine civil and criminal opinions with opinions issued in attorney discipline cases, thus producing a higher total number of opinions. Reports in more recent years, he said, break out tallies for opinions issued in the three types of cases. Fallone also said his own "hard count" of opinions issued in 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 indicate there were more than 100 opinions issued in civil and criminal cases in each term. But even if he were correct, that would indicate the number of opinions issued dropped off before 2008, which is when Fallone says tensions among the justices spiked upward. Going back further Fallone also cited a 2010 article in the magazine of the Wisconsin Public Research Institute, a conservative think tank, which argued that discord among the justices led to reduced productivity. The article said the state Supreme Court was issuing fewer opinions than it had in "decades," but the statistics it cited lumped attorney discipline cases in with civil and criminal cases that were decided by opinion. We examined annual reports from the court dating to 1992, hoping to gather two decades’ worth of data, but there were two problems. Reports issued before 2006-2007 did not provide separate statistics for opinions issued in civil and criminal cases -- the opinions in attorney discipline cases were included in the totals. Moreover, the tallies were on a calendar-year basis, rather than following the September-through-August Supreme Court terms, like the newer reports do. Our rating Citing incivility on the Supreme Court in the past several years, Fallone said the court's justices are "deciding fewer opinions in civil and criminal cases than they used to." But he doesn’t provide evidence to establish that. Official figures show the number has been steady in the six most recent Supreme Court terms, which dates to when Fallone suggests that tensions on the court were high. We rate his statement False.

pomt-00877	Eliminating affirmative action in admissions in Florida led to "more African American and Hispanic kids attending our university system" than before.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/mar/11/jeb-bush/florida-has-more-black-and-hispanic-university-stu/	Former Gov. Jeb Bush still hasn’t announced a 2016 presidential run, but he is trumpeting his conservative record on subjects like affirmative action. "I eliminated affirmative action by executive order -- trust me, there were a lot of people upset about this," Bush said at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 27, 2015. "But through hard work we ended up having a system where there were more African American and Hispanic kids attending our university system than prior to the system that was discriminatory." It’s been some time since Bush ended race-based admissions policies, so we wondered if more African American and Hispanic students are attending state universities now than when affirmative action was in place. 'One Florida' Bush signed an executive order implementing the "One Florida" plan in 1999, which banned racial preference in state school admissions. It also created a program guaranteeing that the top 20 percent of high school graduates would gain admission to a post-secondary institution and some funding for need-based financial aid. Florida is now one of a handful of states preventing race-based admissions policies and the only one to do so by executive order. Other states had done so by ballot initiative, a route that ran into obstacles in Florida when supporters tried and failed to put a constitutional amendment on the 2000 ballot. Bush’s spokeswoman did not comment, but the first thing we should note is that in terms of sheer numbers, Bush has some evidence to back himself up. From 1999 to 2013, the latest year for which data is available, overall enrollment for black students went up from about 33,000 to almost 44,000. It was the same for Hispanics (students from a Spanish-speaking culture), which shot up from just less than 33,000 students to almost 80,000. But those numbers were going up as overall enrollment was going up dramatically. From 1999 to 2013, the State University System increased enrollment by 45 percent, much higher than the national average of around 25 percent in the same time period. The question really is, did the ratio of black and Hispanic enrollment go up after Bush’s executive order? Well, yes and no. We took a look at all state university fall enrollment, broken down by black and Hispanic students, going back to 1995. Data from the Florida Board of Governors show that black enrollment declined slightly in recent years from 14 percent in 1999 to 13 percent in 2013. Hispanic enrollment, meanwhile, have almost doubled to nearly 24 percent. One thing to keep in mind is that post-2010 data can’t be fairly compared to pre-2010 data. That’s because the U.S. Department of Education in 2007 decided to change racial and ethnic classifications by the 2011-12 school year. The new categories included a "multiple races" choice and weighted classifications for students who answered "yes" when asked if they are Hispanic. Choosing Hispanic overrides racial selections and results in more students categorized as Hispanic. The reclassification also has resulted in fewer students reporting as black and white, according to the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the State University System. But as the graph shows, the trend for more students to report as Hispanic started even before the Department of Education decided to change the categories. Experts told us there are several reasons for these changes, but it doesn’t appear it’s because of the One Florida program. Troy Miller, associate director for research and policy for the student advocacy group the Florida College Access Network, said demographics are part of the equation. Overall enrollment is up because there are more K-12 students in the state than there were in 1999, and more of them (including black and Hispanic students) are graduating than before. Also, college admissions are going up in large part because of the Bright Futures program, started in 1997. Our ruling Bush said that eliminating affirmative action in admissions led to "more African American and Hispanic kids attending our university system" universities than before. The raw numbers of black and Hispanic students are up, but the percentage of black students in the State University System is down slightly since Bush’s 1999 executive order. The number of Hispanic students has gone up considerably, but that is partly because of a recent change in how students report ethnicity during the admissions process. There’s no hard evidence Bush’s One Florida program had much to do with the enrollment changes. Experts say demographics, graduation rates and state-sponsored scholarship money have had more influence. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-02676	"There are many studies that indicate" that the longer people get unemployment insurance, "it provides some disincentive to work."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/09/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-longer-people-get-unemployment-insu/	Just days before the U.S. Senate began consideration of a bill to renew expiring benefits for the long-term unemployed, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., raised questions about how effective such a policy would be. Appearing on the Jan. 5, 2014, edition of ABC’s This Week, Paul said he was concerned "that the longer you have it, that it provides some disincentive to work, and that there are many studies that indicate this. So, what I've been saying all along, we have to figure out how to create jobs and keep people from becoming long-term unemployed." Paul has taken some heat from critics for previous comments about extended unemployment benefits. On Dec. 8, 2013, Paul said on Fox News, "When you allow people to be on unemployment insurance for 99 weeks, you're causing them to become part of this perpetual unemployed group in our economy. And it really - while it seems good, it actually does a disservice to the people you're trying to help." Here, we wanted to look at studies on unemployment insurance, and whether he’s correct that "there are many studies that indicate" that the longer people get unemployment insurance, "it provides some disincentive to work." Overall, we found that, in a literal sense, Paul’s recent comments are carefully crafted and largely correct: Such studies do indeed exist. However, there’s a fair amount of debate among economists about what that conclusion actually means for economic policymaking, particularly on the question of whether cutting off long-term benefits actually boosts employment. A look back at the research In a fact-check we published back in 2009, we noted some commonly cited papers that seemed to back up Paul’s statement, both co-authored in 1990 by Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist who once worked in the Clinton administration, and fellow economist Bruce D. Meyer. In one of these papers, published in the Journal of Public Economics, the authors looked at U.S. unemployment data from 1979 to 1983, and concluded that increasing unemployment insurance by six to 12 months could increase unemployment by four to five weeks, and a duration of 24 months could mean an increase of up to 16 weeks. When we checked with an ideologically diverse group of economists for this article, they cited a number of other, more recent papers that found longer unemployment benefits tended to increase the duration of unemployment. For instance: • In a May 2013 study, Henry Farber of Princeton and Robert Valletta of the Federal Reserve Board of San Francisco concluded that extended benefits in the aftermath of the Great Recession raised the average duration of unemployment by 7 percent and caused the unemployment rate to increase by 0.4 percentage points. The effect, they found, was especially strong among those unemployed for at least six months. An article Valletta co-authored with his Federal Reserve Board of San Francisco colleague Katherine Kuang in 2010 concluded that even though a 0.4 percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is modest, it still "represents about 600,000 potential workers who could become virtually unemployable if their reliance on (unemployment insurance) benefits were to continue indefinitely." • In an October 2013 study, four co-authors -- Marcus Hagedorn, Fatih Karahan, Iourii Manovskii, Kurt Mitman -- concluded that "most of the persistent increase in unemployment during the Great Recession can be accounted for by the unprecedented extensions of unemployment benefit eligibility." They didn’t think that longer benefit periods cut down on unemployed workers’ efforts to search for jobs, though. Rather, they said, extended benefits tended to raise prevailing wages in the wider labor market, which in turn made companies less likely to increase the number of jobs on their payroll. How to interpret these findings Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said Paul is on "safe ground" with his claim. "It is fair to say that there have been ‘many studies’ of the impact of longer unemployment insurance durations on unemployment, re-employment, and labor force participation, and it is fair to say that a sizeable majority of studies shows an impact that links longer potential benefit durations with longer spells of unemployment," Burtless said. At the same time, Burtless emphasized that this "truth" is open to misinterpretation. We found at least three possible concerns: • Not every unemployed person gets an unemployment check. In fact, Burtless says, only about one of every three unemployed Americans gets a check -- so whatever incentives are affecting unemployment-insurance beneficiaries could be outweighed by what’s happening among the unemployed Americans who aren’t receiving a check. If, for instance, beneficiaries of unemployment checks are refraining from taking jobs longer than they otherwise would, open jobs may be snapped up by the unemployed workers who aren’t getting a check. If so, the effect of longer benefits on the unemployment rate could end up being a wash. • Ending unemployment benefits reduces spending by the unemployed, which can lead to jobs being lost in the wider economy. The extra benefits unemployed workers get "represents extra income to some of the unemployed worker’s neighbors – the grocer, the dentist, the hardware store owner, a favorite restaurant and its servers," Burtless said. "Without spending financed by the unemployed worker’s extended unemployment benefits, the incomes of these other people will be lower. One or two of them might be laid off." • The end of extended benefits may push the unemployed out of the labor force, rather than into a job. Receiving an unemployment check is usually contingent on continuing to look for a job; once the checks stop and that requirement goes away, the incentive to keep looking declines. This poses a problem for tracking changes in the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate can drop for one of two reasons -- either unemployed people are moving into jobs, or unemployed people are moving out of the labor force (and thus moving out of the mathematical equation used to calculate the unemployment rate). A recent post by James Pethokoukis of the conservative American Enterprise Institute analyzed data from North Carolina, where the GOP-led legislature earlier this year cut unemployment benefits, both in amount and duration. "If you listen to Republicans," he wrote, "it’s worked out pretty well. The state’s unemployment rate has dropped to 8.0 percent in October from 8.8 percent in June." But while the number of unemployed residents plunged by 44,558 between June 2013 and October 2013, he found, the number of employed people increased by only 1,902. In other words, 96 percent of the decrease in unemployed North Carolinians over that period simply left the labor market, and the unemployment rate plunged for the "wrong" reason. If North Carolinians had simply left the labor market at a more typical rate, Pethokoukis wrote, "the state’s jobless rate would have increased to 9.1 percent rather than sharply declining." Our ruling Paul said that "there are many studies that indicate" that the longer people get unemployment insurance, "it provides some disincentive to work." Paul is on solid ground about the existence of studies that support this point; there are quite a few. But if Paul means to suggest that ending benefits actually increases employment, the support for that proposition is more mixed. In particular, there’s evidence that unemployed people may drop out of the labor market rather than find a job when they stop getting benefit checks. So Paul's statement is accurate, but needs additional information. On balance, we rate Paul’s claim Mostly True.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2014-01-09T11:42:12	2014-01-05	['None']

pomt-00764	"The same federal government that offers some money for a program is walking away from another health care program."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/apr/14/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-feds-walked-away-state-health-prog/	Florida simply can’t trust the federal government to follow through on expanding Medicaid because Washington has already abandoned funding a current statewide health care program, Gov. Rick Scott says. Scott is pointing to the state’s loss of federal money for safety net hospitals called the Low Income Pool. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services made it crystal clear in February 2015 that some $1.3 billion in Florida’s LIP funding won’t be renewed after June 30. That left a billion-dollar hole in Scott’s proposed budget, which assumed that LIP money would be available. "The same federal government that offers some money for a program is walking away from another health care program," Scott said during an April 9 stop in Sarasota. "How can you feel comfortable picking up another federal program when they are walking away from an existing program?" The Florida House and Senate are currently debating a potential state solution to Medicaid expansion, but this claim deals with the specifics of this LIP funding -- namely what it is, how it’s funded and when Washington told Florida they’d be doing without. The issue sounds confusing, but don’t worry, PolitiFact Florida will nurse you through it. Washington gets out of the pool LIP money is part of a special agreement between Florida and Washington called a Section 1115 waiver, and was approved to deal with a burgeoning number of uninsured adults who could not pay their medical bills. (Some other states have their own 1115 programs to deal with different issues.) The money mostly goes to safety net hospitals and clinics that treat uninsured and underinsured patients to reimburse some of their expenses. The LIP fund gets about $1.3 billion, but the entire 1115 waiver program includes other supplemental programs that together total about $2.2 billion in federal matching funds. Only the LIP money is at stake here. These waivers are designed essentially as policy experiments. A state has a problem not covered by Medicaid and comes to Washington to help fund a possible solution. Programs approved by the feds have a five-year time limit, and are subsequently renewed in three-year intervals or allowed to expire. Leighton Ku, director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University, said these waiver programs allow states to "substantially modify their Medicaid policies and finances, provided that the purposes still serve the underlying purpose of Medicaid and do not cost the federal government more than it would have spent otherwise." The LIP started in 2005 and was renewed until 2013. But when it came time to negotiate another extension for 2014 and beyond, Florida upped the funding request to a whopping $4.5 billion to expand the program. This was after the state refused some $51 billion in Medicaid expansion money over 10 years under the Affordable Care Act, to expand that program to anyone making up to about 133 percent of the poverty level, as the Obama administration wanted. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 ruled states had a choice whether to take the money or not. On April 11, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the state they were approving the LIP portion of the program for only one more year instead of the usual three-year extension. CMS required Florida to report how well the Medicaid system was working and suggest reforms, and asked the state to improve the system to work without federal LIP payments. The agency did not specifically mention expanding the program per the Affordable Care Act. Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute, said the federal government had been concerned that the LIP program had problems keeping track of how the money was being spent or how rates were being set, shown in part by a 2012 General Accounting Office report on transparency. There also were questions about how Florida was matching federal funds, an issue with Medicaid even before the LIP program. The one-year extension in 2014 was notice that the federal government wanted Florida to overhaul LIP. Now fast forward to 2015: Scott released his budget proposal in January assuming that LIP funding, which was set to expire June 30, would be available. But in February, Eliot Fishman, director of the Children and Adults Health Programs Group in the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, told an Orlando health care conference audience that there was "no way" the program would continue "in its present form." Fishman’s pronouncement threw Tallahassee into an uproar, as discussions about a $1 billion surplus suddenly turned to big gaps in the budget. On March 4, Scott sent a letter to President Barack Obama saying the state needed the money to help the uninsured, but the funding was "not associated with Medicaid expansion in any way." Scott has opposed the Medicaid expansion for relying on tax dollars and for requiring the state to assume 10 percent of the larger program’s cost by 2020. He recently earned a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter after a short time of supporting the expansion during his re-election campaign. Some have suggested Washington is withholding LIP money to strongarm Florida into the expansion, a move many doctors oppose because of Medicaid payment limits, among other problems. In many ways, LIP isn’t associated with Medicaid expansion, Alker said, given that LIP started while Jeb Bush was governor and George W. Bush was president. But an expanded Medicaid would cover many of those patients, or use preventive care to keep them out of the hospital to begin with, she said. Washington and Lee University professor Timothy Jost added that money for the Medicaid expansion was guaranteed by law in the Affordable Care Act, something not true about the program that created LIP, which is doled out as discretionary spending. (Jost supports the health care law.) Of course, it’s technically possible the federal government could change the law to do away with whatever program they like, including Medicaid. But that would require both houses of Congress and the president to agree on the terms, something "that isn’t likely to happen anytime soon," Jost said. Now Florida faces a tough set of choices: Find a new source of LIP funding, end the program altogether or negotiate with CMS to either revamp the program or get another extension, possibly for as short as one month. Florida also could decide to cover those patients by expanding Medicaid. With the Legislature still in session, experts said the result is anyone’s guess. But Alker said Scott was being disingenuous for blaming Washington for an issue they warned him was looming. "The LIP doesn’t fix the fundamental problem," Alker said. "The LIP is just a Band-Aid for the high rate of uninsured." Our ruling Scott said, "The same federal government that offers some money for a program is walking away from another health care program." He was contrasting Medicaid expansion with how the federal government set an end date for funding for the Low Income Pool, a program that helps pay hospitals that served uninsured patients. The federal government did say it would stop paying for the program, so Scott has a point about losing LIP money. But possible brinkmanship about Medicaid expansion aside, Washington gave plenty of notice it was going to let the experimental LIP program expire. CMS told Florida in April 2014 that it was no longer going to fund the current version of LIP after one more year. Several experts said Florida had time to evaluate the program, make changes and address funding. They also raised the point that federal LIP funding is discretionary, while Medicaid money is guaranteed by law, which is unlikely to change anytime soon. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-02400	With his proposal to cut income and property taxes, Scott Walker is "increasing the state deficit at a time when borrowing is already at record levels."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/10/we-are-wisconsin/gov-scott-walker-increasing-state-deficit-cutting-/	Many times Gov. Scott Walker has proclaimed that he has solved the state government’s budget problems. But his political opponents are not willing to cede the fiscal-conservative ground to him. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke has gone after Walker on this score, and on Feb. 17, 2014, she was joined by We Are Wisconsin, a union-backed group. In a mass email, the group criticized the Republican governor’s plan to cut income and property taxes. The group also made a claim by posing a question: "Irresponsible. What else can you say about increasing the state deficit at a time when borrowing is already at record levels?" For several weeks before the group made its claim, the news out of Madison was that the state expects a budget surplus approaching $1 billion. So, how is it that Walker is adding to a deficit? Is state borrowing at a record level? And, as importantly, is there a connection between the two? Surplus/deficit Let’s begin with the property and income tax cuts. After action by the state Assembly and Senate, they appeared, as of early March 2014, likely to become law. Walker proposed the cuts after the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau in mid-January 2014 projected that the state will see, mostly as a result of higher-than-expected tax collections, a $977 million surplus by the time the current two-year budget cycle ends in June 2015. So, how is it that there is talk of a deficit? When we asked We Are Wisconsin for evidence to back its claim, the group said it was using "deficit" as shorthand for "structural deficit." But the two are different things. The structural deficit isn’t a measure of any deficit of funds in the current state budget. Rather, as calculated by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the structural deficit is a rough estimate of how tax and spending commitments will line up during the next budget period -- in this case, for 2015-’17. So -- and this is an important point in this context -- we’re not talking about red ink like there is at the federal level, where the U.S. government adopts a budget with a deficit and then meets the difference by borrowing money that piles up as the national debt. In October 2013, after the state’s 2013-’15 budget was adopted, the fiscal bureau projected the structural deficit would be $725 million in 2015-’17. In January 2014, after Walker proposed the income and property tax cuts, thus reducing revenue, the fiscal bureau raised its structural deficit projection to $807 million. It’s worth noting that an $807 million structural deficit is relatively small. When Walker took office in January 2011, the 2011-’13 structural deficit exceeded $2.6 billion. Both Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, and Jon Peacock, head of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families’ Wisconsin Budget Project, said that since the term structural deficit doesn’t measure an actual deficit, a better term might be structural imbalance. That is, there is a projection that expenditures will exceed revenue down the road, which could create a deficit. But when the state fiscal bureau makes the projection, it does not attempt to estimate how much tax collections might grow. So, it’s possible that revenue growth, such as in the current budget cycle, will mean there is no actual deficit in the next budget cycle. So, it’s true that because Walker proposed property and income tax cuts, the structural deficit going into 2015-’17 is higher than it would have been if the 2013-’15 budget had simply remained in place. But that is not the same as saying the state has an actual deficit and that the deficit will increase. The debt Now let's look at the state debt and what connection it has to the structural deficit. To build roads and do other large-scale projects, the state takes on debt. The rationale for it is well understood: Costs can be spread out over years, so that future users of a new highway, for example, help pay the tab for building it. Borrowing, instead of paying cash for a major project, can also alleviate the need for a tax increase. However, debt can increase in other ways, too. Governors have responded to a structural deficit by, for example, restructuring debt payments to free up more money in exchange for extending debt payments further into the future. Or by moving money that had been segregated for transportation projects to the general fund and, in turn, borrowing more money for transportation projects. We Are Wisconsin cited a September 2013 fact-check we did that found that, in the first year of the current biennium -- 2013-’14 -- the state would allocate $738 million in general tax dollars toward debt payments. That’s 5.26 percent of general revenue and, according to the fiscal bureau, the highest such percentage on record. The figures for 2014-’15 are lower -- $708 million and 4.88 percent. As for the total amount of debt the state currently has -- most of which was accumulated before Walker -- that is also at a record level, exceeding $14 billion. But, to repeat, the state's structural deficit and its debt aren't directly connected. It's not as if an increase in the structural deficit -- which is a projection not actual red ink -- automatically increases the state's debt. Our rating We Are Wisconsin stated that, with his proposal to cut income and property taxes, Walker is "increasing the state deficit at a time when borrowing is already at record levels." The statement contains an element of truth in that state borrowing is at an all-time high -- but, flush with a nearly $1 billion surplus, it’s clear the state does not have a budget deficit. Moreover, an increase in the "structural deficit" -- a projection of a possible imbalance of expenditures and revenues in the future -- has no direct relation to how much the state borrows.

pomt-11407	Says Conor Lamb "ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/mar/22/donald-trump/did-conor-lamb-say-very-nice-things-about-trump-no/	Looking to put a positive spin on a stunning political upset, President Donald Trump said Democrat Conor Lamb — the yet-to-be-declared winner of last week’s closely watched special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district — "ran on a campaign that said very nice things about me." Trump made the comment at a private fundraiser for Missouri Senate candidate Josh Hawley a day after the March 13 election, The Washington Post reported. But did Lamb’s campaign actually say "very nice things" about the president, or was this an attempt to minimize a looming Republican loss in a reliably red district? What Lamb said about Trump Lamb said very little about the president during the expedited campaign to fill a seat vacated late last year by disgraced former U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy who held the spot for more than a decade. But Lamb also held off on criticizing the commander-in-chief at a time when many Democrats have made the president the focus of their calls to action. Lamb was careful not to alienate voters in the traditionally conservative district, said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll and professor of Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College. "Lamb did not want to arouse the Trump supporters in a district [Trump] won by 20 points," Madonna said. "He wanted the election to be local, where he could focus on his strengths." Asked if she agreed that the Lamb campaign had praise for Trump around points of agreement, campaign manager Abby Murphy said "No, I don't think it was ever that specific." She added: "What was important to the voters of this district were things like jobs and the heroin epidemic and infrastructure. I think the congressman-elect made it very clear that he’s willing to work with whomever to make those things happen. I think it’s very clear that that’s what his intent was." Lamb is the projected winner of the 18th District seat, with just a few hundred votes separating him and Republican candidate Rick Saccone, who conceded to Lamb on Wednesday. Votes were still being tallied and reviewed as of Wednesday, and the results remained unofficial. Republicans previously said they were considering challenging the results, alleging the vote was tainted by irregularities and other issues. On Tuesday, Trump said Saccone had narrowly lost the race, CNN reported. "It was really close," Trump told the crowd at a Republican fundraising event. "We went in there. They were down. Good man, Rick Saccone. Good man. And didn't quite make it. But lost, think of it, lost by about 300 votes out of all of those votes. So, it's pretty incredible. But we can't let it happen. We have to win. There's nothing like winning. We have to win." During the campaign, Lamb did express support for Trump’s plan to apply stiff tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. He also told The Atlantic, "We need the office of the presidency to succeed if we’re gonna make any progress on these issues," when asked what he thought of Trump. But experts argue that even if you judge those comments as charitable by 2018 political standards, Trump’s "very nice things" claim remains misleading. "I think the closest thing [Lamb] said to something complimentary about Trump was his endorsement of the [metals] tariffs," said Dave Weigel, a reporter who covered the District 18 campaign for The Washington Post. Weigel added, "What Lamb did instead, as you probably saw, was not mention the president and make the election more about the Republicans who run Congress." Lamb did criticize the tax cuts bill shepherded through Congress by Republicans and signed into law by the president last year. White House representatives declined to comment for this story. In an interview with Lamb for The Atlantic, assistant editor Elaine Godfrey wrote that Lamb was "careful not to present his candidacy as a way to oppose Trump," adding, "Yes, Trump is a historically unpopular leader, and Lamb is running against a Republican who once bragged that he was ‘Trump before Trump was Trump.’ But as members of the campaign team reminded me repeatedly, Lamb wants to focus solely on local issues, and doesn’t want the race to become a tribal contest." When asked about Trump directly, Godfrey wrote that Lamb offered this response: "We need the office of the presidency to succeed if we’re gonna make any progress on these issues. The number-one thing people talk about is wanting to get someone down there who’s actually gonna attack the problem, not attack the other side." Godfrey wrote that Lamb "never mentioned the president by name" in the course of their conversation. What Trump said about Lamb While Lamb remained largely silent on the subject of the White House, Trump didn’t always return the favor. At a March 10 rally for Saccone in Moon Township, the president referred to Lamb as "Lamb the sham" and said "I hear he’s nice looking. I think I'm better looking than him. I do. I do. I do." On CNN’s New Day program, host Alisyn Camerota asked Lamb about the "Lamb the sham" comment, but Lamb quickly pivoted back to the campaign. "Apart from that, there was a lot of foolishness in this election and a lot of cartoonish campaigning, and by the time of the president’s visit last weekend, people were kind of tired of that approach," he said. Asked about Trump saying he was "better looking," Lamb laughed. "I really have no opinion on that one." Our ruling Trump said Lamb said "very nice things" about him during the recent special election campaign in southwestern Pennsylvania. Lamb ran as a moderate Democrat in a conservative district and avoided openly criticizing the president. At times Lamb showed himself to be in agreement with Trump on certain policy points. But Trump equating this with high praise goes too far in interpreting and exaggerating what Lamb actually said. We found no evidence of Lamb lavishing praise on the president and instead found evidence of Lamb repeatedly pivoting away from the subject on the campaign trail. We rate this claim False.

pomt-14254	Says the Congressional Budget Office "is expecting a protracted economic malaise for at least the next decade under current policies."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/11/tom-price/does-cbo-report-suggest-us-economy-faces-decade-pr/	Is the U.S. economy headed into the toilet if nothing is done to change course? Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said as much when he released his committee’s 2017 budget resolution, which he also posted on Medium. At one point, Price and the committee wrote, "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects economic growth over the next decade to average just 2.1 percent — a drop off of roughly one-third from the long-term historical average of about 3.0 percent growth. In other words, CBO is expecting a protracted economic malaise for at least the next decade under current policies." For this state of affairs, the resolution blames "the current administration’s insistence on higher taxes, burdensome regulations, restrictions on the production of affordable, American-made energy, and a preference for crony capitalism over free markets is exactly the recipe for economic turmoil many predicted." We wondered whether Price was accurately quoting the CBO, so we looked at the original document. It turns out that he repeated CBO’s glass-half-empty comments while glossing over the agency’s alternate, glass-half-full interpretation. The CBO estimate comes from "The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2016 to 2026," released in January 2016. The number in question refers to inflation-adjusted "potential output," which is CBO’s best guess at the maximum growth the economy can achieve without triggering significant inflation. CBO projected 2.1 percent average annual growth between 2021 and 2026. (This is not the full decade, as the resolution indicates. However, the actual decade-long projection -- for the period 2016 to 2026 -- was even lower, at 1.9 percent, so we won’t quibble.) Here’s the full chart CBO provided. Beyond the numbers, CBO’s analysts offered both a darker interpretation and a rosier one. The darker interpretation was that 2.1 percent is low compared to long-term pattern of roughly 3 percent. The 2.1 percent figure "represents a significant slowdown" from the comparable growth rates that were achieved between 1981 and 2007," which was 3.1 percent, CBO wrote. But CBO also had a rosier interpretation -- that 2.1 percent "is substantially faster" than what has occurred since the end of 2007, which was 1.4 percent. The end of 2007 marked the start of the last recession. The House resolution also avoids mentioning a common belief among economists, which is that the United States is unlikely to see the rapid growth it experienced during the first few decades after World War II, when the country had fewer international competitors. For instance, when former 2016 Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush laid out a goal for 4 percent growth, he faced skepticism. It’s also worth noting that calling growth rates around 2 percent "protracted economic malaise" would rope in quite a few Republican presidents. According to a July 2014 paper by economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson, GDP growth hovered around 2 percent during the second term of President Dwight Eisenhower; the combined second term of President Richard Nixon and the tenure of his successor, President Gerald Ford; and the one term of President George H.W. Bush. And the growth rate for the second term of President George W. Bush was well below 1 percent. Tara Sinclair, an economist with George Washington University and the jobs website Indeed.com, said she considers the budget committee’s phrasing problematic. "Calling 2.1 percent growth ‘economic malaise’ is a bit strong given our demographics," Sinclair said. "It is frustrating that we never saw a bounce back of a recovery after the Great Recession to regain the lost output from that period, but at this point looking forward we wouldn't expect one now." When we contacted Price’s office, they stood by their characterization of CBO’s analysis and said that "economic growth projected to be one-third below the historical average is both cause for concern and emblematic of a poor-performing economy. … It is still underperforming, whether for a short while or long while." Our ruling Price, in the resolution his committee produced, wrote that the Congressional Budget Office "is expecting a protracted economic malaise for at least the next decade under current policies." Even granting Price some leeway for his use of the subjective term "protracted economic malaise," he cherry-picks what CBO wrote, offering its negative interpretation without acknowledging its positive interpretation. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Tom Price	None	None	None	2016-04-11T15:00:00	2016-03-28	['None']
pomt-05302	Says "as we sit right now, Medicare, if we do nothing, will be gone in eight years, if we do nothing to it."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/20/jon-runyan/rep-jon-runyan-claims-medicare-will-be-gone-eight-/	Do nothing, U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan said, and the nearly 50-year-old Medicare program will vanish in eight years. Runyan, a Republican representing parts of southern New Jersey, sounded that alarm during a May 4 interview with Michael Aron on NJTV’s "On the Record." "I was elected to make those hard (decisions) and have those serious discussions, and kicking the can down the road and not having those discussions and putting ideas out there on how to solve them, and how to actually preserve these programs for future generations, ‘cause as we sit right now, Medicare, if we do nothing, will be gone in eight years, if we do nothing to it," Runyan said. Medicare -- which provided healthcare coverage to 48.7 million Americans in 2011 -- is eight years away from ceasing to exist? Not at all, PolitiFact New Jersey found. One of Medicare’s two trust funds is set to run out of assets in 2024, but incoming tax revenues would still cover more than 60 percent of projected costs for decades to follow, according to estimates released in April by the trustees overseeing the funds. The second trust fund is to remain on solid financial ground indefinitely, the trustees said. Runyan spokesman Drew Fasoli told us the congressman meant to say that "‘Medicare as we know it’ would be gone and that as a consequence (there) could be a drop in the level of coverage." Now, let’s discuss that fund in financial trouble. The Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund covers Medicare Part A, which includes inpatient care at hospitals. The revenues behind that trust fund primarily come from payroll taxes. Any surplus revenues are credited to the trust fund in the form of government securities, which represents money the government owes itself. The trust fund also accounts for interest earned on those securities. Starting in 2008, there haven’t been enough revenues to fully cover Part A costs, leaving officials to make up the difference by redeeming those securities and spending interest earnings. That process is slated to continue until the fund is exhausted in 2024. Still, even after the HI trust fund is exhausted, tax revenues would still cover a portion of Part A expenses, starting at 87 percent of projected costs in 2024. "The Trustees project that the share of HI expenditures that can be financed with HI dedicated revenues will decline slowly to 67 percent in 2045, and then rise slowly until it reaches 69 percent in 2086," according to the trustees. It’s worth noting that the HI trust fund has faced a projected insolvency since nearly the time it was created, but lawmakers always have taken steps to prevent that from occurring. Due to a different type of financing, the accounts within the second fund, known as the Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) Trust Fund, "will remain in financial balance for all future years," the trustees said. That trust fund covers Medicare Parts B and D. Part B includes outpatient care and Part D relates to prescription drug coverage. Medicare coverage provided through private health plans -- known as Medicare Part C -- is financed by both trust funds. The six trustees overseeing both funds include the Secretary of the Treasury; the Secretary of Labor; the Secretary of Health and Human Services; the Commissioner of Social Security; and two other members appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Our ruling In a May 4 interview on "On the Record," Runyan claimed that "as we sit right now, Medicare, if we do nothing, will be gone in eight years, if we do nothing to it." One of Medicare’s two trust funds is on track to no longer fully cover certain benefits, but the entire program is not facing extinction. Even after that trust fund is exhausted in 2024, tax revenues would still cover more than 60 percent of projected costs for decades to follow. The second trust fund is to remain financially sound indefinitely. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-12636	"2.1 million jobs have been created in the last six or seven years" in California	true	/california/statements/2017/mar/29/jerry-brown/fact-checking-jerry-browns-claim-california-has-cr/	Democratic California Gov. Jerry Brown was asked during his recent appearance on NBC's Meet the Press why so many voters in the Golden State supported Hillary Clinton for president. Brown, a four-term governor, said the reason is simple: California’s job growth and prosperity. In doing so, Brown repeated a claim we rated True in January 2016 about just how many jobs have been created in the state in recent years. "People have jobs. 2.1 million jobs have been created in the last six or seven years," Brown said on March 26, 2017. "So, I think it’s that sense of economic security that makes the difference. If we had the same insecurity as Akron, Ohio, Hillary would not have gotten the votes she got in California." Brown makes his jobs claim at about the 1:30 minute mark in the video above. In his January 2016 State of the State Address, Brown accurately said "Two million new jobs have been created," in California since 2011. Below is an updated look at California’s job numbers and the research that continues to back up this claim. Our research Six years ago, in January 2011 when Brown returned to the governor’s office, California had 14.3 million nonfarm payroll jobs. As of February 2017, the state had nearly 16.7 million of those jobs, according to data tracked monthly by the California Employment Development Department and closely watched by economists. That’s an increase of about 2.34 million. So, if anything, Brown is understating the job growth. Compared with seven years ago, the state has added about 2.44 million jobs. This is a ‘net job creation’ total. Many jobs were also lost during this period, but they were outnumbered by the gross total gained. As with our fact check in 2016, we examined nonfarm payrolls jobs. Economists consider that category the most reliable because it eliminates farm employment, which fluctuates considerably. Everyone in the nonfarm category is listed on a payroll and considered an employee. Our ruling California Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed on NBC's Meet the Press that "2.1 million jobs have been created" in the state in the last six or seven years. If anything, Brown slightly understated the number of net jobs created during that period. The total is closer to 2.34 million over the past six years, according to monthly job data tracked by the state and closely watched by economists. Brown made a similar claim that we rated True in January 2016. The numbers still add up in the governor’s favor. We rated it True.

pomt-01700	"The startup rate of Hispanic businesses is three times the national rate."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/12/libre-initiative/conservative-group-says-hispanic-business-growth-t/	A conservative grassroots organization is targeting a demographic group that the GOP is struggling to win over -- Hispanics. The Libre Initiative is a 501(c)4 nonprofit that has ties to the Koch brothers. They reach out to the traditionally liberal Hispanic community, espousing conservative ideals in favor of economic and religious freedom, and against the Affordable Care Act. Their stated stance on immigration reform is that they believe the system should have a streamlined process for allowing immigrants to work legally in the United States, though their view on how to handle illegal immigrants already in the country is less clear. Part of the Libre Initiative’s mission is to promote business development in the Hispanic community, even hosting a small business summit with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. They shared a positive fact about Hispanic-owned businesses on Facebook and Twitter over the weekend. "The startup rate of Hispanic businesses is three times the national rate," they said. Knowing that Hispanics continue to make up a larger and larger share of the U.S. population, we decided to look into their business growth, too. Growing and growing The Libre Initiative directed us to a White House report on the Fiscal Year 2013 budget that included the same claim, without elaboration. "According to the most recent Census data, Hispanics are opening businesses at a rate three times faster than the national average," it said. So we turned to the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau conducts a survey of business owners every five years, broken down by various demographic groups, industry, size and location. The most recent report came out in 2010 and looks at the years 2002 to 2007. (The bureau will release the next report in 2015.) The survey defines Hispanic-owned businesses as those operating in the United States that "self-identified 51 percent or more of their ownership… to be by individuals of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or other Hispanic or Latino origin." According to the 2010 report, the number of Hispanic-owned businesses grew 43.7 percent from 2002 to 2007. The national average growth rate was 18 percent, so Hispanic-owned businesses grew at a rate that was a little more than twice as fast. But the growth was not quite three times as fast as the national average, so we jumped back five years to the previous business owners survey results, which came out in 2006. This survey seems to contain the claims’ origin. Between 1997 and 2002, the national average growth rate for businesses was 10 percent, and the growth rate for Hispanic-owned business was 31 percent -- just over three times the national rate. We found a 2013 report by business intelligence firm Geoscape and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce that had some more recent data. The report projected that in 2013, there would be 3.16 million Hispanic-owned businesses in the United States -- a growth rate of 40 percent since 2007. The Geospace report also said the average annual increase in Hispanic-owned firms during that time frame was 6.66 percent, compared to 3.14 percent annual growth among all U.S. firms. "The Hispanic population has been starting and growing new businesses at nearly twice the rate of the general population and this trend has continued for more than 10 years," the report says. Service areas and technology are among the top industries where this growth is happening. The growth of Hispanic-owned businesses mirrors the country’s rising Hispanic population. Between 2000 and 2010, the Hispanic population grew from 35.3 million to 54.1 million, which is more than a 50 percent growth, according to the Pew Hispanic Trends Project. All businesses are responding to the growing Hispanic consumer base -- and their more than $1 trillion purchasing power -- said Javier Palomarez, CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The Hispanic community is generally aware of and responds well to Hispanic-led businesses, which might be aiding the growth, Palomarez said. He added that the Hispanic population is younger than the non-Hispanic population, which means they tend to be more technology-able and innovative. Our ruling The Libre Initiative said, "The startup rate of Hispanic businesses is three times the national rate." We found data that showed the number of Hispanic-owned businesses growing at three times the national rate between 1997 and 2002. However, more recent data shows a growth rate of Hispanic-owned businesses that’s closer to twice the national rate. The overall trend -- that Hispanic-owned businesses are popping up faster than other demographics -- is correct, though. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02328	"Women take birth control, more than half of them, as a medication for other conditions."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/26/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-more-half-women-use-birth-contr/	As the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the Hobby Lobby case regarding the Affordable Care Act’s free birth control provision, there’s no shortage of discourse on abortions, emergency contraception and yes, even penis pumps. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., addressed her argument on the case by working Viagra into the conversation. She expressed frustration on MSNBC’s Jansing & Co. at what she sees as a hypocritical view of men’s and women’s health issues. "I have never heard them put any type of moral objection, remember, this is a moral objection, to men getting Viagra, but they have a moral objection to women getting certain types of birth control," Boxer said. Hobby Lobby argued that requiring employers to offer health coverage that includes emergency contraception violates religious freedom. They oppose contraception they believe is equivalent to inducing abortion, such as morning-after pills and IUDs. Boxer continued pushing back against that position. "I view this as very much an anti-woman position to take," Boxer said. "And it’s important to note that women take birth control, more than half of them, as a medication for other conditions, so it is an attack on women." PolitiFact wanted to take a closer look at the different reasons women use birth control. Boxer’s folks pointed us to a November 2011 report from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that studies reproductive rights. They focused specifically on the birth control pill, not all contraception. Here’s what they found: Out of the more than 7,354 women surveyed, 58 percent of pill users cited at least one noncontraceptive reason for taking it. That includes managing menstrual pain, period regulation and acne. That’s where Boxer’s "more than half" claim comes from. Many of the women in this category also take the pill to prevent pregnancy. But just 14 percent of pill users said they only took the pill for noncontraceptive reasons. Guttmacher senior associate Rachel Jones, the author of that report, said the use of birth control pills among adolescents is even more pronounced. Out of 15- to 19-year-olds, 33 percent took the pill only for noncontraceptive reasons, more than double the percentage of the general population. Adolescent women are especially prone to irregular and painful menstruation cycles, Jones said. Our ruling Boxer said more than half of women use birth control "as a medication for other conditions." She was referring specifically to the pill. Guttmacher says 58 percent of women on the pill take it for noncontraceptive reasons. But that number drops to 14 percent if you look at women who take the pill only for noncontraceptive reasons. Her claim is based in fact, but requires additional clarification about the type of birth control and the survey results. We rate it Half True.

pomt-10986	Gov. Bruce Rauner has "created no jobs over the past three years."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/jul/16/juliana-stratton/was-rauners-first-term-dry-spell-jobs-no/	Illinois employment figures hit a high point last summer, finally surpassing the state’s previous jobs peak reached nearly two decades ago in an economy fueled by the dot.com boom. Yet according to the Democratic running mate of governor candidate J.B. Pritzker, the state has gone years without creating jobs under Gov. Bruce Rauner, the Republican that the Pritzker ticket is seeking to oust. "We really have to look at ways all across this state to make sure that we are creating jobs, something that the current governor has not done at all in the three and a half years that he’s been governor," Juliana Stratton, Pritzker’s pick for lieutenant governor, recently told radio host Tom Miller on WJPF-AM near Carbondale in Southern Illinois. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Stratton, a state representative from Chicago, doubled down on her claim a few minutes later. "What we see is that he’s created no jobs over the past three years," she added. But federal jobs data show Illinois employment gains in 2015, 2016, 2017 and on into this year — the period coinciding with Rauner’s time in office so far. Given the numbers, how then can Stratton claim there’s been no jobs growth under Rauner? Job growth, at any rate When we put that question to the Pritzker campaign, spokesman Jason Rubin responded with a statement that, in a backhanded way, refuted his own candidate’s puzzler. "Bruce Rauner called his predecessor a ‘massive failure’ on jobs and then led Illinois to a significantly lower rate of job growth during his time in office," Rubin wrote, referring to attacks Rauner leveled in 2014 against then-Democratic Gov. Patrick Quinn. "Job growth in the first three years of Bruce Rauner’s administration was an abysmal 2.79 percent, nearly half the national average, and lower than many neighboring states," Rubin wrote. Cutting through the partisan fog, Rubin acknowledged employment is up under Rauner even while stressing growth has not been as robust as the national average. But Stratton said there had been no growth, period. Preliminary federal data for May show more than 6.1 million Illinois residents holding non-farm jobs, up 188,000 from the month before Rauner took office in January 2015. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Rubin is correct the rate of job growth has lagged the national average under Rauner, but it also did so in most years under Quinn as well as governors of both parties before him dating back to the early 1990s, federal data show. As for how Illinois measured up to its neighbors over Rauner’s first three years in office, the state has indeed fallen behind Wisconsin, Missouri and Indiana. But it trailed Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa and Kentucky in the last three years of Quinn’s term, according to federal figures. It’s also beside the point. Stratton didn’t talk about growth rates. She asserted there has been no growth under Rauner, which simply isn’t true. Steering state employment trends Political fun with jobs numbers aside, the red herrings tossed by the Pritzker campaign raise a broader question: Can a governor really take blame or credit for the trajectory of state employment figures? Indeed, Rauner himself has boasted in the past about jobs created on his watch. Richard Auxier, a research associate with the Washington D.C.-based Urban Institute, said it would be hard to pin Illinois’ employment trajectory on any single governor. A state economy, Auxier explained, is like a large ship: "You can’t just take the wheel of a ship and turn it at a 90-degree angle." That’s why, Auxier said, employment swings — beholden as they are to national economic shifts and a state’s long-term trends — generally shouldn’t be either "applauded or pinned" on the governor who happens to hold office when one occurs. Our ruling Stratton said Rauner has "created no jobs over the past three years." But federal employment data indicate jobs have increased by 188,000 since Rauner took office. Even the response from the Pritzker/Stratton campaign, which knocked the employment growth rate under Rauner for falling short of his predecessor’s, tacitly acknowledged that job growth had occurred. More to the point, however, Stratton didn’t comment on the state’s employment growth rate during the interview. Instead, her remarks called into question whether any jobs were created under Rauner. The numbers fail to support her there, so we rate her statement False. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Juliana Stratton	None	None	None	2018-07-16T07:00:00	2018-06-28	['None']
pomt-14282	When mentioning Villanova’s buzzer-beating win in the national championships, Hillary Clinton said: "I love those come-from-behind victories."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/apr/06/hillary-clinton/was-villanovas-big-win-come-behind-victory-hillary/	The Villanova Wildcats are about to march down Philadelphia’s Market Street in a victory parade, days after being named National Champions in a nail-biter of a game. But was that a come-from-behind win? During a campaign stop to the AFL-CIO Convention in Philadelphia on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton riled up the crowd with a quip about Villanova’s buzzer-beating final shot that clinched the Wildcats the national championship. "I love those come-from-behind victories," she said. Sure, it was an off-the-cuff remark about a basketball game. But, given the enthusiasm of Philadelphia sports fans, we decided to check the claim: Was Villanova’s win really of the "come-from behind" variety? Not really. Wildcats fans may have been sweating the last few minutes, but Villanova never trailed in the closing stages. Within minutes, Clinton’s campaign defended the remark, saying UNC was leading at the half and, citing FiveThirtyEight, added that the Tar Heels were about twice as likely to win the game at that point before 'Nova came back to take the lead in the second half. Prior to tip-off, ‘Nova was a three-point underdog in the final game of March Madness, despite coming off a 44-point win over Oklahoma in the semi-finals. Villanova was down to North Carolina 39-34 at the half, then trailed by seven points with 19:16 to play in the game before, yes, mounting a comeback. That said, the last lead the Tar Heels held came at the 15:20-minute mark of the second half. The game was tied a few times, but Carolina never held another lead the entire game. Villanova, however, had a 10-point lead with 5:29 to play. The Wildcats’ lead at that time was seemingly so insurmountable, that Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight tweeted there was a 96 percent chance Villanova would would win the game. As UNC chipped away to tie things up with seconds left, ‘Nova held on for dear life before Kris Jenkins hit the game winning shot. That three-pointer that went in as the final second on the clock ticked away won the game, 77-74, for Villanova. Our ruling Clinton said during a campaign stop at the AFL-CIO Convention in Philadelphia that she loves "those come-from-behind victories." We do, too. But this wasn’t one of them. Villanova didn’t trail in the last 15:20 of the game. Yes, the Cats made a last-second shot to win. But if they missed, the game would have moved onto overtime. To steal another basketball cliche, this claim is a bit of a brick. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-04-06T13:02:13	2016-04-06	['None']

pomt-14162	The decision for the United States to buy heavy water from Iran "will directly subsidize Iran’s nuclear program."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/29/paul-ryan/us-purchase-heavy-water-iran-direct-subsidy-irans-/	Since 1984, the United States has officially branded Iran a state sponsor of terrorism, partly because of its support of terrorist groups in the Middle East. Ignoring resolutions from the United Nations Security Council to suspend its nuclear proliferation activities hasn’t won Iran many international friends, either. So it was historic when the United States and other world powers reached a nuclear agreement with Iran in 2015. The deal, pushed by President Barack Obama, makes it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb. In exchange, Iran can reclaim some $100 billion or more of its assets that had been frozen in foreign banks. Republican critics, including U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, worry about the deal leading to terrorism. Johnson got a Half True for saying the Obama administration has admitted that money from the deal "would go directly to terrorism" in that the officials said they expected only some funds to end up with groups labeled as terrorists. But the Obama administration’s newly announced purchase of "heavy water" from Iran, in connection with the deal, brought a fresh round of attacks -- including one from another Wisconsin Republican, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. The purchase, Ryan claimed in a statement, "will directly subsidize Iran’s nuclear program." That doesn’t seem like something the United States would want to do. So, let’s see what this is all about. The nuclear deal As support for the nuclear deal was being sealed in the U.S. Senate in 2015, it was believed that Iran might be two to three months away from getting a nuclear bomb. But if Iran abides by restrictions imposed by the deal, scientists say, it would take at least 12 months to build a weapon. In January 2016 (despite a claim by GOP presidential front runner Donald Trump), inspectors verified that Tehran was doing enough under the deal to curb its nuclear program. That meant the roughly $100 billion that had been locked up by sanctions from European Union and the United States became available to Iran. Heavy water purchase The new controversy stems from the Obama administration’s announcement on April 22, 2016 that it would buy 32 tons of heavy water from Iran to help the country meet the terms of the nuclear deal, which limits how much heavy water Iran can stockpile. That material is a key component of making nuclear weapons and producing nuclear energy. Ryan issued his statement denouncing the $8.6 million purchase the same day. His use of the word subsidy suggests the U.S. is providing cash simply to help prop up Iran’s nuclear program. But experts told us the U.S. paid a market rate for the heavy water, which it needs for research. And by reducing the amount of heavy water Iran has, the purchase means it will take Iran longer to produce more heavy water that could be used for a nuclear bomb. Ryan’s evidence To back Ryan’s claim, his office highlighted this portion of a Wall Street Journal article on the announcement of the heavy water purchase: Iranian officials have hinted at the heavy-water sale to the U.S. and praised it as an early step in support of the country’s ambitions to export its nuclear-related and scientific products. Tehran, in support of the agreement, already has sold low-enriched uranium to Russia and Kazakhstan. "On the heavy water, we are among the very few developing countries which is able to produce its own heavy water and now we have entered the international market," the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, told Iranian state media this month. "We have been able to sell more than 30 tons of heavy water just recently and this has put us on par with other countries." The United States, which does not produce its own heavy water, will use the 32 tons of heavy water it is buying from Iran, which is said to be high quality, for research at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. To Ryan’s point, experts told us the purchase provides funds for Iran’s nuclear program and allows Iran to continue generating more heavy water while staying under the cap in the nuclear agreement -- either for its own use or to sell. Other aims But besides the purchase not being a subsidy, the effect of the purchase is not to make it easier for Iran to make a bomb but to make it harder, by reducing its stockpile of heavy water. Moreover, the purchase helps keep Iran will be in compliance with the part of the nuclear deal that limits how much heavy water Iran can stockpile. That, the Arms Control Association wrote on its website, is "a clear benefit to U.S. national security, as the agreement blocks Iran’s pathways to the bomb." Our rating Ryan said the decision by the United States to buy heavy water from Iran "will directly subsidize Iran’s nuclear program." There is an element of truth in Ryan’s claim about the $8.6 million transaction. Heavy water, which can be used to make a nuclear weapon, clearly is part of Iran’s nuclear program. But the fair-market-value purchase, for a material that the U.S. will use in nuclear research, is not a true subsidy. And by reducing Iran’s heavy water stockpile, the purchase helps Iran comply with a nuclear agreement that is aimed at making it harder for the country to develop a nuclear weapon. We rate Ryan’s statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b09a048b-c6c6-4931-b845-3e16f84e9f90	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-04-29T11:58:02	2016-04-22	['United_States', 'Iran']
pomt-10944	Says Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced in February that "the Russia collusion investigation is over."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/25/jeanine-pirro/jeanine-pirros-new-book-falsely-declares-russia-in/	In a new book that lauds President Donald Trump and lashes out at his critics, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro declares that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Trump campaign ties with Russia is effectively dead. Her evidence? Pirro, a former judge, points to what’s missing from a special counsel indictment in February of more than a dozen Russians: namely, the fact that no charges were filed against Americans. "The Russia collusion investigation is over," Pirro wrote in "Liars, Leakers and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy." "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced that himself, for all intents and purposes, when he indicted thirteen Russians for interfering in the election and said explicitly that no Americans had been knowingly involved." So, did the Justice Department’s No. 2 man announce the end of the Mueller probe back in February? Hardly. What Rosenstein said Pirro’s claim turns on an action Mueller took on Feb. 16, 2018 — or rather, an action he didn’t take. That day, the special counsel charged 13 Russians and three Russian entities with conspiring to defraud the United States and interfere with the 2016 presidential election. No Americans were named in that indictment. A Justice Department press release stated, "There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in the alleged unlawful activity." To Pirro, this meant that Rosenstein, who oversees the Mueller investigation, reached the conclusion that the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia during the election. But Rosenstein said no such thing. While briefing reporters the same day, Rosenstein made clear the investigation was ongoing. At no point did he indicate that the absence of charges against Americans in this particular indictment meant that Americans couldn’t be indicted in the future. Ironically, Pirro’s claim contains a footnote that severely undercuts her assertion. She cites an article from CNBC that emphasizes the opposite of her point. The article’s headline — "Rosenstein: No Allegation of American Involvement or Election Impact — In this Particular Indictment" — makes clear that Rosenstein was speaking narrowly about that particular indictment, and not the possibility of indictments against Americans at some future point. Here’s how the lead sentence of the Feb. 16 CNBC article reads: "When Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein spoke to the press Friday, he repeatedly made it clear that his comments were specific to the federal grand jury indictment the special counsel's office had just announced." Later, the CNBC article quotes a former assistant attorney general who further undermines Pirro’s point: "The deputy attorney general's comments were not an "all-clear" signal for the president, former assistant attorney general John Carlin told CNBC. "What you saw at the press conference is not an 'all-clear.' Instead it's a careful prosecutor sticking to the four corners of the indictment," Carlin said on "Power Lunch." "Carlin, who previously was chief of staff to Mueller when he was director of the FBI, said that the investigation is not over and that Americans will "have to just wait and see."" Investigation still ongoing Under the regulations that govern special counsel investigations, Mueller’s probe will end with a "confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions" to the attorney general. There is no suggestion Mueller has submitted his final report yet, meaning the investigation is still active. To date, the investigation has swept up four members of Trump’s campaign, including three who have agreed to work with with the special counsel as part of a plea deal. As our timeline of the Mueller probe makes clear, the investigation has continued to evolve since February, when Pirro claims the collusion probe ended. On July 13, the special counsel indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers for their role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Clinton campaign, and the leaking of emails and documents. The indictment made reference to an unnamed U.S. person who "was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump," and who communicated during the election with Guccifer 2.0, a front for Russian operatives. Former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone acknowledged he is "probably" the U.S. person referenced in the indictment. Stone’s acknowledgement came five months after Pirro claimed the collusion investigation had ended. Our ruling Pirro said Rosenstein announced in February that "the Russia collusion investigation is over." Rosenstein, who oversees the Mueller investigation, said no such thing. He’s never suggested that an absence of charges against Americans in any given indictment means that Americans couldn’t be charged in the future. Pirro’s claim that the investigation ended in February is also at odds with how the probe has evolved since then. To take just one example, former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone acknowledged he is "probably" the unnamed U.S. person referenced in the July 13 indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers charged with hacking and leaking Democratic documents during the election.

pomt-00605	"The CEO of Goldman Sachs let his employees know that he’d be just fine with either Bush or Clinton."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/02/martin-omalley/had-goldman-sachs-ceo-said-his-picks-are-hillary-c/	A Jeb Bush-Hillary Clinton contest would be a win-win scenario for Wall Street, says former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. In his presidential campaign announcement on May 30, 2015, O’Malley attacked Bush and Clinton for their supposed mutual backer, Goldman Sachs, the poster child of big, bad Wall Street. "Recently, the CEO of Goldman Sachs let his employees know that he’d be just fine with either Bush or Clinton," O’Malley said. "Well, I’ve got news for the bullies of Wall Street: The presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth by you between two royal families." We were curious about O’Malley’s claim on whether Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein would sign off on both the presumed Republican and Democratic frontrunners, especially in front of the firm's 34,400 employees. Goldman Sachs spokesperson Andrew Williams told us, "We’ve looked high and low and found no such statement by Mr. Blankfein." One side of the aisle is clear: Blankfein has fundraised for Clinton. It’s actually his support for Bush where the evidence in lacking. An O’Malley spokesperson pointed us to an article published in March 2015 in Politico magazine. In it, economic reporter Ben White detailed Blankfein’s close relationship with the Clintons and wrote,"Blankfein has indicated he would be fine with either a Bush or Clinton presidency." White told us in an email that to his knowledge, Blankfein has never stated this publicly, though he’s suggested it privately, according to anonymous sources close to the CEO. His long-time support for Clinton, however, is out in the open. Blankfein, a self-described Democrat, personally contributed $4,600 to her last presidential campaign (and thousands to past Democratic presidential candidates). He told Politico magazine in 2014, "I very much was supportive of Hillary Clinton the last go-round," he said. "I held fundraisers for her." Past comments from the Goldman executive do indicate some political fluidity. In 2013, Blankfein said he likes both Hillary Clinton and Chris Christie, "people who are moderated and see the other side," according to BuzzFeed. That’s the attitude on Wall Street in general, experts say. Goldman and its peers tend to play the middle, said economic historian and former banker Charles Geisst. Centrists like Clinton or Bush would maintain the financial status quo, while candidates like Bernie Sanders or Ted Cruz, "people on the fringes, make them nervous," said journalist William Cohan, who wrote a book on the firm. And even if Blankfein personally favors Clinton, he and Wall Street are in it to win it. "It’s about access, access, access...Goldman wants to back the winner. They’re traders who’ll hedge their bets," said Cohan. As for Goldman and Wall Street’s opinion of Martin O’Malley? "I suspect anyone to the right of Elizabeth Warren or Sanders would get the same sort of hedged support," said Geisst. Our ruling O’Malley said, "The CEO of Goldman Sachs let his employees know that he’d be just fine with either Bush or Clinton." The O’Malley campaign referred us a Politico article that stated a much more ambiguous version of the claim. The article’s author told us CEO Lloyd Blankfein has never stated this publicly, much less to the company's 34,400 employees. Blankfein has thrown his weight and money behind Clinton publicly, but he hasn't done the same for Bush. Overall, we rate O’Malley’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-15068	"Daraprim is still underpriced, relative to its peers."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/24/martin-shkreli/fact-checking-martin-shkrelis-claim-daraprim-under/	The CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, the company that jacked up the cost of a life-saving drug from $13.50 to $750 essentially overnight, says the new price tag is still below market value. Martin Shkreli, a 32-year-old former hedge fund manager, was singled out as the man behind Turing’s controversial decision. So Shkreli took to the airwaves to defend himself, insisting that the price hike was altruistic or, at the very least, not unique. "You only need less than 100 pills so at the end of the day, the price for treatment – to save your life – was only $1,000," Shkreli told Bloomberg TV on Sept. 21, 2015. "These days, in modern pharmaceuticals, cancer drugs can cost $100,000 or more, rare disease drugs can cost half a million dollars. Daraprim is still underpriced, relative to its peers." Daraprim is used to treat a parasitic infection known as toxoplasmosis, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers a leading cause of death attributed to food-borne illnesses. The Toxoplasma parasite can be transmitted through contaminated food, water, and kitchen utensils as well as contact with infected cat feces. While 60 million Americans carry the parasite with no symptoms, it can become deadly for those with weakened immune systems. We were curious about Shkreli’s claim that Daraprim’s new price was comparable to "its peers." (Shkreli has since said that he would lower the price amid the outrage, but he did not reveal the new price.) Neither Shkreli nor Turing Pharmaceuticals got back to us for this fact-check, but we found that while other treatments are certainly expensive, Shkreli is committing a false equivalence when he compares them to Daraprim. Shkreli is right that other treatments can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars: for example, the cancer drug Revlimid can cost $150,000 per year while Kalydeco, a drug for cystic fibrosis, can cost $300,000 a year, according to the New York Times. By Shkreli’s calculations, the new price of treatment –100 pills of Daraprim for $750 a pop – is $75,000. But that’s a low estimate, according to the Infectious Disease Societies of America. It estimated a new annual cost of $336,000 to $634,000, depending on dosage. Beyond cancer and rare disease treatments, few drugs cost more than $100,000, said David Howard, a professor of health policy and management at Emory University. So the high price Shkreli cited "isn’t a good benchmark for deciding whether a drug is underpriced," he said. Numbers aside, experts told us the real problem with Shkreli’s claim is Daraprim and cancer drugs shouldn’t be compared to each other. "They're not peers," said Amir Attaran, a professor of health law and policy at the University of Ottawa. "He could have said, ‘A bar of gold cost $1 million, so Daraprim is underpriced.’ He's comparing fish and fowl." Simply put, cancer and rare disease drugs are almost always under patent, while Daraprim’s expired in 1953. And unlike Daraprim, those drugs are the products of expensive, recent research. "The comparison is irrelevant. Cancer drugs were developed by companies that invested hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars in research and development," said John Lamattina, a former senior vice president at pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who currently writes about the industry for Forbes. Daraprim, meanwhile, "is generic drug. There’s no research and development they had to do," said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health economics and finance at Johns Hopkins University. The research and development for Daraprim happened long before Shkreli bought the rights. It’s the trade name for pyrimethamine, a drug created by Nobel Prize-winning scientist Gertrude Elion that can be used to treat malaria as well as toxoplasmosis. Though no generic drug company has taken up manufacturing Daraprim (there are only about 2,000 U.S. patients who use the drug every year), it’s been available for reproduction for more than 60 years. That means its peers should be other generic drugs like ibuprofen, penicillin, and antibiotics, experts told us. The proposed 5,000 percent price increase on Daraprim is indicative of a larger trend among more niche generic drugs. A joint House and Senate investigation, partly led by Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, found that the annual cost hikes for 10 generic drugs ranged from 390 to 8,200 percent. This "anarchy pricing" can be attributed to the failure of the free market and a lack of government regulation, says Alan Sager, a professor of health policy and management at Boston University. "Essentially, this is an example of where the drug pricing system for generic drugs has totally failed," Anderson said. "In the past, generic drugs have prices that are low because of competition. Anyone can make it with FDA approval. The only thing you can compete on is price. (Shkreli’s) found something where there's no competitors." Anyone can legally make Daraprim, but for the time being, Turing’s monopoly gives it free reign to impose very high prices. As for Shkreli’s claims that the profits will go to research for a better version of Daraprim, experts aren’t buying it. "Turing has not got a single clinical trial underway. Shkreli’s not testing new drugs of any kind for toxoplasmosis. He's got nothing registered," Attaran said. "No one needs a new drug for toxoplasmosis anyways. It works so well bloody well." Our ruling Shkreli, the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, said, "Daraprim is still underpriced, relative to its peers." By his own estimates, Daraprim is cheaper than cancer and rare disease drugs, which he considers Daraprim’s "peers." By others, Daraprim costs about the same, if not more. Yet experts told us cancer and rare disease drugs are not Daraprim’s peers. Daraprim’s patent expired more than six decades ago and is a niche generic drug. The same cannot be said of cancer treatments. We rate his claim False. Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check misspelled Martin Shkreli's name.

pomt-06643	In the New York 9th District, "there is a large number of people who went to the polls tonight who didn't support the president to begin with and don't support Democrats -- and it's nothing more than that."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/sep/14/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-downplays-meaning-new-yor/	Republican Bob Turner's stunning victory in a New York special congressional election on Sept. 13, 2011, has Democrats scrambling to offer explanations for their pre-presidential election year defeat. The leading defense is that the result in New York's 9th district is an isolated event -- the combination of local issues, a less-than-strong Democratic candidate in David Weprin and the lingering baggage of the 9th District's former congressman, Anthony Weiner, who resigned after admitting to sending inappropriate messages to several women via Twitter and Facebook. Party leaders also contend that the district -- which has been held by a Democrat since 1923 and where Democrats hold a 3 to 1 registration advantage -- apparently isn't that Democratic. Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz offered the de facto Democratic rebuttal in interviews with the the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. "It's a very difficult district for Democrats," the Journal quoted her as saying. The paper noted that Wasserman Schultz said the Democratic margins in the 9th tend to be the second lowest of all the districts in New York City. In the Times, Wasserman Schultz said: "In this district, there is a large number of people who went to the polls tonight who didn't support the president to begin with and don't support Democrats -- and it’s nothing more than that." We wanted to see if the New York 9th meets Wasserman Schultz's description -- or if we're the victim of spin. The 9th Congressional District in New York includes parts of Queens and Brooklyn. The district has one of the heaviest concentrations of Jewish voters in the country. Here's how the 2010 Almanac of American Politics describes it: "This is unquestionably a Democratic district, but conservative by New York City standards: It voted 67%-30% for Democrat Al Gore for president in 2000, but in 2004, after President George W. Bush's response to September 11, it gave Democrat John Kerry only 56%. It was the greatest swing of any congressional district in the nation that year. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama won with 55%-44% over Republican John McCain. Obama lost the Brooklyn portion of the district 57%-42%." The numbers provide a good overview of the district. Here's some more things to consider: Since the current boundaries were drawn in 2002, no statewide Republican candidate has carried it except George Pataki; Weiner won the district by 32 percentage points in 2002, 43 points in 2004 and without Republican challengers in 2006 and 2008; In 2010, Weiner beat Turner (the Republican who won Sept. 13) by 22 percentage points. Some of those Weiner numbers can be explained, in part, by the power of incumbency. But Weiner is a Democrat -- as was now-Sen. Charles Schumer, who served in the 9th before Weiner. Reading back what Wasserman Schultz said We have two instances of Wasserman Schultz downplaying the results in the 9th by suggesting that the district isn't as Democratic as it sounds. In the Journal piece, she said "It's a very difficult district for Democrats." That's a silly claim on its face -- based on the performance of candidates in that district. However, the Journal's quote includes a note that leads us to believe she may be talking about being "very difficult" only relative to other New York City congressional districts. So for this fact-check, we're zeroing in on her comments to the Times, where she said: "In this district, there is a large number of people who went to the polls tonight who didn't support the president to begin with and don't support Democrats -- and it's nothing more than that." This quote, too, has some nuance -- namely because she said that there were a "large" number of people who went to the polls opposing Obama and Democrats. You could say that of any election in any district. And another problem is knowing who went to the polls. We haven't seen any exit polling and haven't spoken to anyone who has. We asked pollsters and political science professors who had been following the special election and know the district to analyze Wasserman Schultz's statement. Most agreed that while the district shouldn't be confused with liberal districts in California, Massachusetts or other places, it is a Democratic district. They also generally agreed that the district's voters have turned more against Obama since they helped elect him in 2008 -- which would negate Wasserman Schultz's assertion that people didn't support Obama "to begin with." "She's correct that the president is very unpopular in that district -- 31 percent approval to 56 percent disapproval," said Democratic pollster Tom Jensen. "However that hasn't always been the case -- he won 55 percent of the vote there in 2008. So yes a lot of the people who voted Republican just did so because they don't like the president -- but it should be a major cause of concern for Democrats that there are so many voters who fall into that category in a district where he did quite well his first time up for election." Christopher Malone, a political science professor at Pace University in New York, said anecdotal evidence is strong that Obama Democrats in 2008 have since abandoned ship and voted for Turner in 2011. "There were many voters that came out to vote against Obama that probably have stayed home in the past because they knew their vote was wasted (for example, in 2008 when McCain was sure to lose New York state)," Malone said. "On the other hand, it is also clear that many Democrats who supported Obama have become disenchanted with him and either stayed home or switched their vote and went with Turner. I can’t give you figures right now because I’ve not seen exit polls. But this is what I’ve seen leading up to the race from conversations with people on the ground and from other reports." Republican pollster John Diez, who polled the district ahead of the special election, said polling data clearly showed that opinions about the president have changed since 2008. "The fact is that between the 2008 election results and recent survey data, President Obama, the leader of the Democrat Party and the architect of the Democrat policies, has become increasing less popular. His declining job approval is not only driving turnout, but voting decisions among voters who supported him in 2008," Diez said. And then there's the end of Wasserman Schultz's claim -- that the results were "nothing more than" the people voting for Turner who didn't vote for Obama or Democrats. Douglas Muzzio, professor of public affairs at Baruch College in New York, took umbrage with that characterization. "'Nothing more than that' -- gimme a break," Muzzio said in an e-mail. "Far more than an anomaly, a local screw-up." Brad Woodhouse, communications director for the DNC, said he was unsure what people could object to in Wasserman Schultz's remarks. "I don't see how that statement could be in dispute," he said. "We lost the race so it stands to reason that the people who showed up are unlikely to be supporters of the president." Our ruling Wasserman Schultz defended the defeat of a Democratic candidate in New York's 9th Congressional District by saying that "there is a large number of people who went to the polls tonight who didn't support the president to begin with and don't support Democrats -- and it's nothing more than that." In a low turnout election, where about 60,000 people voted (compared to about 200,000 in 2008), and based on the fact that a Democrat lost and a Republican won -- there's no doubt that there's some truth to the statement. But there are a few problems with Wasserman Schultz's characterization. First, despite who voted there has been a shift in the popularity of Obama in the 9th District -- where 55 percent voted for him in 2008 but only 31 percent approve of him today. That undercuts her claim that people who went to the polls didn't support the president to begin with. And the historical trends show that the 9th district has largely and consistently been a Democratic district. A more complete picture might emerge when and if exit polls are released, but for for now Wasserman Schultz's claim has holes in it. We rate it Mostly False.

But it wasn’t taken during Russia’s 3-1 quarterfinal loss to Finland. The photo was taken during an earlier game in the tournament between Russia and Slovakia. The Russians actually won the game where the photo was taken. The Russians beat Slovakia 1-0 in an overtime shootout. The image making the rounds was captured by Sasha Mordovets, a contributor to Getty Images, on Feb. 16, 2014. (We confirmed this through Getty's image archives.) Other photographers also captured the two Russian leaders at the Russia-Slovakia game. We found some from the Russian news agency Ria Novosti. The Russian government also released photos from the Slovakia game where Putin and Medvedev did not look quite as sad. (It does not appear that either Putin or Medvedev even attended the Finland game. Putin was in Moscow for at least part of Feb. 19, and Medvedev was 6,500 miles from Sochi in the city of Mirny, where he toured a government space facility.) Our ruling A photo making the rounds on Twitter shows a sad-looking Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev allegedly after Russia’s tournament-ending hockey loss to Finland. The photo is legit. But it was taken days earlier, during a Russian 1-0 victory against Slovakia. We're guessing Putin and Medvedev are sad that their team lost. But the photo circulating on the Internet does not actually depict that. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-05635	"New business startups are at the lowest levels in 30 years."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/23/john-boehner/us-house-speaker-john-boehner-says-new-business-st/	Its fate in the Senate and its potential economic impact remain unclear, but the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS, produced a rare show of bipartisanship when it was passed by the House of Representatives on March 8. House Republicans and the White House cooperated on the Republican initiative, after larger jobs measures stalled. Sponsors said they hoped the bill would lift the low approval ratings of Congress. House Speaker John Boehner said he hoped it would make it easier for small firms to raise investment capital. The West Chester Republican said it would help to encourage job creation in Ohio and elsewhere "at a time when new business startups are at the lowest levels in 30 years." Thirty years goes back to the recession of the early 1980s, which would make sense. But PolitiFact Ohio had also seen a recent report that business startups were booming. We asked Boehner's office for more information. They pointed us first to a recent study by the outplacement consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. The study found that the number of unemployed managers and executives starting their own businesses in the second half of 2011 failed to rebound from the record lows recorded over the first half of the year. The study also cited numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that "it's not just the unemployed who seem turned off -- self-employment in general has decreased significantly during the recession." The BLS reported there were 8.6 million self-employed Americans in July 2011, compared to almost 10 million in June 2007, prior to the recession. Boehner’s staff additionally referred us to an article in Bloomberg Businessweek reporting that many indicators of startup activity are at record low levels. The per capita rate of formation of firms with employees in 2009, the most recent year tracked by the U.S. Census Bureau, was less than half its 1977 level. Those figures, however, seemed at odds with the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, a widely cited annual study measuring U.S. business startup activity at the individual owner level. It comes from the nonpartisan Kauffman Foundation, which works to foster entrepreneurial activity. Its latest report, issued March 19, said that the rate of new business creation dipped during 2011, but still remained "among the highest levels of entrepreneurship over the past 16 years," and showed that "entrepreneurship is alive and well in the wake of the Great Recession." A previous report of the Kauffman Index said that more Americans had started businesses since the start of the recession than at any period over the previous decade and a half. Wondering how this apparent conflict could be explained, we asked a leading authority on the subject: Scott Shane, chairman of the economics department and professor of entrepreneurial studies at Case Western Reserve University. The numbers do look contradictory, he said, but they measure different things. Using an analogy, "it's like measuring water in a bathtub." The Kauffman Index, he said, uses data from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) of the Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure the percentage of the adult population, not self-employed, starting a business each month. Using the bathtub analogy, he said, it's like putting a meter on the faucet -- the Kauffman Index measures the water's flow. The Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, meantime, track the number of people who are self-employed, Shane said -- it's like measuring the water level in the tub -- and that number has declined, because of the people who quit self-employment. (Or who, extending the analogy, go down the drain.) But more pertinent to the employment issue addressed by the JOBS Act and Boehner, Shane pointed out that there are two types of businesses: employer firms, which have employees, and non-employers, which do not. Non-employer firms are 80 percent of U.S. businesses, but have much less economic impact, Shane said. Employer firms account for 97 percent of gross domestic product. Using data from the Census Bureau and U.S. Small Business Administration, Shane found that the per capita rate of new employer business formation in 2009 (the most recent year available) was 1.32 per thousand people -- "an astonishing 51.4 percent of the rate in 1977," he said. "That is, Americans are starting new businesses with employees at half the rate they did 30 years ago." Not only the rate, but the raw numbers have declined, he said. In 1977, SBA figures show, Americans started 563,325 businesses with employees. In 2009, despite an increase in the population, they started 403,765. And no previous valleys dipped so low. A spreadsheet from Shane shows that neither the rate nor number of startups since 1977 ever hit the most recent level. On the Truth-O-Meter, Boehner's statement that new business startups are at the lowest levels in 30 years gets a rating of True.

pomt-03114	"Obamacare will question your sex life."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/19/betsy-mccaughey/betsy-mccaughey-says-obamacare-will-question-your-/	"Obamacare will question your sex life," says a New York Post headline this week. The opinion piece underneath, written by former lieutenant governor of New York Betsy McCaughey, author of Beating Obamacare, begins: "‘Are you sexually active? If so, with one partner, multiple partners or same-sex partners?’ "Be ready to answer those questions and more the next time you go to the doctor, whether it’s the dermatologist or the cardiologist and no matter if the questions are unrelated to why you’re seeking medical help. And you can thank the Obama health law." McCaughey then claims that the law offers incentive payments, and eventually penalties, to pressure doctors and hospitals to convert to electronic health records. She quotes a cardiologist saying sex questions are "insensitive, stupid and very intrusive" and a nephrologist declaring that new requirements turn your medical record "into an interrogation, and the data will not be confidential." Readers sent us the op-ed and asked us to fact-check it. So does Obamacare require your dermatologist to ask you about your sex life? ‘Sex questions’ We talked with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, two members of a federal committee on health information technology, and the president of a national physicians group. We reached out to McCaughey and the two doctors she quoted, but we didn’t hear back. (The last time we rated a claim from McCaughey, it was her 2009 comment that the health care law would require mandatory counseling for Medicare patients "that will tell them how to end their life sooner" — a Pants on Fire falsehood.) Here’s what we learned. The federal government did create incentives and eventually penalties to encourage doctors and hospitals to make "meaningful use" of electronic health records. The government says the switch from paper will offer easier access to health records and data, provide reminders and alerts for doctors and patients, and reduce medical errors. The change wasn’t part of Obamacare, though. And it doesn’t require any "sex questions" — except for whether you’re male or female. You might hear the words, "Are you sexually active?" from your doctor, but it wouldn’t have anything to do with the health care law. In other words, McCaughey’s claim was utterly at odds with the evidence. "Arrgghhh — now I have heard it all!" said Molly Cooke, president of the American College of Physicians. Cooke, an internist, told PolitiFact that when she was in medical school in the 1970s, she was taught to ask: • Are you sexually active (with other people)? • If yes, are your partners men, women or both? • If no, is that out of choice, because you don’t currently have an appealing partner, because you have no privacy, or some other reason? • Are you happy with your sex life, however it is? "My classmates and I were taught to ask all patients all four questions," she said. "I am not saying that we always did it, but these questions are as old as the hills." The rationale is that patients’ answers may reveal important information about their health, safety and well-being, she said. Her medical practice happens to focus on patients with HIV and other complex chronic illnesses. But let’s say some doctors, such as the cardiologist quoted by McCaughey, find such questions "insensitive, stupid and very intrusive." McCaughey wrote that the president’s "reforms" aim to "turn doctors into government agents, pressuring them financially to ask questions they consider inappropriate and unnecessary." Yet that cardiologist could earn government incentives for meaningful use of electronic health records whether he asked "sex questions" or not. ‘Electronic health records’ We looked at the specifications ourselves. The financial push toward electronic records came not from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, commonly called Obamacare, but from the federal stimulus bill the year before — the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In the first stage of the incentives program, paid through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, doctors must use electronic records to keep up with basics on their patients. They need to check for drug interactions, keep an up-to-date list of diagnoses, transmit prescriptions, keep medication and allergy lists, and record demographics and vital signs. They need to note preferred language, gender, race, ethnicity, date of birth, height, weight, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking status. The demographic information helps doctors catch disparities in care, said Paul Tang, an internist who chairs the workgroup on "meaningful use" for the health information technology committee created by the Recovery Act. Just as with paper records, that information is protected by federal health privacy laws, such as HIPAA, and in some cases additional state law. In the second stage, the requirements for doctors get more sophisticated, with provisions for electronic access for patients to their health information, ability to transmit data to immunization registries, and more. Some optional steps include entering electronic notes for at least 30 percent of the patients they see, and recording family health history as structured data. There’s a requirement to protect electronic health information. But there aren’t any requirements to ask questions about sexual history. That’s not to say they won’t be common: past medical history, family history and social history are fairly standard questions, and it would make sense for vendors of electronic health records systems to include them in their software. But if McCaughey’s cardiologist didn’t want to ask, he could still collect government money for using the records. What makes McCaughey’s claim even more bizarre is that it isn’t necessary to exaggerate concerns about electronic health records. There’s plenty of evidence-based debate about whether current privacy protections are enough in the new world of electronic records, and how to give patients a "meaningful choice." A New York Civil Liberties Union report she mentions says current regulations don’t give patients enough control over sensitive health information. A recent blog post at the website of the journal Health Affairs discusses how to earn patient trust and get meaningful consent for participation in health information exchange organizations. But the federal push toward electronic health records doesn’t require your doctor to grill you about your sex life. Our ruling McCaughey says in "Obamacare will question your sex life" that you can thank the president’s health law for questions about your sexual activity, even if your doctor finds them unnecessary. She suggests it’s part of Obamacare’s move toward electronic health records. But incentives for electronic health records were part of the Recovery Act, not Obamacare. And they don’t require participating doctors to ask questions about your sex life. McCaughey frames her concern for patient privacy with an evidence-free attack on Obamacare that veers toward the ridiculous. We call it Pants on Fire.

pomt-08724	Dan Webster supports "privatization of Social Security, deep cuts in Social Security."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/02/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-dan-webster-supports/	Most politicians know how to pivot: In a political context, it means changing the subject you don't like to one that you do. House member Debbie Wasserman Schultz demonstrated the maneuver in an interview with Larry King on CNN, changing the subject from a new mosque in New York City all the way to Florida Republican candidate for Congress Dan Webster and privatizing Social Security. Here's how the exchange went, with conservative commentator Ben Stein jumping in for good measure: King: "Congresswoman Schultz, do you think that Muslim situation in New York will be a national issue?" Schultz: "I really don't think it will be a national issue. I think what it boils down to is, it is a case of just because you can doesn't mean you should. I think the leadership of the mosque and that Muslim community in that area of New York City would be well served to sit down with the leadership in New York and in that community, and work together to build some consensus on an alternative site. I do think the national issues that are important in the outcome of races are turning the economy around, creating jobs, and the fact that virtually all Republican candidates for Congress across the country support privatization of Social Security, deep cuts in Social Security, like Dan Webster in Florida ..." Stein: "She just made that up." Schultz: "No, no, Ben. With all due respect to you, I did nothing of the kind. There are candidates across the country for Congress ..." Stein: "Will you show us the source?" King (demonstrating his own pivot and going to viewer phone calls): "Phoenix, hello." We wanted to check the Florida Democrat's claim that "virtually all Republican candidates for Congress across the country support privatization of Social Security." But we found many Republican candidates aren't on the record one way or the other about privatizing Social Security. We find her broad statement dubious after looking into President Obama's statement, "Some Republican leaders in Congress" are "pushing to make privatizing Social Security a key part of their legislative agenda if they win a majority in Congress this fall." We rated that Barely True. But we decided to look at her specific example, that Republican candidate for Congress Dan Webster supports "privatization of Social Security, deep cuts in Social Security." Webster is running against Alan Grayson, the outspoken Democrat who represents the Orlando area. (During the debate over the health care law, Grayson won notoriety for saying the Republican health plan was "die quickly.") Wasserman Schultz is a supporter of Grayson's and a deputy whip for the Democrats in Congress, so it's not surprising she would comment on the race. Webster is a former Speaker of the House in the Florida state legislature and has been endorsed by Jeb Bush, the former Republican governor. A spokesman for Wasserman Schultz pointed us to a report in the liberal Huffington Post website about remarks Webster made at a candidates' forum sponsored by the tea party movement. Webster said the nation's budget woes could be addressed by rolling back the current budget to 2007 levels. The statement didn't provide any evidence backing Wasserman Schultz's claim that Webster supports privatization, but it does mention cutting cost-of-living increases for entitlement programs, which include Social Security and Medicare. "Just three years ago, if we would take that budget and pass it today just as it was, does it roll back some salary increases? Yes," Webster said. "Does it get rid of TARP and health care and all of the other things, including the stimulus package? Yes, it does that. Does it take back some of the COLAs for the entitlement programs? Yes, it does that, too. But it's only three years ago. If we took that budget and passed it, it would self-balance in two more years." (The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has posted the video on YouTube.) The definition of an entitlement program is any kind of program that spells out the benefits for people under the law. Social Security and Medicare are the largest federal entitlement programs. It's certainly reasonable to think he meant those programs, since he referred to entitlement programs. Rolling back COLAs -- cost of living adjustments -- would reduce Social Security payments for current retirees. But the Webster campaign released a statement after the Orlando Sentinel reported on the forum, saying that Webster did not support rolling back cost-of-living increases to Social Security. The Webster campaign sent us the same statement from the candidate when we asked about the issue. The Sentinel reported on the statement on Aug. 18, four days after Webster's statement on Aug. 12 and a week before Wasserman Schultz's Aug. 24, 2010 appearance on CNN. "I've never stated that Social Security benefits should be cut or reduced for those who are currently receiving benefits or those near retirement age," the statement said. "Social Security is a mandatory program that is not included in the budgetary process. I simply stated that the budget should be rolled back to 2007 levels to help address our national budget crisis. Rolling back the budget to 2007 will eliminate what is left of the bailouts, stimulus packages, salary increases (COLA) for federal employees - which includes Congressmen, and Obama's Healthcare Plan." So Webster said he does not support rolling back the recent increases for current Social Security recipients, even though his comments at the forum gave the opposite impression. In his first statement he said that he wanted to take back "some of the COLAs for the entitlement programs," which could include Social Security. More recently, he said "I never stated that Social Security benefits should be cut or reduced" but that he supports rolling back "salary increases (COLA) for federal employees." Our next question for Webster's campaign was whether Webster supported a plan promoted by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., a plan to add personal accounts to Social Security, which some consider privatizing. Under the Ryan plan, those 55 and older would not be affected one way or another; they would simply receive benefits as they are set up today. Workers under 55 would have the option to stay in the traditional government-run system and receive benefits as promised or to opt for personal retirement accounts in which they could invest part of their payroll taxes. Those personal accounts would be a series of funds managed by the government. It would partially privatize Social Security in the sense that people would own their own accounts. Webster's campaign didn't respond to our repeated questions about whether Webster supported Ryan's plan or not. Wasserman Schultz said that Republicans support "privatization of Social Security, deep cuts in Social Security" and gave Webster as an example. Webster's comments at the forum didn't address privatization. Webster's comments at the forum gave the impression he supported cuts, but he didn't specifically mention Social Security, and later he specifically said he didn't support cuts to the program. We're not sure whether Webster supports Ryan's plan, which isn't full privatization anyway.

pomt-08187	Says the Texas House has "a record number of new members joining our ranks."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/nov/27/joe-straus/speaker-joe-straus-says-texas-house-has-record-num/	Bolstered by big Election Day gains, Texas House Republicans are preparing for a legislative session in which they will vastly outnumber Democrats. Indeed, House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio notes in a Nov. 12 e-mail sent to Republican colleagues (and to reporters): "We have a record number of new members joining our ranks, and it is essential that we focus our energies on the business of the people, working together to achieve our common goal of a more educated, prosperous and secure Texas." Attached is a letter from 18 GOP House committee chairwomen and chairmen expressing their support for Straus, who is facing calls from the right for Republicans to line up behind an alternative candidate for speaker. When we asked Straus spokeswoman Tracy Young about the "record number of new members," she said Straus was referring to Republicans only. She provided us with a chart showing the growth in GOP House membership over the past few decades that she said she received from Associated Republicans of Texas, a group created to strengthen the GOP presence in Texas government after 1974, when Republicans suffered at the polls in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal. According to the chart, which is organized by election year starting with 1974, the largest increase in GOP membership will take place when the Legislature convenes in January and at least 98 Republicans fill seats in the 150-member House. But the GOP's chart only goes back to the 1974 election, and there were 60-plus legislatures before then. Also: Despite his spokeswoman's clarification, it's not obvious in Straus' e-mail that his mention of "new members joining our ranks" means only Republicans. The speaker oversees the entire House, so "our ranks" can (and maybe should) be read as inclusive of that body. It's no secret either that House Democrats were key to Straus winning the speakership, a job filled by vote of the House membership, at the start of the 2009 session. In search of a definitive, historical count of GOP "true freshmen" in the House, we turned to the Legislative Reference Library. The library, housed in the Texas Capitol, tallied the Democratic and Republican freshman House members for each Legislature since the 15th, which convened in 1876. Catherine Wusterhausen, coordinator of public services, told us that the library's count of freshmen excludes anyone who had served in an earlier session. Starting the count in 1876 leaves out the 12th Legislature, a majority-Republican body whose members were elected in 1869 during Reconstruction; however, we could not determine how many GOP freshmen came in with that group. Upshot: According to the library, there will be at least 29 truly new Republican House members in 2011, the most of any of the 68 sessions included in the library's list. Depending on the outcome of a special election and a pending recount, that number could go up. The year with the second-highest number of new Republican members was 2003, when 27 freshman Republicans came to Austin. But the upcoming influx is not a record increase in new House members in toto — not even close. According to the library, 2011 will see at least 34 freshman House members. However, from 1876 to 1967, when Democrats dominated Texas politics, turnover in the House was usually much higher, with a high of 97 new members in the 1913 session and only one session proceeding with fewer than 34 new members (32 in 1943). Since 1967, seven sessions have had a freshman class of more than 34, with a high of 71 in 1973. Summing up: The 2011 Legislature stands to have a record number of new Republican House members. But the House record for new members won't be broken, and Straus's statement was not clear about limiting its scope to Republicans only. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-00115	In public approval, "the press is rated right now below that of Congress, and that is very low; it’s in the single digits."	false	/west-virginia/statements/2018/oct/29/e-gordon-gee/trust-media-lower-trust-congress/	How low is public approval of the media today? West Virginia University President Gordon Gee raised the topic during a Sept. 17 meeting with the staff of the West Virginia University student newspaper, The Daily Athenaeum. Gee was expanding upon a statement he had made on Aug. 27, 2018, during Gov. Jim Justice’s Blue Ribbon Commission on Four-Year Higher Education. At the commission meeting, Gee discussed some unflattering news reports about actions he had taken within the organization. "You’ve learned the common truth of public life, which is don’t believe what you read in the newspaper," he said. Three days later, the Athenaeum published a front-page editorial pushing back on Gee’s remark. "Such a comment feeds into a narrative that diminishes truth, dubbing accurate news as ‘fake news’ and honest journalists as ‘enemies of the American people,’" the editors wrote. When Gee held a meeting with the newspaper staff about a month later, he said that his original statement was taken out of context and sought to affirm his faith in the press. Encouraging the student paper to pursue greater diligence in their reporting, Gee said that "the press is rated right now below that of Congress, and that is very low; it’s in the single digits." Neither the press nor Congress is held in particularly high regard today, but we wondered: Is public trust in the press really lower than that of Congress? PolitiFact checked a similar statement by President Donald Trump in February 2017. We reviewed the data we found then and updated it with data that’s been produced since. Rating Congress As we noted in early 2017, Gallup has been asking people how much confidence they have in various institutions since 1973. Here’s a look at the run of historical data. In a Gallup poll conducted in September 2018, 19 percent of respondents reported that they approved of the work Congress is doing in Washington, while 76 percent said that they disapproved. The remaining 5 percent reported that they had no opinion. Rating the Media As for the media, Gallup has asked the question a few different ways. In September 2018, the most recent poll specifically regarding media trust that Gallup published, asked the question, "In general, how much trust and confidence do you have in the mass media such as newspapers, TV and radio -- when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly? A great deal, a fair amount, not very much or none at all?" The survey found that 54 percent of individuals had "not very much" in the mass media or "none at all." But 45 percent responded that they had either a "great deal" or a "fair amount" of trust. In what may be Gallup’s most direct recent comparison of the press and Congress, a survey conducted in June 2018 asked about trust in various major institutions. In this survey, 58 percent of respondents said they had either a "great deal/quite a lot" of trust or "some" trust in newspapers, while 54 percent reported the same for television news. In the same poll, 50 percent of respondents said they had a "great deal/quite a lot" or "some" confidence in Congress, while 48 percent to say they had "very little" or "none." Looking just at the numbers for "great deal/quite a lot," Congress was the lowest at 11 percent, with both types of news media in the low 20s. John Bolt, WVU’s senior executive director for the office of communications, responded to an email inquiry about the claim by citing several polls from NPR and Gallup. However, none of these polls supported Gee’s statement, either. The joint poll from NPR, PBS Newshour and Marist found that 25 percent of respondents had either "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence in Congress, while 71 percent had "not very much" or none. In the same poll, 30 percent reported they had either "a great deal" or "quite a lot" of confidence in the media, while 68 percent reported they had "not very much" or none. A poll from Gallup asked respondents how they "would rate the honesty and ethical standards of people in these different fields -- very high, high, average, low, or very low?" 11 percent rated members of Congress very high or high, while 60 percent rated them very low or low. In the same poll, 25 percent rated the media very high or high, while 35 percent rated them very low or low. Gee would have been closer to the mark if he had referred to Republican views of the media. For instance, a survey by the Pew Research Center in February and March of 2018 measured partisan differences in attitudes towards the media. The lowest number is the 11 percent of Republicans who said that the "national news media do very well at keeping them informed." Meanwhile, 27 percent of Democrats responded said they believed that same statement. Bottom line: The levels of trust in the media are higher than Gee had indicated, and trust in the media are higher than they are for Congress. Our ruling Gee said that in public approval, "the press is rated right now below that of Congress, and that is very low; it’s in the single digits." Levels of trust for both institutions are low, but Gee’s claims are wrong on two counts. First, trust in Congress is consistently lower than trust in the media. And second, we couldn’t find a poll in which the press’s approval ratings were in the single digits. We rate the statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	E.

pomt-15092	One of the Planned Parenthood videos shows "a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, 'We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.' "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/17/carly-fiorina/cnn-debate-carly-fiorina-urges-others-watch-planne/	Following the release of several videos claiming to prove Planned Parenthood illegally profits off of aborted fetal tissue, many anti-abortion politicians have called for cutting off federal funding to the women’s health organization. At the second Republican debate, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina laid out defunding Planned Parenthood as a priority. "I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes," she said on the stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library Sept. 16. "Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, 'We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.' " The videos, which amount to at least a dozen hours, are produced by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress. They primarily show people posing as tissue brokers and talking with Planned Parenthood employees about procuring fetal tissue for medical research. Fiorina’s claim makes it sound like there is actual footage of Planned Parenthood examining an aborted fetus whose heart is still beating, while someone says "we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain." There isn't. Fiorina is likely talking about this 10-minute Aug. 19 video. (Warning: The video contains extremely gruesome footage.) The video shows an interview with a woman talking about a scene similar to the one Fiorina describes; the video’s creators have matched her interview with grisly stock footage of a fetus outside the womb. In the video, the Center for Medical Progress interviews a woman identified as Holly O’Donnell, a former procurement technician for StemExpress. StemExpress is a biomedical company that previously worked with Planned Parenthood to collect tissue for medical research, but the company ended its relationship with Planned Parenthood amid the ongoing controversy. O’Donnell talks about a time when she saw a fully-formed aborted fetus, with its heart still beating, in a pathology lab at a California Planned Parenthood clinic while she was on a job. "I’m sitting here looking at this fetus, and its heart is beating, and I don’t know what to think," O’Donnell said. According to O’Donnell, her supervisor then told her they would procure the brain because the fetus was well-preserved. The Center for Medical Progress video does not show actually show footage of O’Donnell’s experience, and there’s nothing else in the video to corroborate O’Donnell’s story. Additionally, the supervisor in O’Donnell’s story does not say anything about keeping the fetus alive specifically for the purpose of harvesting the brain. To dramatize O’Donnell’s interview, the video cuts to a fetus outside the womb, placed on what appears to be some sort of examination surface, and the fetus’ legs are moving. The Center for Medical Progress says the source of the footage is the Grantham Collection, an organization that hopes to stem abortion by promoting graphic images of the procedure. We don’t know the circumstances behind this video: where it came from, under what conditions it was obtained, or even if this fetus was actually aborted (as opposed to a premature birth or miscarriage). Our ruling Fiorina said one of the Planned Parenthood videos shows "a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain." One of the Center for Medical Progress’ videos attacking Planned Parenthood shows an interview with a woman identified as a former tissue procurement technician, who tells about an experience in a Planned Parenthood pathology lab where she sees a fetus outside the womb with its heart still beating. According to the woman, her supervisor said they would procure the fetus’ brain. The video’s creators added footage of an aborted fetus on what appears to be an examination table, and its legs are moving. But Fiorina makes it sound as if the footage shows what Planned Parenthood is alleged to have done. In fact, the stock footage was added to the video to dramatize its content.

pomt-10390	"Did Obama know that Tony Rezko was saving him $300,000 on the purchase of his home?"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/17/republican-national-committee-republican/no-proof-rezko-saved-obama-money-on-home/	It didn't take long for the Republican Party to pounce after Antoin "Tony" Rezko, a prominent former fundraiser for Sen. Barack Obama, was convicted on June 4, 2008, on federal charges of fraud and money laundering as part of Illinois' pay-to-play politics. The very day of the conviction, the Republican National Committee crafted a news release titled, "Obama Must Answer Questions so the American People Can Decide." One of those questions: "Did Obama know that Tony Rezko was saving him $300,000 on the purchase of his home?" By asking if Obama knew about it, the question presumes the claim is true: that Rezko did, in fact, save Obama $300,000 on the purchase of his home. Now it's true that Obama paid $300,000 less than the asking price for a century-old mansion that he and his wife, Michelle, purchased from a Chicago doctor in 2005 for $1.65-million. And on the same day the Obamas closed on their house, Rezko's wife, Rita Rezko, bought a vacant lot next door from the same seller for $625,000, the full asking price. Obama said it was his understanding that there was another offer besides the Rezkos' for the vacant lot at or near the asking price, thereby setting the market. The Obama campaign has posted an e-mail from the seller, Frederic Wondisford, confirming that Obama's offer on the house was the best one. In the letter, the seller says he rejected two lower offers from the Obamas before the two sides finally settled at $1.65-million. The seller also confirmed that he did not offer or give the Obamas a discount on the house price on the basis of the price offered and accepted on the adjacent vacant lot purchased by Rezko's wife. Lastly, Wondisford confirmed that it was he who insisted the closing for the two properties be completed on the same day. Donna Schwan, with MetroPro Realty, which listed both the house and the vacant lot, recalled that there were several offers on both the house and the lot, though she could not remember the amount of those other offers and said she has since discarded the offer sheets. "The most important thing to the sellers was to close on the same day," Schwan said, as they did not want one of the properties to sit unsold, alone. The sellers also required the buyers to put off the closing until June 15, after their children had gotten out of school. The fact that the Rezkos agreed to purchase the vacant lot on that date in mid June, "could have been to their (the Obamas') advantage, absolutely," Schwan said. "Each was contingent on the other selling," she said. "Whoever was willing to close on that date, if they made a reasonable offer, that's who they went with," Schwan said. One could certainly argue that the Rezkos' purchase, and their flexibility on the closing date, helped assure that the Obamas' offer was accepted. The real estate agent made clear that getting the two properties sold at the same time was a priority for the seller. But that's still a long way from saying the Rezkos saved the Obamas $300,000. The GOP offers no proof that the price paid by the Obamas was anything other than a matter of negotiation, or that the Obamas would have had to pay $300,000 more if not for the Rezkos' purchase. In fact, the seller specifically confirmed that the Obamas' offer of $1.65-million was the best offer he received on the house. Further, the seller confirmed that he did not offer the Obamas a discount on the price of the house "on the basis of or in relation to the price offered and accepted on the lot." Having the Rezkos as flexible buyers on the vacant lot might have helped the Obamas get the house they had been trying to buy, but there's just nothing to support the GOP claim that the Rezkos saved the Obamas $300,000.

"You know what else is hard work? Socialism," Scarborough said on the April 7, 2009, Morning Joe . "And I'm not being negative toward the president. This is the truth though. Think about this. We've got a president who has never received a paycheck ... he's never received a check from a profitmaking business in his entire life, not one check. Think about it." Another guest, New York Times reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin, thought about it for a split second and pointed out that Obama had received plenty of checks from the publisher of his two books. "Is that all you've got?" Scarborough replied. "Think about the radicalism of that." No. That's not all. It's true that Obama's most well-known jobs, as a community organizer and politician, have been for governments or nonprofit organizations. But Obama has worked for plenty of private companies, from Baskin-Robbins to Business International Corporation. He worked at law firms. He was a telemarketer. He worked construction. He sold island trinkets in Hawaii. In his diatribe, Scarborough remarked that "if you're going to run the most complex financial sectors in the world, I hope that you have at least received a paycheck for working at a burger stand." We're not sure whether the deli at which Obama worked as a young man in Hawaii sold burgers, but it's entirely possible. Below, compiled from and cross-checked among a host of sources, is what we believe to be the most thorough account of the president's work history. (Several details from his early years are unknown, and will remain so for now; the White House did not respond to our request to verify the accuracy of our list and fill in the blanks.) 1975 or 1976 — ice cream scooper, Baskin-Robbins — Honolulu — Obama claims to have lost his taste for ice cream during this, his first job, the duration of which is not publicly known. Date unknown — deli counter clerk, business name unknown — Honolulu — Obama had a summer job at a deli counter in Hawaii, making sandwiches, his spokesman said during the presidential campaign. 1980 — gift shop sales clerk, business name unknown — Honolulu — Obama worked at a gift shop in Hawaii selling island souvenirs the summer after his freshman year at Occidental College in California. Sometime between 1981-1983 — construction worker, business name unknown — New York — Obama cleared a construction site for a summer on Manhattan's Upper West Side while attending Columbia University, the Associated Press reported. Obama referred to this job in Dreams From My Father . Sometime between 1981-1983 — position unknown, company unknown — New York — During his years at Columbia University, Obama worked one summer for a private company processing health records of either police or firefighters, his spokesman said during the presidential campaign. Sometime between 1981-1983 — telemarketer, company unknown — New York — During one school year at Columbia, Obama was a telemarketer in midtown Manhattan selling New York Times subscriptions over the phone, his spokesman said during the presidential campaign. 1983-84 — research assistant, Business International Corporation — New York — At this firm that helped American companies do business abroad, Obama was a researcher and writer for a reference service called Financing Foreign Operations; among his duties was writing a newsletter called Business International Money Report. 1985 — project coordinator, New York Public Interest Research Group — New York — Obama mobilized student volunteers at City College in Harlem for NYPIRG, a nonprofit organization that promotes consumer, environmental and government reform. He promoted activism around issues such as mass transit, higher education, tuition, financial aid and recycling. 1985-1988 — community organizer, Developing Communities Project — Chicago — Obama advocated for asbestos removal, job training and public-works services at this community organization on Chicago's South Side. 1988 — research assistant, Lawrence Tribe — student assistant to this Harvard Law School professor and renowned constitutional scholar. 1989 — summer associate, Hopkins & Sutter — Obama held this job the summer between his first and second years of law school. 1990 — summer associate, Sidley & Austin — After his second year of law school Obama was a summer associate for one of the world's oldest and largest law firms, where he met Michelle Robinson, his future wife. 1990-1991 — president, Harvard Law Review — Obama was the first African-American to hold this prestigious position. 1991-1992 — executive director, Project Vote — Ran a campaign that registered nearly 150,000 black voters for the 1992 elections. 1993-2004 — associate and partner (starting 1996), Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland — Chicago — defended clients ranging from landlords to a securities trader, and handled employment-discrimination and voting-rights cases at this Chicago law firm. 1993-2004 — part-time lecturer, University of Chicago Law School — Chicago — lectured on constitutional law. 1995 — author, Times Books — published memoir, Dreams From My Father. 1997-2004 — state senator, Illinois — senator from Illinois' 13th District on Chicago's South Side. 2005-2008 — U.S. Senator — represented Illinois in the U.S. Senate. 2006 -- Author, Random House — published The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream. 2009 — President, United States — Washington — In his current position, Obama is the head of state of the most powerful country in the world. He runs the executive branch and serves as commander in chief of the armed forces. There you have it. By our count, Obama earned paychecks from 11 for-profit businesses, compared to just six nonprofit or government employers. We understand the point that the most well-known part of Obama's work history is in positions outside the private sector, but Scarborough was absolute in his declaration. "Not one check," from a for-profit enterprise, he said. We like Joe. He's hosted segments on PolitiFact. But this claim is False.

pomt-08059	Portland Public Schools invites "well-paid, well-fed school bureaucrats, administrators, teachers, other staff, non-needy students, affluent parents of students, and other adults, including on the other extreme the adult homeless, illegal aliens, fanatical Muslim terrorists, or drug addicted street people, to enjoy cheap breakfasts in taxpayer-paid school facilities amidst school children."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2010/dec/25/rees-lloyd/portland-public-schools-invites-all-adults-cheap-1/	Making the rounds on the World Wide Web is this entry from Rees Lloyd, an attorney who contributes to the blog of talk-radio host Victoria Taft. Lloyd is livid that West Sylvan Middle School (Portland Public Schools) is advertising low-cost breakfasts for students ($1) and adults ($1.75) regardless of their ability to pay. Students eligible for free or reduced-price meals don’t pay anything for breakfast. In his post, Lloyd says he’s OK with offering free or reduced-price meals to genuinely poor students. But he’s not OK extending meals to everyone else within walking distance of the school. "It is quite another thing, and a wrongful thing, to invite well-paid, well-fed school bureaucrats, administrators, teachers, other staff, non-needy students, affluent parents of students, and other adults, including on the other extreme the adult homeless, illegal aliens, fanatical Muslim terrorists, or drug addicted street people, to enjoy cheap breakfasts in taxpayer-paid school facilities amidst school children." Wow. That’s quite a range of adults eating for cheap on the taxpayer dime. We asked Portland Public Schools to explain, one, whether Lloyd had his facts correct, and two, if so, more about the program. Matt Shelby, spokesman for the school district, confirms that a Dec. 9 school e-mail re-posted on Taft’s blog is correct. In it, district nutrition services program manager Kristin Palmer reminds "West Sylvan parents and staff" that hot and cold breakfasts start up again in the new year. The memo reads: "Breakfast is only $1.00 for students, $1.75 for adults and free for all students on reduced or free priced meals. Your breakfast will meet ¼ of the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for children for many vitamins and nutrients and will include a juice, milk and entree, so come hungry! Please remember you can put money on your child’s account at mylunchmoney.com or bring a check or cash to the cafeteria." Clearly, the breakfast offer is not intended for the general public, which means no drug addicts, homeless or suspected terrorists, domestic or otherwise, get to mingle with the kids unless they happen to be staff or parents at the well-to-do school. Adults unaffiliated with the school need to sign in to get on campus, so the idea of an undocumented worker dropping "in at West Sylvan School for a $1.75 breakfast on their way to a job ‘Americans don’t want’" is pretty far-fetched (contrary to Lloyd’s musings). Strike this part as a Pants on Fire claim. (By the way, Lloyd doesn’t buy it. He interprets the e-mail as a more sweeping invitation, despite it being addressed to "West Sylvan parents and staff." "That’s what makes it so stupid, inviting adults to come in for $1.75. It’s without limitation and they know damn well we don’t want people walking into schools, what in the hell are they thinking? If they’re not inviting everyone in there, they should know how to say so.") But what about the broader gripe behind Lloyd’s post? Are taxpayers being cheated because schools such as West Sylvan offer high-quality, low-cost breakfasts to children and adults who can afford to eat at home? A bit of history first. Like the National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Program is housed under the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Shelby says the USDA reimburses the district $1.76 for every free breakfast, $1.46 for every reduced-price breakfast and 26 cents for every fully paid breakfast. The district is not reimbursed for adult meals, which is why adults pay $1.75 to cover the cost of labor and food. The total districtwide budget for school lunches and breakfasts is $17.5 million, sustained by sales of meals to students and reimbursements from the federal government. Which gets us back to Sylvan, where adults pay $1.75 for a meal; the 8.3 percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals pay nothing; and the rest of students pay $1 for breakfast. First, the adults. Only two adults have eaten breakfast at Sylvan since the school year started in September. Of 623,563 breakfasts served this year districtwide, 1,783 have gone to adults. That’s 0.3 percent of meals. In other words, not a lot of adults eat a low-cost breakfast at school. Now what about the kids? In 46 school days, West Sylvan has served 2,949 breakfasts to students. Of those, the bulk -- 2,276 -- went to children who paid $1 for every meal. So why does Portland Public Schools subsidize meals for children and provide meals to adults who clearly can afford to pay more? The answer given by the district is that it’s more cost-effective in the end to sell more meals, since there is a minimum anyway for labor and supplies. "You’re still going to have a staff member there administering meals to students," Shelby said. "Three meals or 30, it takes at least one staff member to do it." There are other reasons for offering breakfast at school. Sometimes kids don’t want to eat first thing in the morning. Or they don’t have time to eat. Sometimes, they don’t have food to eat at home. School districts and educational experts argue that breakfast helps students to concentrate. Lloyd is wise to question government use of taxpayer money. But the claim that breakfast is truly open to anyone and everyone is Barely True. Only students and adults allowed on campus can partake of school breakfasts. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13292	Donald Trump says "that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO..."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/oct/10/tim-kaine/contrary-kaine-claim-trump-hasnt-called-us-break-n/	Tim Kaine says Donald Trump would toss NATO in the trash. "That’s why Donald Trump’s claim that he wants to — that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous," Kaine said Oct. 4 during his debate at Longwood University against Mike Pence, the Republican vice presidential nominee. Pence denied that. So we’ll examine whether Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, really has said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an "obsolete" alliance that should be disbanded. Sarah Peck, the communications director for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign in Virginia, pointed us to a series of Trump speeches and news articles about his comments on NATO. We found additional transcripts of the GOP nominee’s comments on the alliance. There are many instances when Trump said NATO is outdated and argued that it has failed to modernize beyond its original Cold War mission and instead should focus more on fighting the Islamic State and other terrorist threats. "N.A.T.O is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!" Trump said in a March 24 tweet. Trump made a similar statement July 21 during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. "Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost," he said. So "obsolete" is a modifier Trump often attaches to NATO. But we couldn’t find evidence that Trump actually has called for "getting rid of NATO," as Kaine says. In a July 22 interview with The New York Times, Trump was asked if the U.S. should continue putting as much money as it does toward NATO if other countries don’t increase their spending. "I would prefer that we be able to continue (protecting them), but if we are not going to be reasonably reimbursed for the tremendous cost of protecting these massive nations with tremendous wealth. … We’re talking about countries that are doing very well. Then yes, I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, ‘Congratulations, you will be defending yourself,’" Trump said, according to The Times transcript of its interview. Trump has made many other statements that NATO countries that pay too little might not be defended. In an April 2 article in The New York Times noted that Trump told a crowd in Racine, Wis., that if countries don’t pay more toward their defense, they have to get out of the alliance. "And if it breaks up NATO, it breaks up NATO," he said, according to The Times. Trump has made other statements that indicate he’s ambivalent about the alliance’s fate. "I don’t want to get rid of NATO, but you always have to be prepared to walk. It’s possible," Trump said at an Aug. 3 rally in Jacksonville, Fla. During a March 27 interview on ABC, Trump said NATO has been "disproportionately" expensive for the U.S. "And we should readjust NATO," Trump said. "And it's going to have to be either readjusted to take care of terrorism, or we're going to have to set up a new coalition, a new group of countries to handle terrorism, because terrorism is out of control." At a July 27 news conference, Trump raised the issue of NATO again. "I like NATO, just so you understand. I like NATO. I like the concept of NATO. It is somewhat outdated, because it doesn't cover terror the way it should. I've been saying this for six months now," Trump said, according to The Washington Post’s transcript of the event. He added, "I think NATO's great. But it's got to be modernized. And - and countries that we're protecting have to pay what they're supposed to be paying." During his first debate with Clinton on Sept. 26, Trump said, "I’m all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also." Our ruling Kaine said Trump has said "that NATO is obsolete, and that we need to get rid of NATO." The record is full of instances when Trump called the alliance "obsolete," but that doesn’t means he’s called for its end. To the contrary, Trump has spoken of a future for NATO as long as other nations shoulder more of NATO’s costs and make other changes. If they won’t do so, then Trump has voiced ambivalence about the alliance’s future. But Kaine’s statement leaves the misleading impression that Trump is advocating for NATO’s demise.

In a memo written for the second day of the convention, the RNC focused on Obama's economic plan. The Democrats' speeches "will also touch on Barack Obama's plan to achieve energy independence. Yet, Barack Obama and Joe Biden oppose new drilling at home and oppose nuclear power. Either they don't understand the seriousness of the energy situation or they aren't giving straight answers to the American people," the RNC opined. It's true that Obama and Biden have opposed expanded offshore drilling in the past. However, Obama has said that he would accept drilling as part of a compromise bill that enacts broader energy reforms. We weren't able to find any public statements from Biden on the energy compromise. The RNC is on considerably shakier ground when it says Obama and Biden oppose nuclear power. Obama has said that nuclear power "has to be part of our energy mix" in attaining energy independence, though it does require environmental safeguards. He's also said that he hopes developing technology will provide better answers to the problem of nuclear waste storage. Biden's position is similar; he has said nuclear energy "must be part of our future" but that "serious safety, security and waste issues must be solved." Having concerns about safety, though, doesn't mean you're against nuclear energy, and Obama and Biden have specifically said that they support nuclear energy. Obama's position on drilling has some flexibility as well. Given that much of the RNC's statement is not correct, we rate their statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08859	"Canada sets aside 36 percent of their visas for people with skills they think their country needs. We set aside 6 percent."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/05/michael-bloomberg/bloomberg-claims-canada-allows-far-more-work-visas/	Immigration has become a hot-button issue this year and politicians are complaining that the United States has outdated laws and weak enforcement of border security. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg took up the debate on NBC's Meet the Press on Aug. 1, 2010, arguing that the U.S. should seek immigrants with valuable work skills. "You have to give visas for the skills we need," Bloomberg said. "Canada sets aside 36 percent of their visas for people with skills they think their country needs. We set aside 6 percent. We educate the doctors and then don't give them a green card." Since we don't often hear about Canada's immigration policies, we decided to dig in and see if he was right. But before we get into the numbers, we should point out some important differences between immigration policies in the United States and Canada. The U.S. gives highest priority to family members of citizens and immigrants with work permits (which are often known as green cards) under the philosophy that immigrants with family members in the U.S. are more easily integrated into American society. Over two-thirds of all immigrants enter the U.S. through family reunification. Humanitarian protection and employment-based immigration account for the other third of legal immigration. Canada's system, on the other hand, takes a different approach. Although it permits immigration through family reunification and humanitarian protection channels, it primarily relies on a point system to determine who will be permitted through economic channels. The point system is designed to encourage immigration by those who seem likely to make the greatest contribution to the Canadian economy. The system awards points based on criteria such as level of education, languages spoken, occupation and whether or not the immigrant has relatives in Canada. Only candidates with enough points can apply for a Canadian work visa. So at the outset, the two systems were set up for very different purposes -- and encourage very different types of immigration. With that in mind, let's dig into the figures. There is no limit to the number of people who can immigrate to the U.S. through the family reunification process, as long as the immigrant's application is sponsored by a citizen. Employment-based immigration, on the other hand, is capped at 140,000 per year. Because employment-sponsored immigrants can also immigrate with spouses and children, only about 40 percent of those 140,000 visas go to workers themselves; the other 60 percent go to dependents. In the U.S., annual limits and caps on specific types of immigration were established in the 1990 Immigration Act, but there is no overall number limiting total immigration into the U.S. each year. Because there's no total cap on the number of visas available, it's impossible to say that 6 percent of visas are "set aside." There is no U.S. law that sets aside 6 percent of the annual flow of immigrants for skilled workers; rather, Department of Homeland Security data shows that most years about 6 percent of U.S. immigrants are sponsored by U.S. employers. Bloomberg's office told us the numbers come from a book published by the Brookings Institution that said 6.5 percent of immigrants came on employment visas. But we find that Bloomberg misspoke when he said that 6 percent of visas are set aside. While there is a cap on visas for economic immigrants or skilled workers, the cap is not a percentage. Canada, by contrast, does not cap job-related immigration. Instead, it sets annual "targets," which are given as a range. In 2009, for example, the government hoped that between 156,300 and 166,800 skilled workers would become Canadian permanent residents. Bloomberg's assertion that any Canadian visas are "set aside" is incorrect. When we crunched the actual data from 2009 (not the limits or targets), we found that 63,997 Canadian immigrants came as principle workers and accounted for 25.4 percent of the total 252,124 who became Canadian permanent residents in 2009, well below the 36 percent Bloomberg cited. Bloomberg's figure for Canada may have come from a single category of economic immigrants, "Skilled Workers," which, if dependents are included, accounted for 38 percent of all immigrants. If it did, he was comparing a small subsection of Canadian economic immigrants, including dependents, and the entire category of U.S. economic immigrants, not including dependents. That, in our view, is an apples to oranges comparison. So let's recap. While Bloomberg correctly noted an interesting disparity between Canadian and U.S. immigration policies, his facts are off. First, he says that the U.S. and Canada both set aside certain percentages of their visas. But only the U.S. limits visas for specific types of immigrants, and it does so with a number, not a percentage as he claims. And there is no "set aside" as Bloomberg says. We find the statement False.	None	Michael Bloomberg	None	None	None	2010-08-05T17:08:29	2010-08-01	['Canada']
pomt-02051	Says Barack Obama is the only American president who has not visited the D-Day Monument in Normandy on D-Day.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/30/chain-email/chain-email-falsely-claims-obama-only-president-no/	Off and on for several years, readers have been sending us a chain email that claims, among other things, that President Barack Obama is the only American president in the last 69 years who has failed to visit France’s D-Day Monument on D-Day. With the D-Day anniversary coming up -- the pivotal Allied invasion of Normandy took place on June 6, 1944 -- we thought it was time to check it out again. You can read the full text here. In addition to the claims about Obama, the email also makes false statements about the D-Day anniversary celebrations in Normandy and the number of American forces involved in the battle. The email is fairly lengthy, so we’ll break it down into parts. Obama is the only American president in the last 69 years who has not visited the D-Day Monument on D-Day. The email claims that since the D-Day invasion in 1944, the United States "has only four times not been there to do the honors." The language of the email is ambiguous, but we will assume it is referring to "there" as the D-Day Monument in Normandy, rather than also including the monuments in the United States and Britain. There are actually only four American presidents who have visited the D-Day Monument on D-Day. While Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Ford, Carter and George H.W. Bush all visited France after 1944, they were never there on D-Day. Presidents Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson never went to France at all, according to the State Department. Here are the four who did visit Normandy on D-Day anniversaries: Ronald Reagan attended commemorative ceremonies and delivered the 40th anniversary address in 1984. Bill Clinton gave a speech at the 50th anniversary in 1994. At the 60th anniversary in 2004, George W. Bush delivered an address in Normandy with French President Jacques Chirac. Previously in 2001, Bush spoke at the dedication of the National D-Day Memorial in Bedford, Virginia. And in 2002, he spoke at an event in Normandy on Memorial Day, but it was not associated with D-Day. And the fourth president to speak on D-Day? President Barack Obama, at the 65th anniversary ceremony in 2009, where he dedicated the new visitor center at the U.S. Military Cemetery in Normandy. The email lists events from Obama’s schedules on June 6 of 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, and it’s correct when it says Obama was not at the D-Day anniversary in Normandy in those years. But the email omits mention of the year he was present at the anniversary -- 2009. Making the email’s claim even more ironic is that Obama is scheduled to attend the upcoming 70th anniversary on June 6, 2014 -- which means he would be the only U.S. president to ever visit the D-Day Monument on D-Day twice. For comparison, Snopes.com reported that George W. Bush had no public events connected to D-Day in 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2003, or 2002. Every year the French have a four-day celebration in Normandy complete with American uniforms, tanks, jeeps and guns. The email is largely correct in stating that the French host a celebration in Normandy every year, but it is not necessarily 4 days long. For instance, in 2004, the 60th anniversary of D-Day was remembered with a 3-day celebration that included 17 official ceremonies between June 5 and 7. This year, 2014, marks the 70th anniversary -- possibly the last decennial anniversary for those who took part in or witnessed the battle. To commemorate this event, Normandy is hosting a 3-month long celebration, from June 5 to August 21. D-Day was "the largest invasion ever attempted, where 200,000 Americans stormed the beaches at Normandy" and 6,000 soldiers died. It is true that the invasion of Normandy was the largest land, air and sea operation in the history of warfare. However, the email’s numbers are off when it comes to the troops and casualties involved. Roughly 156,000 Allied troops landed in Normandy on D-Day, but only 73,000 of those were Americans, not 200,000, as the email states. The email also says 6,000 Americans died on D-Day, but this mistakes total casualties for deaths. The D-Day Museum in Britain defines casualties as all losses suffered by the armed forces, including those killed, wounded, missing in action and prisoners of war. There is no official casualty figure for D-Day because of the lack of accurate records, but it is estimated that there were 6,603 American casualties. The U.S. National D-Day Memorial Foundation has recorded the names of individual Allied troops killed on D-Day, verifying 2,499 American fatalities -- not 6,000, as the email says. Our ruling The chain email said that Barack Obama is the only American president who has not visited the D-Day Monument in Normandy on D-Day. This long-circulating email was always wrong -- presidents Reagan, Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama himself had indeed visited the monument in Normandy on D-Day -- but it’s especially wrong now, with Obama scheduled to visit the monument again on D-Day 2014, making him the only president to visit it twice on D-Day.

pomt-02724	Studies suggest the 2017 College Football Playoff Championship game will bring about 1,700 to 1,800 full-time jobs.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/dec/20/ken-hagan/ken-hagan-says-studies-suggest-college-football-ch/	Hillsborough County boosters and politicians were ecstatic when organizers chose Tampa to host the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship game. Even though the new college football playoff system doesn’t start until next year, each season-ending contest promises to be a big event, bringing big money with it. Hillsborough County Commissioner Ken Hagan, who helped develop the city’s bid to playoff executives, told a reporter he thought the game would bring an economic impact "in the range" of the Super Bowl, and had read studies that reflected the game could bring 1,700 to 1,800 full-time jobs to the area. Hagan wasn't quoted directly, but both Hagan and the reporter confirmed to us he had discussed that. "I've attended four national championship games in three different cities, and the energy and excitement surrounding this game is not dissimilar to the Super Bowl," Hagan said. The job numbers kicked off the question here at PolitiFact Florida: How can a single game possibly create that many jobs? We decided to look into that statistic and figure out if that claim is through the uprights or a fumble. By the numbers The game, to be played at Raymond James Stadium on Jan. 9, 2017, is the finale of a playoff system designed to replace the current Bowl Coalition Series used to determine the best team in college football. The first game will be played in Arlington, Texas, in 2015, and in Arizona in 2016. Because the numbers in the story were paraphrased, the first thing we did was call Hagan’s office and confirm he actually said that. He said he had "skimmed" two reports the day before the announcement as the basis for those numbers. One was a South Florida Business Journal story about the economic impact of the 2012-13 Orange Bowl Festival, which included the Orange Bowl and the BCS National Championship game in Miami Gardens. The article reported on a study by Conventions Sports & Leisure International that said the games supported 2,400 new full- and part-time jobs, but no specifics beyond that. PolitiFact Florida attempted to contact Convention Sports & Leisure International, a Dallas event planning and economic development consulting firm, to discuss the findings, but our calls weren’t returned. The second report was by Arizona State University’s W.P. Carey School of Business examining the impact of three bowl games in 2010-2011. That study measured the statewide effects of the Insight Bowl in Tempe and the Fiesta Bowl and BCS National Championship game in Glendale, collectively referred to as the Festival of College Football. The Carey study measured jobs in terms of "labor demand" -- an equivalency for number of worker hours generated by the game. Broken down by event, the BCS National Championship game created the equivalent of 1,919 full-time jobs in Arizona; the Fiesta Bowl produced the equivalent of 469 full-time jobs; and the Insight Bowl added the equivalent of 855 jobs, the ASU study concluded. That doesn’t necessarily mean these are full-time new jobs, but we’ll get to more on that in a moment. Since both reports looked at combinations of games in a metropolitan area during bowl game season, we asked Hagan’s office if the commissioner was linking the championship game with the Jan. 1 Outback Bowl, also played in Raymond James Stadium. His office said he was referring only to the single playoff game. (There is no College Football Playoff National Championship game study yet, because studies are done after an event, and the first game isn't until 2015.) In an interview, Hagan said he had been asked the question about jobs and gave an answer he felt the studies reflected, specifically citing the Arizona State report that said the BCS Championship game created 1,919 jobs. "I don’t know how they came up with it," Hagan said. "It sounds kind of high to me." The experts take the field Are those numbers too high? Yes, said Georgia State University economics professor Bruce Seaman, who wrote a study about the potential impact of a new stadium for the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons. "This is grossly over-optimistic verging on the absurd, and yes, it is probably relating to full-time equivalent jobs, but still this is highly unlikely," he told PolitiFact Florida. So what is the measure of "full-time equivalent" employment? The measure is typically used in economic impact studies, defined as the annual average of monthly jobs in an industry. These can be broken down into fractions of an annual full-time job for the sake of measurement -- it can be recorded as one job for 12 months, or two jobs for six months each, or three jobs for four months and so on. A job can be either full-full time or part-time, and full-time can be defined to be as few as 30 hours a week, Seaman said. So when the reports talk about jobs, they’re not always talking about creating new jobs, even though the language they use sounds like it. The important thing to note is, these jobs aren’t limited to workers at the stadium, like ticket takers or security personnel. They can be direct jobs linked to an event itself, or indirect jobs created as the money from an event circulates through the local economy. Seaman said a more realistic, albeit rough estimate for potential jobs created for a metro area during an event like the championship game would probably be more in the range of 850 to 1,050, not 1,700 to 1,800. A comparable event would be the NFL’s annual Super Bowl, which also rotates host cities. A 2004 study co-authored by College of the Holy Cross economics professor Victor Matheson examined the effects of Super Bowls on their host communities from 1970 to 1997. It found the games brought an equivalent average of 537 jobs. "Nineteen hundred jobs is a crazy number for a one-day event," Matheson said, pointing out an entire NFL team with eight home games a year only generates a few hundred full-time equivalent jobs. "You make your room cleaners and your desk clerks work longer hours. I wouldn’t be surprised if 1,900 people worked some overtime." University of South Florida economics professor Philip Porter said he believed economic impact reports tend to be flawed in any event, because statistical models are designed to measure permanent changes, not necessarily one-time events. Porter worked on a 1999 study tracking economic impact in Hillsborough County, Miami-Dade County and Maricopa County, Ariz., for several Super Bowls, but found no marked increase in taxable sales, during the event or afterward. Porter said he predicted activity in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties "will be no different than usual." Our ruling Hagan told a reporter he had read reports that suggested the game could result in 1,700 to 1,800 jobs for the region, based on findings after prior NCAA football title games. The reports were loaded with numbers, ranging from 2,400 full- and part-time jobs during the Miami area’s 2012-13 Orange Bowl week to 1,919 specified in a report breaking down Glendale’s 2011 title game. Economists said those kinds of numbers tend to be grossly inflated, and are difficult to parse, especially when the determining factors aren’t well-defined. Even with Hagan’s relatively conservative offhand guess, those experts said the numbers are wide of the goalposts. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-01489	"Sen. Mark Begich cast the deciding vote in favor of President Obama’s authority to issue executive amnesty to illegal aliens."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/25/dan-sullivan/begichs-record-illegal-immigration-target-alaska-s/	Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, says he doesn’t support amnesty for illegal immigrants -- but his opponent Republican Dan Sullivan says Begich cast a "deciding vote" that proves he does. Last week, the Senate briefly squabbled over immigration legislation, eventually blocking a Republican proposal from coming to a vote. Now, Republicans are using that as ammunition. Begich voted to block the proposal. In a Sept. 19, 2014, email to supporters, the Sullivan campaign framed this as a blatant contradiction to what Begich has said in the past. "Yesterday Sen. Mark Begich cast the deciding vote in favor of President (Barack) Obama’s authority to issue executive amnesty to illegal aliens," the email says. "Yeah, I couldn’t believe it either. Especially after he told Alaskans he was against executive amnesty." The way it’s phrased, Sullivan’s statement makes it sound like Begich voted "Yes" on a bill that approves Obama’s authority to give amnesty to illegal immigrants. Based on our research, that’s not what happened. What was this vote? The chain of causality is pretty tangled, but we’ll try to break it down succinctly. On Sept. 18, Congress passed a bill that funds the government through mid December, including allocations to equip and train Syrian rebels. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., wanted to attach an amendment to the bill that would have stripped down the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program (more on the specifics of the amendment later). However, they couldn’t propose their amendment. Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., had filled the bill up with his own amendments -- effectively blocking any others from consideration. Cruz and Sessions asked for a vote to table (kill) one of Reid’s amendments to make room for their proposal. The Senate voted exactly 50-50, with Begich voting "no." The measure needed 51 votes to pass, so it failed, and the Cruz-Sessions proposal never made it to the floor. Both conservative and liberal media outlets have played this as a vote either for or against Obama’s immigration authority. It’s possible that some senators voted "no" on this measure because they do not support the Cruz-Sessions amendment, but it’s not a given. Begich’s campaign said he did not support the procedural measure because it would have slowed consideration of the primary bill, which Begich opposed. In sum: The Senate did not vote on a bill that addressed Obama’s "executive amnesty." They voted on whether or not they should kill an amendment that addressed numbering in another amendment. The deciding vote? The Cruz-Sessions measure was one vote away from passing. The tally split almost evenly along party lines, except for five Democrats -- four of whom are up for re-election -- who sided with Republicans. Begich sided with Democrats, but was his the "deciding vote"? We’ve checked many, many claims that say a Democrat cast the deciding vote for the Affordable Care Act. Usually, those claims rate a Mostly False. In order for the measure to pass, it needed every vote up to and including the tiebreaker, so it leaves out a lot of context to designate one individual as the ultimate tiebreaker. The same logic applies here. It’s easy to pin blame on Begich because he is a Democrat running for re-election in a red state, so he likely felt pressure to vote both ways. In an interview with Politico, he joked that he possibly could have been swayed to vote with the Republicans but ultimately decided against it. But that doesn’t mean Begich is the only senator who was on the fence. Amnesty? Whether or not the Cruz-Sessions amendment addresses "executive amnesty" -- as Sullivan’s comment says -- is almost a moot point because Begich never voted on it. We want to hash it out anyway. The amendment -- a version of which passed the House in August -- would have stripped funding from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and prevented it from being expanded upon. The program is aimed at young people who arrived in the United States illegally as children. (They’re sometimes referred to as "Dreamers" because legislation that would permanently address their status is known as the DREAM Act.) Experts disagree on whether or not the Deferred Action program can be considered "executive amnesty." It is an executive program, to be sure -- Obama and the Department of Homeland Security established the program in 2012. It allows people who were brought to the United States as children and meet other requirements to apply for a two-year deportation deferral and work permit, which can be renewed. (Sullivan’s statement makes it seem like the entire illegal immigrant population is in play.) "In the immigration context, amnesty is anything that lets an illegal alien stay legally," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels. With this definition, Krikorian said Deferred Action is a two-year amnesty program. On the other side, immigration policy attorney Kamal Essaheb said Deferred Action is not amnesty because it doesn’t permanently prevent someone from being deported. Nor does it absolve them from their crime of entering the country illegally. A more accurate descriptor is "prosecutorial discretion" because it helps prioritize deportation cases -- of which there are too many for the courts to realistically handle, said Essaheb, who works for the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group. We asked several experts about this and heard both arguments multiple times. We searched news databases and couldn’t find any Begich commentary on the Deferred Action program specifically. However, he has said he doesn’t support the president using executive action to give illegal immigrants amnesty. At a debate in Anchorage last month, Begich and Sullivan were asked if they would support the president taking executive action on giving amnesty to illegal immigrants, according to local publication News-Miner. "No. Congress needs to be a part of it," Begich said. (Sullivan said, "No way.") Our ruling Sullivan said Begich "cast the deciding vote in favor of President Obama’s authority to issue executive amnesty to illegal aliens." Begich never voted on this question. In reality, Begich voted "no" on a procedural measure, along with 49 other senators. As a result, a amendment regarding immigration policy did not come up for a vote. It’s debatable whether this amendment really addressed "executive amnesty," and it had little chance of passing even if it hadn’t been blocked. Begich’s vote did not increase Obama’s authority, as Sullivan’s statement makes it seem. Rather, it maintained the status quo. We rate this claim False.

pomt-08138	"Understand, this is unemployment insurance. It’s not welfare, as a lot of my Republican colleagues like to suggest it is. You pay into it when you’re working. You get help when you’re not."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/dec/07/sherrod-brown/brown-says-congress-needs-show-compassion-and-exte/	If you lose your job and it’s not your fault -- you didn’t steal, sell trade secrets or tell rude customers what they could do with that hideous tie they want to return the hellish day after Christmas -- you can usually get unemployment benefits. Here’s how it works: The state of Ohio will help you out for 26 weeks. Then a federal program kicks in to cover 20 more weeks during times of high unemployment. But in the recessionary doldrums of the last two years, Congress has given even more help -- up to 53 weeks more. That makes all these jobless benefits add up to 99 weeks. The latest congressional extension, though, expired on Nov. 30, and Congress hasn’t decided whether to grant another one. The money would have to come from the federal Treasury, which already borrows money to keep the government operating, and that’s the biggest hangup. Some lawmakers say they don’t want to keep adding to the deficit, so they’re insisting on offsets from other domestic programs. Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio is not in that camp, however. He says that people who get unemployment compensation tend to spend it right away on groceries or rent, so it has a stimulative effect. Many, but not all, economists agree. Regardless, Brown says that Congress needs to show some compassion, because so many Americans are struggling to find work. "Understand, this is unemployment insurance," Brown told MSNBC anchor Contessa Brewer on Nov. 30. "It’s not welfare, as a lot of my Republican colleagues like to suggest it is. You pay into it when you’re working. You get help when you’re not." Brown raises several points that we thought were worth checking. The key point: Do workers pay into the unemployment system and then draw benefits from it if they lose their jobs? The unemployment system is a bit more complex than that. Workers don’t pay into the system. But their employers do, up to a point. In Ohio, private employers pay anywhere from 0.5 percent to 9.4 percent of the first $9,000 of workers’ wages into the state uninsurance fund, according to the state’s Department of Job and Family Services. A company’s payroll size, its total contributions and its claims experience account for the variation. Generally, companies that lay off a lot of people have higher unemployment taxes. There also is a federal unemployment compensation fee, but it comes to only 0.8 percent. Back to Brown’s claim: "You pay into it when you’re working." As just mentioned, it’s actually the employer who pays into it. Brown and his communications director said he is fully aware of this, but that employers regard their premiums as part of the cost of compensation, so in a figurative manner he was saying the same thing. Brown made that point again Dec. 1 in a conference call with reporters to discuss an unrelated matter and we asked him about paying for unemployment compensation. We checked with economists at the socially liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Regardless both agreed Brown is essentially right. "That’s a cost of hiring workers, and that’s a reduction in the amount of money that they’re willing to pay in wages," said Chad Stone, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics at Heritage, said that economists believe 85 percent of the cost of these taxes on employers would otherwise fall back to the employees. OK, so the employee pays the taxes indirectly. But that only covers the state portion of jobless benefits, or 26 weeks. Everything after that is coming from the federal government. "It’s mostly deficit financing at this point," said Sherk. Money from that first 20-week extension would ordinarily be split between the state and federal governments, but the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- better known as the stimulus act -- picked up the state’s portion. One more component of Brown’s claim: that "a lot of my Republican colleagues" like to suggest that unemployment insurance is like welfare. This was an important part of the claim because it explains why he felt the need to clarify how the system is funded -- not by freeloaders but by workers who pay into the system. So we asked Brown’s communications director, Meghan Dubyak, to back up this part of the claim, too. She sent us news stories and links to transcripts, newscasts and news releases in which lawmakers or candidates said that unemployment payments can encourage people to stay jobless (Senate candidate Sharon Angle, Sen.-elect Ron Johnson, Sen. Richard Burr and others); are a disincentive to seeking work (Sen. John Kyl), or, stated another way, pose the risk of creating hobos (Rep. Dean Heller of Nevada). Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah proposed that people receiving federal benefits, including jobless benefits, be tested for drugs. Far be it from us to analyze the behavior of all people who are out of work or say whether they’d rather collect benefits -- which average about $300 a week -- than get a job. But according to the Wall Street Journal, the Federal Reserve Bank estimates that the receipt of unemployment benefits explains only 0.4 to 1.7 percentage points of the unemployment rate, which nationally is 9.8 percent. In other words, most people would rather work. So let’s break down Brown’s claim and our fact-finding. "A lot of my Republican colleagues" like to suggest that jobless benefits are like welfare. What he meant was clear enough -- that they equate jobless benefits to the public dole. We can’t quantify "a lot." But Brown’s staff provided numerous examples that show there are Republicans saying they worry that jobless benefits encourage people to stay out of work. This isn’t to suggest it is a majority view. But Brown did not say "most." He said "a lot." This part of the claim, then, warrants at least a Half True. "You pay into it when you’re working." Economists from the right and left agreed that this is essentially correct, with some elaboration required. So it is Mostly True. "You get help when you’re not." This is True. This entire discussion needs a caveat. MSNBC put Brown on the air because of the ongoing debate over extending federal jobless benefits. The reason for debate is the fact that the federal government has to pick up the tab and it will have to borrow more to do so, at least in the short term. To put matters clearly: You pay into the unemployment compensation through your employer, and that pool of money pays for your state benefits -- but not your federal benefits -- if you lose your job. We could use the averages from the three pieces to Brown’s claim -- Half True (but unmeasurable), Mostly True and True -- and arrive at a rating of Mostly True. Or we could turn to the principles of the Truth-o-Meter. According to those principles, a statement is Mostly True if it is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Either way you slice it, we arrive at the same place: Mostly True.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2010-12-07T06:00:00	2010-11-30	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-09468	"We worked together to enact ... the largest tax cut in Florida history."	false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/02/charlie-crist/crist-largest-tax-cut-florida-history/	In his final State of the State address, Gov. Charlie Crist made a big claim that we've heard before. "In our first year, we guided our state through the storm of skyrocketing property taxes and property insurance," Crist said March 2, 2010, in front of a joint session of the Florida Legislature. "We worked together to enact meaningful property insurance reform and the largest tax cut in Florida history." Crist has often touted his tax-cutting record and repeatedly said he and the Republican Legislature passed "the largest tax cut" in the state's history. He's made that claim in news releases, political speeches and in the first radio ad for his U.S. Senate campaign. We first put it to our Truth-O-Meter in September 2009. Here's the background: The property tax changes Crist is talking about were passed by the Legislature in 2007 and sold as the antidote to citizens' complaints that local government spending had spiraled out of control. House Bill 1B required local governments to reduce their property tax rates to 2006 levels and mandated deeper cuts based on how much a local government collected in property tax dollars. The reported savings to taxpayers: $15.6 billion over five years. House Bill 5B, meanwhile, let voters consider further property tax changes. Also known as Amendment 1, the changes — which included an additional homestead benefit, limited property value increases for non-homesteaded property and created portability for Save Our Homes — were approved by voters in January 2008. The savings: $9.3 billion over five years. Combined, that's about $25 billion in predicted property tax savings over five years. But those predictions don't jive with reality, we found. Specifically, the governor's $25 billion estimate could be accurate only if: • Property tax values increased as analysts predicted back when the tax package was passed (3 to 5 percent a year), and; • Local governments failed to reduce their tax rates. We will never know what governments would have done to their tax rates, but we do know about property tax values: They haven't gone up. They've gone down. Taxable property values dropped 15 percent in 2008, according to figures from county property appraisers. Property values dropped again in 2009 and are expected to drop in 2010. That means the governor's projections are high. And moreover, another tax cut is bigger -- Save Our Homes. Save Our Homes, an amendment to the state Constitution approved by voters in 1992, limited increases to the property value of homesteaded property in Florida. While there is debate about whether those savings were offset by people without homestead exemptions, the savings to homesteaded property owners is quantifiable. From 1996 to 2008, almost $1.9 trillion in property value went untaxed because of Save Our Homes. Using a conservative tax rate of 17 mills, that equates to $32 billion less in property taxes paid — or about $2.66 billion per year without adjusting for inflation. In 2007, the savings was about $7.27 billion and from 2004 to 2008 the estimated savings was more than $26 billion. Those numbers certainly are bigger than Crist's tax package, in reality or projection. The governor's office said it did not consider Save Our Homes when it made the claim that the Crist tax changes constitute the state's largest. Officials then provided data that showed the savings in the first years of Save Our Homes was modest. But that's because the large savings came in later years as Save Our Homes protected against increases to properties' taxable value. The Crist-led changes to Florida's property tax structure certainly required the lowering of tax rates and assessment values throughout Florida. But there are all kinds of holes in projecting the size and scope of the legislation's impact. For example: • The basis for the governor's estimate assumed a future that did not come to pass. Specifically, the governor's estimates relied on future property values continuing to increase and local governments failing to lower their property tax rate. We now know property values are decreasing. • The governor's office admitted its projections are inaccurate because of declines in property values statewide. • A state analysis concluded that the tax measures have failed to produce the savings estimated by the governor. Portability, for instance, was predicted to cut taxable property values by $11.5 billion in 2008. But it cut property values only $3.4 billion, the analysis showed. In the absence of additional data, and with the knowledge that Save Our Homes has cut property tax bills for Florida residents $32 billion or more, we find no changes since we rated this in September. We can't agree with Crist that the 2007 and 2008 changes constitute the largest tax cut in state history. We rule Crist's statement False.

pomt-02115	Congress used earmarks "for more than 200 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/13/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-congress-used-earmarks-200-years/	The term "earmark" has become something of a dirty word in Washington in recent years, with lawmakers pledging not to use the special funding carve-outs to aid groups back in their district. Taxpayer groups have long criticized earmarks for encouraging wasteful spending. But could the pendulum now be swinging the other way? Recently, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., was quoted speaking favorably of earmarks, something you don’t hear every day in Washington. Reid defended the practice by claiming earmarks are an American tradition. "I have been a fan of earmarks since I got here the first day," Reid said on May 6, 2014. "Keep in mind, that’s what the country has done for more than 200 years, except for the brief period of time in recent years that we haven’t done these." "And I'll say this ...if there needs to be more transparency than what we had, then fine, do it," he added. "But it is wrong to have bureaucrats downtown make decisions in Nevada that I can make better than they can make." We wondered if earmarks have been around that long, so we took a look. First, some background. Although there is some variation in the definition of "earmark," the term generally refers to provisions in bills that set aside funds for specific projects or programs at the state or local level. Shortly after celebrating victory in the 2010 midterm elections, House Republicans chose to institute a ban on earmarks. The House’s rules meant this ban effectively blocked the use of earmarks in the entire 112th Congress. Some say that the ban on earmarks has contributed to gridlock, and that bringing them back might grease the wheels for moving legislations through Congress. Historical Context The first instance of Congress using the practice we now refer to as earmarking was in the Lighthouse Act of 1789, said Don Ritchie, a historian with the Senate Historical Office. This measure, passed by the first Congress, allocated federal funds for the construction of lighthouses in states along the Atlantic coast. The earmarking in this act was drawn up by the congressional delegation from Pennsylvania, which, along with the help of an interest group, pushed to include federal funding for a pier in Philadelphia, according to a 1991 report from the Senate Historical Office. This is also considered the first time an interest group helped craft legislation. "It’s an old practice that has appeared and re-appeared under different names," Ritchie said. Ritchie added that South Carolina Sen. John C. Calhoun used what amounts to an earmark in the Bonus Bill of 1817, which would have allocated money to be used for public works projects in the states. Calhoun’s fellow senator, Kentucky’s Henry Clay, used a similar method as part of his signature "American System" infrastructure initiative, according to Ritchie. It is important to note that then-President James Madison vetoed Calhoun’s bill, arguing that Congress did not have the power to make such appropriations. However, just because it was vetoed by the president doesn’t mean the measure can’t still be considered an earmark. Around the end of the 19th century, politicians began referring to the practice as "pork barrel" politics, and would tack funding for projects they wanted completed onto bills or lobby heads of agencies to request the project as part of their budgets, Ritchie said. So the earmark has a long history. But that doesn’t mean it’s been an equally important tactic for all of that time. Indeed, such prior examples pale compared to the surge in earmarked spending starting about two decades ago. Between 1994 and 2005, total spending from earmarks more than doubled, rising from $218 million to $500 million, according to the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress. Over the same time period, earmarked spending as a percentage of total appropriation rose from 1.3 percent to 3 percent. That explosion of earmarking was a big departure from the work of earlier Congresses. Calling measures like Calhoun’s plan an earmark "misrepresents the whole history," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "Even if they were earmark-ish, they were the exception, rather than the rule," he said. We should note that not everyone has exactly the same definition for "earmark." The Congressional Research Service acknowledged the difficulty of nailing down the definition of "earmark," noting in January 2006 that "one of the principal challenges to measuring earmarks in appropriation bills is defining the term and applying it consistently to the analysis." The report also quotes Congressional Quarterly’s American Congressional Dictionary as allowing that under a looser definition, "virtually every appropriation" could be considered "earmarked." Our ruling Reid said Congress has used earmarked spending for "more than 200 years." A credible case can be made that Congress engaged in something like earmarking as long ago as 1789 and 1817. The tactic wasn’t used extensively and consistently during that whole period, and it really exploded in the past 20 years, before being phased out more recently. Still, Reid has a point that legislators have long directed spending, and there are 200-year-old (and older) examples of things that are very much like earmarks. We rate Reid’s claim Mostly True. Correction: This report has been changed to remove a reference to an article that examined the history of the earmark. We incorrectly identified the source of article as Taxpayers for Common Sense, but their site only reproduced the article.

pomt-01483	Says President Barack Obama has launched "twice as many strikes (on) countries that are predominantly Muslim" than President George W. Bush.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/28/lz-granderson/lz-granderson-obama-has-bombed-twice-many-muslim-c/	In light of recent U.S. military involvement in the Middle East, some say the voters who put President Barack Obama into office in 2008 didn’t sign up for this. On CNN’s State of the Union Sept. 28, political commentator LZ Granderson said Obama is losing favor among his base supporters because of his recent foreign policy decisions. In 2008, they were tired of the wars started under former President George W. Bush and were hoping that a new president would bring them to a close. "They voted for him because he was supposed to end these wars and stop bombing people," Granderson said. "And when you look at the raw numbers, three times as much Special Forces were used than ‘W.’, twice as many strikes (on) countries that are predominantly Muslim. Those were not the numbers that his staunch progressive base voted for." Last week, we fact-checked the New Yorker’s Washington correspondent Ryan Lizza, who tweeted, "Countries bombed: Obama 7, Bush 4." We rated that claim True. Granderson’s claim that there have been "twice as many strikes (on) countries that are predominantly Muslim" is similar to Lizza’s -- but with the added caveat that these are Muslim countries, so we decided to check it out again. The tally When we compared Bush and Obama last week, Lizza sent us this list of countries that had been bombed by each president: Bush: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Somalia. Obama: Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Syria. We asked Granderson for additional evidence. He cited the same numbers as Lizza, and pointed to a supporting CNN article. We found little reason to challenge the nations Lizza and Granderson named. If anything, they shortchanged both presidents. There’s no question about airstrikes in Afghanistan and Iraq -- Bush launched wars in both countries, and airstrikes have continued there under Obama. Drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia have been in the news for a long time, with or without official acknowledgment. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit news service based at City University London, maintains a running list of U.S. military actions in a number of countries, including Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen, based on press and official reports. By its tally, American drone strikes against suspected terrorists in Somalia occurred under both Bush and Obama. In the case of Yemen, we found evidence of just one airstrike there under Bush -- back in 2002, reported by BBC News and Time magazine. This would increase Bush’s total to five countries, but the strikes have been much more frequent under Obama. The air attacks on Libya that helped topple Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 under Obama are well documented. In March 2011, the United States and British warships fired more than 100 cruise missiles to destroy Libyan air defenses. And, of course, there’s now Syria. We also found some unconfirmed reports of drone attacks on suspected militant camps in the Philippines in 2006 and 2012, reported by the New York Times and an expert at the Brookings Institute. If these reports are accurate, the totals for Bush and Obama would rise by one. The final, maximum number would be Bush 6: Obama 8. Predominantly Muslim Granderson is correct to say these countries are all predominantly Muslim (with the exception of the Philippines, which is not included in his tally). We found at a Pew report that said each of the seven countries with confirmed airstrikes under Obama are more than 90 percent Muslim, as of 2010. Afghanistan: 99.8 percent Iraq: 98.9 percent Pakistan: 96.4 percent Somalia: 98.6 percent Yemen: 99.0 percent Libya: 96.6 percent Syria: 92.8 percent The Philippines, on the other hand, is just 5.1 percent Muslim. For comparison, the United States is 0.8 percent Muslim, according to the Pew report. Our ruling Granderson said Obama has conducted "twice as many strikes (on) countries that are predominantly Muslim" as Bush. By Granderson’s count -- Bush four countries, Obama seven countries -- it’s a little less than twice (1.75 times to be exact). While you can make arguments that both Bush and Obama have bombed additional countries, we think Granderson -- and Lizza before him -- are using reasonable figures based on what’s publicly known. Granderson’s claim is accurate but could use the caveat nearly twice. As such, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-08011	Members of Congress and their families and staff are exempt from repaying student loans.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/11/chain-email/do-members-congress-have-pay-back-student-loans-ye/	The latest chain e-mail we've received could be a new classic of the genre: Congress gets special perks nobody else does, a complacent media ignores the news (well, except for Fox News) and a request to forward it on to 20 people. Here's the text: "Monday on Fox news they learned that the staffers of Congress family members are exempt from having to pay back student loans. This will get national attention if other news networks will broadcast it. When you add this to the (items) below, just where will all of it stop?" The e-mail then includes a list of other purported examples of Congress giving itself special treatment, such as paying members for life, exempting members from sexual harassment laws, and leaving themselves out of "the Healthcare Reform... In all of its forms." Not one of these claims is accurate. The student loan claim, though, was a new one for us. We decided to see if it could possibly be true. The e-mail says that "the staffers of Congress family members are exempt from having to pay back student loans." It's confusingly worded, but we're going to assume the person meant relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers. We contacted the U.S. Department of Education, which informed us that these groups are not exempt from paying back student loans. They have to pay back their loans like everyone else. "There are no provisions under Title IV (federal student aid programs) that provide loan forgiveness for Members of Congress or their families or staff (beyond what any other borrower would be eligible for)," said Jane Glickman, a spokesperson for the department, in an e-mail statement. We wondered if the confusion arose because there are federal programs that help a small number of government workers pay back their student loans. It's called the Federal Student Loan Repayment Program, and it's meant to improve recruitment and retention. If a federal agency really wants to hire someone, it can offer to help pay the prospective employee's student loans. In exchange, the employee agrees to work for the agency for a minimum of three years. The payments are considered a form of income, and the worker pays taxes on them. The program is fairly small: In 2010, the government repaid student loans for 8,454 employees. This compares with a total federal civilian workforce of about 2.7 million. According to government statistics, the program is used mostly by the U.S. Justice Department, the Defense Department, the State Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Government Accountability Office and the Department of Health and Human Services. Congressional staffers are eligible for a similar assistance. But members, their spouses and their dependent children are not eligible for the program, said Dan Weiser, a spokesman with the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer for the U.S. House of Representatives. We should emphasize that there's an enormous difference between an individual competing for and receiving a job offer that includes student loan payments as a benefit and an across-the-board exemption for people in power. The chain e-mail seems to have no conception of that. Still, it wasn't that long ago that Congress did exempt itself from laws that other people had to follow. In 1995, Congress passed the Congressional Accountability Act, which applied 13 laws to members that hadn't applied previously. Several of the laws involved discrimination in the workplace, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Getting back to the question at hand, though: The chain e-mail said that members of Congress, their families and staff members do not have to repay student loans. This is ridiculously false.

pomt-09548	The Senate-passed health care bill "is identical to the Massachusetts health care plan -- the same thing."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/04/paul-krugman/krugman-calls-senate-health-care-bill-similar-law-/	The recent Massachusetts Senate election captivated Americans far beyond the Bay State. In that contest, Republican Scott Brown picked up a seat formerly held by the late Democratic giant Edward Kennedy. Brown's upset victory was aided by a wave of frustration over how Congress and President Barack Obama have been handling health care reform legislation. During the campaign, Brown said that if he was elected, he would become the 41st Republican senator, enabling the GOP to block the Democratic majority from reaching the 60-vote threshold required to pass key legislation, including a health care bill. The Senate has already passed a version of health care, but it needs to be reconciled with a different bill passed by the House and then signed by the president before it becomes law. As it happened, Massachusetts passed its own health care reform plan in 2006, with the help of both Republican Gov. Mitt Romney and a heavily Democratic legislature. Brown, then serving in the state Senate, voted for the plan. On the Jan. 31, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, host Barbara Walters asked Brown about his vote on the Massachusetts plan. "Why isn't what's good for Massachusetts good for the whole country?" she asked. Brown responded, "In Massachusetts, the free market, the free enterprise has taken control, and they're offering a wide range of plans. I've never ever said that people should not get health insurance. It's just a question of if we're going to take a one-size-fits-all government plan or we're going to do something where the individual states can tailor their plans as we've done." When Walters asked him, "Do you think the whole plan should be scrapped?" Brown said, "Yes." "The whole plan?" Walters continued. "Yes," Brown said. Later, during the show's round-table segment, liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman expressed disbelief at Brown's response. "That was the most evasive answer," Krugman said. "If you think this is a straightforward guy, that was an incredibly evasive answer on health care, because the Senate bill, which has now stalled, is identical to the Massachusetts health care plan -- the same thing. Only in the finest of fine print is there any difference. He voted for the Massachusetts plan. A majority of voters in Massachusetts who voted for him approve of the Massachusetts health care plan. Nonetheless, their plan is dead." We wanted to see whether the Massachusetts plan was indeed "the same thing" as the bill passed by the U.S. Senate. So we looked at the details of both plans and consulted with an ideologically diverse group of health policy experts. The consensus among our experts was that Krugman is basically right on the overall structure, although some of the details differ. As Elizabeth A. McGlynn, associate director of RAND Health, put it, "Same recipe, different amounts on the ingredients." Here are elements of the two plans that are broadly the same, along with some of the differences in details: • Individual mandate to buy health insurance. Everyone in Massachusetts must purchase health insurance or else pay a penalty; the same goes for the Senate plan, though the penalty structures vary between the two. • Employer responsibilities for offering health insurance. Companies with more than 10 employees in Massachusetts need to offer health insurance or else pay a penalty. The Senate bill sets the bar for companies at 50 employees, though technically the bill falls short of a mandate. • Health insurance exchanges. Both the Massachusetts and U.S. Senate plans involve the use of voluntary "exchanges" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. These exchanges are designed to offer a range of plans with different benefits and premium levels. • Affordability subsidies. Under both plans, lower-income individuals and families can receive government subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums. In the Massachusetts plan, subsidies are allotted on a sliding scale up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the U.S. Senate plan, the sliding-scale subsidies go up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. • Expansion of Medicaid. The Massachusetts plan expands Medicaid to all children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. The U.S. Senate plan also expands Medicaid, but in a different fashion, offering it to all individuals (not just children) up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. • Insurance market regulation. Both plans restructure the insurance market, in similar but slightly different ways. In Massachusetts, the reform bill merged the individual and small-group markets (that is, it merged the market serving individuals not covered by their employer's plan with the market serving smaller employers). The U.S. Senate bill placed new regulations on those two markets but kept them separate. In Massachusetts, dependents up to age 25 can be covered on their parents' plan, while the U.S. Senate bill allows such dependent coverage up to age 26. And young adults in Massachusetts from age 19 to 26 can purchase a special lower-cost, lower-benefit plan through the exchange; the U.S. Senate bill creates a category of lower-cost, lower-benefit plan in the exchange for those up to age 30 who cannot find affordable coverage. • Limits on the ratio between the highest and lowest premiums. In Massachusetts, the highest premiums can generally only be twice as high as the lowest premiums. The only factors that can be used to vary premiums are age, tobacco use, geographic area, the nature of the employee's industry, an unusually low participation rate (for group plans) and participation in a wellness plan. The U.S. Senate bill allows premiums in the individual and small-group market and on the exchange to vary based only on age (limited to a 3-to-1 ratio), geographic area, family composition and tobacco use (limited to 1.5 -to-1 ratio). Wellness programs do not factor into ratings variations under the Senate bill, but the bill does provide other incentives for such plans. The bills differ more noticeably in several other areas. • Cost containment. Critics of the Massachusetts plan have taken it to task for its lack of cost-containment provisions. The U.S. Senate bill makes changes to Medicare that are intended to lower program costs, such as restructuring how payments are made to Medicare Advantage plans -- the HMO option under Medicare. Since Medicare is a federal program, the Massachusetts plan does not address this issue. The U.S. Senate bill also authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to approve generic versions of certain drugs. This, too, is a federal rather than a state responsibility. • Financing. Both the Massachusetts plan and the Senate bill are financed in part by revenue generated from the individual and employer mandates. But the Massachusetts plan's financing is heavily dependent on leveraging federal matching funds, while the Senate bill, in addition to cost savings from Medicare, imposes taxes on drugmakers, device manufacturers, health insurers and indoor tanning services. It also taxes high-cost ("Cadillac") health care plans. The Massachusetts plan does not do any of these things. "The Senate probably has more cost containment," said John Holahan, a health expert at the Urban Institute who has studied the Massachusetts plan extensively. "And the financing is different. But the structure is the same." So it seems that there's broad agreement that, despite some operational differences, the broad structure of the Massachusetts health care plan is quite similar to that in the U.S. Senate bill -- certainly more similar than either one is to, say, a single-payer health care plan or even to the current system. Krugman's comparison of the two plans is Mostly True.	None	Paul Krugman	None	None	None	2010-02-04T18:05:32	2010-01-31	['Massachusetts']

abbc-00232	In recent weeks, the fate of an aging power station in NSW's Hunter Valley has become the unlikely focus of a spirited debate over Australia's energy mix.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-22/fact-check3a-is-compulsory-acquisition-a-last-resort-for-extre/9718900	Mr Wilson's claim is overreach. It would be highly unusual for the Commonwealth to acquire a working asset such as the Liddell Power Station. Over recent times, governments of all persuasions have to varying degrees sought to privatise infrastructure and essential services, not buy them. It is unsurprising that a conservative member of parliament, holding a core ideological belief in the private sector, would be hesitant to acquire an asset unless doing so was "the last resort". But there is nothing in Commonwealth or state legislation that requires compulsory acquisition to be used only as a last resort or in extreme situations. The Government could choose to immediately start the process to compulsorily acquire Liddell. And putting aside the specific case of Liddell, governments of both political persuasions regularly use compulsory acquisition powers for road and other infrastructure projects that are not critical and when other options may be available. The new Western Sydney Airport, for instance, will be on land that was mostly acquired in the late 1980s. And it has been argued that the Victorian Government is planning to compulsorily acquire private bus company assets, even though there is no suggestion of a urgent crisis in bus services in that state. Mr Wilson's claim in itself is ambiguous. A viewer might have taken him to be expressing a personal opinion on when he believed compulsory acquisition should be used. But he does not preface the claim as an opinion, and it is couched in general terms: it is apparently "understood" that compulsory acquisition is "the power of absolute last resort". It was clearly open to a viewer to take Mr Wilson's comments to be a statement of fact.

pomt-01712	"I've either balanced every budget or we turned back a surplus."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/08/david-clarke-jr/david-clarke-jr-says-hes-never-had-budget-deficit-/	With the critical Democratic primary approaching, Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. is emphasizing his fiscal record over his past decade in office. Clarke will face Chris Moews, a Milwaukee Police lieutenant, for the second time in the Aug. 12, 2014 primary. In November, the winner will face independent challenger Angela Nicole Walker, who is running as a Socialist candidate. In a July 27, 2014 interview on Upfront with Mike Gousha, which airs on WISN-TV, Clarke declared: "I’ve either balanced every budget or we’ve turned back a surplus." A great talking point. But is Clarke right? To be sure, the county is required to balance the overall budget every year. So, to evaluate Clarke’s claim, we are looking at what happened specifically within the Office of the Sheriff's budget. And we’re looking at the final numbers for the year, which reflect actual spending. According to County Comptroller Scott Manske, it is expected that each department lives within the amount it is allocated. Most of the money comes from the property tax levy, though there are other sources of revenue, such as fees and grants. Clarke did not respond to our request for backup, so we turned to County Auditor Jerome Heer. He directed us to the county’s annual fiscal reports from 2003 to 2013. Clarke was appointed sheriff in 2002, but the first full year with his own budget was in 2003. All told, the sheriff's office will spend about $78 million this year, compared to $64 million in 2003. These are the budget surpluses and deficits the office has encountered under Clarke: 2003 -$2,393,755 2004 $1,510,200 2005 $1,363,322 2006 $442,806 2007 $1,296,949 2008 $52,338 2009 $1,380,056 2010 $1,420,322 2011 $237,127 2012 -$660,579 2013 -$217,000* * estimated deficit as of 8/4/14 So, the fiscal reports prepared by the Comptroller's office show Clarke's office actually had a deficit in three of the 11 years. The number for 2013 is an estimate, since the books have not been closed. Here is a look at the three exceptions: 2003: In Clarke’s first full-year budget, the office ran a $2,393,755 deficit, because revenue from fines, forfeitures, grants and reimbursements came in nearly $2.2 million less than expected. 2012: The office was hit with another deficit, totaling $660,579. A $942,666 difference between budgeted and actual revenues contributed to the deficit for that year. 2013: The auditor’s office has yet to determine final surplus and deficit figures because year-end adjustments are still "firming up," Heer said. In any case, Heer said he believes the office's final deficit will be between $162,000 and $217,000. Another factor to consider is Clarke’s temporary control over the House of Correction, inheriting a $5 million deficit on overtime pay when he took it over in January 2009. A court ruling unraveled his authority over the House of Correction in May 2013. Before Clarke took it over, the House of Correction was its own separate entity that oversaw a $45 million budget and includes about 500 employees. While Clarke cut the overtime spending by 70 percent in his first year, two budgets sustained deficits in 2012 and 2013. In an Aug. 1, 2014 appearance with host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM, Clarke rephrased his claim a bit: "I have a 10-year record where I’ve balanced every budget or some of those years I’ve turned back budget surpluses. Ten consecutive years." The numbers show it is actually eight consecutive years where the office didn’t have a deficit: Our rating Clarke said he’s balanced the budget or returned a surplus to Milwaukee County for every year since he became sheriff in 2002. But county numbers show he didn’t in 2003, 2012 and most likely won’t in 2013. We rate his claim False.	None	David A. Clarke Jr.	None	None	None	2014-08-08T05:00:00	2014-07-27	['None']

pomt-03429	Says Florida didn’t offer special incentives to Deutsche Bank, which announced it will add 300 jobs in Florida.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/jun/25/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-sidesteps-question-about-incentives/	Companies are practically tripping over each other to relocate to Florida because of its alluring beaches and business-friendly approach. At least that’s the picture Gov. Rick Scott painted during a June 24, 2013, interview on Fox News. "That’s why companies like just today, Deutsche Bank, added 300 jobs right here in Florida," Scott told host Stuart Varney on Your World with Neil Cavuto. "Last week, I was with the Paris Air Show. We have companies from France, companies from Virginia moving to Florida. So it’s clearly working in our state. And I hope you’ll buy a one-way ticket and do your show down here." Varney chuckled, then pressed for more details. "That’s an invitation I might just take up. Quickly though, Deutsche Bank, they’re bringing 300 jobs to Florida, I think they’re going to Jacksonville. Can you tell me, did you offer them something special? Did you say, I’ll build you an exit off the freeway? No property taxes for a time? Did you do anything like that at all to get them in?" Scott dismissed the notion. "No, what we do is we make sure we have an educated workforce. You know, you can’t have a lower income tax than zero. Our business taxes are going down every year, so that’s happening. I cut the, I got rid of the sales tax on machinery and equipment for our manufacturers. So every year, we’re trying to make our state a state that no one can compete with because we like jobs. We like businesses. I want to make sure we’re the No. 1 state for your family to get a job, get a great education and afford to live." We wondered whether Florida nabbed a big jobs deal without offering "something special," as Varney put it. In a statement tied to the jobs announcement, the managing director of Deutsche Bank Jacksonville hailed the "tremendous support from the state of Florida and the City of Jacksonville," which he said "played a large part in our decision to increase our footprint at this location." What kind of support? The state wouldn’t tell us, saying that information is shielded from public records laws, but a look at news clips and city council legislation filled in the blanks well enough. The short answer: money. Deutsche Bank has received a bevy of state and local tax incentives since starting a Jacksonvillle campus in 2008. That year, Deutsche Bank chose Jacksonville over Nashville, Tenn., and Charlotte, N.C., as the site for expanding two subsidiary companies, according to the Florida Times-Union. The expansion came with the promise of $4.8 million in state and local incentives for creating 1,000 jobs and doing capital investment. In the summer of 2012, state and local governments offered another $1.45 million to create 260 jobs. Fast forward to the most recent expansion, which Scott highlighted in his comments. In April, the Jacksonville City Council agreed to partner with the state to offer $2.08 million in tax incentives to Deutsche Bank in exchange for adding 300 jobs over three years. The jobs would pay about $62,000 a year on average and bring the total Jacksonville workforce to 1,600 by 2016, according to city records. Under the plan, Deutsche Bank would receive up to $1.8 million in tax refunds through the Qualified Target Industry program, with Jacksonville paying 20 percent ($360,000) and the state paying the rest. The bank could also recover $140,000 in property taxes based on a pledge to spend $10 million in renovations to its office space and buy new furniture and technology. Separately, Jacksonville’s Office of Economic Development said Scott has agreed to contribute an additional $140,000 from a pot of incentive money used largely at the governor’s discretion to close deals. Scott's state Department of Economic Opportunity would not confirm whether that is the case, saying only that Deutsche Bank had not yet received any money for the project. That’s normal, however. State incentives typically are offered on jobs that are actually created, not just promised. "It’s absolutely worth the investment," said state Rep. Daniel Davis, a Republican who leads the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce. "You have a little investment up front to invest in the long haul." A Deutsche Bank spokesman downplayed the role of incentives in the company’s decision, saying "there were numerous factors that led to this announcement of new jobs at our Jacksonville location." Our ruling We are not evaluating whether Deutsche Bank finds several things about Florida attractive for expanding its company: the weather, the lack of income tax, etc. We are looking at Scott’s response to a pointed question in his Fox News interview: Did Florida offer "something special" to Deutsche Bank in exchange for 300 jobs? Scott could have acknowledged that economic incentives were used in the deal. Instead he said they were not. That's incorrect. Records show the company is ready to receive up to $2.08 million in state and local incentives if it hits its job targets. We rate Scott's claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-13137	Says of Donald Trump, "He even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/01/hillary-clinton/trump-said-he-would-require-schools-allow-guns-cli/	Hillary Clinton says that as president, she would "tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America," while her opponent Donald Trump would "do nothing." At a rally in Cincinnati eight days before Election Day, Clinton explained how she and Trump differ on the issue of guns. The National Rifle Association endorsed Trump, and "in return" Trump has adopted various anti-gun control positions, she said. "He’s even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms," Clinton said. "How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?" We wondered if Trump really has said he’d put allowing guns in classrooms at the top of his priorities list. Throughout the election, he has advocated for getting rid of gun-free zones at schools and military bases, arguing that this could prevent mass shootings in these types of locations. And he did say once during the primary that he would get rid of these zones on his first day in office. "I will get rid of gun-free zones in schools, and — you have to — and on military bases, he said at a Jan. 7 rally in Vermont. "On my first day, it gets signed, okay, my first day. There’s no more gun-free zones." The Outdoor Channel asked Trump about this plan in an interview two weeks later. "I’m going to get rid of gun-free zones on military bases and I’m also going to do it in schools," he said, adding that he would try to "work with the states" or "perhaps override the states if I have to." The topic came up again in May, when Trump accepted the NRA’s endorsement. In the days that followed, he waffled on whether he wants schools to allow guns on campus. In his May 20 speech accepting the endorsement, he said, "We're getting rid of gun-free zones, okay. I can tell you that. We're getting rid of them." On May 21, Trump tweeted: "Crooked Hillary said that I want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!" He then made a seemingly contradictory claim on Fox News the next day, May 22: He doesn’t advocate for guns in the classroom, but sometimes teachers should have guns in the classroom. "I don’t want to have guns in classrooms," he said. "Although, in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms, frankly. Because teachers are, you know. Things that are going on in our schools are unbelievable. You look at some of our schools, unbelievable what’s going on. But I’m not advocating guns in classrooms. But remember, in some cases, and a lot of people have made this case, teachers should be able to have guns. Trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms." We looked through other transcripts and interviews Trump has given since May, but we were unable to find further clarification about his position. His campaign did not respond to our request for comment. One final note: It’s highly unlikely Trump could let people carry guns onto school property on his first day in office. Regulations against possessing or firing a gun in a school zone is written into federal law and would take congressional approval to overturn. Meanwhile, states have their own laws prohibiting guns in schools that would need to be repealed, as well. Our ruling Clinton said of Trump, "He even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms." Trump did say once during the primary that he would eliminate gun-free zones at schools on his first day in office. He later said he thought that trained teachers specifically should be able to have guns in the classroom.

The picture gained traction after it was retweeted by Roseanne Barr, the television star fired by ABC following a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett. "Out of curiosity, ABC & Disney, is this okay with you? Hypocrisy on the Left is sickening! Your (sic) pathetic!" user JamieR tweeted. Barr has since deleted her retweet. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The image is doctored. In the original photograph, taken at the Women’s March in New York on Jan. 21, 2017, Goldberg wore a shirt that read, "And you thought I was a nasty woman before? Buckle up, buttercup." Goldberg showed the original shirt she wore using video footage on The View on April 18, 2017, when the image first surfaced. "I need to clear up a lie that was posted online this morning," Goldberg said. "A photo of me at the Women’s March has been photoshopped to show me wearing an offensive shirt against you-know-who. Even though I don’t care for this man, I would never wear this shirt that’s there." That didn’t stop social media users from circulating the image again in May 2017, when comedian Kathy Griffin landed in hot water after posing for photographs with a mock severed head of Trump. Goldberg explained the photo again when it resurfaced on May 30, 2018. "Now, some bonehead photoshopped a horrific image on the shirt," Goldberg said. "And (Barr) retweeted this.

pomt-10027	"Teddy Roosevelt first called for (health care) reform nearly a century ago."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/05/barack-obama/Obama-goes-back-to-his-Republican-roots-on-health-/	Not content to emulate Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan, Republican icons for whom President Obama has expressed admiration in the past, Obama has aligned himself with a third GOP hero on the issue of health care. "The problems we face today are a direct consequence of actions that we failed to take yesterday," Obama said, opening a health care conference in the East Room of the White House on March 5. "Since Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform nearly a century ago, we have talked and we have tinkered. We have tried and fallen short, we've stalled for time, and again we have failed to act because of Washington politics or industry lobbying." We wondered whether Roosevelt really proposed reform on the scale of the near-universal health care Obama advocates, or if the new president was pushing the whole bipartisan-appeal thing a bit far. We consulted two well-regarded biographers of Roosevelt, H.W. Brands and Kathleen Dalton. Both confirmed that in 1912, when the former Republican president was running as a Progressive Party candidate for what would have been his third term (after a four-year break), the party advocated national health insurance in its platform . Health care was the 11th issue listed under "Social and Industrial Justice," after occupational safety, a child labor prohibition, a minimum wage, "one day's rest in seven" and other progressive ideas. "The supreme duty of the Nation is the conservation of human resources through an enlightened measure of social and industrial justice," the platform said. "We pledge ourselves to work unceasingly in State and Nation for ... the protection of home life against the hazards of sickness, irregular employment and old age through the adoption of a system of social insurance adapted to American use." "What this envisioned was pretty much what FDR accomplished with Social Security, but with health insurance added," said Brand, author of TR: The Last Romantic (1998). "We don’t know the specifics of the plan," said Dalton, author of Theodore Roosevelt: A Strenuous Life (2002). "The roots were probably British, though he knew about German health insurance." Dalton said unequivocally Obama was on solid ground evoking Roosevelt. Brands more or less agreed, though he cautioned that health care was "not the priority that trust-busting or conservation was" for Roosevelt. "It's worth remembering that health care was a far smaller concern in those days," Brands said. "Doctors had few medicines, and most people died or got better on their own. The biggest issues were public health — eradicating malaria, cleaning up water supplies, and so on." In Healthcare Reform in America: A Reference Handbook (2004), Jennie Kronenfeld, a sociology professor at Arizona State University, writes that "this was the first inclusion of a health insurance plank in any national platform with a major candidate, although the Socialist Party had endorsed a compulsory system as early as 1904." Roosevelt and the Progressives, nicknamed the Bull Moose Party, lost the election to Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic Party candidate. Republican William Taft finished third. Clearly, Obama is on solid ground tracing the push for national health care back to Theodore Roosevelt. We find this claim to be True.

pomt-14968	"We have the highest tax rate anywhere in the world."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/oct/20/donald-trump/trump-says-us-has-highest-tax-rate-anywhere-world/	Donald Trump promised tax cuts to a cheering crowd in Henrico County during his first presidential campaign rally in Virginia on Oct. 14. "Our taxes - we just put in a plan the other day - we’re going to reduce taxes tremendously because we have the highest tax rate anywhere in the world and our middle class is being absolutely destroyed," Trump said. "It’s being destroyed." We wondered whether the U.S. really does have the world’s highest tax rate. We asked Trump’s campaign for clarification and evidence but didn’t hear back. So we’ll evaluate Trump’s claim within the context of which he was speaking - of tax burdens affecting most people. That leads us to income taxes. Income tax rates The top income tax rate in the United States is 39.6 percent. That ranked 33rd highest on a list of the top rates in 116 nations compiled this year by KPMG, an international tax advisory corporation. Another survey - by tradingeconomics.com, a website that compiles economic data - ranks the U.S. top rate 38th highest among 155 nations and territories. Chad and Ivory Coast had the highest top tax rates, at 60 percent. The bottom income tax rate in the U.S. is 10 percent. Forty-one countries have higher bottom rates, according to data on 157 nations and territories compiled by Ernst & Young, an international accounting corporation. There’s no precise way to compare middle income tax rates, because most nations don’t have systems as complicated as the seven-bracket tax scale used by the U.S. Keep in mind that all of these figures concern statutory tax rates. Effective tax rates - the percentage actually paid on earned income after deductions - are lower. On average, Americans pay an effective income tax rate of 9.5 percent, according to research by the Tax Policy Center in Washington. We were unable to find a chart of the effective rates in other nations, which have their own rules for deductions and allowances. Tax experts told us that focusing on tax rates - either statutory or effective - is not a meaningful way to compare the tax burdens of nations. The reason is that different countries place different emphasis on certain levies. For example, some nations with high income tax rates may have low payroll taxes and vice versa. Other indicators The experts suggested two different yardsticks for comparing tax burdens in different countries. One was tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product. The other was tax revenue per capita. Both measures are calculated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 advanced industrialized nations. PolitiFact National has found that for both measurements, many of the United States’ industrialized peers had higher levels of taxation in 2013, the most recent year for which data are available. Taxes accounted for about 25 percent of the United States’ GDP -- placing the U.S. 27th out of 30 countries studied. The five with the highest percentages were Denmark, France, Belgium, Finland and Sweden, each of them with taxation accounting for more than 42 percent of gross domestic product. Only South Korea, Chile and Mexico had lower levels of taxation per GDP than the United States. When looking at tax revenue per capita, the United States ranks somewhat higher but still far from the top. Taxes per capita in the United States totaled $13,482, according to the OECD data. That ranked 16th out of 29 countries for which data were available for 2013. The five with the highest per-capita amounts were Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, with amounts ranging from $23,000 to $48,000. Eleven countries had per-capita amounts less than $10,000, including Hungary, Chile and Turkey, the bottom three on the list. While it probably makes the most sense to compare the United States with other advanced, industrialized nations, there is one additional data source that includes the full roster of countries. In the World Bank’s comparison of 115 countries for 2012, the U.S. ranked 12th from the bottom in taxation as a percentage of GDP. Among the countries with lower percentages were two OECD members (Japan and Spain), some wealthy oil-producing nations (Oman and Kuwait), and a handful of very poor countries (including Afghanistan and the Central African Republic). A final note: We should note that a more specific statement by Trump might have been largely accurate. PolitiFact has given a Mostly True rating to the claim that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in world, although widespread deductions and exclusions tend to lower the effective corporate rate below the comparative level for some other countries. But Trump didn’t mention corporations when he made his comment. He was lamenting economic problems facing the middle class. Our ruling Trump, while lamenting the condition of the middle class, said the U.S. has "the highest tax rate anywhere in the world." All sets of data we examined for individual and family taxes prove him wrong. Statutory income tax rates in the U.S. fall around the end of the upper quarter of nations. More exhaustive measures - which compute overall tax burden per person and as a percentage of GDP - show the U.S. either is in the middle of the pack or on the lighter end of taxation compared with other advanced industrialized nations.

pomt-02405	About half the people who would qualify for Medicaid expansion in Florida "can buy a health care plan for $30 a month" on the federal health care exchange.	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/mar/07/will-weatherford/will-weatherford-says-about-half-people-eligible-m/	Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford has been a vocal opponent of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. He’s no fan of the law’s proposed Medicaid expansion, especially. During an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board on Feb. 27, Weatherford played down the need for Medicaid expansion, which the Legislature rejected last year. He said many Floridians who might have enrolled under an expanded Medicaid system can now buy affordable private insurance from the federal website HealthCare.gov. "If you live above the 100 percent of the poverty rate today, which is about 400,000 of the 800,000 who would qualify for Medicaid expansion, half of the people who qualify for Medicaid expansion today can buy a health care plan for $30 a month on the exchange," he said. Weatherford added that he thought people in that income range "should be able to afford $30 a month and have some skin in the game." We wondered if half of the people who would have been eligible under a potential Medicaid expansion could get a private insurance plan for $30 a month. We ran the numbers and found that Weatherford had a point that many people who would have been eligible for Medicaid can buy plans from healthcare.gov for $30 a month. But it’s not half of them, it’s a good bit less. Showing you why is going to involve a deep dive into how the health care law works. Medicaid math The federal government offered to pay all the costs initially for states to expand Medicaid, a health insurance program for the poor, and 90 percent in later years. But Florida opted not to expand coverage. Just how many people would have been covered under the potential Florida expansion is hard to gauge. Estimates put it at about 1.3 million. The government uses the federal poverty level as the measure to determine a person’s eligibility to receive assistance for government programs such as Medicaid and, in the case of the Affordable Care Act, eligibility for insurance subsidies. For 2014, the poverty level is set at $11,670 for a single person and $23,850 for a family of four. Florida’s Medicaid program has more than 3 million enrollees, but many residents don’t qualify under the program’s guidelines. Some people, like young adults and parents, have to be at 22 percent of the Federal Poverty Level or below to qualify, but most single adults without children don’t qualify for Medicaid at all. The federal law intended to allow all poor adults into the program, but Florida opted not to expand the program. Who gets tax credits? The federal health care law intended for the very poor to get Medicaid and for low-wage workers to get tax credits to buy private insurance. The law splits those groups up by income, using definitions based on the federal poverty level. People who make 138 percent of the poverty level or lower would be eligible for Medicaid. People who make between 138 percent and 400 percent of the poverty level would get subsidies to buy private insurance on sites like HealthCare.gov. It doesn’t work like that in Florida, though, because the state chose not to expand Medicaid. In states that don’t expand Medicaid, the law also allows people making between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level to shop for private insurance with subsidies. (Why that’s the case is another complicated story, which we will address in a separate report.) Weatherford is right that those people can buy insurance on the exchange. So how much will it cost them? The president’s health care law keeps premium costs low for households making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level by providing tax credits to purchase insurance. The size of the tax credit is adjusted based on the cost of the second-least expensive silver option available in the marketplace. (Plans can be bronze, silver, gold or platinum, with the most generous -- and expensive -- plans being platinum.) Break out your calculators: The second-cheapest silver plan can only cost 2 percent of an individual’s annual income for households making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. For a person making $16,104, that’s an annual premium of $322, or $26 a month. By plugging demographic and salary information into HealthCare.gov, we can see how this rule bears out. For example, a 35-year-old single man living in Pinellas County and making $16,104 a year (138 percent of the federal poverty level) is "eligible for a premium tax credit" of up to $198 a month, according to HealthCare.gov. That individual could find a Bronze level plan from Humana for $0 a month (yes, zero dollars), albeit with a $6,300 deductible. He could also buy six other plans from various providers for $30 a month or less. What about a family of four (two adults and two children under 18) living in Miami-Dade County making exactly 100 percent the federal poverty level, or $23,850 a year? The children may be eligible for Medicaid through the Children’s Health Insurance Program, HealthCare.gov says. The parents would have to buy insurance on the federal marketplace, but they would be eligible for a tax credit of up to $712 a month. With the tax credit, there are several Bronze options that would cost nothing, but the deductible would be capped at $12,600 a year. There are eight other options for less than $30 a month. Those individuals would also be eligible for co-payment assistance, which is available to individuals and families making up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level. It’s not as good of a deal for those individuals as Medicaid would have been, which basically costs nothing for recipients, but Weatherford is right they could find coverage for pretty cheap. But what if you’re a family of four making $12,599 a year, just one dollar less than the federal poverty level? The parents would no longer be eligible for any financial assistance toward their premiums. The same plans that would cost nothing to the family making $12,600, now cost $555 a month or more. Rachel Garfield, a senior researcher for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care research group, said those individuals making less than 100 percent the federal poverty level would likely be stuck in a situation where they couldn’t afford coverage and would remain uninsured. The law says they cannot be penalized for not having insurance, because affordable coverage is not available to them. Other estimates So Weatherford is correct that some people can buy insurance for cheap on the federal marketplace. But is it half of the people who would have been covered by a Medicaid expansion? Greg Mellowe, director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, said it appeared the speaker had gotten confused about his numbers. Mellowe cited a Kaiser Family Foundation study that said there are about 1.3 million uninsured Floridians making 138 percent of the federal poverty level or less. Of those people, about one-third earn enough to buy cheap coverage on the marketplace. In another study released in August 2012, the Urban Institute also found almost 1.3 million people would be eligible in an expansion. Of those, 300,000 had income between 100 and 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about 23 percent, and would be eligible to buy in the marketplace. Weatherford’s office told us his numbers were based on an estimate from staff analysts projecting that about 937,000 Floridians would be eligible under an expansion. Of those, about 314,000 were between 100 and 138 percent, meaning they now can buy insurance on the federal exchange. That’s about 30 percent, though, not half. Spokesman Ryan Duffy said projections showed 402,000 Floridians between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level were expected to enroll over 10 years based on population and economic trends, and that’s the figure to which Weatherford was referring. The speaker said "today," though, not 10 years from now. Our ruling Weatherford said that about half of Florida residents who would qualify for a Medicaid expansion "can buy a health care plan for $30 a month on the exchange." Thanks to an unintended quirk of the law, there are somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000 people who can buy cheap coverage on the federal marketplace without the Medicaid expansion. Using premium tax credits, many could find insurance premiums below $30 a month. But that’s not half of the individuals who would have qualified for the Medicaid expansion. It’s actually a much lower number, closer to 25 to 33 percent, depending on the study. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Will Weatherford	None	None	None	2014-03-07T16:29:29	2014-02-27	['None']

pomt-10721	"I believe in tax cuts. I believe in being a supply-sider. I cut the income tax I think it was 24 percent. We got 42 percent more revenues."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/21/rudy-giuliani/update-giuliani-pushed-city-income-tax-cut/	Updated: Rudy Giuliani is deft at cherry-picking statistics to make his case and he's not one to share credit, either. But he does have a record of performance that can be examined. The claim made in Dearborn is an oft-analyzed, widely debated example. In our original posting on this issue, which we declared "Barely True," we focused on his use of "I," which is indeed technically untrue. It takes the mayor, the city council and the state legislature to cut that income tax. But after hearing an appeal from the Giuliani people, we think he deserves the benefit of the doubt on this. The tax cut he refers to clearly was a Giuliani initiative, and in the same way that we refer to "Reagan tax cuts" that were studied, modified and approved by Congress, we have concluded that Giuliani's initiative on this is clear enough to be lenient in judging the "I" claim. We also erroneously stated that this is a state income tax, and while it must be approved by the state, it is a separate city income tax. And 24 percent? Giuliani likes to use percentages of percentages. It doesn't sound like much to say the top-bracket tax rate fell from 4.46 percent to 3.54 percent during his tenure. But okay, the math works. Since personal incomes were also rising, it's not necessarily the case that New Yorkers saw a reduction in their total tax bills. But the rate went down 24 percent. We want to note that the same report reflecting the 24 percent reduction shows that the rate was even lower, 3.4 percent, in 1989, the end of the Ed Koch administration. (It was raised again during the David Dinkins administration.) Okay, so we're getting addicted to our calculator. Which brings us to that "42 percent more revenues." The 42 percent figure for revenue growth, just to complete the documentation, is a comparison of revenues from the city income tax from Giuliani's first full fiscal year, 1995, to his last, 2001. That's a very reasonable way of counting. But to link the revenue growth to the tax cut brings us into the world of supply-side economics. With tax-cut advocate Steve Forbes, of the magazine family, as an economic adviser, Giuliani keeps claiming that "his" tax cuts created the growth. "When you reduce the burden of government," Giuliani said in Des Moines on June 20, 2007, "what happened is the unemployment rate was cut in half, the number of jobs grew ... the number of people that were working went up dramatically, and new businesses came back to the city." So let's just pause on supply-side economics, the popular version of which is that reducing the tax rate actually increases the tax revenue by giving people more incentive to produce income. But how much is tax-cut incentive, how much is sheer greed, and how much is the rising tide of a booming economy? Who knows? One sign that something else is involved is that during the years in question the revenue increase ranged from 41.4 percent in Queens to 60 percent in Brooklyn. We have changed our ruling since this item first published in November 2007. We understated Giuliani's role in the city income tax cut, and we simply misstated the origin of the tax that was in question. Upon further review, in light of clarifying information provided by the Giuliani campaign, we are giving Giuliani a Mostly True ruling.

pomt-03634	"If you are a federally licensed gun dealer and your license is revoked because you've engaged in misconduct ... your entire inventory under prevailing law is deemed your personal collection. You then can sell it free from any background checks."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/may/04/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-gun-dealers-whose-lice/	As the nation debates proposed new gun restrictions after the Newtown, Conn., elementary school massacre, one issue is whether current law adequately regulates firearms dealers. During a recent appearance on WJAR-TV's "10 News Conference," U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, spoke on the issue. Cicilline this year sponsored a bill, which has more than 60 co-sponsors, that would close what supporters refer to as the "fire sale loophole." The bill is still pending in a Congressional committee and it is unclear when, or if, it will be taken up. "If you are a federally-licensed gun dealer and your license is revoked because you've engaged in misconduct or because you've sold guns to people who shouldn't have them (if) your license is revoked, your entire inventory under prevailing law is deemed your personal collection," Cicilline said. "You then can sell it free from any background checks. So we reward bad behavior." When we contacted Cicilline’s office to check his claim, spokesman Richard Luchette referred us to the federal firearms law. We found Section 923 of Title 18, Chapter 44, which includes some of the regulations on federally-licensed firearms dealers. But the law doesn’t specifically address what gun dealers who lose their federal licenses can do with the firearms in their inventory. That absence, according to Cicilline and other gun-control supporters, is a serious loophole, allowing dealers to transfer their inventory into a personal collection and then sell those firearms -- without requiring buyers to submit to a background check. Luchette also sent us links to a couple of examples provided by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, headed by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. (Cicilline was among 15 mayors who in 2006 -- he was Providence mayor at the time -- attended the first summit, hosted by Bloomberg, that helped to launch the group.) One example the group cited dated to 2006 and involved a Maryland gun dealer who had lost his license for multiple violations in which firearms in his sales inventory were unaccounted for. After the dealer filed a federal lawsuit against the director of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a legal opinion that said "‘when a dealer loses his license he can dispose of his inventory by selling those firearms without being deemed to have engaged in the business in violation of" a federal law. The gun dealer would violate the law only "if he chooses to purchase and resell firearms," the opinion stated The Maryland dealer was found to be within his rights to transfer some 700 guns into his personal inventory and continue to sell them, despite having a record of previous violations in which guns in his inventory were unaccounted for, so long as he did not buy any additional weapons, according to an article in the Baltimore Sun. The other example cited by the mayors’ organization was an Ohio firearm dealer allowed to sell what had been remaining in his inventory after his federal license had been revoked. Seeking an independent point of view, we contacted the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco, the federal agency that handles federal licensing of firearms dealers. An ATF spokeswoman, Debora Seifert, said that once someone is no longer a federally licensed firearms dealer, either voluntarily or because his license is revoked for some misconduct, then "they are citizens, so they have the ability to convert the firearms from their [sales inventory] into their own personal inventory." Therefore, she said, dealers who are no longer federally licensed do not come under the ATF’s purview. Because they are no longer subject to the federal jurisdiction of ATF, they can conceivably sell those firearms. Those sale are free from federal requirements for background checks of buyers. Siefert said some states may have their own laws that curtail firearms sales under those circumstances. Rhode Island is one of those states. Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin, said that "Rhode Island is not a ‘loophole’ state." The state’s law "requires a background check and waiting period before any firearm is transferred to any purchaser so it doesn’t matter if the seller has [a federal firearms license] or not," she said by e-mail. Our ruling Cicilline said that "if you are a federally-licensed gun dealer and your license is revoked because you've engaged in misconduct or because you've sold guns to people who shouldn't have them (if) your license is revoked, your entire inventory under prevailing law is deemed your personal collection …You then can sell it free from any background checks. So we reward bad behavior." An ATF spokeswoman confirmed that is true. And examples of ex-dealers selling their inventories have occurred and been documented. We rate the claim True.

pomt-07042	Says Wisconsin’s 2011-13 state budget contains "no fee increases"	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/01/jeff-fitzgerald/no-fee-increases-wisconsins-2011-13-state-budget-w/	Long before Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker signed the 2011-2013 state budget on June 26, 2011, he and fellow Republicans in the Legislature boasted that it solves a $3 billion shortfall without raising taxes or fees. On the tax claim, PolitiFact Wisconsin’s Walk-O-Meter gave the governor a Promise Broken rating after he included tax hikes in his own budget proposal. However, the final budget, which raises three taxes, contains a larger amount of tax cuts, so the net result is an overall tax reduction of more than $23 million, according to the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. That’s the tax picture. But what does the budget do with fees? Taxpayers pay plenty of those, too. After the budget was approved by the Assembly on June 13, 2011, Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald said: "To pass a budget like this, with no tax increases and no fee increases, and put the state in the right direction, is something we feel good about." "No fee increases" is the key phrase here -- and the Horicon Republican isn’t alone in uttering it. Similar claims have been made by other GOP lawmakers, including Rep. Robin Vos of Rochester and Sen. Frank Lasee of DePere, both of whom said the budget passed "without raising taxes or fees"; Rep. Samantha Kerkman of Powers Lake, who touted "no increases in state taxes or fees"; and Rep. Kevin Petersen of Waupaca, who said that compared to prior budgets, "gone are … tax and fee increases". When we asked Fitzgerald for evidence to back his "no fee increases" claim, we noted that the fiscal bureau -- which both political parties have long cited as a neutral scorekeeper on budget matters -- had determined the budget would raise nine fees over two years by $133 million and reduce eight other fees by $22 million. That’s a net increase in fees of $111 million. Here are some of the major fee increases, as laid out by the fiscal bureau, as well as comments from Fitzgerald spokesman John Jagler. College tuition: Tuition at University of Wisconsin System colleges would rise 5.5 percent in each year of the two-year budget cycle, raising $107 million. Jagler argued that the tuition hikes normally are not identified as fee increases in the state budget and that they are labeled as such this year only because the budget gives more autonomy to the UW System. That results in a "technical change" in how the figures are reported, he said in the email. The fiscal bureau, however, says it has tallied tuition increases as fees in the past. As we’ll see, even if we set aside tuition hikes, there are plenty of other fee increases to consider. Lender fees: Licensed lenders would have to pay a new $5,000 annual fee in order to make motor vehicle title loans, raising $500,000 over two years. New fees would also be imposed on beer wholesalers. Said Jagler: "A new fee isn’t a fee increase." That’s a novel argument, but one that clearly goes against the GOP message -- that the budget does not rely on higher fees to be balanced. New fees obviously increase the amount of revenue the state takes in. Driver’s license tests: Currently, drivers pay $15 to take a test for a regular automobile license, but if they fail, they can take two more tests without paying another fee. Under the new budget, drivers would have to pay another $15 for each additional test. That would raise $634,600 over two years. Unlike the new lender fee, Jagler didn’t label the driving test fee as new. He acknowledged that it’s a fee drivers wanting to take additional tests would have to pay. Background checks: Non-profit organizations would have to pay $7 -- up from $2 -- for every criminal record search they request on individuals, a change projected to raise $2.5 million. The fee for other entities would drop to $7 from $13, resulting in a loss of $1.92 million. That means the state will net an additional $580,000 in fees. Said Jagler: "A fee that goes down or stays the same is not an increase." OK, but fees would rise for non-profits and that would help drive an overall increase in revenue of $580,000. You get the picture. And it’s not what you might have imagined it would be if you heard the phrase "no fee increases." To sum up: Fitzgerald said the new state budget contains "no fee increases." The non-partisan state fiscal bureau, however, lists nine fee increases (along with eight fee reductions). The net result is an increase in fees of $111 million. It’s ridiculous to claim there are no fee increases when some fees are being created, others are being raised and the result is more cash in the kitty. We rate his claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-09238	The Treaty of Tripoli signed by President John Adams was "his outreach to Muslims."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/11/keith-olbermann/countdown-host-says-founding-father-reached-out-mu/	On Countdown With Keith Olbermann, Monday, April 19, 2010, Olbermann took on former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin for complaining about President Barack Obama's outreach to Muslims. And he did it by citing the Founding Fathers. He noted a remark from Palin to a Women of Joy conference in Louisville, Ky.: "Hearing any leader declare that America isn't a Christian nation . . . It's mind-boggling to see some of our nation's actions recently." Olbermann said that wouldn't be mind-boggling to the founders. "President John Adams, of course, signed the Treaty of Tripoli, his outreach to Muslims," Olbermann said. "Quote, 'The government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion.' That was ratified by the United States Senate without debate unanimously in 1797." We wondered if Olbermann was correct to characterize the treaty as an outreach to Muslims. We found that while that was a small element of the treaty, he ignored the overriding purpose of the treaty: to protect American ships from pirates. A little history: When the American colonies were under British rule, the Royal Navy protected American commercial shipping in the Mediterranean Sea from privateers financed by the North African Muslim states on the Barbary Coast who were terrorizing commercial shipping in the region. During the Revolutionary War, an alliance with France allowed for continued protection. Once America gained its independence from Britain, though, it was on its own against the dreaded Barbary pirates from Morocco, Tunis, Algiers and Tripoli. In 1785, two years after the signing of the Articles of Confederation, two American ships were captured and held for ransom. Over the years, the situation worsened, with more American ships being captured and sailors being sold into slavery. Eventually, the United States began negotiating treaties with the Barbary States. "The treaty with Tripoli, and those with the other Barbary Powers, were for the purpose of making the Mediterranean safe for American ships," Ian W. Toll, author of the book Six Frigates, told PolitiFact. Still, Olbermann is right that there was a mention of the Muslim religion in the treaty. Here's the full text of Article 11: "As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen [Muslims], -- and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan [Muslim] nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries." Alana Russo, a spokeswoman for Olbermann, cited that passage to explain the talk show host's claim. "This was indisputably outreach not just to Tripoli, but a declaration of intentions regarding "any Mahometan [Muslim] nation," she said in an e-mail interview. But others say that language indicates the United States of America was merely neutral on religion in a treaty that was all about protecting U.S. ships. Article 11 "makes clear that this was a commercial treaty and that religion played no part," said Frank Lambert, author of The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America, a book that argues the Founding Fathers were more concerned with religious freedom than any one religion being the best. "I don't know what Olbermann meant by 'outreach to Muslims,' but Adams signed the treaty to secure American commercial rights in the Mediterranean." So why did the Founders include Article 11 in the first place? "The Barbary Powers often declared that they were 'at war with all Christian nations' unless and until a treaty was signed," said Toll. "In diplomatic communications and in some cases in the treaties themselves, the Americans would say they had nothing against Muslims, or even (in one celebrated and controversial instance) that the U.S.A. was not a Christian nation, and I have no reason to say that those sentiments were not genuine. But to the extent that Adams or the other early presidents reached out to Muslims, it was always for the same reason -- to obtain agreements shielding American ships from attacks in the Mediterranean." By characterizing the treaty as an "outreach to Muslims", Olbermann exaggerates the importance of Article 11 and implies that the central focus of the treaty was to engage with Muslims. In fact, President John Adams wanted to secure commercial shipping rights, and the countries he wanted to negotiate with happened to be Muslim, and happened to justify piracy by declaring war on Christian nations. Adams addressed that declaration by claiming that the United States was not Christian, and was not at war with Muslims. There is some truth in Olbermann's claim in that the clause essentially "reaches out" to Muslims, but he exaggerates its importance. So we find his claim Half True.

pomt-06030	"My opponent on day one of this campaign attacked me on Medicare and Medicare Advantage and that claim was found to be False."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/14/suzanne-bonamici/did-cornilles-go-after-bonamici-medicare-day-one/	Candidates like to say that their opponent is trying to destroy Medicare, the health care program best known for servicing seniors. Candidates also like to claim that their opponent has attacked them unfairly. Suzanne Bonamici, a Democrat, has expressed outrage that Rob Cornilles, the Republican, has picked up a favorite talking point of Republicans across the country: That Democrats favored a $500 billion cut to Medicare by supporting President Obama’s Affordable Care Act. "My opponent on day one of this campaign attacked me on Medicare and Medicare Advantage and that claim was found to be False," she said in last week’s televised debate for the Jan. 31 1st Congressional District special election. Cornilles did make this claim against her in his Nov. 8 speech, the day after winning the special primary election: "Sen. Bonamici says she supports the $500 billion cut to Medicare passed last year." PolitiFact Oregon found the statement False, because the $500 billion is a reduction in future spending. In other words, those dollars aren’t taken out of the current budget, they are not actual cuts and the bill does not actually eliminate any current benefits. Democrats like to attack Republicans on Medicare as well and scare seniors, so they’re not angels either. But in this instance, Bonamici is correct. Cornilles made the claim the day after he won the special primary election and PolitiFact Oregon ruled the statement False. We rule her statement True.

pomt-07331	Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker "literally invented a $3.6 billion deficit."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/12/gwen-moore/us-rep-gwen-moore-says-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-/	The Wisconsin Democratic Party billed its Founders Day Gala as an event to "focus on resistance to Scott Walker's divisive power grab." Among the speakers who dressed down Wisconsin’s Republican governor at the April 30, 2011 event was U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wisconsin. Moore began her remarks by referring to the keynote speaker, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, and his new memoir, A Reason to Believe. "I was thinking: How in the world can you believe, what reason would you have to believe in anything, when you had just elected a governor who says that Wisconsin was open for business and therefore closed to every single human being in the state," Moore said to applause. Moore said Walker was cutting funding for schools, Medicaid, birth control and public transportation, but providing "$200 million worth of tax breaks -- and (he) just literally invented a $3.6 billion budget deficit." Wait a minute. "Literally invented"? We’ve been down this road a couple of times before. In November 2010, as his time as governor was winding down, Democrat Jim Doyle said the deficit was as low as $1.5 billion. We rated that statement False, given that Doyle’s top administrator almost immediately portrayed the figure as $2.2 billion and experts outside of government put it at about $3 billion. In February 2011, about six weeks after Walker took office, state Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) received a False for his claim about the shortfall. Pocan said Walker manufactured a fiscal crisis and that his $3.6 billion estimate was a "bogus figure." At that time, we found Doyle had left a deficit of more than $3 billion and that Walker followed the past Madison practices in making his estimate. We asked Moore what proof she had that Walker had invented a $3.6 billion deficit. We’ll address point by point the response we received from Moore’s spokesman, David Frey: Point 1: Moore thinks Walker "made the state’s fiscal situation worse" and the fiscal bureau "spells out the costs of his tax cuts." Frey noted the bureau said Walker’s 2011-2013 budget includes $83 million in tax cuts. But that figure doesn’t address the size of the budget deficit, which existed before Walker proposed his budget in March 2011. And it ignores the fact that the budget also includes $49 million in tax increases. Frey also noted $117 million less the state will take in because of other Walker tax changes, but that figure also does not go to the size of the deficit, either. Point 2: Moore thinks that when compared to other states, Wisconsin’s budget situation "is much more manageable." That’s largely opinion and it doesn’t specify the size of Wisconsin’s deficit. Point 3: Moore thinks Walker "is making all the wrong choices on this matter." Another opinion that doesn’t get to the deficit question. Point 4: Walker’s changes to state laws to reduce the collective bargaining powers of public employees "were more about ideology than about budget issues." Again, that’s an opinion -- one widely shared by Walker critics. But, like the others, that’s not on point in terms of the size of the budget deficit. (On May 11, 2011, a new projection showed the state would take in about $200 million a year more than previously estimated over three years. It is unclear how Walker and the Legislature will adjust the budget proposal. But this, too, does not go to Moore’s claim, which was made before the new projection was released.) In sum, Moore doesn’t provide any evidence to back her claim -- which means we find ourselves at a familiar destination. Moore said Walker "literally invented" a $3.6 billion state budget deficit. We’ve previously established that the figure is a reasonable estimate. Moore offers no new evidence to the contrary. We rate her claim False.

pomt-09590	"The Texas Department of Transportation... misplaced a billion dollars."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/22/debra-medina/medina-said-txdot-lost-1-billion/	The Texas Department of Transportation has become an easy target this campaign season, and Debra Medina, the Wharton businesswoman vying to knock Gov. Rick Perry from his seat, took a swing at the agency during the Jan. 14 GOP gubernatorial debate. "We've got to look at transparency, efficiency and accountability in all areas of state government," she said. "We have seen sloth, if you will, sloppy management in the Texas Youth Commission, in criminal justice, in the Texas Department of Transportation, where they misplaced a billion dollars." A billion dollars, MIA? Chris Lippincott, TxDOT director of media relations, said: "That's not correct." In October 2007, TxDOT officials accidentally counted $1.1 billion in bonds revenue twice, he said — a mistake that led the agency to commit an extra billion to road projects. Chief Financial Officer James Bass realized the agency had erred by a billion dollars when it approved $4.2 billion for construction in fiscal 2008. Because of the mistake, the department announced huge cuts in spending that froze some road projects that were ready to go. "There was an accounting error," Lippincott said. "A miscalculation." Actually, there were two accounting errors, according to an August 2008 state audit of the agency. In adding up what was available for projects, department forecasters added $581 million of bond money that was already in a $3.1 billion total. Then, they lumped in another $488 million from the Texas Mobility Fund, money that was actually already tabbed to pay for past projects. Taken together, that was $1.069 billion that at least some people in the agency counted twice. TxDOT didn't announce its gaffe until a February 2008 legislative hearing, where lawmakers were skeptical that it was just a number-crunching error and not a tactical move to create a financial crisis and thus pressure legislators to ease the limits on private toll road contracts. The audit concluded that "ineffective communication, a complex reporting structure, and misunderstanding of reported data led the Department of Transportation to overschedule $1.1 billion in planned contract awards for fiscal year 2008." No one has shown that any money was misplaced, as Medina claimed. The money never existed in the first place. But she didn't miss the point. The transportation behemoth did make a billion-dollar mistake, a misstep that hobbled crucial road projects. We rate Medina's claim Mostly True.

pomt-14353	Says Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg agreed to use a technicality to give a convicted sex offender a new hearing because "he didn’t understand the charge."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/23/wisconsin-alliance-reform/groups-tv-ad-criticizing-joanne-kloppenburg-leaves/	Conservatives often say liberal judges are soft on crime. Such an attack is embedded in a claim made about Wisconsin Court of Appeals Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg, who is running against Justice Rebecca Bradley in the April 5, 2016 state Supreme Court election. The claim comes in a TV ad released March 8, 2016 by the Wisconsin Alliance for Reform, a group that surfaced in late 2015 with an ad campaign against Democrat Russ Feingold, who is trying to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson. The alliance has since been producing ads that back Bradley, who was appointed to the high court by Republican Gov. Scott Walker in October 2015. The ad begins with a reference to liberal judges and includes images on the screen of Daniel R. Fierro, a convicted sex offender, and a teen girl. "We’ve heard it before. Liberal judges letting criminals off on technicalities. Judges like JoAnne Kloppenburg," the narrator says. "This man (Fierro) had a long criminal history, including beating his wife in front of their 2-year-old daughter. Then, after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting a 15-year-old child, he got 15 years. Incredibly, he appealed, saying he didn’t understand the charge. And JoAnne Kloppenburg? She agreed to give him a new hearing. Tell Judge Kloppenburg courts should protect children, not criminals." So, did Kloppenburg agree to use a technicality to give a convicted sex offender a new hearing because "he didn’t understand the charge"? The case As the ad indicates, Fierro pleaded guilty to sexual assault and was convicted, but then filed an appeal over his plea. The appeal was heard by Kloppenburg and the two other judges on the Madison-based appeals court panel, Paul Lundsten and Paul Higginbotham. Here is a summary of the Fierro case, based on a decision issued in March 2015 by the three judges: Fierro was charged with having sexual intercourse in June 2012 with a 15-year-old girl in Dane County. In February 2013, he pleaded guilty to felony second-degree sexual assault of a child. Two months later, Circuit Court Judge William Hanrahan sentenced Fierro to 10 years in prison and five years of extended supervision. (A note: Technically that was a 15-year sentence -- 10 years in custody, plus five years of supervision after release from prison. But the ad, by saying "he got 15 years," suggests the sentence was 15 years behind bars.) Six days after sentencing, Fierro filed a motion stating he wanted to withdraw his plea, although his formal request wasn’t made until more than a year later, in May 2014. In essence, Fierro was arguing that he didn’t understand that he was pleading guilty to the crime of sexual intercourse with a minor. Hanrahan heard Fierro’s request. But, without holding an evidentiary hearing, he denied it, saying Fierro "did fully understand the nature of the crime against him." Fierro appealed. The appeals judges unanimously agreed Fierro should be given an evidentiary hearing in order to try to prove that he did not understand the charge he pled to. Such a hearing allows lawyers for both sides to present evidence on a factual question before the court. Here was the basis of the decision by Kloppenburg and the two other judges: At the plea hearing, Hanrahan asked Fierro if he had read over the plea documents and whether his lawyer explained the documents to him. Fierro said yes. But the documents referred to the wrong charge -- sexual contact, rather than sexual intercourse, even though intercourse was what was alleged in the criminal complaint. Hanrahan also did not himself explain the elements of the intercourse charge to Fierro. In other words, it was not clear whether Fierro understood he was pleading guilty to the crime of intercourse with a child. The appeals judges said there were several reasons to question whether Fierro did not understand the elements of the charge of sexual intercourse. "And, we stress that nothing in this opinion should be read as suggesting that Fierro’s asserted failure to understand should be believed or not believed," the opinion said. That’s the purpose of holding a hearing, the court wrote -- evidence could be presented by the prosecution and the defense as to whether Fierro understood the elements of the crime of sexual intercourse. Hanrahan ultimately held that evidentiary hearing three months later, in June 2015. He denied Fierro’s request to withdraw his guilty plea, concluding that Fierro did understand the charge he pled to, court records show. Throughout the process, Fierro’s conviction remained in place and he remained in prison. As for the idea that Fierro was given a hearing based on a technicality, it’s hard to imagine anything more fundamental in a plea bargain than the defendant understanding the charge he was pleading guilty to. A footnote: The original version of the ad carried a message on the screen saying "conviction overturned." That was removed after Kloppenburg’s campaign sent a cease-and-desist letter, citing the words on the screen, to television stations that were running the ad. Our rating The Wisconsin Alliance for Reform says Kloppenburg agreed to use a technicality to give a convicted sex offender a new hearing because "he didn’t understand the charge." Kloppenburg agreed with two other appeals court judges in ordering that the sex offender get a hearing. They did not rule, however, that the offender didn’t understand the charge he had pleaded guilty to. Rather, they ruled there should be hearing on the fundamental question of whether he did understand what he had pled to. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-14053	"I can tell you that the enhanced interrogation techniques that have since been banned by this administration — specifically waterboarding — work."	false	/florida/statements/2016/may/24/todd-wilcox/waterboarding-works-us-senate-candidate-todd-wilco/	U.S. Senate candidate Todd Wilcox said the controversial interrogation practice of waterboarding isn’t torture but an effective tool in the global war on terror. It gets results, he said. In an interview published in the Miami Herald on May 20, Wilcox blamed the White House for limiting the country’s ability to gain intelligence from alleged terrorists. "I can tell you that the enhanced interrogation techniques that have since been banned by this administration — specifically waterboarding — work," said Wilcox, who is vying for the Republican nomination to replace Sen. Marco Rubio. "They work on the terrorists, and there's a proven history of that." Wilcox didn’t consider the practice to be torture, and also said while he didn’t advocate overusing waterboarding, it’s an option that should be available for interrogators. We wanted to know if waterboarding — strapping a prisoner to a board or table and then pouring water over a cloth covering their mouth and nose to simulate drowning — was a proven method of questioning someone. Torture vs. interrogation Waterboarding was one of the "enhanced interrogation techniques" used on terrorism suspects by American interrogators in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks. President Barack Obama banned the practice by executive order in 2009. It’s recently been revived in politics after GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump advocated for waterboarding and "a hell of a lot worse" should he be elected. Wilcox, an Orlando defense contractor, noted to PolitiFact Florida through his spokeswoman that some high-ranking officials including former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and former CIA Director Leon Panetta credited waterboarding for producing valuable intelligence. The former Green Beret and CIA officer told the Herald that he has "access to a lot of information that the rest of the public may not know" from which to draw his conclusion. But PolitiFact can’t make a judgment based on information that's classified or otherwise not readily available to the public, so we don't consider that assertion as proof. Wilcox didn’t elaborate further on his assertion there was evidence waterboarding worked. But those declarations are lacking real evidence, either historically or in the recent past, experts told us. Waterboarding has long been considered a poor way to extract information, Reed College political science professor Darius Rejali said. Only a handful of case studies about waterboarding’s effects are available. Those examples involved Nazi Germany’s Gestapo in Norway and France; the French in Vietnam and Algeria; and the United States in the Philippines at the turn of the last century. In each case, the benefits of waterboarding were suspect at best, Rejali said. To start, interrogators aren’t in a position to know whether a prisoner is divulging anything factual, Rejali said. They think they have the training and can tell what’s the truth, but they can’t. The prisoner, meanwhile, is likely willing to say anything to make the interrogation stop. One of the most prominent examples of waterboarding’s alleged success is that of Abu Zubaydah, whom the Bush administration had initially considered al-Qaida's chief of operations. Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times, among being subjected to other techniques, and confessed to planned attacks on shopping malls, nuclear power plants and the Brooklyn Bridge. But Zubaydah was mentally ill and had actually been in charge of scheduling people to move in and out of al-Qaida training camps after joining the group following 9/11. Much of the information he supplied was unreliable, but also provided before he was waterboarded. He revealed so much, critics say, because he didn’t know many real details. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence examined the CIA’s program when Democrats controlled the Senate. Their final report, about 6,700 pages long and approved in 2012, remains classified. A 525-page redacted executive summary was released in December 2014, followed by a minority report from the committee’s Republicans and a CIA response. The summary said that enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding were not effective for getting intelligence from people detained after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The committee examined 20 prominent cases (including Zubaydah’s) that reportedly "saved lives," according to the CIA and the Bush administration. Some of these cases specifically cited waterboarding as a tactic used, but the committee concluded that in each example, either key information was gathered before enhanced interrogation began, the information was already available prior to interrogation, or the interrogation had nothing to do with the information obtained. Rejali pointed out most officials defending waterboarding were people whose jobs were at stake over the practice. Patrick Eddington, a former CIA analyst now at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the Senate investigation showed the agency was aware waterboarding and other techniques could potentially be considered torture. "The SSTI report makes it very clear, through the publication of CIA internal documents, that CIA personnel up to and including Director (John) Tenet knew that they were basically going to be breaking the law," Eddington said. There is little in the way of experimental data on waterboarding, because as you may imagine, there are a variety of reasons subjects don’t usually line up to submit to simulated drowning. (One subject in a BBC documentary confessed to being "born a bunny rabbit" after mere seconds, with no memory of saying as much.) But Trinity College Dublin’s Shane O’Mara, a professor of experimental brain research, told Newsweek there is scientific evidence that waterboarding physically prevents a person from providing reliable information. The sensation of suffocating activates survival instincts, not memory recall, O’Mara told the magazine. Furthermore, a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) hurts cognition and the increase of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) induces panic. In effect, putting a person under severe stress to make them talk also makes it difficult for them to recall or communicate anything worth extracting. Rejali noted that along with the historical and scientific strikes against waterboarding, there’s a third element to consider. To put it bluntly, while much of the Senate’s report is still classified, there’s no proof that the CIA’s waterboarding program was effective enough to convince more brutal regimes to use it. "If the Americans had found the golden fleece of torture techniques, no one has noticed and no one is copying," Rejali said. The most commonplace methods of making someone talk are still torturing with electricity or beating them with sticks, he said, although those techniques still don't guarantee anything that's said results in actionable intelligence. If waterboarding was considered truly effective, for example, "thousands of torturers in China would be using this. But they don’t." Our ruling Wilcox said, "I can tell you that the enhanced interrogation techniques that have since been banned by this administration — specifically waterboarding — work." While many top officials defended the CIA’s use of waterboarding in the past, there is no irrefutable evidence the practice provides results. Experts said there are few historical accounts of success, and even those are suspect. Meanwhile, there’s scientific proof that a technique like waterboarding would affect brain function enough to make any prisoner’s statements unreliable. They may say anything to make the waterboarding stop, and could actually be physically unable to provide any cogent intelligence. Wilcox didn’t provide concrete proof and experts say virtually none exists. We rate the statement False.

pomt-14418	"As a legislator, (Marco Rubio) flipped on a key vote after making a quick $200,000 from selling the house to the mother of the bill's lobbyist."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/mar/10/donald-trump/trump-attack-inaccurately-implies-rubio-traded-aut/	Billionaire Donald Trump likes to talk about his money-making prowess, but lately he’s taken to the airwaves to imply GOP presidential primary rival Marco Rubio has cut deals of his own as a Florida lawmaker. In an ad we first saw on March 7, 2016, Trump’s campaign said Rubio had a history of shady shenanigans as Florida’s speaker of the House. The commercial included a dig about Rubio suspiciously changing his stance on an issue after money changed hands. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER "As a legislator he flipped on a key vote after making a quick $200,000 from selling the house to the mother of the bill's lobbyist," the ad said. The ad hints that Rubio was caught in some kind of pay-to-play scandal without outright accusing him of wrongdoing. Trump’s campaign didn’t elaborate for us, but it appears Rubio wasn’t guilty of much more than a somewhat odd coincidence in the middle of some protracted legislating. The PIP battle Let’s start by going back to 2007 and introducing Rubio’s former West Miami neighbor, a chiropractor named Mark Cereceda. Cereceda was the lobbyist in question here, although calling him that is technically incorrect. We could find no record of him being registered as a lobbyist with the state in 2007 or any other year. He did, however, have a vested interest in the renewal of a type of auto insurance called personal injury protection, or PIP. And he let Rubio know about it. In 2007, when Rubio was House speaker, the state’s mandated PIP coverage was going to expire. The law required $10,000 in coverage that paid for accident injuries to drivers and passengers, no matter who was at fault. It cost about $100 or $200 per year. Then-Gov. Charlie Crist and the state Senate wanted to extend coverage when they met for the 2007 legislative session. The coverage was popular among health insurers and hospitals, which wanted to control costs. But Rubio and some House members weren’t fans, saying the PIP system encouraged too much fraud. Rubio demanded extensive fraud reforms and balked at a Senate proposal that he felt didn’t go far enough. "We have to wipe out fraud. The current PIP system has so much fraud built into it," Rubio said during the 2007 session. "An entire fraud industry has been created and unless that's addressed, there's no need to do anything." Clearly, Rubio wasn’t going to budge on PIP without what he considered substantial fraud protections. Cereceda, who had many patients who paid for treatment with insurance, made it a personal mission to change Rubio’s mind. He joined other doctors and chiropractors in a campaign to pressure Rubio to keep the PIP mandate alive. He went to Tallahassee to meet with Rubio. He organized demonstrations at Rubio’s West Miami office. He hired planes to fly banners over Rubio’s home and office. And, curiously, he was tied to Rubio another way at the same time: His mother, Nora Cereceda, was buying Rubio’s house. The house sale Back in February 2003, Rubio paid $175,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home in West Miami that was 1,340 square feet. He sold it to Nora Cereceda in April 2007 for $380,000 in a cash sale. That accounts for the $200,000 to which Trump’s ad is referring. Interesting, right? Well, the amount itself wasn’t so bizarre. Keep in mind this is after the housing bubble made home prices go haywire. Paying $380,000 wasn’t unheard of for a house that size within a square half-mile that year. According to property records, a 1,413-square-foot house with three bedrooms and two baths sold for $332,500 in June 2007. Three blocks away, a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home that was 1,960 square feet sold for $373,000 in May 2007. The Miami-Dade Property Appraiser considered it a qualified sale at fair market value. Qualified simply means neither the buyer nor the seller were under any constraints or incentives, like selling a house to a family member. (The price is not such a great deal now, of course; the house had a fair market value of about $213,000 in 2015.) Both Rubio and Mark Cereceda have insisted the transaction was completely unrelated to the PIP issue. It just so happened that Cereceda and Rubio were neighbors, and Rubio’s house was for sale. Nora Cereceda’s husband had died and she wanted to live near her son. She was a retiree with money from a life insurance policy, so the cash sale isn’t so unusual. That’s especially true in Florida, which routinely is among the leading states in cash real estate transactions. The house sale closed April 13. Three weeks later, on May 4, the Legislature adjourned with no deal on PIP. Rubio didn’t budge on his demands for more fraud protections, and state mandates for coverage were scheduled to sunset on Oct. 1. But about that flipped vote … Rubio wrote a letter to Crist on Sept. 28, months after the sale, asking the governor to include "property tax reform and mandatory auto insurance" to the list of issues to address at a previously called Oct. 3 special session, the third special session of that year. Rubio said in the letter that both the House and the Senate had worked on reforms that would foster an agreement on PIP. He credited then-House majority whip Ellyn Bogdanoff for creating "sensible and comprehensive anti-fraud legislation." Crist agreed, and legislators reached a compromise on Oct. 5, adding three measures to defray fraud. The final bill limited the prices that some medical facilities and doctors could charge for nonemergency care. It also required PIP clinics be owned or supervised by licensed doctors, and added $2 million to the state budget to hire more anti-fraud investigators. The House passed the bill 105-4, with Rubio voting yes. The Senate voted 37-0. He later noted that he considered the fraud protections sufficient, although we now know they didn’t do much to curb the problem. Fraud claims actually increased in the years immediately after lawmakers passed the 2007 PIP bill. They have since dropped after new legislation in 2012. Rubio’s campaign didn’t comment on the ad to PolitiFact Florida, other than to point out the accusation had been proved incorrect years ago when Crist tried to use it against him during the 2010 U.S. Senate campaign. Technically, it’s impossible to say Cereceda had no influence on Rubio. But Rubio didn’t say he would never approve a PIP extension, just that he wanted more protections. The near-unanimous vote in the House shows lawmakers overwhelmingly approved of the changes. Before we issue our rating, a brief afterword on Cereceda: In 2013, he pleaded guilty to charges he made his employees give illegal donations to political campaigns statewide. He and his brother Kemel Cereceda were given 60 days house arrest, three years of probation and fined more than $100,000. A Hialeah judge also lost her seat after taking a bribe from Cereceda. Our ruling Trump said of Rubio, "As a legislator he flipped on a key vote after making a quick $200,000 from selling the house to the mother of the bill's lobbyist." There’s no evidence Cereceda met the state’s strict definition of lobbying, and he was not registered as a lobbyist. He did, however, pressure Rubio to extend a PIP insurance mandate the then-speaker of the House opposed. His mother also bought Rubio’s house in the middle of a legislative session that could have dealt with the issue, at more than $200,000 what Rubio paid for it. Both men deny the sale influenced debate in Tallahassee, and no one can prove otherwise. Rubio didn’t really have a change of heart on any insurance vote. Months after the 2007 session ended, the House and Senate overwhelmingly agreed on new PIP terms that included fraud protections meeting Rubio’s expectations. Trump’s claim has a basis in real events, but there are several problems with the ethical implication he’s making about Rubio’s time in the Legislature.

pomt-08038	State governments have little ability to stimulate job growth in the short run.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/05/david-wyss/economist-says-state-can-do-little-short-term-job-/	Georgians need jobs. Last election season, that's just what politicians promised. Gov.-elect Nathan Deal's commercials focused on bringing "real jobs for real people." His Democratic foe, former Gov. Roy Barnes, said he would put the state "back to work." But during a boot camp for state legislators in December, prominent economist David Wyss said there's little Georgia government can do to kick-start the labor market for the near term. "It doesn’t work well on the state level because states can’t run budget deficits," Wyss said in a Dec. 13 article in The Florida Times-Union. He is chief economist for the credit rating company Standard & Poor's. "So anything you do in reducing taxes has to come back with a reduction in spending, which basically wipes out any stimulus you get," he said Really? But what about all those promises politicians made? Jobs were a central issue during the elections. A poll conducted before the primaries for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other papers found that across party, gender and racial lines, Georgians were worried about their economic futures. Three in four had qualms about their household finances and job security. Georgians still have good reason to be anxious. Unemployment hovered just above 10 percent in November, according to the state Department of Labor. Wyss also spoke during a biennial conference of state legislators sponsored by the University of Georgia. The meeting updated lawmakers on the issues they face starting Monday, when the 2011 legislative session begins. We called Wyss, who stressed that state government can enact policies that foster long-term job growth. They can train a work force specifically suited for a business's needs, for instance, or collaborate with local universities to foster technological innovation. States such as Georgia also have agencies specifically charged with economic development. And governors have been known to go on trade missions. But those efforts, too, are aimed at creating jobs in the long term. Wyss was talking about the short term. And in the short term, state legislators and governors don't have many options. Georgia and other states have to balance their budgets -- it's a constitutional requirement in Georgia. So if the state decides to cut taxes to stimulate business growth, it has to come up with the lost revenue somewhere else, Wyss said. That means government spending cuts. It could even mean layoffs. "There's no free lunch here," Wyss said. AJC PolitiFact Georgia asked seven experts with wide-ranging perspectives for their input. For the most part, they agreed with Wyss' assessment. Kelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a Libertarian-influenced think tank, called the idea "absolutely correct." If a state spends money to spur job growth, lawmakers have to make cuts elsewhere. Jon Shure, deputy director of the State Fiscal Project for the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, agreed with Wyss as well. "Short-term job gains are dictated mostly by the economy. And those are mostly regional, national and global issues," Shure said. One slight exception was Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He said tax cuts could bring a "marginal" improvement in the short term and are worth trying, but they can't bring a big boost. "There is no magic wand," Riedl said. We found that experts placed the state's ability to create jobs for the short term between limited and marginal. None argued that state government could cause an immediate, major gain. We find Wyss' statement True.	None	David Wyss	None	None	None	2011-01-05T06:00:00	2010-12-13	['None']

pomt-03824	"Seven of the 10 highest-income counties in the country ring the city" of Washington D.C.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/20/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-dc-home-highest-income-counties/	Supersize soda in hand, Sarah Palin rallied the CPAC crowd with barbs at "liberal media folk," jokes about President Barack Obama’s background and even a shout of "You lie!" Her speech at the annual meeting of conservative activists emphasized the need to rebuild the country -- not the Republican Party -- with an anti-Washington focus. "The permanent political class is in permanent campaign mode. So where do we go from here?" Palin said. "... At a time when Washington is so powerful that seven of the 10 highest-income counties in the country ring the city, allow yourself to imagine leadership that deigns to understand us little people, us clinging to our God, our guns, our Constitution and the grass roots!" Palin isn’t the first to cite that statistic about the wealth concentration in the nation’s capital. (PolitiFact Ohio checked it out earlier this year.) Here’s a fresh look. The statistic comes from the 2011 American Community Survey, a yearly estimate of population characteristics put out by the U.S. Census Bureau. The data was released last fall, and the Washington Post compiled it into a "Top 100" list. Indeed, seven of the top 10 are in the greater Washington, D.C. area: 1 - Loudon County, Va., median income $119,134 2 - Fairfax County, Va., median income $105,797 3 - Arlington County, Va., median income $100,735 5 - Howard County, Md., median income $98,953 7 - Prince William County, Va., median income $95,146 8 - Fauquier County, Va., median income $93,762 10 - Montgomery County, Md., $92,909 So Palin’s claim is on the money. We wondered: What’s making the nation’s capital so well-off? Stephen Fuller, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University, told PolitiFact some of the factors: "The D.C. area ranks third in the U.S. in the number of workers per household and second in labor-force participation rate, among the lowest in unemployment, and No. 1 in years completed in school ... We also work predominantly in professional and business services, and this is what explains this high ranking." Salim Furth, senior policy analyst for macroeconomics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, mentioned two other rankings: Washington is third in the country in both millionaires per capita and median gross rent. "That seems to me like poor people are getting priced out, and that helps push up your income stats if you can only stay here if you get a great job -- and the federal government gives really great jobs," he said. Those statistics: there are 320,000 federal jobs in the D.C. area, and 55 percent of them pay $100,000 per year or more, he said. And even though that salary doesn’t go as far as it would in, say, rural Mississippi, "it doesn’t eat up all of the wage gains," Furth said. Beyond the federal jobs, there are also industries concentrated around Washington because of the government presence, such as lobbyists, the defense industry and federal contractors. "There really is a lot of wealth here," Furth said. "There’s definitely a feel of everybody’s wealthy, everybody has nice things. You should dress up nice to go out. Drinks are expensive in a bar. Rent is expensive even if you’re in a crummy neighborhood." The ruling Palin said seven of the 10 wealthiest counties are in greater Washington D.C. The claim is accurate. We rate it True.

pomt-09021	"He (Kirk) did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/08/alexi-giannoulias/alexi-giannoulias-says-kirk-mixed-politics-militar/	A race for President Barack Obama's old Illinois U.S. senate seat features enough negative attacks to keep an army of fact-checkers busy. Democrat Alexi Giannoulias' go-to dig has been numerous misstatements made by his Republican rival, U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, about his military record. An ad entitled "On and On" from the Giannoulias campaign hits on a number of them rapid-fire -- splicing Kirk's words with TV news commentary and print media reports calling Kirk out for misstatements. The idea is to paint Kirk as a "typical Washington politician" who cannot be trusted. Kirk has copped to misspeaking and being "careless" with facts about his military records. We'll discuss each of the misstatements cited in the Giannoulias ad briefly before delving more deeply into one of the most recent and controversial claims in the ad, that, "He (Kirk) did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service." Before we get started, though, here's a little on Kirk's military history. He has served in the Naval Reserve for 21 years as an intelligence officer, and currently holds the rank of commander. In 1999, Kirk was called into active duty and deployed to Aviano, Italy, in support of Operation Allied Force, the war in Kosovo. He was the team leader for an ad-hoc intelligence team used to support air combat operations during Kosovo. Commanding officers raved about his "phenomenal performance" and described Kirk as "a natural and charismatic leader" and "head and shoulders above any intelligence officer I have ever met." Elected to Congress in 2001, Kirk has continued his military service, which included two two-week training stints in Afghanistan, in late 2008 and 2009. According to Navy records, Kirk has been awarded two Navy Marine Corps Commendation Medals, a Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Navy Unit Commendation, Meritorious Unit Commendation, a National Defense Service Medal, a Navy E Ribbon and a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. For this item we are going to do a Truth-O-Meter ruling on Giannoulias' claim that Kirk "did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service.'' But before we get to that part of the ad, we're going to examine other quotes from Kirk that Giannoulias also uses in the ad. "I was the Navy's Intelligence Officer of the Year." This is perhaps the highest-profile of the military gaffes by Kirk, one he boasted about both on his resume and on the floor of Congress. He didn't win that award. Rather, in 2000, the National Military Intelligence Association awarded the intelligence unit led by Kirk with the Vice Admiral Rufus L. Taylor Navy Reserve Intelligence Award, which honors exceptional achievement by outstanding intelligence professionals. And Kirk was tapped to physically accept the award at the National Military Intelligence Association’s annual awards banquet. Kirk has since acknowledged that he incorrectly referred to himself as the “Intelligence Officer of the Year." "Most importantly, I wasn't thinking," Kirk said in a press conference. "This was a carelessness that did not reflect well upon me." "I served in Iraq and Afghanistan." At other times, Kirk or his campaign literature have described him as "a veteran of Operation Desert Storm and Operation Enduring Freedom." He actually served as an intelligence officer stateside in Maryland as a reservist during both operations. The Kirk campaign later changed his record to read that he served "during" the operations. And again, his service in Afghanistan consisted of two two-week training sessions. "The last time I was in Iraq, I was in uniform flying and the Iraqi air defense network was shooting at us." In 2000, Kirk trained with a squadron based in Turkey, and flew over Iraq as part of Operation Northern Watch, enforcing a no-fly zone in the northern part of the country. In a June 4, 2010 interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Kirk later clarified "that while he heard reports of enemy fire, he cannot be sure his plane was ever fired on in Iraq or Kosovo." "I want to be very contrite and say there is a casualness with which I sometimes describe military details," Kirk told the Sun-Times. "And if it gave the impression that my military record is larger than it was, I want to apologize." "I command the war room in the Pentagon." Another misstatement. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, and acknowledged in an interview with Kirk, he commands one of two rooms -- the intelligence unit -- for eight hours at a time on his once-a-month weekend Naval reserve duties. Kirk told the newspaper he misspoke as he was trying to explain that to a civilian audience. But our ruling here is on this claim by Giannoulias: "He did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service." This was an issue first brought to light by blogger Terry Welch, who posted a Dec. 18, 2009, memo from Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Gail McGinn approving an exception to allow Kirk to train in Afghanistan. The memo contained this intriguing concluding paragraph: "As a candidate for the vacant Senate seat in Illinois, Commander Kirk must complete the appropriate acknowledgment of limitations required for all candidates on active duty. ... Ordinarily this acknowledgment must be completed within 15 days of entering active duty. Because of the short period of active duty and concerns arising from his partisan political activities during his last two tours of active duty, Commander Kirk must complete this form prior to his entry on active duty." Kirk campaign spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski released a statement: "Mark Kirk has served our nation in the U.S. Navy for two decades and has done so honorably. The fact is, Congressman Kirk never violated Defense Department policies. He has misspoken about his record, acknowledged it and apologized. Mark Kirk left for Afghanistan and he did not engage in political activities -- even in the face of radio commercials accusing him of being gay. The memorandum in question is simply off the mark. Furthermore, this raises grave concerns and questions about who gained access to Kirk's confidential records. The document in question should be viewed for what it is -- a baseless political ploy by partisans bent on defending a U.S. Senate seat at any cost." The Pentagon, however, later clarified, saying that on two occasions, Kirk was "counseled" about violating military policy regarding getting involved in politics while on active duty, and that Kirk was required to sign a statement acknowledging he knew the rules and wouldn't break them again, the AP reported. Specifically, the Pentagon said Kirk gave video interviews in late 2008 about Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich being arrested. And in July 2009, Kirk or a staff member wrote on the candidate's Twitter account that he was on duty at the Pentagon's National Military Command Center. According to a Department of Defense directive on political activities by members of the Armed Forces: "In keeping with the traditional concept that members on active duty should not engage in partisan political activity, and that members not on active duty should avoid inferences that their political activities imply or appear to imply official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement." Specifically, the rules say that "a member of the Armed Forces on active duty shall not ... participate in any radio, television, or other program or group discussion as an advocate for or against a partisan political party, candidate, or cause." According to AP coverage of a Kirk press conference published on June 30, 2010, "As Kirk apologized (for some of his misstatements about his military record), however, he also acknowledged something his campaign had flatly denied just two weeks ago — that he was twice scolded by the Pentagon for improperly mingling politics with his military duties." He stopped short of acknowledging that he had actually violated military policy, though. The Giannoulias ad states, "He (Kirk) did violate Pentagon rules, twice actually, for improperly mingling politics with his military service." The Pentagon released a statement to AP saying that Kirk was twice "counseled" for mixing politics with military service. And we have a memo from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense referring to "concerns arising from his partisan political activities during his last two tours of active duty." The fact that Kirk was merely "counseled" suggests these were not deemed terribly egregious violations of military policy. But the Pentagon did tell AP that Kirk signed a statement acknowledging that he knew the rules and wouldn't break them again. You don't sign such a statement if you aren't deemed to have skirted the rules. We rule this claim True.	None	Alexi Giannoulias	None	None	None	2010-07-08T18:18:21	2010-07-08	['None']
pomt-09318	"When you look at the nearly 150 men and women who have served us on the Texas Supreme Court, more than half of them had zero prior judicial experience."	false	/texas/statements/2010/apr/16/rick-green/rick-green-says-more-half-past-justices-texas-supr/	Before Rick Green lost to Judge Debra Lehrmann last week in the Republican primary race for a Texas Supreme Court seat, he pushed back against his opponent's claims that his lack of judicial experience made him unqualified to sit on the state's highest civil court. In a video posted March 25 on his campaign Web site, Green said, "When you look at the nearly 150 men and women who have served us on the Texas Supreme Court, more than half of them had zero prior judicial experience." We asked the Green campaign how it had done its research. Kara Green, the candidate's wife and his campaign treasurer, said the campaign relied on the Supreme Court's Web site and short biographies of the justices on the University of Texas Tarlton Law Library's Web site. Both sources list the justices starting in 1836, when the Texas Supreme Court was created after Texas gained independence from Mexico. Kara Green said the campaign found that 83 out of 148 justices -- 56 percent -- had no judicial experience before serving on the court, but the campaign didn't share their names with us. We jumped at the chance to explore Green's claim -- and with it, a fascinating slice of Texas history. The early years of the court, when Texas was a republic and not yet part of the United States, brim with stories of adventure and tragedy. In 1842, for instance, Justice Anderson Hutchinson was captured by the Mexican Army during a court session in San Antonio, forced to march to Mexico and held prisoner for months. We also learned that some of the Supreme Court's most respected members, including Chief Justices Robert W. Calvert and John Hill, had not previously warmed a judicial bench. Neither had a few of the court's most infamous justices, including Don B. Yarbrough of Houston, who resigned six months after being sworn in, in 1977, and eventually served time in federal prison. However, we couldn't find a definitive list of justices who came to the court without judicial experience. Officials with the Supreme Court and the Texas Supreme Court Historical Society, a nonprofit group that helps preserve artifacts related to the court, said they did not know how many there were. Professor James W. Paulsen of the South Texas College of Law in Houston, founding secretary of the historical society and an expert on Texas legal history, said he did not know of any studies that answered the question. With Paulsen's help, we did our own analysis using the Green campaign's sources: biographies on the UT library's Web site and the Supreme Court's list of justices. Right away, we ran into problems because the two lists of justices don't match exactly. For instance, the UT list includes more justices from the Republic of Texas than the court's list does, and it ends in 1986, while the court's list is current. Second, the biographical information for some early justices was incomplete, preventing us from being able to confidently determine whether they had prior judicial experience. Also, at least one biography of a Republic of Texas justice -- Shelby Corzine -- fails to mention judicial experience that he had in Alabama, according to Paulsen. After correcting for inadequate information, we wound up removing three justices from consideration. We also eliminated six more justices who Paulsen said should not be counted: Three because they never actually served on the court or were never confirmed for the job, or because of questions about the legality of their appointment or election. The last three were women whom Gov. Pat Neff appointed in 1925 to hear one case. Paulsen said that if all special judges of this kind were considered justices of the Texas Supreme Court, the list of names would grow considerably. (Those six names do not appear on the Supreme Court's list.) Bottom line: After making all these adjustments, we found that 65 out of 139 justices on the UT law library's list -- 47 percent -- had no prior judicial experience. On the Supreme Court's list, the breakdown was 62 out of 135 justices, or 46 percent. Neither amounts to "more than half," as the Green campaign claimed. One footnote: Though both lists date back to 1836, Paulsen makes a good case for taking those Republic of Texas-era justices out of the lineup, primarily because the court in those days operated very differently from they way it does now. Only the chief justice was a statewide officer; the court's other members were the state's district judges -- trial judges -- who from time to time served as associate justices of the court. Though Green's campaign included those justices in its tally, we agree with the law professor's argument. And if you remove from the UT list the 22 justices who served only during the Republic of Texas, the percentage of those without prior judicial experience drops to 37 percent. For the Supreme Court list, the percentage would be 38 percent. The verdict? No matter how we sort the numbers, they show that the majority of high court justices had prior judicial experience. We rate Green's statement as False.	None	Rick Green	None	None	None	2010-04-16T12:37:50	2010-03-25	['None']
pomt-02709	"Since 2007 David Jolly has given almost $30,000 to keep Democrats in Congress!"	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/dec/27/kathleen-peters/david-jolly-gave-almost-30000-keep-democrats-congr/	Republican 13th Congressional District candidate David Jolly’s past as a Washington lobbyist was always a sure bet to be a bone of contention for rivals in the campaign for the late C.W. Bill Young’s open seat. Kathleen Peters is more than happy to oblige. In a mailer sent to voters, Peters’ campaign declares, "Since 2007, David Jolly has given almost $30,000 to keep Democrats in Congress!" It then adds "(But not a dime to Congressman Bill Young)" before launching into a number of bullet points about how Jolly has supported his rival party. Lobbyists typically work both sides of the aisle in Congress depending on who can help their causes the most. We wanted to know if the mailer was telling the full story. Time to dig into the public record. Mr. Jolly goes to Washington The mailer doesn’t say it, but Dunedin native David Jolly worked for Young for several years. Jolly has played up his connection to Young, for whom he worked full time from 1995 to 2006. Jolly held various positions, with a brief break in 2001 when he took six months off to work at a Washington securities firm. In 2002, Young named Jolly his general counsel, a position Jolly held through 2006. In 2007, Jolly began work as a lobbyist with Washington firm Van Scoyoc Associates. Eventually, he opened his own firm, Three Bridges Advisors. Jolly officially took his name off the Lobby Registry in order to run for the vacant House seat. Peters has spent a lot of time making hay over Jolly’s past as a lobbyist, illustrating why it is so difficult for a lobbyist to run for office (leaving office to become a lobbyist is nowhere near as difficult -- or as uncommon). Her mailer says, "In the past three election cycles, Washington Lobbyist David Jolly has made nearly $30,000 in personal contributions to the campaigns of Democrats in Congress -- liberals who have forced Obamacare on America and have fought responsible Republican policies." The flier then lists 13 "Jolly Good" Democratic senators and representatives to whom Jolly has given campaign contributions. Among the baker’s dozen are Florida’s own Sen. Bill Nelson (who received $4,500 in direct contributions and through his PAC, Moving America Forward), Rep. Kathy Castor ($3,600) and former Rep. Allen Boyd ($7,500). Boyd, who was defeated for re-election by Republican Steve Southerland in 2010, is now a lobbyist for the Twenty-First Century Group. The list also includes other Democrats from around the nation, including Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin ($1,000), late Hawaii Sen. Daniel Inouye ($1,000), Maine Rep. Mike Michaud ($2,250) and former Illinois Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. ($2,300), who was sentenced in August to 30 months in prison for wire and mail fraud for using campaign contributions for personal expenses. The total listed on the mailing was $28,622, a number PolitiFact Florida confirmed through Federal Elections Commission filings from 2007 to 2013. What the mailer doesn’t mention is that Jolly also gave thousands to Republicans. Some noteworthy recipients include Rep. Gus Bilirakis ($9,350), Rep. Dennis Ross ($4,104), Rep. Richard Nugent ($4,629), Arizona Sen. John McCain’s presidential campaign ($2,300) and former Florida Sen. Mel Martinez ($1,500). Jolly also gave then-Republican Gov. Charlie Crist $500 during his failed Senate bid. In all, Jolly the lobbyist gave more than $34,000 to Republican politicians, candidates and organizations over the past six years. Jolly has maintained that paying both Democrats and Republicans is the cost of doing business as a lobbyist. "My giving has always followed my personal relationships," he told PolitiFact Florida. He said in the case of Democrats, the contributions were for candidates and Congress members in races that weren’t close and had defense and national security priorities that matched his own. It’s been noted in coverage of the 13th Congressional District race as well as the mailing in question that Jolly hadn’t given any money to Young, which Jolly confirms is true. But it wasn’t for a lack of trying, he said. "I actually gave him money, and he did not accept it," Jolly added, repeating a favored anecdote about Young literally tearing up the check. He said he often worked to get money for Young by organizing host committees for fundraisers. Our ruling Peters’ mailer said Jolly "has given almost $30,000 to keep Democrats in Congress" in the form of campaign contributions. The total on the flier, which we confirmed and Jolly did not dispute, is $28,622. That sounds like almost $30,000 to us. But Jolly has given even more to Republicans, and he was a staff member to Young for several years. The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-12109	"We took Wisconsin from the Bottom 10 for business to the Top 10."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/23/scott-walker/testing-scott-walkers-top-10-business-ranking-clai/	Gov. Scott Walker has sought to make business development and job creation a foundational part of his legacy in the state — a drive boosted by the announcement that Foxconn Technology Group plans to build a $10 billion plant here. So it’s no surprise the state’s business climate has been a common refrain in the push to win the plant and in the victory laps since Foxconn’s decision. That included this July 19, 2017, tweet from Walker: "We took Wisconsin from the Bottom 10 for business to the Top 10. Our reforms are working and more are on the way!" The same claim showed up in a column published Aug. 4, 2017, in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. What does it mean to be in the "Top 10" for business, and who decides that? Let’s dig in. Many surveys, many results Walker’s tweet didn’t cite a source, but Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said it referred to a ranking from Chief Executive Magazine, which placed Wisconsin No. 10 in its 2017 Best & Worst States for Business. The same survey ranked Wisconsin 41st in 2010, the year Walker was elected. That’s the bottom 10 of his claim. The ranking — which Walker’s touted in a news release when it was released in May — is based on a survey asking CEOs their perceptions of each state. Many national groups do similar surveys with a variety of methodologies, but most others aren’t so keen on Wisconsin’s business climate. Here’s a sampling of the most recent ratings from prominent sources: CNBC’s 2017 scorecard ranked Wisconsin 21st in economic climate, based on an analysis of more than 60 measures, such as workforce, infrastructure, cost of doing business, economy and quality of life. The Tax Foundation’s 2017 ranking of state tax climate pegs Wisconsin at 39th for how well a state’s tax system is structured for business. Site Selection Magazine ranked Wisconsin 25th for overall business climate in 2016, which it calculates by combining a survey of corporate site selectors and data on recent projects sited in the state. Forbes ranked Wisconsin 27th in 2016 among its best states for business based on a combined ranking that included business cost, labor supply, regulatory environment, economic climate, growth prospects and quality of life. The Kauffman Index publishes three rankings on aspects of entrepreneurial activity. Among the largest 25 states in 2016, it ranked Wisconsin second for Main Street entrepreneurship (per capita small businesses and business owners), 23rd for growth entrepreneurship (how much new businesses have grown) and 25th for startup activity (number of new businesses and business owners). An undated ranking from US NEWS & World Report puts the state’s business environment at 32nd, based on private business birth rate and number of patents per capita. Among the prominent national rankings, the Chief Executive Magazine one cited by Walker is the only one that does not have some objective, data-based component. Mike Winkleman, the magazine’s editor in chief, said the survey was sent to CEOs of the 42,000 largest companies in the country, of which about 500 responded. Each was asked to rank the four best and four worst states for doing business, and those were compiled into the national rankings using a points system. Rankings overly simplistic, experts say Site selectors, who analyze state and local business climates for a living, say such rankings are trying to paint broadly and objectively what is inherently specific and subjective. "There is no ‘best’ state (or states) for every type of business," Andrew Shapiro, managing director of site selection company Biggins Lacy Shapiro & Company, said in an email. "These rankings can be methodologically suspect and as a result can vary wildly from survey to survey and from year to year." A concept like "business climate" means different things to different people and can’t really be objectively defined or ranked in a general way, said Darin Buelow, a principal and head of the site selection group for Deloitte Consulting. "Any site selection or location decision has to be customized to a particular company and their particular needs," Buelow said. "A state or a community or a county might be a great place to do business for one company in a certain industry sector, but it could be a terrible place to do business for another company." Larry Gigerich, executive managing director of Ginovus, an Indiana-based site selection firm, said the surveys can catch the eye of business leaders in some cases and may get a state some initial consideration, but conditions specific to that project and industry determine final decisions. He said the rankings his firm typically pays attention to are CNBC, Chief Executive Magazine, Site Selection Magazine and the Kauffman Index’s growth entrepreneurship score. Wisconsin ranked an average of 20th among those four. Moving in the right direction Chief Executive Magazine is an outlier in how highly it ranks Wisconsin’s current business climate, but Wisconsin’s rankings have improved across the board since 2010. The CNBC ranking rose from 29 to 21, Forbes from 40 to 27 and the Tax Foundation a lesser uptick from 42 to 39. Site Selection Magazine only ranks the top 25, and Wisconsin was not ranked in 2010. "I think for the most part the state has shown significant improvement in terms of both perception and its business climate" since Walker took over, said Gigerich, who has helped locate sites for 300 projects, including about 25 that considered Wisconsin. "Wisconsin is not one of the lowest-cost states to do business in, but it is one that is now competitive, where I think a decade ago Wisconsin struggled with its tax structure and … economic incentive programs." Several site selectors pointed to the creation of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation as a step in the right direction, though they noted the state is still being held back by its aging transportation infrastructure. "They’ve certainly done a better job of marketing and articulating Wisconsin’s value proposition as a destination for advanced manufacturing," Buelow said. Evenson, the Walker spokesman, said Foxconn’s decision to build in Wisconsin is evidence of change.The Asian electronics giant has said it will employ thousands at a massive flat screen television plant in southeastern Wisconsin. Our rating Walker said Wisconsin is now a Top 10 state for business when it used to be in the bottom 10. Site selection professionals say they have seen improvements in Wisconsin’s business environment, but note there is no consensus on how to define and rank the business climate between states. Walker’s claim was made broadly and without attribution even though it referred to just one of many rankings that attempt to quantify data and perceptions on states’ business environments. It is the only prominent national ranking to rank Wisconsin in the Top 10 aside from an index that focuses narrowly on small businesses. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-02308	Premeditation, in murder cases like the Oscar Pistorius case, "can be formed in the twinkling of an eye."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/31/nancy-grace/nancy-grace-talks-oscar-pistorious-trial-could-pre/	On-air flare-ups between TV pundits trigger our spidey sense here at PunditFact, especially when the hot topic is a murder case gripping the world’s attention. So when Dan Abrams and Nancy Grace got into a spat over the Oscar Pistorius murder trial on Good Morning America, we had to dig in. Pistorius, the paralympian known as "Blade Runner," is accused of murdering his girlfriend, model Reeva Steenkamp, by shooting her with expanding bullets through a bathroom door in his home on Feb. 14, 2013. He admitted to shooting her but says it was an accident because he thought she was an intruder. The prosecution presented its case in March, and Pistorius is expected to take the stand when the trial resumes. Abrams and Grace, who are both attorneys, agreed the prosecution brought a strong case for a murder conviction. But they had sharply different takes on whether there was enough evidence to prove the killing of Steenkamp was premeditated. Abrams said, "I have not heard a single piece of evidence in this case which says this was a premeditated murder." "Premeditation requires planning, it requires thought beforehand. That’s very different from just an intentional murder. He’s charged with premeditated murder here. Look, the reality is this judge could decide intentional murder, that’s still a conviction on murder, it’s a slightly lesser sentence than premeditated. But I don’t know why they’ve pursued a premeditated murder case unless there’s some other evidence that’s going to be presented in this case." Grace’s turn. "Well, I know why. And it’s a very common misunderstanding about premeditation. Yes, it is intent. Yes, it is planning. But premeditation can be formed in the twinkling of an eye. That quickly." There was some overtalk, and Grace continued: "He came and got the gun out of the holster from under her side of the bed. He had to see, he was on his stumps, which he lied about, he had to see she wasn’t in the bed. He then walked into the bathroom and started firing. And they had had an argument. And the argument as you pointed out earlier, Dan, shows motive for anger. And just because you’re angry that does not denigrate premeditation." Abrams responded: "But that’s just a misunderstanding of the law. The bottom line is what Nancy is talking about, about what you can form in an instant, is intent. You can create the intent to commit murder in an instant. You cannot create the intent to create premeditation in an instant. And in fact there’s a case in South Africa..." Grace cut in: "The intent to create premeditation? Premeditation is simply planning, and you can plan in a moment of minutes." "Whoa, so now we’re minutes?" Abrams said. "A moment ago you were saying it’s seconds. So the bottom line is premeditation takes time. You have to plan it out." Grace: "Yeah, well, it can be seconds according to the law. Go read your law book. Come back to me after you’ve tried a couple murders." Sorry for the whole transcript, but it’s a fun read. And it’s all crucial to our fact-check. Disses aside, a reader asked if Grace was right that premeditation could occur in "the twinkling of an eye." In South Africa, the site of Pistorius’ trial, the answer could mean the difference between Pistorius spending the rest of his life in prison or getting a lighter sentence. (There’s no death penalty, or juries, in South Africa.) To our question here, legal analysts we consulted said deciding to kill someone in the moments before a murder can be considered premeditation in many American jurisdictions. But that does not necessarily apply in the backdrop of Grace’s statement, South African court, where experts point to case law that suggests premeditation requires more of a plan. Could it happen in the U.S.? Pistorius is charged with murder, and prosecutors want to prove it was premeditated because that warrants the stiffest penalty under South African law, life in prison. The legal analysts on TV were essentially arguing about what kind of sentence he will get. Grace, via a HLN spokeswoman, pointed to case law to back up her point involving U.S. Supreme Court decisions and state Supreme Court appeals of murder cases in Montana and Georgia, which say things like "premeditation may be formed momentarily" and "malice aforethought can be formed instantly." And American law experts say she has a valid point that just seconds could qualify as premeditated in some states. Planning in many American definitions does not require much time and is basically the opposite of impulse, which usually leads to second-degree murder, said Robert Weisberg, a Stanford University law professor and director of the Stanford Criminal Justice Center. But it’s not uniform. "The drafters of the American Model Penal Code strongly urged the elimination of the premeditation/intent distinction, but few states follow that guidance," Weisberg said. So whether premeditation can occur in an instant in America is nuanced depending upon the jurisdiction. "That might be true in a Georgia court where she practiced law, but it’s not true in a Florida court," said Charles Rose, a professor at Stetson University College of Law. South Africa law ≠ U.S. law The more important question: Could it be true in South Africa? What counts as premeditation is an unsettled area of law decided on a case by case basis, said Kelly Phelps, a University of Cape Town Faculty of Law senior lecturer. Still, jurisprudence suggests it takes time. "What is clear is that crimes of passion in the heat of the moment will not be premeditation," Phelps said. "It is true that as long as a clear thought is formed and executed, even in a few minutes, this could in theory be premeditation, but not if the killing happen on the spur of the moment out of rage." Some types of murder that would be considered premeditated in the U.S. would not be considered premeditated in South Africa, said Bob Dekle, a retired assistant state attorney who teaches the prosecution clinic at the University of Florida Levin College of Law. In South Africa, murder is defined as the unlawful and intentional killing of another person. There are three different forms of intent that come into play when a judge is determining the length of a sentence. (Memorize the Latin terms like we did and you’ll seem super informed about this case.) Dolus directus, or direct intent. It was your goal to kill someone. Dolus eventualis, or knowing the possible result of your action will kill someone and recklessly going through with it anyway. It’s akin to second-degree murder, Dekle said. Dolus indirectus, or indirect intent. When a person’s death is a substantially certain outcome of your action, such as committing arson and knowing factory workers will die as a result. The judge could also decide the murder was not intentional and find Pistorius guilty of culpable homicide, or an unlawful negligent killing. In that scenario, Pistorius ought to have foreseen the result of shooting through a door but did not, or he should have known Steenkamp was in the bathroom when shooting through the door, said Marius du Toit, a criminal defense attorney in South Africa who is tracking the case. The court would determine how a reasonable person in Pistorius’ situation would have acted that night and compare it to what he did. The bigger takeaway, Dekle said, is South African law has a high standard for premeditation. "When South African law says premeditation, what they mean is a prior plan to murder," Dekle said. "That’s somewhat similar to our concept of cold, calculated and premeditated" in Florida. On Good Morning America, Abrams tried to reference a South Africa case, Raath vs. The State, a decision cited alongside discussions of what constitutes premeditation, but Grace cut him off. A High Court revisited the case of a man who made his son open a safe so he could retrieve a revolver, which he used to kill his wife across the street moments later. The court reduced his life sentence to 22 years, arguing the lower court erred in deeming the murder as the result of premeditation. Even though there is no concrete definition for the term, the judge wrote, "clearly the concept suggests a deliberate weighing up of the proposed criminal conduct as opposed to the commission of the crime on the spur of the moment or in unexpected circumstances." It is correct that from the moment he appeared to conceive the idea of shooting his wife the appellant brooked no opposition and almost immediately proceeded to carry out the terrible deed. However, this does not, in my view, transform what appears to have been the deadly, but spur of the moment act or acts of a man in an emotional rage, into a planned and premeditated murder. In other words? "Grace has got it all wrong," du Toit, the South African criminal defense attorney, said. "The period between the forming of the intention and the carrying out of the act is crucial to the test whether premeditation was present. Our courts have said repeatedly that premeditation does not occur on the ‘spur of the moment.’" The prosecution alleged premeditation in the Pistorius trial to get him to disclose his full version of the events leading up to Steenkamp’s death, du Toit said. Phelps, the law lecturer from South Africa, pointed to several cases, among them State vs. Dyonase, in which the accused killer retaliated to the victim’s previous assault and ransacking of his home by ambushing him as he returned from drinking with another friend and stabbing him to death. The court weighed whether the evidence showed a preconceived design or clear motive, which would prove premeditation. The court ruled the murder was not premeditated, preventing the killer from serving a minimum life sentence. (You can read more cases and Phelps’s commentary in this document.) Our ruling Grace and Abrams wrangled over the definition of premeditated murder, with Grace arguing, "premeditation can be formed in the twinkling of an eye." Location, location, location. Legal experts told us it could in some parts of the United States, but it’s not as likely to meet South Africa’s heightened standards for premeditation. While the definition for what counts as premeditation is not finite, legal precedent shows South African courts are likely to require evidence that proves more planning than a "spur of the moment" decision. We rate her claim Mostly False. Thanks to our friends at reddit, both in our reddit community and in the /r/law subreddit, for weighing in on this fact-check.

pomt-14598	"90 percent of all pain medications are prescribed in the United States."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/feb/04/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-americans-consume-vast-majority-addi/	Editor's note (May 10, 2017): Since the publication of this fact-check, PolitiFact Missouri has found additional information and analysis about this topic. To read the latest, see this fact-check. As New Hampshire officials work to contain the state’s opioid crisis, presidential candidates have been called upon to address the problem and offer solutions. At an editorial board meeting with Monitor staff, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush outlined his plan -- and dropped an interesting statistic. Bush said Americans have a tendency to overmedicate in general, but addictive painkillers are even worse. "I read this, I believe, that 90 percent of all pain medications are prescribed in the United States in the world," Bush said. Could this be true? Are so many of the world’s pain medications dispensed in this country alone? We decided to check out the number and its origins. Bush’s New Hampshire campaign staff said the candidate misspoke; he meant to say 80 percent, not 90. The article Bush was referring to was by Dr. Sanjay Gupta and published last year on CNN.com. "We were stunned to learn 80 percent of the world's pain pills are consumed in the United States," Gupta writes. That number doesn’t just appear in CNN’s reporting, though. ABC News cited it in 2011. The BBC mentioned it in coverage a year later. As noted by the Bush campaign -- and independently verified by PolitiFact New Hampshire -- the statistic originates with the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, a group based in Kentucky with some 4,500 members. The group reports in a fact sheet that the United States, with "only 4.6 percent of the world’s population, has been consuming 80 percent of the global opioid supply, and 99 percent of the global hydrocodone supply, as well as two-thirds of the world’s illegal drugs." Papers published in Pain Physician -- ASIPP’s quarterly journal -- are the source of those numbers. That 80 percent figure appeared in a paper published in 2008, and has been repeated in the organization’s literature, including testimony to the U.S. Senate. But while these numbers were the source of Bush’s statement, they date from 2008. Out of curiosity, we decided to search for another, more recent version of the information. Luckily, there’s a separate source for such data, and it’s the United Nations. The group’s International Narcotics Control Board issues yearly papers about narcotic drug use around the world. While it publishes a general report, it also puts out technical reports, which detail the actual use of such substances globally. And according to the group’s 2014 report, its most recent, the United States consumes 78 percent of the world’s oxycodone (known as Oxycontin). It’s also reported to use 99 percent of the world’s hydrocodone (it’s Vicodin when combined with acetaminophen) and used 51 percent of the world’s hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Earlier versions of this set of statistics appear in a 2012 Newsday piece, a 2013 New Yorker article and a 2014 New York Times blog post. And Bush’s larger point that Americans generally over-medicate is supported, too. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the United States uses 75 percent of all of the world’s prescription drugs, period. Again, the United States has just under 5 percent of the world population. Our ruling Bush said that, globally, "90 percent of all pain medications are prescribed in the United States." In the context of the conversation, it was clear that Bush was referring to opioid painkillers. The most up-to-date information suggests that the United States uses the majority of the world’s supply of popular versions of such drugs. And statistics from a few years ago put that overall percentage at 80 percent. The exact number Bush used isn’t far off from commonly available statistics, and his campaign acknowledged that he misspoke. His overall point, however, was correct. We rank his statement Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2016-02-04T13:45:34	2016-01-21	['United_States']

pomt-02390	"The average family (is) now bringing home $4,000 less than they did just five years ago."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/12/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-average-us-family-earning-4000-le/	Economic stagnation is an issue that has become a major talking point for both parties. Take President Barack Obama’s most recent State of the Union address, in which he said that during the past four years, "average wages have barely budged." We rated that claim True. Now, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, has offered an even more ominous statistic for working Americans. "The average family," he said in the March 8, 2014, weekly Republican address, is "now bringing home $4,000 less than they did just five years ago." We wondered whether Portman’s claim was correct, so we turned to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The bureau collects data on family income and found that Portman is correct as long as the dollar amounts are adjusted for inflation. We looked at both the mean family income (that is, total family income divided by the number of families) and the median family income (the middle value when all family incomes are lined up from biggest to smallest). For the inflation-adjusted mean, family income fell from $87,312 in 2007 to $82,843 in 2012, the most recent year available. That’s a drop of $4,469, making Portman correct. In fact, he underestimated a bit. The difference is even more stark if you use the inflation-adjusted median. By that measure, family income dropped from $67,943 to $62,241 over the same period. That’s a drop of $5,702 -- an 8.3 percent decline over five years. So Portman’s only shortcoming is to lowball the size of the family-income decline. We should note that choosing 2007 as the starting year maximizes the decline, since the last recession began in December 2007. But we have no quarrel with the use of this period, because when looking at income trends, it seems reasonable to look at how big an impact the recession has had. We’ll also note that Portman wouldn’t be correct if non-inflation-adjusted figures are used. Without an inflation adjustment, both mean and median family incomes went up from 2007 to 2012 -- about 5 percent for mean family income, and 1.4 percent for median family income. But economists generally prefer inflation-adjusted data for situations like this, since the adjusted data takes into account the most important aspect of income -- what it can actually purchase. Our ruling Portman said "the average family (is) now bringing home $4,000 less than they did just five years ago." According to Census Bureau data, the decline is even greater, making Portman’s overall point even stronger than the data he offered. We rate his claim True.

pomt-08447	"John Boozman is excited about putting a 23 percent national sales tax on everything you buy."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/15/blanche-lincoln/blanche-lincoln-ad-highlights-23-percent-sales-tax/	In tight races around the country, many Democrats are going after Republican opponents who have supported -- even tepidly -- proposals to replace federal income taxes with a tax on retail sales. Supporters of the idea call it "the Fair Tax." One example is Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln, the Democratic incumbent, who has aired several ads criticizing her Republican opponent, U.S. Rep. John Boozman, for supporting the Fair Tax, which Lincoln believes is a "dumb" idea. We are fact-checking the latest ad, which begins with a clip from a debate on Sept. 8, 2010, in which Boozman said, "I'm excited about looking at the Fair Tax." Then comes the voice-over: "John Boozman is excited about putting a 23 percent national sales tax on everything you buy. Calling it a fair tax is like putting a dress on a pig. 95 percent of Arkansans would pay more taxes." The ad then cuts to another sound bite from Boozman calling the Fair Tax "a workable solution." In some of the Democratic ad campaigns running around the country, the Republican candidates' support for a national sales tax isn't as clear as the ads suggest. For example, some have spoken about it in terms of one of several options that should be considered. But Boozman's position is fairly well-documented. Twice, in 2007 and 2009, Boozman has cosponsored "Fair Tax Act" bills in Congress. The bills, which have come up annually for years, have all failed to progress to a full hearing. The bills sought to repeal the federal income tax, employment tax, and estate and gift taxes, replacing them with a 23 percent "national sales tax on the use or consumption in the United States of taxable property or services." The 2007 bill got 72 cosponsors in the House; and the 2009 bill got 65 cosponsors. But the bills never gained much traction and died. Here's a fuller context of Boozman's comments about the Fair Tax during the Sept. 8 debate highlighted in the ad: "I'm excited about looking at the Fair Tax," Boozman said. "I'm excited about getting rid of the IRS...The bill would make it such that you would eliminate all federal taxes. I think it's something that needs to be looked at. It's a workable solution, and it should be gone forward with hearings and things in that manner." Boozman campaign spokesman Patrick Creamer said Boozman simply wants the Fair Tax and other options to be debated. "The congressman is a cosponsor of H.R. 25.," Creamer said. "He did so to move the discussion on comprehensive tax reform forward. He believes our tax system is inherently dysfunctional and needs to be overhauled. He would like to abolish the IRS and replace it with an easier and more fair system of taxation, which is why he supports looking into the Fair Tax as one way to achieve this." Critics of the plan call it a regressive tax system that places too much tax burden on middle and lower income people. Which brings us to Lincoln's claim that the plan would result in 95 percent of Arkansans paying more taxes. That statistic comes from a 2004 analysis from the left-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice. But it's not an apples-to-apples analysis of the bills repeatedly proposed in Congress. The group's research arm, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, used a 45 percent sales tax for its analysis arguing that was a more realistic percentage for what is needed to raise the same amount of revenue as the current federal tax system. Other economists have criticized the 23 percent figure as well, saying that it would require massive cuts in federal spending (or running up massive debt) if it were used alone to replace the federal income tax. Nonetheless, the figure used in the study is not the 23 percent sales tax figure contained in the bill Boozman cosponsored. What the appropriate percentage for a national sales tax ought to be is a matter for debate, but we think it's misleading to cite the 95 percent figure in the ad based on an analysis of a sales tax that is nearly double the tax rate in the bill Boozman cosponsored. Our bigger issue with the Lincoln ad -- and a number of similar ads being run against Republicans who have had nice things to say about the "Fair Tax" -- is that it highlights support for a 23 percent national sales tax but fails to mention that it would replace federal income taxes. No matter what you think of the plan, that's a very deceptive omission. As Creamer, from the Boozman campaign, notes, "Her ads never even mention the fact that it eliminates all your current federal taxes, much less the prebate provisions which give every American an upfront monthly rebate to cover their essential purchases, within the plan." The so-called Fair Tax is certainly a controversial, wholesale upheaval of our current tax system. And when distinguishing yourself from your opponent, it's certainly fair to call your opponent's plans "dumb." But saying your opponent supports a sales tax increase and failing to mention that it would also mean the elimination of federal income taxes is only telling half the story. And so we rate the ad's claim Half True.	None	Blanche Lincoln	None	None	None	2010-10-15T17:46:55	2010-09-20	['None']
pomt-12319	"Docs: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker took $1 million from a pro-Putin Ukrainian businessman—last election cycle."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/21/tweets/pro-putin-ukrainian-gave-scott-walker-1-million/	An anti-Donald Trump Democratic strategist and fundraiser has attacked Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker by trying to tie him to Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a May 23, 2017 tweet that has been retweeted more than 6,500 times ties, Scott Dworkin said this: Docs: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker took $1 million from a pro-Putin Ukrainian businessman—last election cycle. It’s a bit of a drive-by attack. Dworkin and his group Dworkin, who goes by @funder on Twitter, is a senior advisor for the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, which was founded during the 2016 presidential campaign. He gained attention after the election by saying he was filing treason "complaints" against Trump and three other officials in connection with Russian interference in the election. PunditFact pointed out that only federal prosecutors, not ordinary citizens, can file criminal complaints alleging treason. Dworkin has continued hammering on Russia, telling the Washington Post two weeks after his Walker tweet: "Anybody who says we shouldn’t look into Russia at this point is either in it or a traitor." The Walker attack Dworkin’s attack pertains to Walker’s brief run for the 2016 Republican nomination and to a super PAC which, unlike a presidential candidate, can accept unlimited donations. When we asked for information to back up the claim, Dworkin referred us to a Federal Election Commission record showing that Access Industries Inc. of New York City made a $1 million contribution to Unintimidated PAC, a super PAC launched by longtime Walker advisers. (The super PAC, by the way, offered perks to $1 million donors, including: twice-a-year retreats, members-only briefings and conference calls, two private dinners with "VIP special guests" and a special "executive board member" pin.) Access Industries actually gave a total of $1.5 million to the super PAC, the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics told us, although $1.2 million of it was returned after Walker dropped out of the race. So, the $1 million figure in the tweet is accurate, except that the money was given to a super PAC supporting Walker, not to Walker or to his campaign. The rest of the attack is less on target. The company owner Access Industries is a New York-based industrial group whose holdings include Warner Music. It was founded by Leonard Blavatnik. According to Forbes, he’s worth $19 billion, having made $7 billion from the sale of TNK-BP, a Russian oil company, in 2013. Blavatnik was born in Ukraine and raised in Moscow. But he emigrated to the United States for school in 1978, now lives in London and holds dual citizenship in the United States and the United Kingdom. So, calling him a Ukrainian businessman is not accurate. As for whether Blavatnik is "pro-Putin," we didn’t find direct evidence of that, although there are connections. The Financial Times referred to Blavatnik as one of the "Kremlin-friendly tycoons" who made a fortune on the sale. In 2015, the London-based Daily Mail reported on controversy over a $75 million donation made by Blavatnik to Oxford University. Academics, human rights activists and Russian dissidents called on the university to "stop selling its reputation and prestige to Putin’s associates." And in 2016, the Daily Mail reported that British Prime Minister Theresa May believed that Russian and former Soviet bloc oligarchs with links to Putin had become too close to the Tories and should be barred from party fundraising events. The article cited Blavatnik as one of the oligarchs. However, when we checked with Steven Lee Myers, Karen Dawisha and Anne Garrels, each of whom has written a book on Putin, they told us they didn’t know whether Blavatnik was "pro-Putin." Blavatnik has pushed back on being tied to Putin. In May 2017, The Guardian reported that lawyers for Blavatnik have denied he is an associate of Putin, saying he has had no personal contact with the Russian president since 2000. Similarly, the Telegraph has reported that Blavatnik insists he's a strong believer in democracy who hasn't had any contact with Putin since 2000. Our rating Tweets made this claim: "Docs: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker took $1 million from a pro-Putin Ukrainian businessman — last election cycle." The businessman was born in Ukraine, but has long lived in London and New York. His company gave $1.5 million not directly to Walker, but to a super PAC that supported Walker’s run for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. He has ties to Putin, based on his past ownership of a Russian oil company, but whether he is "pro-Putin" is unclear. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-14741	"If you are going to kill the families of terrorists, realize that there's something called the Geneva Convention we're going to have to pull out of."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/17/rand-paul/rand-pauls-right-geneva-conventions-bar-donald-tru/	Donald Trump says the United States should kill the family members of terrorists, and not to do so is just being "politically correct." "The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families," Trump said on Fox and Friends on Dec. 2, 2015. "They care about their lives, don't kid yourself. When they say they don't care about their lives, you have to take out their families." Trump got a challenge on this at the CNN presidential debate in Las Vegas. CNN aired a pre-recorded question from Josh Jacob, a student at Georgia Tech: "Recently Donald Trump mentioned we must kill the families of ISIS members. However, this violates the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants in international law." Trump doubled down on his position: "I would be very, very firm with families" and repeating his sentiment that even though people think "they may not care much about their lives … they do care, believe it or not, about their families' lives." Later in the debate, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul took Trump to task for that approach. "If you are going to kill the families of terrorists," Paul said, "Realize that there's something called the Geneva Convention we're going to have to pull out of. It would defy every norm that is America." We wondered whether Paul was right about the Geneva Convention, so we asked a range of experts in international law. They said Paul was correct and pointed to two key pieces of international agreements. What the Geneva Convention says about fighting terrorist groups The Geneva Conventions were designed after World War II to establish agreed-upon rules of war. The United States, like most countries, is a party to them and "is hugely committed in principle and in the training of soldiers," said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. All four Geneva Conventions from 1949 contain "Common Article 3," which applies to "armed conflict not of an international character." What does that mean? The U.S. Supreme Court, in the 2006 case Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld, ruled that "armed conflict not of an international character" means a war that is not fought against a sovereign state. (A sovereign state simply means a country with a recognized government.) Since groups like ISIS are not considered sovereign states, that means that Common Article 3 applies to the current war on terrorism. According to Common Article 3, people who are taking no active part in the hostilities "shall in all circumstances be treated humanely… To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever … violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture." Experts said this language would make Trump’s approach a violation of the Geneva Conventions, assuming that the family members were not taking part in terrorist activities. Common Article 3 "would seem to prohibit any targeting of families or others who were ‘taking no active part in hostilities,’ " said Anthony Clark Arend, Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service. "The principle of noncombatant immunity is a fundamental principle of international law." What the Geneva Conventions say about targeting civilians This extension of the original Geneva Conventions was finalized in 1977. The most relevant portion for judging the Trump scenario appears to be Article 51.2, which states, "The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited." This root principle here is to ensure that civilians are not the object of an attack, said Richard D. Rosen, director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at the Texas Tech University School of Law. "I believe that a policy of intentionally and directly targeting the families of terrorists, assuming the family members are not combatants themselves, is a gross violation of the law of war and a war crime," Rosen said. Rosen and others acknowledged that there are some gray areas when putting this provision into practice. For instance, the Geneva Conventions don’t outlaw all civilian casualties when armed forces are undertaking a military objective. It effectively permits them if precautions are taken and the "expected loss of life or injury to civilians, and damage to civilian objects incidental to the attack, is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained," Rosen said. This balance can be difficult to strike, Ratner said, but at least it means that "you can't kill a huge number of people just to knock out a small target." There’s another wrinkle: Officially, the United States is not a party to the Additional Protocols of 1977. However, the United States has blessed them in practice, experts said. The United States "has recognized much of (the Additional Protocols) as binding customary law," said Mary Ellen O'Connell, a Notre Dame law professor. The Supreme Court "said as much in Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld in 2006. As customary international law, the U.S. cannot ‘pull out’ of the rule. It binds us until a new treaty rule or customary rule supersedes it." In addition, Rosen said, the Defense Department Law of War Manual published in June 2015 says that civilians may not be made the object of an attack. The provisions in the Additional Protocols "prohibit acts of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror in a civilian population," said David P. Fidler, a law professor at Indiana University. "Trump's proposal to have U.S. military forces deliberately kill families, including women and children, in order to deter ISIS fighters is a proposal to use acts of violence to spread terror among civilians. Or Trump wants to fight terror with terror, something abhorrent to America's warriors and unconscionable as a suggestion from someone who wants to be commander in chief." Our ruling Paul said, "If you are going to kill the families of terrorists, realize that there's something called the Geneva Convention we're going to have to pull out of." A range of experts in international law agreed that at least two elements of the Geneva Convention would contravene a policy of killing family members of terrorists, and that the United States has demonstrated a commitment to adhering to both provisions.

pomt-01640	Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein "gave hundreds of thousands of campaign cash to control Crist’s appointments of key state judges."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/aug/25/republican-party-florida/republicans-ad-says-scott-rothstein-bought-charlie/	Florida’s famous Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein now lives in a federal prison, but Republicans hope that he can help smear the reputation of former Gov. Charlie Crist. Back when Crist was a Republican, Rothstein and his Fort Lauderdale law firm donated generously to Crist and the Republican Party of Florida, as well as several other politicians. In 2010, Rothstein was convicted in a $1.4 billion Ponzi scheme and sentenced to 50 years in prison. Rothstein’s testimony in a related case provided fodder now being used by Republicans to attack Crist in a TV ad. "Convicted swindler Scott Rothstein bought expensive things with stolen money. He even bought a governor," says the narrator. "Rothstein boasted about contributing huge sums of money to the campaign of then Gov. Charlie Crist and the influence it gave him over judicial appointments. Now cooperating with prosecutors, Scott Rothstein admits he gave hundreds of thousands of campaign cash to control Crist’s appointments of key state judges." Florida newspapers have extensively covered Rothstein’s case over the years. We wanted to know if the facts matched up with the ad’s brief description. To do that, we reviewed everything we could find on the case and conducted new interviews of people who had dealings with Rothstein on judicial appointments. What we found doesn’t reflect well on Crist, who took Rothstein’s money and placed him on a key commission that recommended judges. But we also failed to find hard evidence that Rothstein actually controlled Crist’s judicial appointments as the ad claims. Those who served on a judicial nominating commission with him painted a portrait of someone who was all style but not much substance. Rothstein craved access to politicians More than 20 people were convicted as part of the scheme Rothstein ran, and it had all the markings of a great novel: investors losing millions of dollars, tales of mafia connections and prostitutes, as well as glitzy parties. Rothstein first founded his law firm with Stuart Rosenfeldt in 2002, which became Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler in 2005. He drove luxury cars, lived in a waterfront home with a gold toilet and had a stake in the former Versace mansion in South Beach. He befriended politicians and held fundraisers for them, posing for photos which he framed on his law firm walls. He wanted connections to power at all levels: He invested in the county sheriff’s race, held fundraisers for Sen. John McCain’s presidential bid and supported Crist’s campaigns for governor in 2006 and U.S. Senate in 2010. It all came crashing down in early November 2009, when federal authorities revealed they were investigating his scheme of selling bogus legal settlements. Rothstein briefly fled to Morocco before he returned to face charges and the demise of his 70-lawyer firm. The Republicans’ ad focuses on Rothstein’s connection with Crist and the governor’s judicial appointments. The ad relies on Rothstein’s February 2014 testimony in a related case that led to the conviction of a law firm employee for her role in bilking investors. In August 2008, Crist appointed Rothstein to the Judicial Nominating Commission for the Fourth District Court of Appeal in West Palm Beach. The JNC is a nine-member panel that recommends applicants for the governor to appoint. Rothstein testified that he told Crist the names of lawyers to appoint to the Broward County bench. Here is part of Rothstein’s testimony: Question: "You were able to convince the Governor to appoint you to the Judicial Nominating Committee?" Rothstein: "Yes, sir. I was able to convince the governor to do a lot of things." Question: "Well, what other things were you able to convince him to do?" Rothstein: "I was able to convince him to appoint people to judicial positions." Question: "So there are sitting judges right now that are sitting as judges because of your influence over the governor?" Rothstein: "Yes, sir." Rothstein testified that while he was on the JNC, he gave additional input to Crist about judicial appointments. Rothstein: "Based upon conversations that I had with Gov. Crist and with his chief of staff and general counsel, my job in my position on the nominating commission was to be the governor's voice on the commission. In other words, he had his preferences as to who he wanted to see get the appointments. And I would, in my role on the commission, push these particular candidates as hard as I possibly could on the governor's behalf." Question: "So in essence, are you telling us that you were basically thwarting the efforts of the commission?" Rothstein: "In certain ways. Yes, absolutely. I had significant influence with the governor on judicial appointments to the circuit bench in Broward County. It was quid pro quo between the governor and I." When asked how he chose candidates to recommend to Crist, Rothstein replied: "Someone who is going to favor our law firm." During his testimony Rothstein said that he expected Crist to "do certain things in exchange for large political contributions." When asked if he put that in writing, he replied: "Some of them I did. I wrote them to one of his assistants." But during his testimony Rothstein didn’t name any particular judges that he supposedly told Crist to appoint. What others on the JNC said Rothstein said he pushed as hard as possible on the JNC to get the nominees he wanted. To see if that was the case, we turned to meeting minutes and attempted to contact every member of the JNC who served with Rothstein. Members vote by secret ballot and then forward a handful of names to the governor, who makes the final pick. The current chair of the JNC, lawyer Debra Jenks, emailed us copies of the minutes which showed Rothstein attended at least two meetings and missed at least two other meetings. (The JNC, however, doesn’t record minutes for every meeting, including when they vote on nominees.) The brief minutes aren’t verbatim records, though. They indicate who was present, procedures and information about upcoming meetings. JNC members were assigned based on a rotating blind assignment list to investigate judicial applicants. At his first meeting in October 2008, Rothstein was assigned to investigate two: one was Spencer Levine, who would later get appointed by Crist, and Palm Beach Judge Elizabeth Maass. Crist appointed four judges to the Fourth District’s Court of Appeal during Rothstein’s tenure. Three were previously county or circuit judges: Cory Ciklin, Jorge Labarga and Jonathan Gerber. (Labarga served a single day, and then Crist appointed him to the Florida Supreme Court. This year he became the first Cuban-American chief justice.) The remaining appointment was Levine, who had worked a variety of government jobs including at the Florida attorney general’s office, a sheriff’s office and most recently as chief operating officer at the North Broward Hospital District. Levine had connections to Rothstein, according to a newspaper article. But what we read isn’t proof that Rothstein was the reason Crist appointed Levine. The Broward New Times reported that Rothstein’s law firm met with Levine about representing the hospital district in September 2008. The article indicated that the district had an agreement with Rothstein’s firm, but a spokeswoman for the district said that there is no record of the firm doing actual work for the district. Levine said he knew Rothstein and had attended Republican fundraisers with him. But he also said they were basically acquaintances. "He claimed to never socialize with Rothstein alone. He said he was ‘insulted’ by the idea that he helped Rothstein's firm get work at the district as a way to curry favor for his judicial appointment," the New Times wrote. PolitiFact Florida interviewed six members who served on the JNC with Rothstein, including Democrats and Republicans, many of whom had donated to Crist. The members said they didn’t see Rothstein do anything to taint the process or even particularly push hard for specific nominees. David Ackerman said that the JNC followed the procedures carefully "to assure checks and balances and to prevent any suggestion of the kind that has been claimed by Mr. Rothstein." Another member, Gordon James, said, "I didn’t find him to have any special influence other than he was on it. He was just incidental. He was there -- he attended." Some members said they wondered at the time why Rothstein was named to the JNC. Rothstein wasn’t known for courthouse victories but simply for his recent wealth. A couple members recalled Rothstein mentioning Crist, though not in the context of selecting judges. Gerald Richman said he recalled at one meeting Rothstein said he might be able to talk to Crist’s office. Richman couldn’t recall the exact nature of the procedural issue but said it might have related to how many names they should forward to Crist’s office when they had more than one vacancy to fill. Rothstein "never said anything about any particular candidate -- he didn’t seem to be overly Democratic or Republican," Richman said. Greg Barnhart recalled Rothstein showing up with a driver in a fancy car and wearing breast pocket hankies that stood out 4 or 5 inches. "He was almost a caricature of somebody trying to be a big shot. I do remember we did not take him seriously, but we tried to be polite," Barnhart said. Donald Beuttenmuller said he recalled Rothstein talking about Crist with respect to fundraisers, but not about judicial appointments. "You would think they were bosom buddies, but he talked that way about everything.....That Rothstein had a big ego -- that was clear. That’s about all I can say. There was nothing that he talked about that he wasn’t superior at in his own mind. But all this later stuff, it did not happen at the JNC." Rothstein’s donations to Crist and state GOP In addition to the four judges that Crist appointed related to Rothstein’s JNC, Crist also appointed about nine Broward judges between 2007 and Rothstein’s downfall in November 2009. The timing of some of the Broward appointments occurred around the same time as some of Rothstein’s donations to the Republican Party of Florida. We can see why the timing after the scandal broke raised questions about whether there was a link, but we found no evidence to prove that Rothstein made the donations because Crist promised to appoint certain judges at his request. For example, Rothstein's law firm gave $52,000 to the state GOP on July 28, 2008, the same day that Crist appointed Jay Hurley to the Broward bench. A day later Rothstein's firm donated another $25,000 to the party. But Hurley, a former prosecutor, already had a connection to Crist unrelated to Rothstein: They were members of the same fraternity at Florida State University, though Hurley told the Sun-Sentinel that they weren’t there at the same time. "The governor didn't invite me to his wedding. I don't know him that well. ... I stand on my resume," Hurley said. (Hurley lost a judicial race and later sought an appointment about six times before Crist appointed him, the Sun-Sentinel wrote.) Hurley told the Tampa Bay Times in 2006 about giving Crist a $500 contribution: "You kind of feel obligated, but in a good way. He's a member of the fraternity. There's a lot of camaraderie there." When he ran for election in 2009, Hurley got a $500 donation from a lawyer at Rothstein’s firm. Hurley was one of several judges Crist appointed to the Broward bench. In January 2009, Crist appointed Carlos Rodriguez, who had worked as a public defender and in private practice, and General Magistrate Barbara McCarthy to the Broward bench. Two days earlier Rothstein and his firm gave about $100,000 to the RPOF. At the time, the lack of the diversity of Broward’s judges received frequent media attention and Crist was urged to appoint a minority. Rodriguez was a native of Cuba and a former public defender. McCarthy was a former social worker and special-needs teacher and had worked as a general magistrate. McCarthy had connections to Rothstein’s law firm but we didn’t find proof that Rothstein’s influence led Crist to appoint her to the bench. She was married to long-time Broward Judge Arthur Birken -- his son Shawn Birken worked for Rothstein’s firm but was among employees not charged with any wrongdoing. In 2009 as she faced an election, McCarthy’s first campaign treasurer was Rothstein law partner Stuart Rosenfeldt. After the scandal broke, she replaced Rosenfeldt and returned donations from him and a few other Rothstein lawyers. Rosenfeldt later pled guilty for his role, which included illegal campaign donations. Rothstein gave big bucks to Crist and his Republican Party News reports at the time put Rothstein-related political donations between $2 million and $3 million including more than $500,000 in donations to the state Republican party and $200,000 to the Florida Democratic Party. The donations helped fuel Crist’s campaigns and his party, but we found no documented proof that Crist agreed to follow Rothstein’s personal advice on which judges to appoint in exchange for those donations. Rothstein and others associated with his firm gave Crist about $81,000 for his U.S. Senate race in 2010, according to media reports at the time. Rothstein threw fundraisers for Crist, and for the governor’s 52nd birthday in 2008, he donated $52,000 to have his name prominently displayed on Crist’s birthday cake. As Crist gave a speech, Rothstein was talking loudly. "Scott, if you want the mic, it's going to cost you another $100,000!" Crist joked. After Rothstein faced charges, several politicians and political groups gave at least a portion of the money back, including Crist from his Senate bid. (Donations related to some earlier races had long since been spent.) Crist’s response We asked a Crist campaign spokesman whether Rothstein and Crist discussed judicial appointments. "Charlie Crist made his own decisions about appointing judges," Crist campaign spokesman Brendan Gilfillan said. "When the JNCs submitted a list, he selected judges based on their resume, their experience, and their understanding of the law. Period." When Crist was asked by a reporter about the ad attacking him for his Rothstein connection, Crist didn’t address the specific allegations but simply dismissed it as "desperate." Crist counterpunched in his own ad attacking his likely opponent Republican Gov. Rick Scott. "Now," the Crist ad says of Scott, "he's teamed up with a felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme to smear Charlie Crist with false attacks." There is no evidence Scott and Rothstein have "teamed up" -- that’s simply a reference to the Republicans using the Rothstein scandal to attack Crist. In February, former state Sen. Dan Gelber who is supporting Crist’s campaign characterized Rothstein as the "Hannibal Lecter of liars." "He's the most-accomplished liar in South Florida history, which is an incredible feat if you consider all of the scamsters around here," said Gelber, an attorney who successfully defended a client from what he said were false Rothstein claims in another case. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida ad said that Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein "gave hundreds of thousands of campaign cash to control Crist’s appointments of key state judges." Rothstein and his firm spent huge sums donating to the Republican Party of Florida back when Crist was a Republican, and they also gave directly to Crist’s campaigns. Crist appointed Rothstein to serve on a commission that recommended appeals judges, but in his official capacity he was only one of nine votes. Rothstein boasted in court testimony that in exchange for donations he was able to dictate judicial appointments. But nobody who served with Rothstein remembered him as a strong advocate. It is certainly possible that Rothstein and Crist discussed judicial appointments. We may never have a full accounting of what the two men said to each other. But to say that Rothstein controlled the appointments seems to be an overstatement that lacks evidence. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-10489	"My husband didn't wrap up the nomination until June."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/09/hillary-clinton/he-had-it-wrapped-up-in-march/	Sen. Hillary Clinton is using her husband's journey to the presidency in 1992 as an example of why her presidential race is not over. In a March 24, 2008, interview with the editorial board of the Philadelphia Daily News, she said: "I just think it's a very dynamic process, and all these people haven't voted — most importantly Pennsylvania hasn't voted, so why do people want to shut it down? My husband didn't wrap up the nomination until June . . . — elections are dynamic." Clinton is right that her husband didn't have the delegates needed for the nomination until June 1992. But her claim lacks context that makes the two races an unfair comparison. After losing early contests, Bill Clinton emerged in 1992 to battle former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas and former California Gov. Jerry Brown. Clinton swept the Southern states on Super Tuesday — March 10 compared to Feb. 5 this year — then took Michigan and Illinois on March 17 for a decisive victory. The late March primaries left him with 942 delegates, a commanding lead with more than twice the number of his closest opponent, Tsongas, who suspended his campaign that week. Hillary Clinton is technically right that it wasn't until the June 2 primaries in Ohio, New Jersey, Alabama, California, Montana and New Mexico that Bill Clinton clinched the nomination. Before the night was out, he had surpassed the 2,145 delegates needed. But after March, there was little doubt that he would become the nominee. A similar thing happened this year on the Republican side of the race. Arizona Sen. John McCain claimed front-runner status after winning Florida's primary on Jan. 29, 2008. The following week, his main rival, Mitt Romney, dropped out after Super Tuesday made McCain's lead hard to overcome. That made McCain the presumed nominee, in February. But the race wasn't wrapped up until he passed the 1,191 delegate mark on March 4 with victories in Texas, Ohio, Rhode Island and Vermont. The other difference this election season is that states have front-loaded their primaries to have a bigger say in who becomes president. This year's first test — the Iowa caucus — was Jan. 3, 2008. In 1992, it was Feb. 10. The first primary in 1992 was Feb. 18, when New Hampshire chose Tsongas. By that date this year, voters in 22 states and the District of Columbia had already cast ballots in primary elections. All of which makes it even more surprising that the 2008 Democratic race is stretching into summer. Clinton is trying to argue that past primary races have been competitive for as long as this one. But more recent elections have had clear early leaders. Sen. John Kerry secured the Democratic nomination by early March 2004. In 2000, both George W. Bush and Al Gore had wrapped up their parties' nominations by mid March. So while Clinton is right that her husband's nomination process stretched until June, she doesn't account for his insurmountable lead long before then and the vast difference in election schedules when she makes her comparison. We rule her statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02623	"We’ve had the private sector more than double the investment that was made by the public sector" at Quonset Business Park.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jan/22/steven-king/steven-king-director-ris-quonset-business-park-say/	From before World War II until just after the Vietnam War, Quonset Point, in North Kingstown, was a bustling U.S. Navy base, a massive complex of buildings and docks where aircraft and ships could be rebuilt and repaired and their crews trained. Since the Navy closed the base in 1974, the state and federal governments have been financing an array of improvements and cleanups to convert it to civilian, commercial use. That ongoing real estate redeployment is overseen by the Quonset Development Corporation, a quasi-public state agency. Steven J. King, the corporation’s managing director, was on WPRI’s "Newsmakers" show Jan. 5 touting the progress he said had been made at Quonset. During the interview, WPRI’s Tim White noted that the federal and Rhode Island state governments had spent more than $600 million on improvements to the property. White asked how King how he’d explain that generosity to taxpayers who might think "that’s a lot of taxpayer money that went, essentially, to the private sector." King balked at White’s description of the money the federal and state governments spent rehabilitating the site as a private industry handout. He said private businesses put their own money in, too. "We’ve had the private sector more than double the investment that was made by the public sector on the property," he said. According to the Quonset Development Corporation, $666.4 million in federal and state government money has been spent since 1974 on the 3,207-acre park: $460.3 million from the federal government and $206.1 million from the state. Nearly half went to transportation improvements: $160 million for upgrading freight rail lines and $159 million to improve state Route 403 and its access to state Route 4. Hazardous waste cleanups, which are ongoing on some parcels, cost $100 million. So, if state and federal investment comes to $666.4 million, for King to be right the private sector would have to have contributed $1.3 billion. Do the locals measure up? Quonset Business Park’s 170-plus tenants cover a range of businesses from warehouses for Ocean State Job Lot and Sally Beauty Supply to high-technology manufacturers Toray Plastics and submarine builder Electric Boat, a division of General Dynamics Corp. Quonset spokesman David Preston said the corporation doesn’t have precise figures on all private investment because some tenants chose to keep confidential how much they’ve spent on their facilities. But we checked with some of the bigger tenants. Electric Boat employs 2,767 people at its 140-acre plus complex, where workers build submarine sections, called "supermodules," which are then shipped to either Groton, Conn., or Newport News, Va., to be welded together to form a new submarine. Since it opened its Quonset factory in 1974, EB spokesman Robert A. Hamilton said the company has spent about $900 million on its facilities. Last week, Jeffrey S. Geiger, the new president of General Dynamics/Electric Boat, announced the company plans to invest $150 million more there over the next four years. Toray Plastics America Inc. is the next biggest firm in the park, occupying about 70 acres and employing approximately 680 people. The firm makes extremely thin plastic films for use in manufacturing. In July 2010, Shigeru Osada, Toray America’s senior vice president for engineering and maintenance, appeared before the state Public Utilities Commission and said that as of that date, the company had invested $750 million in its facilities at Quonset. Toray vice president for human resources Lisa Ahart said last week that number was still valid. They aren’t alone. Besides high-technology firms like Toray and EB, the Quonset has attracted business like All American Foods Inc., which supplies meat, fish and produce to supermarkets throughout the region. All American vice president Steven Savastano said the company has had a warehouse operation there for about 15 years, and invested more than $6 million in the site. Add Toray’s $750 million to EB’s $900 million and you get $1.65 billion. Our ruling Steven King said private companies have invested twice what taxpayers have spent on developing Quonset Park. With federal and state government putting up $666.4 million, that would be at least $1.3 billion in private investment. Just the two largest tenants combined spent $300 million more than that.

pomt-06401	The departments of Commerce, Education and Energy and the EPA saw their spending increase by between 130 percent and 219 percent between 2008 and 2010.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/28/jeb-hensarling/supercommittee-co-chair-jeb-hensarling-cites-huge-/	Editor’s note: We originally published a ruling on this claim on Oct. 27, 2011, rating it False. After the story came out, Hensarling’s office -- which hadn’t gotten back to us by publication time -- contacted us to provide the data they were working from, and we promised to re-evaluate the claim based on the newly provided data. We’ve rewritten the article below, republishing it Oct. 28, keeping the rating the same. Our original article is archived here. *** During an Oct. 26, 2011, hearing of the congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction -- the "supercommittee" that’s charged with making steep cuts in the federal budget -- the co-chairman, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, offered budgetary statistics designed to show massive spending increases by federal agencies in recent years. Here’s a portion of the back-and-forth between Hensarling and Douglas Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan arm of Congress that analyzes budget and fiscal matters. Hensarling: "Is it not true that the stimulus bill, with interest, amounts to over a $1 trillion of spending, which accounts for a large temporary growth in our discretionary budget?" Elmendorf: "Yes, although, as you know, congressman, only a part of the Recovery Act was about discretionary spending. There were also increases in mandatory spending and reductions in taxes. In total we put it a little over $800 billion, and including interest I think you're right about a trillion. And it did lead to a bulge in discretionary funding and then to … an attenuated bulge in outlays because not all of the money got spent right away." Hensarling: "I don't know if you have at your fingertips numbers with respect to agency growth. I had quoted a few, and now that I look down, apparently the source is your office, so I hope I'm quoting your office correctly." Elmendorf: "I don't have those at hand, congressman, but ... if they're numbers from us, then you can certainly trust those!" (Laughter in the hearing room.) Hensarling: "I can trust them. Well, then I trust that when you add in the stimulus, the Commerce Department has grown 219 percent from '08 to '10, that with the stimulus, EPA has grown 130.8 percent. The Energy Department has grown 170.7 percent with the stimulus. Education has grown 180.6 percent at a time when the economy has actually seen negative economic growth and family paychecks have shrunk." When this exchange got picked up in a Fox News Web article, a reader saw it and asked us whether Hensarling’s numbers were accurate. So we took a look. After we published our original analysis of this comment on Oct. 27, 2011, Hensarling’s staff got back to us, sending the table he was working from as he conducted the exchange with Elmendorf. The table is drawn from CBO data but compiled by the House Budget Committee Republican staff. It shows department-by-department breakdowns of discretionary budget authority between 2008 and 2011. What does "discretionary budget authority" mean? Simply put, it’s the amount of money that Congress, in a given year, has agreed to allow a department to spend -- but it may be spread over multiple years. It’s not the same as actually spending the money in that year. The latter is known as "outlays" -- a distinction that becomes important to our analysis. But to keep things simple, we’ll just look at discretionary budget authority for now. Here’s a stripped-down version of Hensarling’s table; the full version is accessible here. All amounts are rounded and in billions of dollars. Dept. 2008 2009 Stimulus 2010 Base budget growth, ‘08-’10 Total growth incl. stimulus, ‘08-’10 Commerce 6.8 9.3 7.9 13.9 103% 219% Education 57.4 57.7 97.4 63.7 11% 181% Energy 24.1 26.5 38.7 26.6 10% 171% EPA 7.6 7.6 7.2 10.3 36% 131% As Hensarling stated at the hearing, he was adding together the 2010 authority and the stimulus amount to arrive at his percentage increase. And using that method, the numbers do work out. But is it a fair method to use? We have a few problems with it. Hensarling combines several years of stimulus spending into a single year, exaggerating the actual amount of budgetary growth between 2008 and 2010. Lumping all of the budget authority from the stimulus into one year makes the final year of his two-year comparison higher, even if the stimulus money was actually spent over multiple years. This juices the percentage increases he cited at the hearing. As we noted, there’s a difference between a department being granted discretionary budget authority in a given year and actually spending the money in that year. Not only may the agency face logistical hurdles in spending the money, but in some cases the money was never expected, or intended, to be spent during the same year the authority was granted. That’s where the alternate concept of "outlays" comes in. Outlays measure how much money actually goes out the department’s door in a given year. Here are the OMB outlay figures for 2008 to 2010. Commerce: Up 71 percent (compared to Hensarling’s 219 percent) Education: Up 41 percent (compared to Hensarling’s 181 percent) Energy: Up 44 percent (compared to Hensarling’s 171 percent) EPA: Up 39 percent (compared to Hensarling’s 131 percent) It’s clear that for every department cited, Hensarling’s percentage increase is three to four times higher than what the figure would be for actual outlays. Even if you consider both methodologies to be equally valid -- which we’re not convinced of -- Hensarling has essentially cherry-picked a much higher figure for the percentage increase that doesn't represent real spending. Also, to be strictly accurate, the budget authority from the stimulus should have been assigned to the year the bill passed -- 2009 -- which would have lowered his numbers, not 2010, as Hensarling has chosen to do. The fluid nature of how stimulus monies began flowing make this issue somewhat complicated, but choosing to add it to 2010 is one additional factor that jacks up the amount of spending in the latter year of Hensarling’s comparison. Hensarling leaves out that stimulus spending was always supposed to be temporary. Hensarling is guilty of cherry-picking for another reason: The stimulus was designed to be temporary. Someone hearing Hensarling’s figures might assume that the large increases he cited would continue into the future, when in fact departmental budgets were designed to return to a more historically "normal" level by 2011 and beyond. This becomes apparent from the column in Hensarling’s own chart titled "base budget growth, 2008-2010." "Base budget growth" is the amount of growth to the department’s budget minus the stimulus. Its pattern is closer to the department’s long-term spending arc. These numbers, while rising, are much more modest than the figures Hensarling cites -- an 11 percent increase for Education, a 10 percent increase for Energy and a 35 percent increase for EPA. (Commerce’s figure was significantly higher, but we’ll explain why in a moment.) To be fair, focusing on base budget growth when there’s an elephant in the room -- the stimulus -- isn’t appropriate either. But we think the most accurate way to chart the growth in departmental spending is to show separately how much comes from base growth and how much comes from temporary stimulus. Yet Hensarling focused only on a combination of the two -- a much more dramatic number. "It is a little disingenuous to infer the stimulus bulge as the baseline increase in agency budgets," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending. Ellis added that he’s heard Democrats doing the opposite. "You often find Democrats complaining about draconian cuts from 2009 to 2011, using the same bulge in the other direction," he said. The Commerce Department figures are skewed by a different temporary bump -- from the 2010 Census. Every 10 years, the Commerce Department undertakes a national census. As a result, spending by the department in any year divisible by 10 is much higher than it is for the rest of the decade. That skews the Commerce Department number for 2010 -- the final year of the time frame Hensarling cited, thus contributing to Commerce’s supposed chart-topping increase of 219 percent. Aides speaking for Hensarling acknowledged the Census bump. They also addressed the other two concerns we listed above. On why they used budget authority rather than outlays -- effectively lumping all stimulus spending into 2010 even if the money was spent in a different year -- Jonathan Burks, policy director at the House Budget Committee, said that Hensarling was speaking as a member of Congress, and Congress can only control how much budget authority is granted, not how fast departments ultimately spend the money they are permitted to spend. As for why Hensarling used the stimulus-enhanced numbers for the 2010 figure, Burks acknowledged that "you can look at the numbers a lot of different ways, but the fair way to do it is to look at the amount of budgetary resources available to agencies during the first two years of Democratic control" of Congress and the White House. He also expressed skepticism about how temporary the stimulus will ultimately prove to be. He said that the White House may have sold the stimulus as a temporary measure, but it’s now coming back with an American Jobs Act that looks a lot like a stimulus bill. Our ruling We understand the arguments behind Hensarling’s methodological choices, but we still believe the path he chose cherry-picked the highest possible increase that the numbers would allow -- one several times higher than other ways to measure the same figure. He lumped all stimulus spending into a single year, even though the spending was spread over several years. The year he chose to assign the stimulus spending to -- 2010 -- was not even the year the budget authority had been granted. And he obscured the fact that much of the enormous increases he cited stemmed from temporary factors, whether it’s the stimulus or spending on the decennial Census. We rule this claim False.

pomt-11089	Says Bill Nelson voted for "cuts to Medicare providers" and voted to weaken "Social Security protections" as a U.S. senator.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/jun/15/new-republican-pac/republican-pac-misleads-ad-about-sen-bill-nelsons-/	A new ad portrays Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson as a career politician who doesn’t have the backs of senior citizens. The New Republican PAC, which is backing Gov. Rick Scott in Florida’s closely watched Senate race, released a 30-second ad criticizing Nelson’s voting record in Congress. The ad juxtaposes Nelson’s mugshots from the 1970s to the 2000s with claims about his votes on Medicare and Social Security, two federal programs that largely benefit seniors, at the time. "Politician Bill Nelson continues to run for public office, leaving few footprints behind," a narrator says. "Votes with Hillary Clinton 89 percent of the time. And raises taxes again. Cuts to Medicare providers, weakens Social Security protections." Nelson’s team quickly raised objections, criticizing Scott for having "refused" to expand Medicaid, the federal health care program primarily serving the very poor. "Here's the truth: No one is more committed to protecting Medicare and Social Security than Bill Nelson," said campaign spokeswoman Carlie Waibel. We wanted to get to the bottom of the ad’s claim: Did Nelson vote to cut Medicare providers and weaken Social Security protections? The New Republican PAC cited a few votes Nelson took while in the U.S. Senate, but experts questioned whether the measures really lived up to the consequences the ad described. All in all, these were not votes geared toward making substantive, structural changes to the Social Security and Medicare programs. Crash course on a spending showdown The PAC cited two measures that Nelson supported in 2011 and 2013 affecting Medicare. The 2011 vote was for the Budget Control Act, and the 2013 vote was for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Understanding how those votes can be characterized as "cuts to Medicare providers" requires a lot of context and a little history lesson on the 2011 sequester. Let’s start with Nelson’s vote on the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, spearheaded by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. The budget passed the Senate 64-36, and every Democrat, including Nelson, voted in favor. The legislation averted a government shutdown in January 2014 by funding federal agencies and providing some relief from the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration in 2011. Here’s the relevant background: In the summer of 2011, President Barack Obama and Congress were engaged in a high-stakes standoff over the debt limit. House Republicans insisted on spending cuts before increasing the debt limit. Obama and House Speaker John Boehner tried unsuccessfully to reach a "grand bargain" to put the federal budget on more stable footing. When that failed, they arrived at the much less ambitious Budget Control Act of 2011. That law included about $1.2 trillion in future budget cuts, but it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion via a bipartisan "supercommittee." As further incentive, the law had a threat: If a supercommittee couldn’t agree on a package, or if Congress voted down the supercommittee proposal, a "sequester" — or across-the-board cut — would automatically go into effect, with half coming from defense. Sequestration was enacted when Congress passed the Budget Control Act in August 2011. The 2013 budget extended a 2 percent spending cut to Medicare provider and plan payments. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the 2 percent cut translated to a reduction of $11.1 billion for Medicare providers in fiscal year 2013. "That means that doctors, hospitals, and providers will continue to bill Medicare in the normal way but will be reimbursed at 98 cents on the dollar, as will per-capita premium payments made to health insurance plans on behalf of Medicare participants," the center wrote in its analysis. Medicare cut? Not that simple So that’s a cut, but experts suggested the ad is overplaying it. First, the cut was intended as a short-term bridge to a more permanent solution to spiraling Medicare provider costs. Second, the provision was a stopgap alternative to a much larger cut that would have gone into effect if nothing else was passed, said Stuart Guterman, a senior health care scholar at the Commonwealth Fund, which supports expanding health care access for the poor. The final Medicare physician fee schedule rule called for a 20.1 percent reduction in the fee schedule update for 2014. By passing the legislation cited in the ad, Congress was also able to block the 20.1 percent cut and replace it with a small increase for services provided through March 31, 2014. All in all, Joe Antos, a health policy specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said "Two percent is clearly a minor reduction." The last point we’ll make about both bills is that they were bipartisan and passed by significant margins. And 28 Republicans including Mitch McConnell, who leads the Senate GOP majority that Scott hopes to join, supported the 2011 measure. To push back on this claim, Nelson’s camp said that he opposed cuts to Medicare in 2017 when the November GOP tax plan threatened to make cuts to Social Security (At the time, the CBO predicted the plan could cut $25 billion from Medicare.) They also pointed to legislation he sponsored such as measure to end a Medicare policy that causes seniors to be charged unknowingly with high costs after receiving medical care. Did Nelson vote to ‘weaken’ Social Security protections? The ad hammers Nelson for harming Social Security in the 1980s and again in the 2000s, first with a "cut" and then by weakening its protections. We’re focused on his Senate actions for this fact-check, but we’ll explain his 1983 vote below. To support its claim, the pro-Scott group cited two votes Nelson took in 2006 and 2007. It’s misleading to characterize those as votes in favor of "weakening Social Security protections." The votes involved essentially the same measure and were introduced by the same lawmaker, then-Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C. DeMint’s amendments aimed to create a reserve fund for Social Security. So, the vote wasn’t explicitly looking to weaken Social Security protections. By voting against it, Nelson opposed adding something to the existing program. The amendment failed both times, with Nelson and every other Democrat voting against the measures. According to the Democrats who voted against it, the amendment was a step toward Social Security privatization, which critics argued would worsen solvency, not strengthen it. Supporters of the amendment, including DeMint, argued that setting up a reserve fund would stop Congress from borrowing money from the Social Security Trust Fund. Andrew Biggs, a Social Security policy specialist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called the claim about Nelson "iffy." "The DeMint proposal was a stalking horse for personal accounts, in the sense of setting aside money that DeMint and others would have wished to be invested in personal accounts," Biggs said. "It’s not unreasonable that someone who opposed Social Security personal accounts, as Sen. Nelson did, wouldn’t favor (those) amendments." So Nelson could counter-argue that his vote instead served to keep privatization at bay. In addition, in 2015, Nelson cosponsored legislation to boost Social Security and other critical benefits for seniors and more recently, he filed legislation to waive the 30-day requirement with respect for Social Security to ensure that residents of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands affected by hurricanes would have immediate access to Social Security benefits. He also was endorsed by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare in April. "Sen. Nelson has been a staunch advocate of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid since taking office in 2001," they wrote. "His voting record on these issues has consistently earned him a 100 percent rating from the National Committee. Social Security time machine The pro-Scott PAC reaches into the early years of Nelson’s time in Washington as further evidence that he made "cuts" to Social Security. In 1983, Nelson voted for the Social Security amendments, which were passed by bipartisan majorities and signed into law by Republican Ronald Reagan. Before the amendments passed, actuaries warned that Social Security payments would be unable to continue paying benefits in July 1983 unless Congress acted. The law raised payroll taxes, taxed Social Security benefits for some higher earners and gradually increased the full retirement age. Our ruling The New Republican PAC ad said that Nelson voted for "cuts to Medicare providers" and voted to "weaken Social Security protections" as a senator in the 2000s. This claim is misleading. The votes neither weakened Social Security nor eroded the position of Medicare providers, experts said. The budget act in 2013 actually prevented a larger cut to Medicare providers, and the Social Security votes in the 2000s can just as easily be portrayed as a "stalking horse" for personal accounts. In addition, the ad ignores other actions Nelson has taken to protect Medicare and Social Security. We rate this Mostly False.

pomt-12418	There is no ‘backlog’ of untested rape kits in Wisconsin.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/19/brad-schimel/brad-schimel-falsely-claims-there-no-backlog-untes/	Thousands of rape kits collected in Wisconsin in recent decades are now scheduled to be tested as officials seek to identify serial rapists or find leads on unsolved crimes. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel has agreed the work needs to be done, but he has repeatedly contested the description in news reports that the untested kits comprise a "backlog." He argues the term unfairly casts his agency in a negative light. "I do disagree with the term backlog because the Wisconsin crime lab is up to date with all current, pending investigations," Schimel said April 9, 2017 on Up Front with Mike Gousha. "It’s not a backlog. These are things no one ever asked the state crime lab to test." Is Schimel — a Republican who is up for reelection in 2018 — right to claim the untested kits are not a "backlog"? The background Rape kits have accumulated over decades in police evidence rooms and hospital storage areas — both in Wisconsin and nationwide. A July 2015 USA TODAY Network investigation revealed that 70,000 rape kits were untested nationally. In Wisconsin, the figure was about 6,000. They include cases where victims choose not to pursue charges, defendants confessed or the issue was consent rather than identity, Schimel said in the Up Front interview. But, he said, authorities have realized in recent years the value in going back and testing those cases, since sex offenders typically have more than one victim. "If you test that DNA, you might link that defendant to another unsolved case out there," Schimel said. "So we’ve recognized the need to go back and look at these, but it’s not a backlog." The state Justice Department determined 3,800 of the untested kits would be tested, though only if the rape survivor consents. But the process hasn’t moved quickly. In September 2015, the department received a $4 million grant to begin testing, but it didn’t have the capacity to handle that volume in house. Instead, the private lab Bode Cellmark Forensics was hired to run the tests. The lab can process about 200 kits per month, said department spokesman Johnny Koremenos. But it will take about two years to test all the kits, based on figures DOJ provided. About 800 kits have been sent to Bode so far, and the testing process can take as long as six months for a single kit. In February 2017, Schimel said "a few hundred" kits had been tested, but his office acknowledged days later that only nine had been completed. Koremenos said as of early May the state crime lab had completed testing on 13 kits, and Bode Cellmark had completed 50, though DOJ was awaiting the "formal results." Backlogs have been an issue at DOJ before. The crime lab it oversees fell far behind as DNA testing exploded in frequency in the mid-2000s, with 1,800 cases on crime lab shelves awaiting testing in 2007 when Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen took office. He hired 31 additional analysts and declared in 2010 that the backlog had been eliminated. Schimel has emphasized the state crime lab has kept up with testing new sexual assault evidence under his watch and rape kits didn’t become viewed as uncompleted work until state authorities shifted their perspective of it recently. Schimel disagreeing with himself Schimel’s claim that the word "backlog" is inaccurate runs into trouble when compared with, well, his own past statements. A May 2015 letter from Schimel accompanying a federal grant application referred to "the state’s backlog of unsubmitted sexual assault kits." An identically worded letter seeking a similar grant in April 2016 used the phrase again, though the letter was signed that time by Bonnie Cyganek, a DOJ administrator. That word choice is in line with the definitions used by popular dictionaries. Oxford says backlog describes "an accumulation of uncompleted work or matters needing to be dealt with," and Merriam-Webster says it is "an accumulation of tasks unperformed or materials not processed." Dictionary.com uses the definition of "a reserve or accumulation, as of stock, work, or business." It says the word originally described a large log placed at the back of a fire in the late 1600s and evolved over the next two centuries to figuratively mean "something stored up for later use." Now, however, Schimel and his spokesman are saying that word is not appropriate. Koremenos said the term implies DOJ is to blame for the untested rape kits when "this is not a DOJ shortcoming." Our rating Schimel says it is wrong to describe the untested rape kits as a "backlog," arguing it implies blame on the department under his watch. But the definition of the term does not involve how or when a backlog began. The department has decided that the work should be done — a process that began slowly and is on pace to stretch out for up to two years, based on the current capacity and pace. That’s a large accumulation of uncompleted work. And that’s the definition of a backlog. The fact that Schimel himself previously used the term makes his claim not only wrong but ridiculous.

Mr Bandt did not receive enough first preference votes at the 2013 election to be elected "in his own right" without preferences, and he relied on minor party, independent and Liberal Party preferences to be elected. While the Liberal Party how to vote card preferenced Mr Bandt last, a third of Liberal voters disregarded this and preferenced Mr Bandt ahead of the Labor candidate. There were 53 electorates, or roughly one-third of all electorates, at the 2013 election in which the candidate won on the primary vote alone, meaning that roughly two-thirds of seats were decided on preferences, as Mr Bandt's was. But experts say that the proportion of preferences that Mr Bandt relied on was small relative to his primary vote and that he was the clear winner of the seat. By contrast, there were 15 seats, or 10 per cent of electorates, which returned results which elected a different candidate to the primary vote winner, such as the rural Victorian seat of Indi.

pomt-07827	Under the White House’s budget proposal, "we will not be adding more to the national debt" by the middle of the decade.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-white-house-budget-would-not-add/	During a Feb. 15, 2011, press conference, President Barack Obama responded to a question from Ben Feller of the Associated Press about the president’s fiscal year 2012 budget, which had been released one day earlier. Obama said, "What my budget does is to put forward some tough choices, some significant spending cuts so that by the middle of this decade our annual spending will match our annual revenues. We will not be adding more to the national debt. It's -- so, to use a -- sort of, an analogy that families are familiar with, we're not going to be running up the credit card anymore." It wasn’t the first time the administration had made the argument that the U.S. would "not be adding more to the national debt" within a few years if the budget were enacted. On Feb. 13, 2011, Jack Lew, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, appeared on CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley and said, "Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spending money that we have each year, and then we can work on bringing down our national debt." Would the president’s budget really mean that within a couple years, the U.S. will "not be adding more to the national debt"? First, a bit of background about the budget. Every year in early February, the president releases a budget with detailed proposals for federal spending, laid out department by department and program by program. It is not a binding document. Rather, it is traditionally the opening proposal in the annual fight over federal spending, with Congress ultimately charged with passing spending bills that the president is asked to sign. The administration’s budget document includes 10 years of future projections for federal outlays, revenues, deficits and accumulated debt. These are the tables we turned to first. We’ll also remind readers that a deficit occurs when a given year’s worth of revenues is smaller than that same year’s spending. By contrast, the term "debt" refers to the accumulated total of past deficits, minus any surpluses. Over the next 10 years, according to the president’s budget, there will be projected deficits every year. Here’s a rundown: Year Deficit 2010: $1.293 trillion 2011: $1.645 trillion 2012: $1.101 trillion 2013: $768 billion 2014: $645 billion 2015: $607 billion 2016: $649 billion 2017: $627 billion 2018: $619 billion 2019: $681 billion 2020: $735 billion 2021: $774 billion So, with deficits every year for the next 10 -- and no surpluses -- the nation’s accumulated debt will rise every year for the next decade. Here’s the rundown by year of the projections for publicly held debt every year: Year Public debt 2010: $9.019 trillion 2011: $10.856 trillion 2012: $11.881 trillion 2013: $12,784 trillion 2014: $13,562 trillion 2015: $14.301 trillion 2016: $15.064 trillion 2017: $15.795 trillion 2018: $16.513 trillion 2019: $17.284 trillion 2020: $18.103 trillion 2021: $18.967 trillion These numbers show that the publicly held debt rises each year. Two other measures of debt also go up every year from 2011 to 2021 -- gross federal debt (which includes public debt plus debt held by other parts of the government) and public debt adjusted for financial assets held by the government. So the contention that "we will not be adding more to the national debt" after the middle of the decade seems incorrect on its face. So what is the administration thinking? The president gave a pretty good idea of his thought process during the press conference. Obama responded in a follow-up question by Chip Reid of CBS News by saying, "We still have all this accumulated debt as a consequence of the recession and as a consequence of a series of decisions that were made over the last decade. We've piled up -- we've racked up a whole bunch of debt. And there's a lot of interest on that debt. So in the same way that if you've got a credit card and you've got a big balance, you may not be adding to principal; you've still got all that interest that you've got to pay. Well, we've got a big problem in terms of accumulated interest that we're paying and that's why we're going to have to whittle down further the debt that's already been accumulated." In other words, Obama argued that new outlays stemming from his fiscal 2012 budget plan -- discretionary spending, military-related spending and entitlements -- wouldn’t be adding to the debt. Only interest payments stemming from past budgets would be adding to the debt. First, we checked to see if he was right. Here’s a rundown of the net interest totals for each of the 10 years. (Net interest is interest paid to the government minus interest paid out by the government.) Year Net interest 2010: $196 billion 2011: $207 billion 2012: $242 billion 2013: $321 billion 2014: $418 billion 2015: $494 billion 2016: $562 billion 2017: $627 billion 2018: $685 billion 2019: $741 billion 2020: $793 billion 2021: $844 billion If you compare these totals to the projected annual deficits, the net interest begins to match or exceed the size of the deficit in 2017. The two numbers are exactly equal in 2017. Then, net interest begins to exceed the deficit by $66 billion in 2018, by $60 billion in 2019, $58 billion in 2020 and $70 billion in 2021. The president has a point that current spending -- exclusive of net interest -- won’t be adding to the debt beginning in 2017, as it has for more than a decade. It is a little like getting to the point where you are covering monthly expenses with your income, rather than putting them on your credit card. But to extend the analogy, this ignores the big credit card debt hanging over you. That debt isn’t shrinking. In fact, the longer you take to pay down that debt, additional interest costs accrue, and the debt grows. "This is what public finance economists refer to as ‘primary spending’ or ‘primary balance,’" said Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute. "But the White House is using these technical concepts in a very misleading way. Very misleading." If the president can somehow work with Congress to get his budget enacted, he’d have reason to boast that his plan would make annual spending -- minus interest -- equal annual revenues for the first time in years in 2017. That would be an accomplishment, but it doesn't equal "not adding to the debt anymore." Because of interest costs -- which amount to $884 billion in 2021 alone -- the debt is projected to grow during every year of the president’s budget. (It's also a bit of an exaggeration to call 2017 "the middle of this decade.") We think the president’s statement is likely to mislead a lot of Americans about what his budget would do. So we rate Obama’s statement False. UPDATE: Shortly after we posted this article, the White House responded to an earlier request for comment, arguing that Obama was not referring to actual dollars but to the fact that the budget will not increase the debt as a share of the economy. While it’s true that the debt as a proportion of GDP – at least when adjusted for financial assets held by the government – would fall slightly between 2013 and 2017 (from 67.7 percent to 66.8 percent), that's not the explanation Obama gave in the news conference.

pomt-03808	"Do you know that, statistically, when you take the SAT a second time, one third of the people that take the SAT, even if they've been studying, will get a lower score than they did the first time around?"	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/mar/24/larry-valencia/larry-valencia-says-third-s/	There’s a vigorous debate going on in Rhode Island over the state’s decision to require high school students to score highly enough on the New England Common Assessment Program test -- commonly called the NECAP --to qualify for a diploma. Supporters, including state Education Commissioner Deborah Gist, say expecting students to reach at least "partially proficient" in math and English will ensure that they’re qualified to graduate and will push schools to raise expectations of students. But critics say the test, especially the math portion, is too difficult and was never meant to be used to determine whether a student should get a diploma. Showing improvement on the test is one of three graduation requirements, along with completion of coursework and a senior project or portfolio. The Providence Student Union, a group of students who object to using the test that way, recently invited 50 adults, including political figures, to take a sample part of the math test. Sixty percent of the adults failed. One test-taker, state Rep. Larry Valencia, D-Richmond, said in a March 19, 2013, radio interview that he had concerns with the test being tied to graduation. The radio discussion then moved more broadly into standardized testing, including the Scholastic Assessment Test, or SAT, that students around the country take to apply to college. Valencia said, "Do you know that, statistically, when you take the SAT a second time, one third of the people that take the SAT, even if they've been studying, will get a lower score than they did the first time around?" His point is relevant to the debate because NECAP supporters point out that students who don’t do well on the test must take it again and show improvement to qualify for graduation. So we wondered whether Valencia was right that a third -- roughly 33 percent -- of students who take the SAT fare worse on their second try. We asked Valencia for his backup and he e-mailed a link to the College Board web site, which showed these figures about retaking the SAT: 55 percent of juniors improved their scores, 10 percent of juniors got the same scores, and 35 percent -- the key number -- got lower scores. We also checked with the College Board, which administers and devises the SAT, to verify that the information on the website was accurate. The College Board provided updated figures that varied slightly from those on the web site but not enough to change the picture. Sixty-six percent of students saw scores increase, 4 percent saw no change and 30 percent saw a decrease, according to Leslie Sepuka, director of regional communications at the New York offices of the College Board. Both groups of figures are for the 1.66 million SAT takers in the class of 2012. The figures Valencia pointed us to are only for students who specifically took the test in spring of junior year and fall of senior year. The data Sepuka provided are from an analysis of all students in the class who took the SAT more than once. "The important thing to note is that both analyses reflect similar patterns with the majority of students improving their scores and approximately a third of students experiencing a second test score decline," Sepuka said. Changes in scores on the second SAT are typically driven by a specific effect: students who score low the first time are more likely to score higher the second; students who have high scores the first time are statistically more likely to see a drop the second time. "Interestingly, higher scoring students are more likely to retest than lower scoring students, yet when lower-scoring students retest, they tend to experience a larger score gain," Sepuka said. Our ruling State Rep. Larry Valencia, D-Richmond, said, "Do you know that, statistically, when you take the SAT a second time, one third of the people that take the SAT, even if they've been studying, will get a lower score than they did the first time around?" Figures from the College Board confirm that. We give Valencia the highest score on the Truth-O-Meter test: True. (For the record, Valencia reported that he got a 73 percent on the NECAP sample math test portion, which would be a "3," or "proficient," with just 4 of the 50 adults getting a higher score.)

pomt-06788	Says the government wants to require farm tractor drivers to hold commercial driver’s licenses even if they’re just crossing a single public road.	false	/texas/statements/2011/aug/16/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-government-wants-require-commercia/	Stumping for president at an Iowa dinner on Aug. 14, 2011, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said: "Now you tell me whether this is true or not. But one of my fellas just told me, he said that they're talking about a new regulation that if you drive your tractor ... across one public road, you're going to have to have a commercial driver's license. Get out of here! You're kiddin' me. I mean, what are they thinking?" The former cotton farmer and Texas agriculture commissioner sounded more certain by the next morning, saying in remarks excerpted on CNN’s Aug. 15 "Newsroom": "Let me give you just a — this is such an obscene, crazy regulation. They want to make — if you are a tractor driver, if you drive your tractor across a public road, you are going to have to have a commercial driver's license. Now, how idiotic is that?" Attention drawn! We looked into who’s wanting to impose such a mandate and found that such a proposal popped up this year in Illinois. But after the federal government declared last week that it does not plan new rules affecting farm vehicles, the Illinois plans were shelved, according to Guy Tridgell, a spokesman for the Illinois agency. "That issue is null and void," Tridgell told us. Rewind: An Aug. 11, 2011, press release from the U.S. Department of Transportation says the agency’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration reviewed farm-vehicle regulations this year in an effort "to make sure states don't go overboard in enforcing regulations on agricultural operators." At issue, the release says, was whether some states might view tenant farmers as common or contract carriers and as not exempt like other farmers from state commercial driver’s license requirements. The vast majority of about 1,700 public comments the agency received in response "called for us to preserve the guidance that leaves states to carry out the farm exceptions as they have for many years," said the agency’s administrator, Anne Ferro. "We want to make crystal clear that we are not imposing any new regulations." John Porcari, deputy secretary for the federal Transportation Department, told us that Illinois’ move toward requiring tenant farmers to have commercial driver’s licenses, which "defied common sense," touched off the government’s May request for wide public comment. That request, he said, was then widely and erroneously interpreted as a signal the agency was contemplating new transportation mandates for farmers. The result, Porcari said, was "a bit of agricultural legend. Some people said we were attempting to require commercial driver licenses" in situations including a tractor crossing a road. "That wasn’t and isn’t the case," he said. "We are not, repeat not, requiring" them. Why did even the suggestion of regulations cause a stir among farmers? An Aug. 11, 2011, analysis by columnist Ken Root of the (Dodge City, Kan.) High Plains Journal summed up the issue. He noted that farmers have enjoyed exemptions from commercial driver regulations put in place by a 1986 federal act establishing the commercial driver's license to regulate truck drivers nationwide. Change is likely, Root writes: "As more sectors of the transportation industry are required to comply with regulations, farmers are less likely to remain exempt because they are seen as holding an economic advantage over the commercial haulers. "In grain-producing areas, literally all farms of any size have a semi-trailer grain truck," Root’s column says. "They use it to haul to the local elevator or farther away (even across state lines) if the price is higher. They haul for several months each year and get in the dump line with commercial operators yet they don't pay the same registration for their vehicles. That creates animosity and an opening for regulatory agencies to argue that one standard should be imposed on all vehicles and all drivers." Root’s column, published before the federal announcement, says that Illinois is "targeting farmer-owned trucks to gain more revenue. The argument is that one standard should exist for all uses of a vehicle and equivalent fees should be paid." Hours after he made the statement we’re checking here, Perry told the Des Moines Register that he’d based his declaration on information from U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. "Senator Grassley, when I asked him about it last night — I’ve got to go with your senior senator," Perry said. The newspaper said Perry’s staff, "checking their BlackBerrys, said it might be a recent development that federal transportation officials dropped the idea." The newspaper said Grassley, referring to the federal announcement, wrote in an electronic newsletter last week that common sense had appeared to prevail in the matter. Far as we can tell, the regulation questioned by Perry hasn't even been proposed at the federal level. We rate his statement False.

pomt-05585	Last year, "Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/02/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-exxon-pocketed-nearly-/	President Barack Obama, making the case from the Rose Garden that oil companies would be just fine without tax breaks, offered this striking figure: Last year, he said, "Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour." We had to know: Is that true? Here’s the excerpt from the March 29, 2012, speech: "It’s not as if these companies can’t stand on their own. Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits. Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour." Here’s the math: Exxon Mobil Corp. estimates it earned $41 billion in 2011. Divide by 365 days in the year and 24 hours in a day — and that’s $4.67 million. Every hour. Obama has previously struggled with the facts about Exxon’s profit. In 2007, he claimed the company’s profits had never been higher, when that wasn’t true at the time. Last year, Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., was on stronger ground when he declared that "over the past decade, the big five oil companies — BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell — made a total profit of nearly $1 trillion." PolitiFact Virginia rated that Mostly True. This time, Exxon answered the president on its blog, saying "the reality is that statistics such as by-the-hour profits only tell part of the story." "Consider if the president had added the following statistics: ExxonMobil’s taxes were $12.3 million an hour, and it took more than $47 million an hour to run the global business. Those statistics are also accurate and they put the $4.7 million an hour in profits in context." (We should note that we can’t independently verify the company’s tax bill. As we’ve reported before, the actual income tax, for example, paid by Exxon to the U.S. government is confidential information. We have dinged politicians for inaccurately characterizing the company’s taxes.) The company has a point that Obama’s statistic doesn't detail the oil company's expenses. But in this fact-check, we’re focusing just on the claim that, "Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour." As a simple snapshot of Exxon’s 2011 profit, his arithmetic is right on target. We rate the statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-04-02T17:16:50	2012-03-29	['None']

pomt-06028	"I also voted 98 percent of the time with Republicans in the Oregon Legislature."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/14/suzanne-bonamici/bonamici-claims-she-votes-98-percent-time-republic/	In a previous PolitiFact ruling we awarded a Half True to Rob Cornilles for claiming that his opponent, Suzanne Bonamici, voted a partisan 98 percent of the time with Democrats. He was ignoring evidence that many bills in the Legislature are unanimous and noncontroversial. This time, we check Bonamici’s claim, repeated at a televised debate this week, that she voted with Republicans 98 percent of the time while serving in the Oregon Legislature. "Rob keeps using this 98 percent figure that is misleading …" she said about 7-1/2 minutes into the program. "Yes, I voted 98 percent of the time with the majority of Democrats. I also voted 98 percent of the time with Republicans in the Oregon Legislature." We also knew from our previous PolitiFact that the 98 percent figure sounded funky. That’s because when we checked Bonamici’s voting record against that of state Sen. Jackie Winters, a Salem Republican with social services expertise, we found that they voted the same way 89.6 percent of the time in 2011, for an overall average of 83 percent from 2009-11. (During the 2010 special session, she voted with Winters 87 percent of the time and in 2009, 77 percent of the the time.) Nearly 90 percent is not 98 percent. Just to make sure we weren’t overlooking a friendlier Republican, we asked Mark Friesen, The Oregonian’s database expert, to see how often Bonamici voted the same way as Sen. Frank Morse, R-Albany. We picked Morse because he’s considered a Republican moderate. In 2009, Bonamici and Morse voted together on 900 out of 1,123 votes, or just slightly over 80 percent of the time. In 2010’s short session, they voted together on 119 out of 146 votes, or nearly 82 percent of the time. In 2011, they voted together on 822 out of 955 votes, or just over 86 percent of the time. The average over three sessions? Nearly 83 percent, same as with Winters. So not anywhere near 98 percent. (We also checked Bonamici against Sen. Dave Nelson, R-Pendleton. In 2009, they voted the same way on 843 out of 1,123 votes, or 75 percent of the time. In 2010, they voted the same way on 95 out of 146 votes, or 65 percent. In 2011, Bonamici and Nelson voted together on 785 out of 955 votes, or just over 82 percent. The three-session average is 77 percent.) Bonamici’s campaign has long circulated a version of the 98 percent figure: "However, an independent analysis shows that Bonamici voted with the majority of legislators voting on a measure -- both Democrats and Republicans and an indication of the bipartisan nature of the Oregon Legislature -- 98.1 percent of the time." As evidence, the campaign tallied the bills from The Oregonian’s government database and concluded that she voted with the majority of legislators 2,116 times, out of 2,157 votes cast in 2009’s regular session, 2010’s short session and 2011’s regular session. The problem with that analysis is Democrats were in charge all years, with an 18-12 lead in 2009 and 2010, and a 16-14 majority in 2011. Which means Bonamici was able to vote with the majority without any Republican help. In fact, we spotted about 170 such heavily lopsided votes from her campaign’s own database, which means she voted against the Republican caucus at least 8 percent of the time. We took Cornilles to task because it’s not accurate to characterize Bonamici as a button-pushing partisan hack. The members take lots of unanimous votes. They also work on many bipartisan issues. But it’s inaccurate to say that she voted with Republicans 98 percent of the time. The closest she comes is a 90 percent match voting record with Sen. Jackie Winters over one session. We find no evidence of a Republican who has voted with her 98 percent of the time, much less the majority of Republicans. We rule the statement False.

pomt-09103	"In the case of General Motors, the (Bush) administration wrote a check without asking for any conditions of change."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/21/rahm-emanuel/bush-asked-change-general-motors-gave-obama/	A repeated criticism of President Barack Obama's administration is that it has interfered too much with American companies. That criticism came up again in connection with the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, after President Obama successfully got BP to set up a $20 billion fund to compensate people who have lost their livelihoods because of the spill. Jake Tapper, host of ABC News' This Week, asked White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel about the charge when Emanuel appeared on the show on June 20, 2010. "What do you say when you hear criticisms that this administration has used too many strong-arm tactics when it comes to dealing with big business, whether it's in health insurance companies or Wall Street firms or the U.S. auto industry?" Tapper asked. "Well, first of all, it has had a different approach based on the situation," Emanuel said. "In the case of General Motors, the prior administration wrote a check without asking for any conditions of change. We said, without a check from the American people, get yourself right. You've got to make fundamental change. They've made changes and now, as you know, General Motors is going to have an IPO (initial public offering of stock). And most importantly, they're going to keep open factories that they were planning on closing. So we're righting an industry that was not doing itself, or the American people or its workers, the right thing. So it was a way of getting them to do the changes that they had postponed." (Read Emanuel's complete response on the This Week website or watch it via video.) Readers messaged us via Twitter that Emanuel was wrong about how the Bush administration handled the auto companies, pointing us to a blogger who'd already debunked the statement. So we decided to check it out for ourselves. The blogger in this case is Keith Hennessey, a former senior economic adviser to President George W. Bush. Hennessey is also a member of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, whose members were selected jointly by the House and Senate Majority and Minority leadership. Hennessey wrote that he started his blog as an experiment: "During my time in the White House, I wrote and edited hundreds of memos and presentations for President Bush. I'd like to do the same now directly for the taxpayer who finances the U.S. government, as well as for students of American economic policy wherever they might be." Hennessey wrote that Emanuel was wrong that the Bush administration "wrote a check without asking for any conditions of change," laying out a detailed case that the Bush administration did put conditions on loans to the auto industry that went down in 2008. Hennessey even contends that Bush officials tried to get the Obama team to agree to a joint plan -- he describes in detail a meeting between the two sides that happened on Nov. 30, 2008 -- to give the auto companies loans and prevent immediate bankruptcies. The teams never reached any public agreement. A few weeks later, Bush's negotiations with Congress over the matter broke down, and the administration decided to go ahead, using money the Treasury Department already had authorization to use through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Hennessey pointed his readers to Treasury Department documents released Dec. 19, 2008, that outlined conditions for the $13.4 billion in loans it was offering General Motors and Chrysler. The documents show, and press reports from the time confirm, that the Bush administration did put specific requirements on the auto companies that included paying down debt, limits on executive compensation, and negotiated reductions in wages and benefits for autoworkers. It also required the companies to submit detailed restructuring plans by Feb. 17, 2009, that would show how the company planned to achieve and sustain "long-term viability, international competitiveness and energy efficiency." The requirements did have one clause that some critics of the plan said meant the details were nonbinding. The agreement said that the companies had to file additional reports by March 31, 2009, identifying any deviations from the requirements and explaining "why such deviations do not jeopardize the borrower's long-term viability." If the president's designee didn't approve the explanations, the loan would be have to be paid back within 30 days. Still, coverage from the time indicates the auto companies thought the Bush administration's demands were plenty tough. The Detroit Free Press wrote that the loan agreements "not only call for deep concessions outlined in wide-ranging plans due by mid-February, but also start a ticking bomb that could explode in Detroit's face unless dramatic change is on the way." The Wall Street Journal reported the loans were "just the first step in what could be a long and painful revamping of the three Detroit companies during a recession." And in a 2009 eight-part series looking back at the auto industry's turmoil, the Free Press again described the requirements as rigorous: "The deal set tough targets for the two companies -- a two-thirds cut in debt, a 50% reduction in payments to health care funds for UAW retirees and proof of net positive value by March 31. It also came with a threat: Should the automakers fall short, the loans would be called back immediately and bankruptcy would follow." We want to emphasize that the loan agreements happened after President Obama was elected, but before he took office. At the time, Obama called the loans "necessary steps ... to help avoid a collapse of our auto industry." The March 31 deadline for the auto companies gave Obama about two months in office in which to make his own decisions about the companies. Hennessey called the decision to give the auto companies loans "the least worst of two bad options." "Based both on his public comments and what I saw privately, President Bush wanted to give the firms a limited amount of time and a hard back end to prepare for and, if necessary, to force an orderly Chapter 11 process," Hennessey wrote. "He also knew that President-elect Obama would be facing tremendous challenges in his first days in office. Despite their different political parties and policy perspectives, President Bush stressed that we needed to provide his successor with the time and space he would need in the opening weeks of his Presidency." The Obama administration continued loaning GM money that wasn't repaid until April 2010, and the government still owns a majority of GM stock in connection with the company's June 2009 bankruptcy. Emanuel's statement -- "In the case of General Motors, the (Bush) administration wrote a check without asking for any conditions of change" -- implies that the Obama administration was tough while the Bush administration just threw money at the problem. Actually, the Bush administration detailed a number of conditions for change at General Motors, and Obama's administration could have recalled the loans soon after taking office if officials felt the auto companies were not compliant. The Treasury Department documents and press reports contradict Emanuel's claim, so we rate his statement False.

pomt-00367	Says Mike DeWine took $40,000 from ECOT and "did nothing while the online for-profit school lied about enrollment and took millions meant for our kids."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2018/sep/12/afscme-people/fact-checking-attack-mike-dewine-about-ecot-online/	A union group says Ohio Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine took campaign donations from an online charter school and ignored that the school was ripping off taxpayers. "For years Attorney General Mike DeWine took campaign contributions from ECOT associates and did nothing while the online for-profit school lied about enrollment and took millions meant for our kids," said the narrator of the TV ad by AFSCME People, the union’s political action fund. The text on the screen listed the amount of $40,000 and stated "CEO of ECOT donated to DeWine campaign." Then the ad goes in for the kill: "It was DeWine’s job to protect us, but instead he chose donors over our kids." The ad is referring to the Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow, an online school known as ECOT, which closed earlier this year after a long-stemming enrollment inflation scandal. DeWine is running for governor against Democrat Richard Cordray. The school’s downfall is a cautionary tale: Public officials ignored multiple newspaper reports and audits throwing up red flags about the school starting back in the early 2000s. Key takeaways • Yes, DeWine took money from ECOT officials, but he later donated the money he received from ECOT's CEO. • AFSCME, the ad’s maker, is largely counting donations that DeWine’s running mate received many years ago. • DeWine did eventually take legal action against ECOT for inflating its enrollment, although he could have done it earlier. • Many parts of state government share blame for what happened. A long list of politicians and state officials waited many years to take action. ECOT’s long trail of problems The Columbus public online school launched in 2000. News reports showed the school had problems with poor record keeping, suspicious attendance reports, and inflated enrollment. State audits showed problems as early as 2001. By 2015, the state began to suspect that some schools were inflating their participation numbers, so it requested student log-in data. That’s when ECOT started to crumble. The department found that the school couldn’t account for many of its students. The state ultimately sought to recoup $80 million. Earlier this year, the school shut down. ECOT donations to DeWine While the school racked up headlines, school founder William Lager and other ECOT officials gave more than $2 million in campaign donations, largely to Republicans. AFSCME pulled its numbers from a donation database compiled by Innovation Ohio, a liberal group, which used data compiled by Follow the Money. In 2015, DeWine received $12,532 from Lager. DeWine later gave the contribution to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Columbus, so AFSCME didn’t count that amount in the total. But AFSCME did include about $3,000 in donations from ECOT lobbyists, board members and an attorney since 2010. Joshua Eck, DeWine’s campaign spokesman, said that those smaller donations include people who worked on behalf of various entities. AFSCME also added in $36,000 from Lager and other ECOT officials to Jon Husted, who is DeWine’s running mate. The donations are largely from 2002 to 2009, when Husted was in the Legislature, before he became the Secretary of State in 2011. Husted joined DeWine’s ticket in December and then turned over his campaign’s $4.6 million to the DeWine-Husted ticket. While AFSCME said that the donations to Husted should be counted in that pot, DeWine’s campaign says those donations are years ago from previous races. While news reports in Ohio have noted that the DeWine-Husted campaign didn’t return the $36,000, it’s impossible to declare whether specific donations in the 2000s were spent or remained years later. "Regular contributions are not connected or assigned to expenditures, so assigning specific contributions to cash on hand in situations with many donors and many expenditures over multiple reporting periods/cycles can't be done with certainty," said Brendan Glavin, data and systems manager for the Campaign Finance Institute. The DeWine campaign notes that Cordray took money from ECOT, too. He received $500 in 2006, when he was running for Ohio treasurer and $100 when he was running for state attorney general. Cordray donated the sum to an educational foundation. Ohio’s AFSCME affiliates have endorsed Cordray. Could DeWine have acted earlier? DeWine has defended his actions related to ECOT. "We have been very aggressive on this and we have moved when we legally could move," DeWine said earlier this summer. Dan Tierney, a DeWine office spokesman, said said the role of the attorney general is generally limited to pursuing the recovery of misspent funds by closed schools. The Department of Education is responsible for ensuring schools are following the law, he said. But it is the attorney general’s responsibility to defend the education department. When ECOT sued the education department in July 2016, DeWine hired outside counsel, Doug Cole. In August 2018, the Ohio Supreme Court sided with the education department’s requirement that ECOT show student log-in data. Separately, DeWine pursued another legal avenue. In 2018 when ECOT closed, DeWine sought permission from a court to handle the recovery claims and filed litigation in August to recover money related to ECOT. Tierney has pointed to a court ruling in March related to a separate charter school that upheld the authority for the attorney general to pursue claims related to corrupt practices to recover money. DeWine’s critics have said he didn’t have to wait for that ruling, or action by other officials, to try to establish precedent. DeWine’s lawsuit said that Lager violated the Ohio Corrupt Practices Act by acting as an agent of ECOT while also signing contracts between the school and his companies. "This corrupt relationship was there, it has been there his entire term (since 2011)," said Stephen Dyer, education expert at Innovation Ohio and a former Democratic state legislator. "Anytime you are the state’s top cop and the largest ripoff of public taxpayer dollars in state history happens under your watch, that’s a problem." Chad Aldis, the vice president for Ohio policy for the Fordham Institute, a school-choice advocate and charter sponsor, said everything changed after the Department of Education probed the school’s attendance in 2016. "Anyone can make the claim that folks should have acted sooner," Aldis told the Dispatch. "But I think it’s easy to see that after we’ve had all this litigation and the wrongdoing is laid bare, it’s harder to do that in real time." Our ruling An AFSCME ad said DeWine took $40,000 from ECOT and "did nothing while the online for profit school lied about enrollment and took millions meant for our kids." DeWine received donations from the school but later donated the bulk of them. The ad puffs up the donations by largely including money donated from ECOT officials to DeWine’s running mate Husted when he was in the Legislature. Husted joined DeWine’s ticket for governor in December and then merged their campaign accounts. It’s an exaggeration to state that DeWine did "nothing" -- but he didn’t take legal action until the education department was sued in 2016. He then filed litigation in August in an effort to recoup money. DeWine argues that he had to wait for other actions by the court or state offices to step in, though critics say he could have been more aggressive. The warning signs about ECOT had been documented in news articles for many years, and yet the state government as a whole was slow to act. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00386	"In Augusta, (Jared) Golden voted to let welfare recipients use your tax dollars to buy tattoos, tobacco, alcohol, even lottery tickets."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/07/congressional-leadership-fund/super-pac-ad-twists-truth-maine-candidates-welfare/	A super PAC’s attack ad in the race for Maine’s 2nd Congressional District claims that Democratic candidate Jared Golden voted for people to purchase tattoos, tobacco, alcohol, lottery tickets with with welfare dollars. "Why isn’t Jared Golden looking out for us?" the ad says. "In Augusta, Golden voted to let welfare recipients use your tax dollars to buy tattoos, tobacco, alcohol, even lottery tickets." The ad comes from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC focused on strengthening and maintaining the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Golden, a state representative, is looking to unseat two-term incumbent Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin in November. Golden claims the ad was is false. Let’s find out. The claim’s origins The super PAC’s claim refers to a state law passed in 2016 that limits people on Maine Temporary Assistance for Needy Families from using Electronic Benefits Transfer cards to purchase a laundry list of items, including tattoos, tobacco, alcohol and lottery tickets. This state law passed Maine’s House of Representatives 206-38 with bipartisan support. Golden was one of the 38 representatives who voted against the bill. He told the Sun Journal he opposes misuse of welfare funds, but the state-level restrictions were unnecessary because federal rules already prohibit using welfare money for items like tattoos, tobacco and alcohol. Golden spokesman Bobby Reynolds said just because Golden voted against that bill, it doesn’t mean he voted in favor of using welfare dollars for controversial purchases. Reynolds said that if the bill failed, Mainers would still be barred from using TANF funds to purchase those items under federal rules. "It was a solution in search of a problem," Reynolds said. "To be clear, Jared Golden opposes the use of SNAP and TANF for such purchases." However, it’s worth noting that Maine’s 2016 law is more restrictive than federal law. The federal Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 requires states to maintain policies and practices to keep EBT cards from being used at liquor stores, casinos or adult-oriented entertainment establishments. The federal law does not restrict transactions at grocery stores that sell alcohol or that have "gaming activities." It also does not regulate how cash that has been withdrawn with an EBT card can be used. Maine's 2016 law also does not address cash withdrawals. "It would be virtually impossible to effectively monitor and implement such a restriction," Schott said. The 2012 federal law also does not mention tattoos or tobacco. Maine’s 2016 law expanded TANF EBT card purchase restrictions to also include tobacco products lotteries, bail, firearms, ammunition, vacation or travel services, tattoos and obscene materials or entertainment. The Poliquin campaign declined our request to comment on the content of the ad, saying the campaign had no control over the ad and no role in its creation. Our ruling The Congressional Leadership Fund claims that Golden voted in favor of welfare recipients using tax dollars to buy tattoos, tobacco, alcohol and lottery tickets. Golden voted against a 2016 bill that limited EBT card purchases, saying federal law already covered the issue. Golden did not vote in favor of a measure that would expand EBT card use to those items. The statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression.

pomt-07145	Protesters "attacked" the group’s headquarters with "graffiti on the sidewalk" and "stenciled images … smeared on the building and statue."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/15/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce/wisconsin-manufacturers-and-commerce-says-proteste/	With the Legislature poised to approve the state’s budget, protests are flaring up once again in Madison. Protesters have set up a tent city dubbed "Walkerville" near the Capitol, and the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the statewide teachers union, has urged its members to return to Madison to rally against Gov. Scott Walker's two-year budget proposal. Administration Secretary Michael Huebsch said security has been tightened at the Capitol in preparation for the crowds. It is a reprise of sorts. In February and March of 2011, tens of thousands of protesters rallied around the Capitol to fight Republican efforts to curtail collective bargaining by public employees. As the week opened, the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business group, issued a news release on Monday, June 13, 2011, saying its headquarters had been vandalized. The building was the site of an already announced protest at noon that day. The release stated: "State budget protesters attacked the headquarters of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce over the weekend with pro-tax-hike graffiti on the sidewalk, and stenciled images of fists and Governor Scott Walker smeared on the building and statue." That came under a headline of "Pro-Tax budget Protesters Vandalize WMC HQ." The subhead: "Graffiti strewn on Building, Sidewalk, Statue." The group filed a report with Madison Police and posted pictures on its website. This is not the first claim related to the nature of the protests, or even related to damage to property. In fact, some of them have left us feeling like insurance adjusters. There was the claim by Huebsch, and Department of Administration officials, that protesters caused $7.5 million damage to the Capitol. We rated it Pants on Fire. (The estimates were quickly revised to be much, much less.) Likewise the claim from state Democrats that officials bolted the windows of the building shut in order to rein in protesters. (The windows were re-secured after sustaining damage.) And the one from Sen. Dan Kapanke (R-La Crosse) that protesters damaged the windshield of his car. (Madison police said it was likely due to a highway pebble.) So what about the latest claim, of the WMC headquarters being attacked by vandals? Let’s start with some definitions of "vandalized": "Deliberately destroy or damage (public or private property)." Dictionary.com "Willful wanton and malicious destruction of the property of others." The Free Dictionary.com "To deliberately destroy or damage (property)." Merrriam-Webster. Similarly, the definitions of the word "attacked" all include an element of violence. After looking into the incident, the Madison police concluded it was no big deal. The message written on the walkways around the building were in chalk, and "mud stenciling" was used for the fists and Walker pictures. "There’s no permanent damage," said department spokesman Howard Payne. The officer who investigated noted that the chalk and stencil material "was flaking off when she touched it," Payne said. If the stenciling had used spray paint or permanent markers, a report would have been filed with the city agency handling graffiti-removal. No report was filed. We asked WMC about their claim. "It’s vandalism," said Jim Pugh, the group’s public relations director. "You can’t come onto private property and paint the building." Pugh, however, acknowledged there was no permanent damage and said a crew was out cleaning the messages off the building and sidewalk that very afternoon. Additionally, the WMC press release was changed on the group’s website after our inquiry. Removed: The subhead about "Graffiti strewn on Building, Sidewalk, Statue." So where does this leave us? With the budget vote coming up and protesters back in Madison, concern about their conduct has returned. When the headquarters of the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce got hit with sidewalk chalk and easily removed stencils, the group labeled it a vandalism attack on its headquarters. That’s over the top and over-heated. And it leaves a distorted impression of what happened. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02217	"In Rhode Island today, 25 percent of our households either don't have a bank account at all, or they have a bank account and they're still relying on high-cost financial services like payday loans, pawn shop check cashing and so on."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/apr/21/seth-magaziner/treasurer-candidate-seth-magaziner-says-1-4-rhode-/	In the race to succeed Gina Raimondo as Rhode Island general treasurer, Democrat Seth Magaziner is saying he can help poorer residents get low-cost banking services. During an April 13 appearance on "10 News Conference," he said he would try to emulate a program in San Francisco, where banks and credit unions have joined with the city to offer low-cost, low frills bank accounts with minimal fees "that don't nickel and dime people." The service is needed, he said, because, "In Rhode Island today, 25 percent of our households either don't have a bank account at all, or they have a bank account and they're still relying on high-cost financial services like payday loans, pawn shop check cashing and so on." That's "the highest percentage in New England," Magaziner said. The issue resonates in Rhode Island because activists have been trying unsuccessfully for years to limit the interest rate charged by payday lenders. Currently, they charge annual rates as high as 280 percent for short-term loans of up to $500. Critics want to limit the rate to 36 percent. We were interested in knowing whether so many Rhode Islanders are using such costly financial services or have no bank account at all. When we contacted Magaziner, his spokesman quickly pointed us to a copy of the 2011 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, the latest version available. The FDIC is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the independent agency of the U.S. government that insures deposits in banks and thrift institutions. The survey is based on responses from nearly 45,000 households. It breaks households into three groups. In the first, nobody has an account at an FDIC-insured institution, a group referred to as "the unbanked." The second is households in which people have a checking or savings bank account but also rely on what the FDIC calls "alternative financial services," which includes non-bank money orders, checking cashing services, pawn shops, payday loans, rent-to-own services and loans granted to people anticipating a tax refund; they are referred to as the "underbanked." The remaining households, in which people do not use alternative services, are characterized as "fully banked." In 2011, according to the survey, 7.0 percent of the state's 423,000 households were unbanked and 17.8 percent were underbanked. Adding the two together gives you 24.8 percent, which rounds up to the 25 percent figure cited by Magaziner. The percentage could actually be a bit higher. The FDIC report says that in 3.4 percent of the households, it could not be determined if alternative services were used. The report found that the percentage of people who were unbanked or underbanked in Rhode Island had grown significantly from 2009, when it was 18.7 percent. Magaziner was also correct when he said the rate is the highest in New England. The next-highest rate is Maine with 22.7 percent. The lowest rate: New Hampshire at 14.4 percent. The national average was 28.3 percent. Seven states -- Arkansas, Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada and Georgia -- had rates higher than 38 percent. Looking at the people who did not have a bank account, about 33 percent said it was because they didn't have enough money, and another 20 percent or so said they didn't want or need an account. Among consumers who had once had an account, 7 percent said they gave it up because the fees or minimum balance requirements were too high. Our ruling Seth Magaziner said, "In Rhode Island today, 25 percent of our households either don't have a bank account at all, or they have a bank account and they're still relying on high-cost financial services like payday loans, pawn shop check cashing and so on." He is accurately reporting the results of the FDIC's 2011 survey, the most recent available. Because this is a claim you can take to the bank -- if you have one -- we rate it as True.

pomt-10037	The omnibus spending bill has "9,427 pork barrel items."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/25/john-mccain/mccain-says-omnibus-bill-packed-earmarks-and-pork/	Despite all the talk during the campaign about cutting earmarks, Congress is still packing them into appropriations bills. Case in point: the big appropriations bill for 2009 that never got passed last fall and is now before Congress. It's an amalgamation of nine spending bills known on Capitol Hill as the Omnibus. Members of Congress have talked a lot about cutting earmarks, the provisions that specify money for pet projects, but you wouldn't know it by looking at the Omnibus. On CNN's American Morning on Feb. 25, Sen. John McCain complained that the bill was packed with them. "On the floor tomorrow or the next day of the Senate will be a bill with 9,427 pork barrel items," McCain said, noting that one provision would provide $2 million to promote astronomy in Hawaii. Other Republicans have made similar claims. "There are nine appropriations bills that [Democrats] are going to wrap together that are $30 billion over budget in a bill that contains 9,000 earmarks. This is absolutely crazy," Rep. John Boehner, the House Majority Leader, said in a Web video . We wondered if their numbers were right. We should start by noting that there are differences in how groups define an earmark, something we explained when we checked the White House claim that there were none in the economic stimulus package. The House, Senate and the executive branch have different definitions, while we prefer the one in Safire's Political Dictionary that defines an earmark as money "that individual senators or representatives specify be directed to projects and activities that will benefit particular people, institutions or locations in their home constituencies." McCain's office told us the 9,427 was a "preliminary number" that staffers got by simply counting member-sponsored projects in a draft of the House version of the bill. Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington group that tracks federal spending, has a slightly lower number — 8,570 (down from 8,811 last year). That number includes anything defined by Congress as an earmark that doesn't mention the president as the person making the request. If you also include items requested by the president's budget that have been jointly requested by a member of Congress, the number comes to 9,287, according to TCS. A McClatchy News Service story put the total earmarks at 9,000, attributing it to "congressional officials." So McCain's number is in the same range as other counts and given slightly different definitions, it's possible to get different tallies. We find his claim to be True.

pomt-00357	Says the Trump administration transferred $10 million from FEMA to ICE.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/13/jeff-merkley/yes-10-million-were-transferred-fema-ice/	As a major hurricane heads toward the Carolinas, Democratic U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley berated the Trump administration for diverting nearly $10 million from emergency funding to immigration enforcement. "As #HurricaneFlorence bears down, I discovered today that the Trump Administration is taking money away from @FEMA so that they can pay to put more asylum seekers in detention centers. This is a scandal," Merkley of Oregon tweeted on Sept. 11. (FEMA is an acronym for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.) Merkley appeared on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show on Sept. 11 and said he obtained documents about the transfer due to his work in "trying to stop the child separations." Merkley has been a vocal opponent of the government’s "zero-tolerance" immigration policy that led to the separation of more than 2,000 children from their parents as they entered the United States illegally or at ports of entries. Many of them came seeking asylum. Parents separated from their children were sent to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers, and their children were sent to the care of another federal agency. "Just as hurricane season is starting, it generally starts June 1st, the administration is working hard to find funds for additional detention camps. … In fact, $10 million comes out of FEMA," Merkley told Maddow. Is Merkley right that the Trump administration transferred $10 million from FEMA to ICE? The transfer did happen. But the administration contends that appropriations limitations prevented the money from being used for hurricane response. One budget watchdog described the administration’s argument as "disingenuous at best." The ‘$10 million’ transfer Merkley’s claim stems from a fiscal year 2018 "transfer and reprogramming notifications" document from the the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS. That department oversees both FEMA and ICE. The document shows that more than $200 million went to ICE from other DHS agencies, and that the money would be used to pay for detention beds and for flights for deported immigrants. ICE got $9.8 million from FEMA’s Operations and Support account. (The transfer was less than 1 percent of that account’s budget). Some of the funds transferred had been labeled for "Response and Recovery - Recovery"; "Mitigation"; "Response and Recovery - Response"; and "Preparedness and Protection." Due to the transfer, FEMA would curtail training, travel, public engagement sessions, IT security support and infrastructure maintenance, and investments related to a program to streamline grants’ management, the DHS document said. Trump administration response DHS press secretary Tyler Q. Houlton pushed back on Merkley’s assessment that the administration was using emergency money for immigration purposes. "Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts. This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster," Houlton tweeted on Sept. 11. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The transferred money "is not coming out of the disaster relief fund, it has no impact on our efforts to be prepared for Hurricane Florence," FEMA’s administrator Brock Long told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell on Sept. 12. Merkley did not say in his tweet or MSNBC interview that the funds came from the disaster relief fund, he broadly said FEMA. Under law, a series of steps typically take place before the federal government taps into FEMA’s disaster relief fund. (Check out our story on how the United States funds disaster recovery.) The administration’s claim that the funds "couldn’t be used for disaster-related activities is disingenuous at best," said Steve Ellis, executive vice president at Taxpayers for Common Sense. Ellis pointed to FEMA’s budget request for fiscal year 2019. That request described FEMA’s Mitigation program (some of its 2018 funds were transferred to ICE) as one whose efforts "help create safer communities, enable people to recover more rapidly from disasters while relieving financial impacts." Under the Response and Recovery program (funds from here were also transferred to ICE), the mission of the Response unit is to "conduct emergency operations to save lives and property by: positioning emergency equipment, personnel and supplies; evacuating survivors; providing food, water, shelter, and medical care to those in need; and restoring critical public services," the budget request said. Some transferred funds also came from "Mission Support" — which funds FEMA headquarters activities. Our ruling Merkley said the Trump administration transferred $10 million from FEMA to ICE. DHS, which oversees FEMA and ICE, did transfer nearly $10 million from FEMA to ICE. The immigration agency got the funds to pay for detention beds and for the transportation of immigrants ordered deported. A transfer document shows that some of the FEMA money had been marked for response and recovery, mitigation, preparedness and protection. Officials argued that the money didn’t come from the disaster relief fund, but Merkley didn’t say it did, he only said it came from FEMA. We rate Merkley’s claim True.

pomt-05986	Says that according to a study, under Obama’s health care initiative, "nearly 90 percent of people" in Wisconsin with health insurance "will have their costs go up by more than 30 percent."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/22/frank-lasee/gop-us-senate-candidate-frank-lasee-says-study-pre/	Running against three more prominent politicians, Wisconsin state Sen. Frank Lasee, R-De Pere, arguably has received the least attention among the GOP candidates seeking a Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat in 2012. But the 15-year state lawmaker made an attention-grabbing claim about federal health reforms, which he and other Republicans label as "Obamacare," in an opinion piece published Jan. 9, 2012. Writing in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Lasee referenced a study of President Barack Obama’s initiative on Wisconsin. He said that according to the study, "nearly 90 percent of people with (health) insurance will have their costs go up by more than 30 percent." We don’t know whether the study’s prediction will turn out to be accurate. But what about Lasee’s characterization of the study? Do nearly 90 percent of people in Wisconsin who have health insurance face a cost increase of more than 30 percent? 'Obamacare' changes Lasee’s campaign for the seat held by retiring Democrat Herb Kohl has been overshadowed by those of his fellow Republicans: former govenor Tommy Thompson, former congressman Mark Neumann and state Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald. By attacking "Obamacare," Lasee is taking on the landmark health care reform that became law in 2010, although many provisions don’t take effect until 2014. As our colleagues at PolitiFact National have explained, the law leaves in place existing insurance systems -- employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor -- while reducing the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and offering subsidies to help those with modest incomes buy insurance. The law also requires almost every American to acquire insurance or pay a fine, a provision that has been challenged and will result in the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the law’s constitutionality in June 2012. Lasee is among countless people who have debated how much folks will have to pay for health insurance once Obama’s plan fully takes effect. The study Lasee cited in making his claim was commissioned by the administration of Wisconsin’s previous governor, Democrat Jim Doyle, who was succeeded by Republican Scott Walker in January 2011. Released in July 2011, the study was done by Gorman Actuarial, a Massachusetts firm specializing in health insurance, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology health economist Jonathan Gruber. Lasee's evidence When we asked Lasee’s office for evidence to back his statement about cost, chief of staff Robert Kovach cited a summary of the study produced by the Walker administration -- which opposes the reform law. The summary says 87 percent of people in Wisconsin who buy their own health insurance -- rather than getting it from an employer or the government -- will see their premiums increase an average of 30 percent. But there’s a big problem right off the bat: Lasee said the 30 percent cost increase applies to all Wisconsinites who have health insurance. The summary he cites refers to the much smaller group of people who buy their own insurance. In any case, rather than relying on the summary, let’s go to the study itself. It says that as of 2009, 4 million people in Wisconsin under age 65 had health insurance. That included more than 3 million who got insurance from their employer and only 180,000 -- or just 4 percent -- who bought it on their own. Of that small group, 87 percent will see their premiums increase an average of 41 percent once federal health care reform fully takes effect, the study says. Even at that, as the Journal Sentinel pointed out in its story about the study, the cost estimate isn't an apples-to-apples comparison because, for many people, the higher costs will bring higher benefits. Some people will pay more because they will be able to afford health plans with better benefits; some will be forced to buy more insurance than they want; and those who can afford insurance now but opt not to buy it will be required to buy it. We went back to Kovach, Lasee’s aide, who acknowledged that the figures Lasee cited misquote the study. He said he believes Lasee’s larger point was that most people in Wisconsin with health insurance will pay more for it under federal health care reform. But that remains to be seen. Our conclusion Lasee stated that, according to a study of the impact of federal health care reform on Wisconsin, "nearly 90 percent of people with insurance will have their costs go up by more than 30 percent." Those figures apply only to the fraction of people who buy their own health insurance, not to all Wisconsinites with insurance. And Lasee admitted he misquoted the study. We rate Lasee’s statement False.	None	Frank Lasee	None	None	None	2012-01-22T09:00:00	2012-01-09	['Wisconsin', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-07252	Members of Congress "receive full pay retirement after serving one term."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/29/chain-email/email-message-says-members-congress-get-full-pensi/	In an era when government pension benefits are under a lot of scrutiny, in part because retirement programs are costly and underfunded, it's not surprising that members of Congress would have the terms of their benefit package questioned as well. One unsigned email sent to us a few times in recent weeks begins: "No one has been able to explain to me why young men and women serve in the U.S. military for 20 years, risking their lives protecting freedom, and only get 50 percent of their pay, while politicians hold their political positions in the safe confines of the capital, protected by these same men and women, and receive full pay retirement after serving one term. It just does not make any sense." It goes on to say, "Many citizens had no idea that members of Congress could retire with the same pay after only one term." For a rank-and-file member of the House of Representatives paid $174,000 per year, that would mean full pay for the rest of their lives after serving as little as two years. What a deal! But is it a real deal? We wanted to find out. It didn't take us long to uncover a federal report, released in January, on "Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress" prepared for Congress by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. It outlines how pension benefits are calculated. The key provision: no member of Congress is eligible for any pension unless he or she has served in Congress for at least five years. (Senators serve six-year terms; House members must seek reelection every two years.) To collect, a congressman or senator must be age 62, or be age 50 with 20 years of service, or be any age with 25 years of service. Under the most recent pension program, adopted in 1984, the size of a pension is based on the highest three years of a member's salary, the number of years of service and a multiplier, which is 1.7 percent for the first 20 years of service and 1.0 percent for subsequent years. (Typically, for a 25-year rank-and-file member who retired this year, the pension would be the sum of two calculations. First, take $172,443 [the average salary over the last three years] times 20 years times 0.017. Then, add that to $172,443 times 5 years times 0.01. The total: $67,249 per year.) A three-term congressman (or one-term senator) who has now reached retirement age would be eligible for an annual pension of $17,588 for six years of work. That's extremely generous, but not even close to full pay. (Members of Congress are also eligible for Social Security.) Finally, federal law prevents them from getting full-pay retirement when they leave office. The report says, "By law, the starting amount of a member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80 percent of his or her final salary." (Under the formula, it would take 67 years of service to hit that limit.) So the email saying that members of Congress can "receive full pay retirement after serving one term" is blatantly bogus. It's never full pay and the only one-term members who would be eligible for any pension would be senators. This claim has been around the rotunda a few times. Our friends at Snopes.com have emails dating to 2000 reporting that senators and congressmen, when they retire, continue to draw the same paycheck until they die. FactCheck.org has also debunked the email. Over the years the claim has been accompanied by assertions that members of Congress don't pay into their Social Security (they have since 1984) or they don't contribute anything toward their retirement (they do), or that they are exempt from the new health-care law or claims of sexual harassment (they're not). A quick Google search with the words "congress" "full" "pay" and "retirement" would reveal the truth. But too many people prefer to make the seat-of-the-slacks decision to simply spread the myth to family and friends. So for them, and the original author of this ill-informed email, we break out the matches and lighter fluid and give them a Pants On Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c8c8d099-0558-4c98-9c28-e94348bf4b4a	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2011-05-29T00:01:00	2011-05-16	['United_States_Congress']

pomt-05475	David Dewhurst "has never once cut one penny from the state budget."	false	/texas/statements/2012/apr/20/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-david-dewhurst-hasnt-ever-cut-penny-/	Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz sounded dubious of Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst’s fiscal record in a televised debate, saying: "I’ll tell you something the lieutenant governor will not tell you: In his entire tenure in elected office, he has never once cut one penny from the state budget." Not a cent, ever? That’s provocative considering Dewhurst has presided over the Texas Senate during the adoption of five two-year state budgets, including two -- for 2004-05 and 2012-13 -- balanced partly by enacting cuts in the face of multibillion-dollar projected revenue shortfalls. He previously served a term as state land commissioner. Then again, a case might be framed that Dewhurst has no budget-cutting duties. That is, the lieutenant governor has no specified role in writing each state budget, though typical duties include appointing members of the Senate Finance Committee and, later each session, naming a few senators to negotiate budgetary differences with the Texas House. Cruz, the former Texas solicitor general, made no reference to the lieutenant governor’s lack of budget-writing duties. In laying out the basis of his claim during the April 13, 2012, Republican Senate debate at WFAA-TV in Dallas, he said that when Dewhurst was elected to the post in 2002, the two-year state budget, for 2002-03, was $116 billion. For 2010-11, Cruz said, the budget was $188 billion -- $72 billion more. Those cited figures are accurate, according to a chart in the January 2012 Fiscal Size-up report by the advisory Legislative Budget Board. The chart, Figure 22, details state government spending by two-year budget cycles. However, Cruz did not account for the latest state budget, which shows less spending in 2012-13 than the previous biennium. Also, comparing the first and fourth budgets passed into law on Dewhurst’s watch is not the only way to gauge whether Dewhurst ever cut a penny. Let’s drill down. Notably, Cruz’s cited figures reflect spending from all sources, including state and federal funds. At the debate, Dewhurst countered that state lawmakers have the most direct control over the state, or general revenue, portion of each budget -- which is true to a limited degree. According to the budget board report, lawmakers were able to freely appropriate only $15 billion of the nearly $88 billion in general revenue in the 2012-13 budget. The bulk of general revenue was restricted by provisions in state law or the Texas Constitution or influenced by funding formulas or federal laws, regulations or court decisions, the report says. Also, comparisons of state budgets over Dewhurst’s years as lieutenant governor might benefit from taking into consideration inflation and population growth. The figures aired by Cruz were not adjusted. The budget board’s 2012 report presents changes in spending from all sources and from general revenue alone biennium by biennium since 1992-93, meaning September 1991 through August 1993. And according to the report, raw dollar and percentage changes from biennium to biennium increased in each of the four Dewhurst-touched budget cycles. The increases in spending from all sources of funding averaged nearly 13 percent, ranging from 8.9 percent between 2008-09 and 2010-11 to 20.6 percent from 2006-07 to 2008-09, the report says. However, general revenue spending in 2004-05 was down about $960 million from 2002-03, or 1.6 percent. Such spending increased in the other budget cycles referenced by Cruz. Adjusted for inflation and population, though, the average biennium-to-biennium surge in spending from all sources drops to 3.5 percent, with individual increases ranging from 0.4 percent between 2002-03 and 2004-05, the report says, to 9.9 percent, from 2006-07 to 2008-09. The adjusted 2004-05 decrease in general revenue spending was 9.6 percent, the report says, while the 0.4 percent raw increase in such spending for 2010-11 amounted to an adjusted reduction of 5.9 percent. That is, then, one of the referenced budgets had a raw drop in general revenue spending and two of them had adjusted reductions. And what of the 2012-13 spending plan -- the one not mentioned by Cruz? The board report says that estimated spending from all funds in 2012-13 of $173.5 billion is down 7.5 percent from 2010-11. Adjusted for inflation and population growth, that reduction shakes out to 14.6 percent. Also, according to the board chart, nearly $81.3 billion in state general revenue spending in 2012-13 was down 0.8 percent from 2010-11. That raw spending total also is less than $81.6 billion shown in general revenue expenditures in 2008-09. Adjusted for inflation and population growth, state spending for 2012-13 is shown as down 8.4 percent from 2010-11. In a telephone interview, Cruz’s campaign consultant, Jason Johnson, said Cruz did not touch on the latest budget because the figures as presented in the board’s report deliver an incomplete picture. Johnson pointed to maneuvers by the 2011 Legislature that, he said, helped members balance the budget while inflating the savings shown between 2010-11 and 2012-13. There’s meat on that bone: Lawmakers and Gov. Rick Perry agreed to postpone a regular $2.3 billion distribution of education aid to public school districts into the next biennium, in September 2013, and also did not pony up for an estimated $4 billion in 2012-13 Medicaid costs, a gap likely to be addressed by the 2013 Legislature. In November 2011, we looked at how much genuine cutting there was in the 2012-13 budget while checking a Perry claim. Our sense then was that counting the postponed Medicaid and public school expenditures and including additional federal aid that would roll in if the state committed more to Medicaid, the 2012-13 budget might actually total about $184.3 billion, making the overall reduction from the previous biennium about $3.2 billion. Some estimates have since changed. By our analysis, the overall reduction would lately amount to $1.8 billion, down 1 percent from what was spent overall in the 2010-11 biennium. Bottom line: Even after wrapping in the spending not reflected in the report’s total for 2012-13, the overall raw spending level for 2012-13 is slightly lower than in the previous biennium. After adjusting for population growth and inflation, total funding still shows a decrease, although again, it’s smaller, about 8.5 percent, in comparison to the 14.6 percent the report shows. We also looked at how the general revenue picture changes after considering the left-out state spending. On a raw-dollar basis, the reduction of 0.8 percent shown in the report changes to a 6.8 percent increase. But after adjusting for inflation and population growth, the 2012-13 general revenue spending level still shows a reduction, of 1.4 percent, from the previous biennium. Another angle: Johnson of Cruz’s campaign forwarded his calculation of how the budget would have changed from 2002-03, before Dewhurst ascended, through 2010-11 if spending had only tracked inflation and population growth. Spending from all sources would have increased nearly $45 billion, 39 percent, his chart indicates. The actual unadjusted difference was about $72 billion, a difference of 62 percent. Johnson did not extend his analysis to the latest budget. The budget board suggests the raw difference between estimated spending in 2012-13 and what was spent in 2002-03 is about $58 billion, or 50 percent. We calculate that the difference increases to 60 percent if you count the postponed Medicaid and education expenses as part of spending in the 2012-13 biennium. We asked Johnson how Cruz concluded that Dewhurst has never cut a penny from the state budget, particularly given that the 2003 and 2011 Legislatures made reductions to accommodate projected revenue shortfalls and the Republican majority’s desire not to raise taxes. Johnson noted that overall raw spending from all sources of funding increased over the four Dewhurst-touched budget cycles covering September 2003 to September 2011 (though, again, not considering the latest two-year budget adopted in 2011). Johnson later said by email: "Spending more than you spent in the previous (legislative) session doesn't meet the definition of a cut. More pennies be more pennies." Johnson, in the interview, also suggested adjustments of spending figures for inflation and population growth should be discounted: "The average Texan, when they look at dollars spent by the state, that Texan does not step back and say, ‘Let me think about inflation.’ I assure you those same taxpayers aren’t able to make that same calculation on their pay and turn around and seek reimbursement from their employers," he said. As noted in a Dallas Morning News blog entry posted April 16, 2012, Eva DeLuna Castro, an expert fiscal analyst for the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, recently said that to close the state’s latest revenue shortfall, lawmakers in 2011 cut about $11 billion in spending. She said legislators also applied new revenue, adopted budgetary maneuvers and withdrew money from the state’s rainy day fund, she said. The News’ blog entry closes by calling it an overreach to "say there were no spending cuts." Our ruling Cruz’s claim rests on overall spending by state government escalating in the first four two-year budgets adopted with Dewhurst as lieutenant governor. State government spent 62 percent more in 2010-11 than it did before Dewhurst filled his post. However, these results do not mean Dewhurst never once cut the budget. Indeed, expenditures of state revenue alone were reduced by nearly $1 billion -- some 960 million pennies -- in the 2004-05 budget. Also, the 2012-13 budget -- overlooked by Cruz -- spends less than what the state spent in 2010-11, even after adjusting for major current costs to be paid for in the next budget period. Cruz's "never once" is absolute, which also makes it False.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2012-04-20T10:00:00	2012-04-13	['None']
pomt-05467	Says Gov. Scott Walker signed abortion, sex education and discrimination bills "in secret."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/apr/22/kathleen-falk/kathleen-falk-says-gov-scott-walker-signed-bills-a/	In the world of politics, it’s known as "the Friday dump" -- the tradition of officials delivering bad news (usually as it relates to themselves) at week’s end or before a holiday. The idea is to ensure light media coverage. Democrats and liberal interest groups accused Republican Gov. Scott Walker of an all-time classic dump on Good Friday, when Walker’s office announced by news release he had signed four bills they had labeled as part of a "war on women." What’s more, they said he concealed the fact they were signed. In an April 6, 2012, news release, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Falk challenged Walker to "explain to the people of Wisconsin why in secret, he allowed legislation that will restrict women’s access to health care and equal pay and will end age-appropriate sex education for students to become law." She added that Walker had "violated the trust of the people." Wait. Can a bill signing announced by news release really constitute "a secret"? The four bills at issue prevent people subjected to employment discrimination from seeking damages in state court; reverse a 2010 ban on abstinence-only sex education courses; create new requirements for getting medical advice before abortions; and prohibit insurance plans offered in Wisconsin under the federal health care reform law from covering some abortions. Democrats say they are part of a broader GOP "war on women." Republicans said the bills protect women and reverses ill-advised legislation passed when Democrats had control. But what about the signed-in-secret part? The bills, of course, were argued and approved in public. And once signed into law, they ultimately are published. So from that perspective no bill signings are secret. Sometimes, bills are signed in elaborate ceremonies in front of TV cameras that are announced in advance. Most bills, though, are signed quietly by the governor and announced via news release. Let’s look at this case more closely. Walker faced a legal deadline, based on when the bills passed, to sign or reject the four bills. That deadline was Thursday, April 5, 2012. That day, the Journal Sentinel’s Capitol bureau reporters -- and other media members -- asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie if the bills had been signed. He declined to directly say. To back up her statement, Falk’s campaign alleged there had been a one-day gap between when Walker signed the bills and his office’s April 6, 2012 announcement, which listed the four among 51 bills that had been signed. We checked legislative records, and they listed the bills being signed on Thursday (most of the others were signed on Friday). In addition to April 6, 2012 being Good Friday, it was opening day for the Milwaukee Brewers -- a "Friday dump" bonus. The news release, issued at about 12:30 p.m. -- a couple hours before the first pitch at Miller Park -- offered no comments about any of the bills. It was the first time Democratic lawmakers, who are copied on the releases, were notified they had been signed. So, Democratic lawmakers -- and the public -- were not notified in a timely fashion about the four bills in question. What’s more, the release said Walker "signed bills into law today" (italics ours). So, the public notice itself was misleading on when they were signed. We asked Werwie precisely when and where the four bills were signed. He would only say that it was not "the dark of night" as critics alleged, and that Walker didn’t sign them in his office because "he didn’t have time." On that same day, Walker signed two job-creation bills at Palermo’s Pizza in Milwaukee. This underlines a point about bill signings and announcements: In the same manner politicians call attention to popular measures with public signings (for political advantage), they can downplay controversial ones by skipping one (also seeking political advantage). In the end, it all becomes public. The secretary of state gets the bills within 24 hours of a signing, and publishes them. To find out more, we called the sponsors of the four bills. They told us there was a private signing ceremony -- on Thursday, April 5, 2012, at the governor’s Milwaukee office. The Republican sponsors were invited to attend, according to Sen. Mary Lazich (R-New Berlin) and an aide to Rep. Michelle Litjens (R-Oshkosh) though neither of those officials could make it. Some additional information: The general timing of Walker’s move was influenced by the Legislature’s actions. The bills in question were not sent to Walker until March 29, 2012. The state constitution gives Walker six working days to sign or veto. So the timing with Easter Week was determined by lawmakers, while the specific day that week was Walker’s call. A big-batch signing itself is not unusual, especially in the rush at the end of a legislative session. Earlier that week, Walker issued a similar news release announcing 36 bill signings. Our conclusion Echoing others, Falk took Walker to task for signing the four bills "in secret." Falk’s words suggest at the very least a highly unusual effort to conceal an official action. And the record reflects that. It’s clear to us that Walker cloaked the signing from reporters, and delayed his announcement to the public and Democratic lawmakers. But although Walker sought to quietly approve these bills -- that’s his prerogative. The timing was only partially in his control, and it’s not unusual to sign big batches of bills out of direct public view, for practical reasons or political ones. We think it’s a stretch to call it "secret" when the signing will ultimately become public -- and when it was announced in a news release. In short, we think there’s an element of truth to Falk’s claim but it ignores critical facts that could give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-04757	Says President Obama has waived "the work requirement for welfare."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/28/rick-santorum/Santorum-Romney-claim-Obama-ending-welfare-work/	When Congress passed landmark welfare reform legislation in 1996, Rick Santorum, then a Republican senator from Pennsylvania, voted for the bill. Now Santorum is lending his voice to Mitt Romney’s campaign message that President Barack Obama has gutted that reform and done away with rules from the 1996 law that require welfare recipients to eventually get a job. "This summer he showed us once again he believes in government handouts and dependency by waiving the work requirement for welfare," Santorum said Tuesday in a speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. "I helped write the welfare reform bill; we made the law crystal clear -- no president can waive the work requirement. But as with his refusal to enforce our immigration laws, President Obama rules like he is above the law." PolitiFact checked a Romney campaign ad's claim that Obama ended welfare work requirements earlier this month, rating it Pants On Fire. In reality, the Obama administration has said it will consider proposals from states that are aimed at finding better ways of getting welfare recipients into jobs. FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker have also said the claim is false. But the claim lives on. The Romney campaign has released two more ads repeating the line that work requirements were "gutted" line and it's become a regular talking point for Romney campaign surrogates. "Our most effective ad is our welfare ad," strategist Ashley O'Connor said at an RNC forum on Tuesday. "It's new information." "We’re not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers," added Romney pollster Neil Newhouse. Here, we’ll recap what Obama actually did, review the memo the Romney campaign cited to back up its claim and show why the claim is ridiculously false. The HHS memo Since 1996, welfare has been administered through block grants to states. The grant program, called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or TANF, limits how long families can get aid and requires recipients to eventually go to work. It also includes stringent reporting requirements for states to show they are successfully moving people into the workforce. A memo from George Sheldon, acting assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the department wanted to give states more flexibility in meeting those requirements. The memo notifies states "of the Secretary’s willingness to exercise her waiver authority ... to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families." What does that mean? "If you can do a better job connecting people to work, we would consider waiving certain parts of the performance measures and use alternate measures," is how Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, translated the memo’s point. (The center supports the plan.) Schott, who studies welfare policy, said TANF sets guidelines for what activities may count toward meeting the law’s work requirements: jobs, job training, internships or school, to name a few. Beyond that, it puts restrictions on how many hours a welfare client may spend at school, or how many consecutive months they can attend before that activity no longer counts toward the work requirement. The result: "States are running less-effective programs than they might be because they are so driven by performance measurement as it’s set forth in the federal law," Schott said. Waiving work requirements, gutting reform? The waivers, then, would allow for flexibility. For example, someone with a special-needs child might require different work arrangements than are currently allowed. Or a person who needs to improve his or her English skills might require more time to take classes. "The real starting place is: What’s the most effective program to get this person to work?" Schott said. It’s important to note, however, that the waivers would not just be a change on paper. Schott said it’s possible that waivers will allow states to get credit under the work requirement for things that don’t count currently. Romney and other critics contend that this amounts to "gutting" reform. Robert Rector, a welfare expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, wrote that the new standards set a "very weak or counterproductive measure of success." But there's no evidence the Obama administration has changed its philosophy. Indeed, the goal of the policy is to boost employment. The HHS letter, in several places, says only proposals from states that "improve employment outcomes" will be considered. Our ruling Santorum said that Obama "showed us once again he believes in government handouts and dependency by waiving the work requirement for welfare." The claim is a drastic distortion of what the Obama administration said it intends to do. By granting waivers to states, HHS is seeking to make welfare-to-work efforts more successful, not end them. The waivers would apply to individually evaluated pilot programs -- HHS is not proposing a blanket, national change to welfare law. And there have been no comments by the Obama administration indicating such a dramatic shift in policy. Santorum falsely claims that Obama has waived welfare’s work requirement entirely. The remark is inaccurate and it inflames old resentments about able-bodied adults sitting around collecting public assistance. Pants on Fire!

pomt-08431	"I've also offered a plan that can help (fix Social Security) that's supported by Robert Reich, secretary of labor previously, in a previous administration."	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/18/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-social-security-plan-embraced-f/	It's election season in Florida, which means it must be time to talk about Social Security. In particular, the federal entitlement program has found a prominent role in the compelling three-way race for U.S. Senate between independent Charlie Crist, Democrat Kendrick Meek and Republican Marco Rubio. Crist is airing a television ad saying that Rubio wants to raise the retirement age for beneficiaries and cut benefits. PolitiFact Florida ruled the claim Half True because Crist doesn't tell voters that Rubio's plan wouldn't affect current retirees or people nearing the retirement age. Rubio -- and even Meek -- are now piling on Crist for supporting what Rubio says amounts to amnesty for illegal immigrants in order to fund Social Security beyond 2037. Social Security was the first major policy issue discussed in the trio's past two debates, Oct. 6, 2010, with ABC News and on Fox on Oct. 15. Here's how Crist described his plan during the ABC News debate. "I think it's important that we realize where Social Security is today. And let's have a mature discussion about it," Crist said. "Report after report says that it's solvent until 2037 or 2041. I'm an optimist. I'm hopeful that the economy will continue to improve. But I've also offered a plan that can help it that's supported by Robert Reich, secretary of labor-- previously, in a previous administration. And it's straightforward and simple. "There are 11 (million) to 14 million people, different estimates by different people, that are not American citizens today -- not participating in the American economy," Crist said. "If we can find a pathway to earn citizenship for those 11 to 14 million people, they would be paying into the system. And when 2037 or 2041 comes, if in fact Social Security is still being challenged, we have another way and an opportunity to pay for it that provides jobs in a legal sense, and is compassionate to immigrants who come to our country." Meek called Crist's idea "bizarre," and Rubio said it's akin to amnesty. (For the record, Crist does talk about earned citizenship). In this fact check we're focusing on Crist's plan for Social Security and ultimately whether Reich, President Bill Clinton's labor secretary, can be counted among its supporters. Social Security is always a big issue in Florida. According to the U.S. Social Security Administration, more than 3.5 million Floridians receive Social Security benefits. Typically, you need to work in order to be eligible for Social Security and benefits are based on what you earned. The program is funded by payroll taxes. In 2010, for the first time, Social Security will pay out more in benefits than it takes in. The deficit, approximately $41 billion, will be offset by money in the Social Security trust fund. By 2014, as the baby boomer generation retires, deficits are expected to increase, according to the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees. By 2037, the trust fund will be empty, trustees predict, and incoming taxes will only be able to pay out 75 percent of scheduled benefits through 2084. So something needs to change between now and 2037 -- whether it's raising the retirement age, altering benefits, or something else -- to keep Social Security solvent. Crist says he thinks one way to keep Social Security solvent is by having people currently working in the country illegally earn citizenship and pay payroll taxes, which in turn would fund future Social Security benefits. And Reich, who now teaches at the University of California at Berkeley, also pointed to immigration as a way to solve problems funding Social Security. He wrote a blog for the Christian Science Monitor in April 2010 entitled "Immigration: Could it solve Social Security, Medicare woes?" "The biggest reason Social Security is in trouble, and Medicare as well, is because America is aging so fast," Reich wrote. "It's not just that so many boomers are retiring. It’s also that seniors are living longer. And families are having fewer children. Add it all up and the number of people who are working relative to the number who are retired keeps shrinking. "Forty years ago there were five workers for every retiree. Now there are three. Within a couple of decades, there will be only two workers per retiree. There's no way just two workers will be able or willing to pay enough payroll taxes to keep benefits flowing to every retiree. "This is where immigration comes in. Most immigrants are young because the impoverished countries they come from are demographically the opposite of rich countries. Rather than aging populations, their populations are bursting with young people. Yes, I know: There aren't enough jobs right now even for Americans who want and need them. But once the American economy recovers, there will be. Take a long-term view and most new immigrants to the U.S. will be working for many decades. "Get it? One logical way to deal with the crisis of funding Social Security and Medicare is to have more workers per retiree, and the simplest way to do that is to allow more immigrants into the United States." Unlike Crist, Reich's comments do not address illegal workers. Rather, his point is to allow more people to legally immigrate to the United States. That's different from what Crist is saying. In fact it turns out Social Security already is receiving a huge benefit from illegal workers who are paying into the system but as of now are unable to receive any of the benefits. Back in 2005, the New York Times reported that illegal workers essentially are contributing a $6 billion to $7 billion annual subsidy. More recent estimates suggest illegal workers are now paying $9 billion to $12 billion a year into Social Security, with no legal way to get that money back in retirement benefits. Some illegal workers are paid under the table in cash, meaning there is no record that they're working, and of course, no taxes for the federal government to extract. But many more purchase fake IDs and get fake Social Security cards in order to work, on the surface, legally. When those workers are paid, they still pay Social Security payroll taxes. But the federal government can't match those taxes up to a living, real person -- which is the way the government determines a worker's retirement benefit. Some of the Social Security discrepancies are clerical in nature and get fixed. But many of them are thanks to illegal workers submitting bogus Social Security information. The Social Security Administration estimates that two-thirds of illegal workers are paying Social Security payroll taxes. Over the life of Social Security, government actuary Stephen C. Goss said, illegal workers have contributed between $120 billion and $240 billion. That's money that is helping keep Social Security afloat for current and future beneficiaries. Crist's plan would potentially tap the other third of illegal workers not paying payroll taxes, but also would allow all workers access to Social Security benefits when they reach retirement age. Added benefits, yes. But added costs, too. Needless to say, that wasn't what Reich was even talking about in his blog for the Christian Science Monitor. "I've said we'll have to increase legal immigration in order to secure the Social Security of boomers (otherwise, the ratio of working population to retirees gets too far out of whack), but don't recall saying anything more," Reich wrote to the National Review. In an ABC News debate, Crist said his plan to help preserve Social Security -- to have illegal workers earn a path to citizenship -- was supported by former Clinton labor secretary Robert Reich. But Reich hasn't taken a side on that issue. Reich proposes allowing increased legal immigration to add more workers for each retiree, which is different. We rate Crist's claim False.

pomt-04208	Says he first unveiled his new legislative agenda in Wisconsin, not in California as critics complain	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/02/scott-walker/walker-says-he-unveiled-legislative-agenda-wiscons/	When Gov. Scott Walker hit the road for a "conversation" with Wisconsinites after Thanksgiving, it followed criticism that he had unveiled major legislative plans in a California speech before clueing in his home state. Given the 18-month uproar over Walker’s surprise move to sharply curtail public-sector unions in 2011, the particulars of his rollout process for big policy changes are a sensitive topic. The Appleton Post-Crescent wondered if Walker was more comfortable dishing to a friendly conservative audience than his own state’s residents. The Green Bay Press-Gazette headlined a story, "Walker’s California speech doesn’t play well at home." Democratic legislative leaders pounced. This was the first question Wisconsin Public Radio host Joy Cardin read to Walker on Nov. 26, 2012, from "Jerry on Facebook": "I would think the new plans for Wisconsin that the governor unveiled would be better announced in Wisconsin. Why did he unveil them in California?" Walker responded: "Well, I didn’t. I actually announced the ideas on Nov. 8 in La Crosse at the small business summit." Walker said his remarks as part of a question-and-answer session following his Nov. 16, 2012, address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum covered "essentially the same thing" he said in La Crosse. "I literally had talked about it first and foremost in great detail at the small business summit in La Crosse, which had a great crowd, almost 400 to 500 small business leaders from across the state of Wisconsin. So I’ve talked about it before. I just can’t make the press cover it." Walker also told Cardin he talked publicly in front of reporters about his agenda at a Republican Senate caucus meeting on Nov. 8, the day of the La Crosse speech. Did the guv give the scoop to his out-of-state audience? To be sure, Walker set his own bar high, saying he said "essentially the same thing" and in "great detail" in Wisconsin as he did in California. We watched complete video from both speeches and reviewed media coverage of them. We also reviewed coverage of the caucus appearance, and watched it on video. Here’s what we found on the four main themes Walker touched on in California regarding plans for the final two years of his first term. Tax cuts Walker has long expressed his support for an income-tax rate cut, dating to the 2010 gubernatorial election. He did not propose it in his first budget. He also said during the 2012 recall race that he favored a broad income tax cut. In the La Crosse speech, Walker told business people that he’d "love" to reduce the income tax burden in the state in his next budget, and strongly hinted he meant the individual income tax rate. Local media reported the tax remarks, with the La Crosse Tribune noting that Walker "expects Democratic support for measures including tax cuts..." In California, Walker repeated his goal, but in more certain terms, vowing to "put in place" income-tax reform in his next two years. Most notably from a news standpoint, Walker added the ear-catching description of the income tax cut proposal as "massive" and "aggressive." And in California, Walker added what appears to be a new element: a potential property tax cut. He said his administration was going to continue to lower property taxes. His first budget, for 2011-’13, featured a virtual freeze on property taxes, and they actually fell for owners of a median-valued home. We found no references to a property tax cut proposal in his appearances before the California trip. (A footnote on taxes: Eleven days after the California speech, Walker raised the possibility of cutting just the income tax or the property tax, not both.) Education funding Walker told the Senate caucus that his next budget might link state aid to public schools to student performance and school growth, the Associated Press reported. He made the same remarks on Nov. 12, 2012, on a phone call to the Assembly GOP caucus. Both instances were public and received media attention. He repeated the remarks in California, saying, as he did to the Senate caucus, that he would apply the principle to kindergarten-12th grade schools, technical colleges and the University of Wisconsin system. School voucher program In California, Walker said he’d like to expand Wisconsin’s voucher program for private schools to more students over the next two years. He didn’t say anything about vouchers in the La Crosse speech or at the caucus, based on news coverage and video from the speech. This scenario rings a bell. In 2011, Walker announced in a Washington, D.C., speech that he wanted expansion beyond students in Milwaukee, possibly to Racine and Beloit and Green Bay. That was during the 2011-’13 budget debate; ultimately, lawmakers added only Racine. Walker’s comments in California seemed to suggest he supports a statewide voucher program: "Every child -- no matter what ZIP code they come from, no matter what their parents' background -- every child in my state and in this country should have the opportunity to have access to world-class education." Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie told us Walker’s supportive comments should not be read to suggest the governor will include such a proposal in his 2013-’15 budget, expected in February. That, too, sounds familiar: In 2011, Walker did not include the expansion beyond Milwaukee in his 2011-’13 budget, but GOP lawmakers put it in later after Walker signalled his support. Government regulation of business Walker spoke extensively in the La Crosse speech about eliminating rules that fail a common-sense test, as he did in California. So, that’s what the record shows on the key themes. On two -- trimming regulation and holding schools accountable -- Walker clearly announced his intentions in Wisconsin first. And he did so in great detail. On income tax cuts, he strongly hinted at his intentions in the Wisconsin appearances, but his souped-up comments about the size and certainty of the cuts were first made in California. The property tax cut he mentioned in California was new. And on school vouchers, Walker’s talk of expansion may not be surprising, but he put it in play as a top legislative priority during his California speech -- not earlier in Wisconsin. Our rating Walker said he outlined his agenda in Wisconsin first, in great detail, before talking about "essentially the same thing" at the Reagan Library. There’s an element of truth here. Walker did roll out some of the issues in Wisconsin, but he left out major items he later mentioned in California, on property tax cuts and an unspecified expansion of the school voucher program. In addition, Walker spoke with much greater clarity and revealed more about his "massive" income tax plans out west than he did back home. We rate his statement Mostly False.

obry-00026	“Why are we spending $8 million on advertising to persuade people to come back to Wisconsin?” State Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, asked on Jan. 24.

We're talking, of course, about the famed plan to build a nearly $400 million bridge to connect the tiny Alaska city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport. The project was derisively nicknamed the Bridge to Nowhere and became a national symbol of wasteful earmark spending before the project was killed. Well, have no fear, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., says such a project could never again rear its porky head. Schumer made the claim while fending off criticism of thousands of earmarks in the $410 billion omnibus spending bill signed by President Obama on March 11. Schumer noted that since the Bridge to Nowhere controversy, Democrats have instituted earmark reforms that have added transparency and accountability. "They are transparent," Schumer of earmarks during an interview March 8, 2009, on NBC's Meet the Press . "No Bridge to Nowhere could occur." We're not contesting Schumer's claim about more transparency. Last year, Democratic lawmakers spearheaded reforms that require each earmark be attached to a legislative sponsor. Lawmakers used to be able to earmark spending secretly. In the House, congressmen also must say where the project is, what it's for and why, and attest that they don't have a financial stake in it. "Every earmark has someone's name attached to it," Schumer said. "There's my name attached to some. ... So you can no longer ever get the kind of Bridge to Nowhere that brought everything — and that was put in at the last minute in the conference committee with no name on it. People for weeks searched who put this in. So there has been reform." First, Schumer bases his argument on some bad information. The Bridge to Nowhere did have names attached. Everybody knew who was behind it. On June 12, 2003, Keith Ashdown of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group that tracks federal spending, issued a news release awarding a "Golden Fleece" to Rep. Don Young, the Alaska Republican who sponsored the bridge. The AP even wrote a story about it. The following year, on April 10, 2004, the New York Times ran a front-page story about the bridge under the headline, "Built With Steel, Perhaps, but Greased With Pork." In it, Rep. Young, who chaired the powerful transportation committee, boasted that he wanted to be "a little oinker." Unlike most earmarks, it was not part of an appropriations bill, but was added by Rep. Young in the summer of 2005 to a transportation bill at the last minute on the floor of the House. So Schumer is right to the extent that the bridge was attached somewhat late in the House consideration. But there was no doubt that Alaska lawmakers were behind it, certainly by the time the Senate took up the transportation bill. And the debate was very public. Despite mounting criticism, Young defended the project, telling the Anchorage Daily News in July, "These people keep saying it's nowhere, they're just smoking pot." "This is about opening the island," Young said. "It gives the opportunity for Ketchikan to grow. ... Once they build the bridge across, you have the opportunity to expand, and growth occurs, and that's the whole idea of bridges — to get across a body of water." The bill was passed in August 2005. But in the ensuing months, the project became somewhat of a national laughingstock. That October, U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., proposed an amendment that would have redirected $125-million in funding for the Alaska bridge toward reconstruction of a New Orleans bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens was apoplectic. Stevens threatened to quit, to become a "wounded bull on the floor of this Senate," and he vowed that if the bill passed, "I will be taken out of here on a stretcher." "I will put the Senate on notice — and I don't kid people — if the Senate decides to discriminate against our state, to take money only from our state, I'll resign from this body," Stevens said. "This is not the Senate I came to. This is not the Senate I've devoted 37 years to, if one senator can decide he'll take all the money from one state to solve a problem of another." The amendment was defeated by a lopsided vote, and we note that Schumer was among those who voted against it. Later, a congressional committee directed the $225 million earmarked for the Gravina Island bridge to the Alaska Department of Transportation. So Alaska would keep the money, but it would no longer be tied to the Bridge to Nowhere. Alaska could decide how to spend the money as it saw fit. But with the estimated cost of the bridge rising sharply, and amid the reality that more federal dollars were not forthcoming, Gov. Sarah Palin officially killed the project on Sept. 21, 2007. The important thing in judging Schumer's claim is that transparency wasn't the problem here. Young and Stevens were vocal, public advocates for the project. They were not sneaking around. Indeed, what allows projects like the Bridge to Nowhere is the unwritten rule among lawmakers not to judge other lawmakers' earmark projects, lest they judge yours. Groups like Taxpayers for Common Sense applaud the earmark reforms that were made last year, just as they applaud the calls by Congress and the president this week to add even greater transparency for earmark projects in the future. But that won't eliminate wasteful earmark spending. "Other than shame and voter anger, there's nothing that would prevent, specifically, the Bridge to Nowhere," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "Certainly not because of any rules being put in place." The Bridge to Nowhere is a household word because many people decided it was a waste of taxpayer money. But the legislator who sponsored it didn't think it was a waste. It's a matter of opinion. And there are no rules in place today that would prevent a legislator from proposing an earmark that he or she deems worthwhile but that others deem wasteful. So we very well could have more Bridges to Nowhere, which makes Schumer's statement False. Update: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that an arm of the Ketchikan to Gravina bridge was named after Rep. Don Young.

pomt-13497	"I released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics. … You don't learn much in a tax return."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-his-financial-disclosures-more-m/	As Election Day draws nearer, the window for Donald Trump to release his tax returns continues to narrow. When asked about his refusal to release his tax returns during an interview with ABC News’ David Muir, Trump said that "the only one that cares is the press. ... It’s not a big deal." Trump went on to say that he’s already provided significant information about his holdings. "I released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics," Trump said. "It’s either 100 or maybe more pages of names of companies, locations of companies, etc., etc., and it's a very impressive list, and everybody says that. … You don't learn much in a tax return." Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article, but he appears to be referring to the Executive Branch Personnel Public Financial Disclosure Report, also known as OGE Form 278e. This is a form that all presidential candidates must fill out. In Trump’s case, his financial disclosure form is indeed extensive. It runs 92 pages, often crammed with small print detailing assets, income sources and positions held. By comparison, Mitt Romney -- the 2012 Republican nominee who was a businessman with a complex set of holdings -- filed a 47-page disclosure form, not counting amendments and updates. But does his release of that information mean Trump is releasing more than prior presidential candidates who opened their tax returns to public scrutiny? We took a closer look. The history of presidential tax-filing releases The key difference comes from Trump’s refusal to release his tax filings. (Trump has cited an ongoing audit by the Internal Revenue Service.) Whereas the personal financial disclosure form must by law be made public, public release of a candidate’s tax returns is a 40-year tradition that isn’t required by law. As we have previously noted, Tax Analysts, a publisher specializing in tax policy, has been collecting publicly available tax returns of presidential candidates and other top officials for its Tax History Project. This archive goes back as far as the 1913 tax returns of future president Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1976, President Gerald Ford, did not release his tax returns but instead provided a summary of his taxes. His opponent, Jimmy Carter, did release his tax returns that year -- and every major-party nominee since Carter has released them to the public, until Trump. Hillary Clinton has released her tax returns from 2000 to 2015. Right off the bat, the fact that Trump has not released any tax filings undermines his claim to have "released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics," despite the lengthy personal financial disclosure form he submitted. Romney’s 2010 tax filing, for instance, runs 203 pages and is chock full of detail about his personal financial situation. For instance, Romney’s tax return "scrutinized his family’s charitable foundation and their donations to their church," said Ryan Williams, a longtime aide to Romney and a spokesman during his 2012 presidential campaign. So how seriously does the lack of public tax filings undermine Trump’s claim? We checked with experts. Why tax filings matter "It is true that Trump's businesses have received a lot of attention, but without the release of Trump's tax returns, we don't know a lot about his personal financial situation," said Lawrence White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business. The two most obvious pieces of the puzzle missing without Trump’s tax returns are the effective rate of tax he pays on his income, and the extent and nature of his charitable giving. Depending on what figures appear on his tax forms, Trump could face political criticism. Paying a low tax rate could be politically embarrassing. And Trump has faced questions about his past charitable giving. (For details, see the ongoing coverage by reporter David Farenthold of the Washington Post.) Tax returns also can give a clearer picture of the candidate’s liquid assets. "Trump can inflate his image of being rich on the financial disclosure forms, but you can get a better sense of how much he’s actually making from his tax returns," said Williams, who did not support Trump during the GOP primary and now says he’s officially undecided on the presidential race. Other nuggets can be gleaned from tax forms as well, such as what specific mix of taxes the candidate paid. "Romney’s tax return showed us a ton of valuable information about Romney, including the fact that most of his substantial income was ‘carried interest,’ " which is a type of tax-favored income available primarily to fund managers, said Allan Sloan, a business columnist for the Washington Post. Because of this, "we saw that the majority of his income was taxed at low rates." Trump wouldn’t necessarily qualify for the carried-interest tax, but as a someone in the real-estate business, he would have access to specialized tax breaks of his own, Sloan said. There is a "provision in tax law that allows people who spend at least half their working time as real-estate or development professionals to get depreciation deductions not available to other investors," he said. "That’s a huge loophole, and it’s gotten nothing like the attention that carried interest has gotten." The fact that Trump has not run for office before or served in government makes the scrutiny of his business dealings especially important for those who care about transparency. Yet the fact that he runs a privately held company makes it hard for outsiders to get a handle on his personal finances as long as no public tax filing is available, experts said. "Because Trump’s business dealings are varied and extensive, there is a lot to look at, but the quality of information is often poor, so reporters spend a lot of time looking at information insufficient to draw accurate conclusions," said Dennis Caplan, an associate professor of accounting at the University at Albany. Our ruling Trump said that he has "released the most extensive financial review of anybody in the history of politics. … You don't learn much in a tax return." Trump did release an extensive (and legally required) document detailing his personal financial holdings. However, experts consider that a red herring. Unlike all presidential nominees since 1980, Trump has not released his tax returns, which experts say would offer valuable details on his effective tax rate, the types of taxes he paid, and how much he gave to charity, as well as a more detailed picture of his income-producing assets.

He did so again in his State of the Union address. "Small business confidence is at an all-time high," he said. Is it? Pretty much. The primary gauge of how confident small businesses are in the economy is the National Federation of Independent Business’s small business optimism index. On an annual basis, the index averaged 104.8 in 2017. That just beat out the previous record of 104.6, set in 2004. Here’s the full chart: The most recent monthly figure (104.475 for December 2017) was actually down from the previous month (107.123 in November 2017). Still, the annual record is a reasonable measurement. Our ruling Trump said, "Small business confidence is at an all-time high." The NFIB’s small-business survey set a high in 2017, when all months are averaged. So we rate his statement True.

"Breaking: Trump fires deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, raising questions over Mueller’s fate," stated the Dec. 8 headline posted on Houstonchronicle-tv.com, an imposter website that mimics a real newspaper's name. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article is phony. A spokesman for the Justice Department, Ian Prior, confirmed for PolitiFact that Rosenstein remains deputy attorney general. Rosenstein first joined the Justice Department in 1990, and Trump nominated him as deputy attorney general in January. The Senate confirmed his nomination on April 25. Rosenstein oversaw the Russia inquiry at the Justice Department after Attorney General Jeff Sessions agreed in March to recuse himself from all proceedings related to the Russia investigation. In May, Rosenstein wrote a memo recommending that Trump fire former FBI director James Comey because of how he handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation. When Trump fired Comey, the White House made public Rosenstein’s memo. But recently, Trump has been critical of the Justice Department. In a Dec. 2 tweet, Trump wrote, "Many people in our Country are asking what the "Justice" Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and "acid washed" 33,000 Emails? No justice!" Trump tweeted a day after Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to federal investigators related to lying to the FBI that he hadn’t spoken about sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. But a critical tweet is a far cry from a firing. Trump hasn’t fired deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-07196	Assaults on Wisconsin law enforcement officers are up 224 percent statewide since 2005	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/08/wisconsin-professional-police-association/assaults-police-have-surged-mostly-milwaukee-count/	Punched, kicked, pushed, stabbed, shot. Lobbying against state cuts that could trim local law enforcement funding, the Wisconsin Professional Police Association recently trumpeted a disturbing trend: Assaults against officers in the state have more than doubled in the last five years. "1,588 Wisconsin officers were assaulted in 2010. Part of a growing trend, the 2010 statistics represent an astonishing increase of 224 percent over the 492 assaults recorded in 2005," Jim Palmer, executive director of the group, said in a news release issued May 31, 2011. "These disturbing figures demonstrate that our state’s law enforcement community is facing a crisis caused by the state’s repeated cuts to the funding it provides to cities to pay for police services." The connection between assaults and budget cuts is Palmer’s opinion -- a linkage even he told us is difficult to directly establish. But what about the numbers themselves? Has there really been a big spike in assaults on police, even as major crime has dropped? We can check that -- and try to get at what lies behind the numbers. Before we jump in, we should note that assaults are broadly defined. A few are deadly, and draw the most attention, but about one in five incidents results in injury to an officer. Most involve fists and feet rather than weapons. Palmer pointed us to state Office of Justice Assistance data that is based on local crime statistics reported to the FBI. The overall increase cited is on target (though, for the record, the state report we say showed 490 assaults in 2005, not 492). The 224 percent increase moved the state from way below average to average in number of assaults per officer. But we obtained the county-by-county reports and drilled down. More than half of Wisconsin’s counties actually reported fewer assaults in 2010 than in 2005, we found. And outside Milwaukee County, assaults were up only 24 percent in the period. The Milwaukee County numbers, in contrast, were off the charts and driving the statewide increase -- a nearly fivefold increase (486 percent) in the period looked at. To put that huge leap in focus, consider that Milwaukee County is reporting an increase of more than 1,000 assaults on officers in just six years -- from 212 incidents in 2005 to 1,243 incidents in 2010. So, while it’s the state union citing the number to bolster its position, it’s more of a Milwaukee-only trend. The association does not represent Milwaukee cops; the separate Milwaukee Police Association does that. Is it a one-year blip -- or a true "trend," as Palmer said? The numbers show it has been a steady climb up, year by year, since 2005. In fact, they have been heading up gradually since the mid-1990s. Palmer called the increase "astonishing." Nationally, we found, the number basically has been flat for at least a decade. Does the huge jump in assaults of officers reflect a growing number of incidents or some change in the way assaults are accounted for -- or a combination of both? Palmer of the WPPA doesn’t have an answer. He said the state should launch a study of what’s behind the increase. Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm thinks the trend is real. Criminals are more aggressive, less likely to surrender and are under less intense scrutiny because of cutbacks in federal grants for special crime-fighting efforts, he said. Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said lax treatment of young offenders and weak penalties for illegally carrying weapons could explain the trend. "We have a critical mass of undeterred juvenile offenders entering the adult system," Flynn said, "and now they are carrying firearms because they have learned there is not a great risk of serious sanction." Milwaukee Police Association President Mike Crivello says manpower cuts have weakened the show of force necessary to discourage attacks on officers. Tami Jackson, spokeswoman for the state office that collects the data, said no change in reporting method was apparent in the Milwaukee figures. Let’s return to the statement and the bottom line: Lobbying to save funding for law enforcement in communities across the state, the Wisconsin Professional Police Association highlighted an upward surge (224 percent) in reported assaults against law enforcement officers since 2005. The statistics are on point, but while framing it as a statewide problem, the group didn’t note the jump is really centered in the city of Milwaukee. In many other parts of the state, assaults are down. So, it needed some clarification. That rates a Mostly True.

pomt-10521	"I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/10/hillary-clinton/clinton-visited-kosovo-refugees-but-/	As a way of burnishing her credentials to be commander in chief, Sen. Hillary Clinton made a number of claims during an interview with CNN, including, "I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo." On May 14, 1999, first lady Clinton visited a refugee camp in Skopje, Macedonia, for ethnic Albanians leaving Kosovo. The trip received extensive press coverage focused on the plight of families trying to escape violence at the hands of Serbian forces. "I want to send a message to the refugees that we do not intend to let the evil which (Yugoslavia President Slobodan) Milosevic perpetrated against these people keep them away from their homeland and their homes," Clinton said on the trip. Hillary Clinton's campaign has put forward statements from former Bill Clinton administration officials about the importance of the trip. Richard C. Holbrooke, who negotiated the 1995 Dayton Accords ending the war in Yugoslavia and is supporting Sen. Clinton's presidential bid, said the first lady pressed officials on her trip to keep borders open and then continued to lobby for refugees when she returned to Washington. "After visiting refugees and gaining a first-hand assessment of the situation, the first lady had intense talks with President Gligorov and Prime Minister Georgievski," Holbrooke said in a written statement. "In these talks, one in the Presidential Palace, another in the residence of the American Ambassador, Christopher Hill, Mrs. Clinton pressed the Macedonian government to fully open the border so that Kosovar Albanian refugees could flee the war zone to safety." The trip seemed more designed to gain media coverage than to conduct substantive diplomacy, however. Clinton visited the area for less than 12 hours, arriving at 9:20 a.m. and leaving at 5:45 p.m. According to the itinerary provided to news organizations, she arrived at the camp and was briefed on relief efforts at 10 a.m., toured the camp at 11 a.m., and met with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) at 1:30 p.m. Her meetings with officials appear to have been brief. Holbrooke is correct on some of the details he mentions, but the meetings all took place within the space of a single afternoon. The itinerary shows photo opportunities for the traveling press at 2:20 p.m. with Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski at the U.S. Ambassador's Residence; at 2:50 p.m. with President Kiro Gligorov at the president's residence; and at 3:30 p.m. with first lady Gligorov at the president's residence. The New York Times reported that her visit to the camp was "so carefully scripted that administration officials chose which refugees Mrs. Clinton would speak with." Macedonia opened its borders before Clinton visited, so it seems unlikely that she personally negotiated for border openings. But the Clinton administration wanted to make sure the borders stayed open amid concern that Macedonian officials were trying to keep refugees out. In this context, her trip suggests a diplomatic visit intended to reinforce U.S. goals in the region. In her biography Living History , she mentions her visit and describes it as supporting the administration's diplomatic agenda around the world, but she does not mention taking part in specific negotiations. We tried and failed to find an independent expert who could speak to her role in negotiating open borders. Janusz Bugajski, an expert on the region with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said via e-mail of her visit, "No doubt she tried to help the plight of refugees, but whether she was mandated by President Clinton to speak on behalf of the U.S. administration concerning policy in the region one would need to ask the former president." Our reading of the record shows a good deal to suggest Clinton was concerned about the plight of the people of Kosovo, but almost nothing to indicate she was a major player in border negotiations. We'll give her the benefit of the doubt for traveling to Macedonia and meeting with officials, but the way her statement is phrased, it makes her sound primarily responsible for the United States' efforts in the region. We don't find evidence to support that aside from her less-than-12-hour visit, and so we find her statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

On Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace had an exchange with Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., over one of the most contentious Ebola-related issues -- whether to enact a travel ban from countries where Ebola is spreading, such as the west African nations of Liberia and Sierra Leone. Here’s the exchange: Wallace: "I want to talk about the threats from those countries -- the ‘hot zone’ -- to this country, because one of the big issues, of course, is this idea of a travel ban. … Congressman Murphy, this is what President Obama said this week:" Obama: "Trying to seal off an entire region of the world, if that were even possible, could actually make the situation worse." Wallace: "Congressman Murphy, why is the president wrong?" Murphy: "Well, look, first of all, the president has sealed off Israel in the past, and we sealed off other areas temporarily. We can have travel restrictions until we get the rest right. And the rest is not right." For this fact-check, we’ll focus on whether blocking travel from countries with Ebola should be because Obama "has sealed off Israel in the past." We didn’t hear back from Murphy’s office, but the only example involving Israel that experts could recall was the two-day ban earlier this year on American airlines flying into or out of Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport. The Israel flight ban became a cause celebre earlier for conservatives such as Ted Cruz, and the comparison of the Israel ban and a possible Ebola flight ban has been the subject of comment on some conservative blogs. That ban was in effect for parts of July 22 and July 23, in the middle of a weeks-long battle between Israel and Hamas. The Federal Aviation Administration ban was enacted after a Hamas rocket landed within a mile of the airport, prompting safety concerns for airliners flying into and out of the airport, according to news reports. (This was less than a week after a Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 was shot down while flying over a war zone in eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014.) As the official FAA notification about the ban put it, "At 12:15 EDT on July 22, 2014, the FAA issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) informing U.S. airlines that they are prohibited from flying to or from Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport for a period of up to 24 hours." The notification went on to clarify that the move "applies only to U.S. operators, and has no authority over foreign airlines operating to or from the airport." This is an important distinction. The FAA’s decision prevented U.S. carriers from flying into or out of Ben Gurion Airport -- but it did not prevent foreign-owned carriers from flying into or out of Ben Gurion, including those headed to the United States, carrying Americans or people of any other nationality. Indeed, some supporters of Israel, such as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, made a show of solidarity with Israel by flying to Ben Gurion despite the ban, using foreign carriers such as Israel’s El Al. On July 23, Bloomberg tweeted, "Safely landed at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv - here to show support for Israel's right to defend itself." In other words, the Israel example was hardly a case of a country being "sealed off." The FAA did not act to stop airliners carrying Americans and foreigners flying from Israel to the United States -- only U.S. airplanes. "U.S. citizens could still travel on international air carriers into and out of Israel during this time," said Jeffrey C. Price, a professor of aviation and aerospace science at the Metropolitan State University of Denver. This situation isn’t comparable to what would be needed to stop air traffic from west African nations currently grappling with Ebola. To truly keep out Ebola-infected patients from west Africa, the government would need to ban all flights originating in west Africa from landing in the United States. That’s a more all-encompassing ban than the one imposed on Israel. If the FAA simply followed the Israeli example, foreign carriers could continue to fly passengers unimpeded into the United States, something that would defeat the purpose of an Ebola-related ban. (It’s not even clear what a U.S. flight ban might look like. According to CNN, there are no direct flights to the United States from either Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, the three countries most heavily affected by Ebola today.) "It’s wrong to compare what happened in Israel with what has been discussed regarding Ebola and Africa," said Henry H. Harteveldt, founder and travel industry analyst with the Atmosphere Research Group. Separately, the United States could enforce a ban against anyone infected with Ebola. The only notable precedent for that was a ban that lasted for more than 20 years that kept travelers with H.I.V. -- the virus that causes AIDS -- from entering the country. (This ban was ended in 2009 under Obama.) However, if that’s the kind of ban Murphy was referring to, then his on-air comparison is off-base. The AIDS ban never specifically targeted any one country, and it was implemented by President Ronald Reagan, not Obama. Our ruling Murphy said that blocking travel from countries with Ebola should be feasible because Obama "has sealed off Israel in the past." However, the two-day air-travel ban imposed by the FAA earlier this year affected U.S.-owned carriers without halting travel into and out of Israel by foreign-owned carriers, who may have been carrying either Americans or foreigners, and who may have been flying unimpeded into U.S. airports. Comparing this to a travel ban designed to stop Ebola from leaving west Africa is a case of apples and oranges. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-15236	Film and television productions generated a $6 billion economic impact for Georgia’s economy in the most recent fiscal year.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/aug/07/georgia-department-economic-development/film-industrys-impact-georgia-economy-overstated/	Superheroes and zombies apparently bring serious coin into the Peach State. The "Ant-Man" movie, and "The Walking Dead" TV series were among 248 productions shot in Georgia in the fiscal year that ended June 30, according to the state Department of Economic Development. The direct spending in Georgia was $1.7 billion, but the headline had an even more eye-popping number. The productions "generated an economic impact of more than $6 billion," the department said. For political junkies, that’s about the cost of the national 2012 election according to our friends at the Center for Responsive Politics. So do productions really have as much impact in Georgia as all the spending in a contested presidential year nationwide? PolitiFact Georgia couldn’t resist looking further. Georgia’s Red Carpet Georgia has heavily incentivized the entertainment industry since 2008 to lure projects. Production companies can earn a 20 percent income tax credit on in-state costs of projects worth at least $500,000. Another 10 percent credit is given for using a Georgia logo in production credits. One unique element of the credit: if a production company doesn’t need to use it against its Georgia tax liability, it can sell the credit to another Georgia company to help finance a project. Those breaks have become even more attractive as other states, such as North Carolina, have cut back on their incentives. The result: a 553 percent increase in spending from 2008’s tally of $260.4 million spent on production in Georgia, according to Stefanie Paupeck Harper, spokeswoman for the state Department of Economic Development. The impact As head of the Georgia Film, Music and Digital Entertainment Office, Lee Thomas is responsible for certifying what productions can claim the state’s tax credit. But the way the state estimates the overall impact of that direct spending predates her 19-year tenure. For at least 30 years, the state economic development department has multiplied direct spending by 3.57 to estimate impact. In economic terms, that is a multiplier, or how many times each dollar of direct spending cycles through direct spending. In the film industry’s case, that means the state calculates that every dollar of direct spending has generated total spending of $3.57 in Georgia. Looking back to 2008, the state used the multiplier to calculate the film industry’s impact at $465 million. That is an astonishing 1,190 percent jump on impact. Thomas acknowledged that the state doesn’t know what sorts of spending that multiplier originally counted, or why the 3.57 estimate was used. But keeping the same multiplier allows to track progress over time, comparing apples to apples, she said. And it’s clear the more productions mean more local spending on gear, costumes, heating and air conditioning on set and location fees. "If they spend on a caterer, that goes into the 3.57," Thomas said. "Another thing we look at is film tourism, which is very hard to quantify but we know that those visitors are a direct result of the industry filming here. We certainly know that Georgia has seen significant growth in this industry." Economics 101 Bruce Seaman is sympathetic to the growth argument. But as an economist at the Andrew Young School of Public Policy at Georgia State University, he knows the multiplier the state is using is way too high. The common IMPLAN model gives the industry a 1.83 multiplier. Using the state’s method, that would translate into a far lower impact of $3.1 billion. It’s significant, to be sure. But even that high number is likely overstated, because the state has not determined its capture rate. That is, for every $1 million a production company pays a big star – or $100,000 spent on hotel rooms – how much is captured in Georgia before the money goes back to the celebrity’s L.A. home or the hotel’s out-of-state headquarters? "I want to know what it means to say, ‘that money was spent in the state,’" Seaman said. And, a more detailed analysis would also benefit the state’s case of impact. That’s because the state doesn’t capture the long-term money invested from the boom, such as the erection of the new Pinewood Studios facility in Fayette County (where "Ant-Man" was shot last year) and the redevelopment of a Midtown facility for a new film and television master's degree program at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD). It also fails to account for how many of the 43 productions in Georgia today, including a popular "Guardians of the Galaxy" sequel, would have selected the state without its growing ability to handle production. "The good news, really, is the tax credits are spurring an indigenous film industry taking shape in Georgia," Seaman said. "It’s incredibly complicated and you would have to look at all of the details on a project-by-project basis to seriously know what’s going on." "The irony is, without that study, you are clearly overstating the short-term impacts but we appear to be understating the longer-term impacts. We wouldn’t know without more careful study." Our ruling The booming film industry in Georgia generated $6 billion in economic impact in the state in the most recent fiscal year, according to the state department of economic development. The calculation is based on formula the state has used for at least 30 years, multiplied against direct spending. There is no dispute that direct spending on productions has mushroomed, but the state can’t explain why it uses a multiplier that is almost double the standard economic model for that calculation. The state’s formula likely also fails to capture long-term spending and investment that have taken hold in Georgia. There is accuracy in the claim, especially in the carefully tracked direct spending from film and TV production in the state. But it leaves out important information that could better prove, or disprove, the statement. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-08022	Portland spent nearly $1 million in federal stimulus money to install bike path signs where they already existed.	false	/oregon/statements/2011/jan/08/victoria-taft/victoria-taft-says-city-spent-nearly-1-million-red/	CORRECTION: CORRECTION: This item was corrected to reflect that there are new bikeway sharrows near older medallion bikeway marks on Northwest Johnson Street. Our ruling did not change. The city of Portland made national headlines last month by landing in a year-end report of government waste, as compiled by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla. His "Wastebook 2010" lists some laugh-out-loud examples of federal largess: $2.5 million on a Census Bureau commercial too ironic to be understood? More than $200,000 to study why political candidates make vague statements? Nearly $500,000 to maintain a lavish office for former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert? (We’re not vouching for the accuracy of any of those statements.) But we’re pretty sure that entry No. 100 -- out of 100 -- did not make anyone at the Portland Bureau of Transportation chuckle. "Why have one bike sign when you can have two?" reads the final entry from Coburn’s report. "Oregon spent $900,000 in federal stimulus funds on a new bike signage project even though the city already has similar bike signs, which it plans to leave up. ‘The new signs — which include arrows, distance, and travel times to key destinations — have a slightly different design than existing ones,’ according to a local biking website." With the entry, Coburn posted photos of the old and new bike signs, as snapped by Jonathan Maus of bikeportland.org, also known as the "local biking website." The roadside signs in the photos are at two different locations and look a little different from each other. Coburn’s clear implication is that the city doubled up on redundant signage. Local talk radio host Victoria Taft picked up on his theme on her blog: "Portland spent nearly $1,000,000.00 in federal ’stimulus’ money to install ‘bike path’ signs where they already existed." With her blog, Taft includes a photo of a "sharrow" mark, a white sign marked on the pavement to indicate a bike boulevard. The implication here is that the "sharrows" are redundant. PolitiFact Oregon wanted to know: Did Portland spend money for signs when there were already perfectly good signs in place? We asked the city for clarification. In 2009, Portland received $900,000 from President Barack Obama’s "America Recovery and Reinvestment Act" -- the stimulus -- to improve bicycle signage. About $69,000 of that money went for 450 new "wayfinding" signs, the ones singled out by Coburn as wasteful. (These are green and white signs alongside the road telling riders the distance and estimated time to get to Lloyd Center or to the Eastbank Esplanade or myriad other destinations.) The $69,000 also paid for 1,180 new yellow "safety" signs marking crosswalks for pedestrians and cyclists. In any case, $69,000 is a pretty small portion of the overall grant. What about the rest of the money? About $480,000 of the $900,000 was spent on the "sharrow" pavement markings snapped by Taft. The city used the federal grant to paint 2,100 federally approved sharrows to mark 23 miles of new bike boulevards, and 30 miles of existing bike boulevards. The existing bike boulevards were stamped with smaller circles, and those are still there. The sharrows are larger, about 3 feet by 9 feet, and give a uniform look to all bike boulevards. (That leaves $351,000 unaccounted for. Where did that go? Well, said Dan Anderson, spokesman for the transportation bureau, there’s overhead, engineering costs, project management costs, contractor compliance costs, and pollution and erosion control costs. So many costs. But that’s another story.) What does that leave us with? The 1,180 new crosswalk signs were not mentioned in the musings of Taft or Coburn, so we can ignore those. In no case did any of the 450 signs duplicate existing roadside signs, so we can rule those out as well. That leaves Taft’s sharrows. "Those pictures on my blog were of signs on the roads just laid down by those workers. Just feet away were existing painted signs on the streets," Taft wrote to PolitiFact. "Bicyclists already use the roads on which these signs were painted. Signs already existed there and new ones were therefore redundant and, in my opinion, a waste of taxpayer money." The new sharrows did duplicate smaller bike boulevard markings in some locations, but not even close to all of them. The photo Taft snapped was on Northwest Johnson Street, where several sharrows are located next to older and smaller bike circles, some faded, some not. (They also are along Northwest 24th Avenue.) Now, we wouldn’t have a problem if Coburn and Taft had dinged the city for wasting federal money on bike markings. Or for spending too much on overhead costs. But the message from the two was that all of the $900,000 was spent on slightly different signs where other signs "already existed." And that’s inaccurate. We rule the claim False.

pomt-11191	Says Jim Sensenbrenner "has been in office for 40 years" and "he's led on exactly one bill," the Patriot Act.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2018/may/17/tom-palzewicz/pants-fire-claim-40-year-wisconsin-congressman-has/	The rhetorical bombs that Democrat Tom Palzewicz has been lobbing at GOP Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, the senior member of Wisconsin’s congressional delegation, includes this whopper of a tweet from May 14, 2018: Today's a good day to remind the #WI05 district that your current Congressman, @JimPressOffice, has been in office for 40 years. In that time, he's led on exactly one bill - the wildly invasive & unpopular Patriot Act. Chip in & help #RetireSensenbrenner Palzewicz, a suburban Milwaukee businessman, is making a longshot run to unseat Sensenbrenner. So, Sensenbrenner has served in the House since 1979, but the USA Patriot Act is the only bill he has "led"? Chalk this one up to the risks of railing on Twitter. Or maybe not. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Patriot Act The USA Patriot Act was introduced by Sensenbrenner in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and was signed into law by GOP President George W. Bush in October 2001. (Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold cast the lone no vote in the Senate.) The measure granted law enforcement increased surveillance powers to intercept phone and email communications in the name of fighting terrorism, but with little judicial or congressional oversight. Based on a law he signed in 2015, PolitiFact National gave Democratic President Barack Obama a Promise Kept on his pledge to revise the law to increase oversight on government surveillance. So, what else has Sensenbrenner done? An apology When we asked for evidence to back up the claim, Palzewicz’s campaign staff sent us this statement, attributed to the candidate: My campaign used imprecise language, which is an issue in a medium such as Twitter where brevity is king. We were expressing the opinion that over a 40-year career, he doesn’t have a lot of major legislation to his name. The Patriot Act is the only thing of note. That said, it’s not 100% accurate, in that he has had his name on other pieces of legislation, and I apologize for that. Twitter can be hazardous, of course. But we found that Palzewicz also made the attack on a website he’s using to raise money for his campaign. 500 sponsorships The state Republican Party responded to us on Sensenbrenner’s behalf, citing Congress.gov data. That data shows that in his career, Sensenbrenner was the lead sponsor on 500 bills or amendments, 99 of which passed the House and 34 that became law. The measures include these three, each of which was signed into law in 2006: Voting Rights Act: A 25-year extension of the act was signed into law. It was initially enacted in 1965 to fight against racist policies in the South that often kept blacks from voting. Adam Walsh Act: Established a national system for the registration of sex offenders and offenders against children. Violence Against Women Act: Reauthorized a law that provides funding for programs to fight domestic violence, sexual assault and other crimes. Our rating Palzewicz says Sensenbrenner "has been in office for 40 years" and "he's led on exactly one bill," the Patriot Act. Palzewicz told us he meant to say the anti-terrorism law is the only Sensenbrenner-sponsored bill of note. But as for what Palzewicz actually claimed, Sensenbrenner has sponsored 500 bills and amendments, including 34 that became law. That makes Palzewicz’s statement not only false but ridiculous -- Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Tom Palzewicz	None	None	None	2018-05-17T06:00:00	2018-05-14	['None']

pomt-00503	Says Jeb Bush "said low-income women should ‘get their life together and find a husband.' "	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/jun/25/ultraviolet/jeb-bush-did-say-women-should-find-husband-get-wel/	A women’s rights group took presidential candidate Jeb Bush to task in a social media post, dredging up a 21-year-old quote that makes him sound behind the times. In a June 15, 2015, Facebook post, political group Ultraviolet listed "5 things you should know about Jeb Bush." The fourth item: "Said low-income women should ‘get their life together and find a husband.' " We looked at all five items in a separate story (which you can read here) and found a few inaccuracies. In this case, Bush did say it -- way back in 1994, during his failed first run for governor. During that campaign, Bush pushed for two-year limits on receiving benefits from a federal welfare program known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), which ended in 1996. "If people are mentally and physically able to work, they should be able to do so within a two-year period," he said. "They should be able to get their life together and find a husband, find a job, find other alternatives in terms of private charity or a combination of all three. That is the first step, to redefine the role of government. It will be hard. There will be lots of screaming and hollering." Bush’s GOP primary opponents seized on this widely reported quote -- particularly former Florida Attorney General James Smith, who used part of the quote in an attack ad. Bush called the ad unfair, and said Smith took "a fragment of a quote from me on welfare reform totally out of context in an attempt to portray me as a sexist who is insensitive to women." The Orlando Sentinel quoted Bush as saying marriage "is one of many options, and if people are honest about the welfare system we have today, how you get on welfare is not having a husband in the house." CNN reported that Bush added, "Let's be honest here. Men are not on welfare, that's the point. That's the point -- men are not on AFDC." A state official noted that a small percentage of men did get benefits from the program, as did some families with both men and women as heads of the household. Bush lost the 1994 gubernatorial election in a close race with Democratic incumbent Lawton Chiles. Bush’s past statements about shaming single mothers have been in the news quite a bit during this campaign after media outlets began highlighting comments from his 1995 book Profiles in Character. "One of the reasons more young women are giving birth out of wedlock and more young men are walking away from their paternal obligations is that there is no longer a stigma attached to this behavior, no reason to feel shame," Bush wrote. "Many of these young women and young men look around and see their friends engaged in the same irresponsible conduct. Their parents and neighbors have become ineffective at attaching some sense of ridicule to this behavior. There was a time when neighbors and communities would frown on out-of-wedlock births and when public condemnation was enough of a stimulus for one to be careful." The same Ultraviolet Facebook image also referenced the so-called "Scarlet Letter" law that passed while Bush was in office. That 2001 bill included a provision that required unwed mothers who didn’t know who fathered their child to publish weekly notices describing dates, places and partners with which the women had had sex prior to putting the child up for adoption. Bush let it pass without his signature, but it was ruled unconstitutional two years later and repealed. Bush told an attendee at an Iowa event on June 17, 2015, his real goal had been to focus on the responsibility those absent men bore. "I'm not in favor of shaming women. What I'm in favor of is shaming men who abandon their children," Bush said. "Women who bring up children by themselves do it heroically, they do it against all odds. Men who don't feel responsible for being part of their child's life create real strains on that family." Our ruling Ultraviolet claimed Bush "said low-income women should ‘get their life together and find a husband.’ " He did say that, back in 1994 during his first gubernatorial run, when the quote also was used against him by opponents. He was talking about putting a limit on a particular welfare program and doubled down on the concept that women would not be on welfare if they were married. The meme omits context and that the comments are more than 20 years old. But Bush did say that. So we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-12839	Terrorism and terrorist attacks in the United States and Europe have "gotten to a point where it's not even being reported."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-media-not-reporting-terrorism-a/	During a visit to U.S. Central Command headquarters in Tampa, President Donald Trump took a shot at one of his favorite targets -- the media. This time, he blamed the media for letting Islamic terrorists get away with attacks without covering them. "Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11, as they did from Boston to Orlando, to San Bernardino and all across Europe," Trump said. "You've seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe, it's happening. It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported, and in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that." The remark quickly inspired puzzled reactions. Is it accurate? Before we start, it’s worth noting that terrorism happens every day somewhere in the world -- dozens of attacks around the globe each day, according to the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database. Media outlets could cover terrorism attacks from far-flung locales around the clock and not have any space left for other news. "Due to geography, terrorism in the West is overreported compared to terrorism elsewhere," said Benjamin H. Friedman, a research fellow in security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. "The vast majority occurs in the non-western world, generally amid civil wars, and those attacks receive far less coverage than ones closer to home." But recent attacks on U.S. soil -- including the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, Calif., and the 2016 attacks on an Orlando nightclub, a New York City street and a college campus in Columbus, Ohio -- have received heavy media attention, often including live coverage for hours at a time and continuing coverage for days afterward. Europe, the other locale Trump mentioned, has had a number of big attacks in recent years as well, including major incidents in Paris, Brussels and the French city of Nice. These attacks have also received extensive coverage in the United States. Experts who study terrorism told PolitiFact that, in general, terrorist attacks in the United States or Europe do get covered, though the extent of the coverage can vary based on the severity of the attack and whether there are casualties. "Attacks are always reported, in my experience, somewhere," said Bruce Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University. The exceptions, he said, may include "failed plots, aborted plans, or bombs that failed to explode." John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org, agreed. "There are some incidents of such trivial nature that local authorities are hard put to decide whether it is terrorism or hooliganism," Pike said. "But if an American or European civilian or officer is seriously injured or killed, it gets reported." The White House didn’t offer any elaboration, but the strongest defense of Trump’s remark came from Ted Bromund, a foreign policy specialist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. While Bromund said he doesn’t believe the media has failed to report attacks, as Trump asserted in Tampa, he added that he sees "ample evidence that the nature of the attacks has been downplayed." Often, this has come from the media reporting on the words of political leaders, as in the case of a statement by President Barack Obama in February 2015 in which he called a shooting at a Kosher supermarket in Paris "random." For years, the Obama administration officially labeled the shootings at Ft. Hood, Texas, "workplace violence" rather than domestic terrorism, even though it was committed by Nidal Hasan, who had become an Islamic radical. And more generally, Obama, as Trump and others have often noted, went out of his way to avoid specific rhetorical references to Islamic terrorism, favoring instead broader terms like "violent extremism." Bromund said he reads Trump’s comments -- which, he said, "are admittedly not fully clear" -- as being "a statement of the obvious: Leading politicians, and many media outlets, have been very hesitant to describe terrorist attacks as being motivated by radical Islamism, very eager to come up with other explanations for those attacks, and even more hesitant to acknowledge that there is any relationship at all -- even a perverted one -- between radical Islamism and Islam itself." Still, it’s worth noting that it’s not always clear-cut whether an attack was driven purely by religious ideology or by a combination of factors -- and law-enforcement officials aren’t always definitive, either. For instance, in September 2014, Alton Nolen of Moore, Okla., attacked two co-workers with a knife, killing one and wounding the other. His social media accounts suggested an interest in ISIS and beheadings, but he also had long-standing workplace conflicts, and it was not clear that religion was the primary motivation. Ismaayil Brinsley, the man who police said ambushed and killed two New York Police Department officers in Brooklyn in December 2014, had some jihadist connections in his social media accounts but also was dealing with a variety of personal demons, including mental health issues. In the meantime, some argue that -- if anything -- terrorism inspires too much media coverage. "Due to its sensational nature, it’s over-reported compared to other forms of violence and causes of death that kill more people," said Friedman of Cato. "Media has a strong incentive to focus on scary political violence – the aphorism ‘if it bleeds, it leads’ is a sound business principle in news media, especially television." Failing to report on terrorist attacks is actually something Trump has done himself, said Barnett R. Rubin, associate director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. Trump has not yet personally commented on the recent shooting that killed six and injured five at a Mosque in Quebec City. News reports have noted that the alleged shooter is white and had expressed xenophobic sentiments. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that Trump had spoken to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying it was a "senseless act of violence that cannot be tolerated" but that it was best to be "cautious to draw conclusions on the motives at this stage in the investigation." Our ruling Trump said that terrorism and terrorist attacks in the United States and Europe have "gotten to a point where it's not even being reported." We found no support for the idea that the media is hushing up terrorist attacks on U.S. or European soil. The media may sometimes be cautious about assigning religious motivation to a terrorist attack when the facts are unclear or still being investigated. But that’s not the same as covering them up through lack of coverage. There is plenty of coverage of in the American media of terrorist attacks.

pomt-03083	UPS left 15,000 employees’ spouses "without health insurance" and told them to, "go on an exchange with no employer subsidy."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/26/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-policy-change-ups-left-employees-spo/	During his marathon Senate floor speech opposing President Barack Obama’s health care law, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, cited an example of an employer cutting back on health coverage as a result of the law. Cruz said: "Just a few weeks ago, UPS sent a letter to some 15,000 employees saying, ‘We are dropping spousal health insurance because of Obamacare.’ That is 15,000 UPS employees who had insurance for their husbands and wives, and suddenly those husbands and wives are left without health insurance and being told, ‘Go on an exchange with no employer subsidy.’ " We thought we’d check exactly what UPS, the major package carrier, did with its health insurance coverage. The full memo announcing the decision can be found here. Here are the key elements: • If a UPS employee is on the company’s plan and their spouse is employed at a different company that offers health insurance, the spouse will no longer be eligible for the UPS plan and must purchase insurance from their own employer. • If a UPS employee is on the company’s plan and their spouse is not employed by a company that offers health insurance (or isn’t employed at all, or is on a government plan such as Medicare), then the spouse will remain on the UPS plan. • The company estimates that of the 77,000 UPS employees who are enrolled in UPS health insurance, about 33,000 currently have spouses enrolled in the plan. Of those, the company estimates that 15,000 current UPS spousal enrollees may have to take their employer’s coverage -- roughly one in five of all enrollees. • Spouses whose employers offer medical insurance but do not offer prescription drug coverage or behavioral health benefits will not be allowed to remain on the UPS plan. • After the change, if a spouse shifts from being unemployed (and thus eligible for the UPS plan) to a job with insurance coverage, they must drop the UPS coverage and take their new employer’s coverage. • Children may remain on the UPS plan. If both parents have plans from different companies, the parents can choose which plan will cover their children. Stepchildren who are children of a spouse being removed from the UPS plan may remain on the UPS plan. • The UPS memo specifically cited Obamacare as a factor in its decision: "Limiting plan eligibility is one way to manage ongoing health care costs. … This change is consistent with the way many large employers are responding to the costs associated with the health care reform legislation." So UPS did change its policy on insuring spouses of employees, a change that will affect an estimated 15,000 people. But Cruz is wrong that the UPS spouses would be "without health insurance" and would have to "go on an exchange with no employer subsidy." In reality, the only spouses that would be removed from the UPS plan would be those that already had an option of purchasing employer coverage. They wouldn’t be without health insurance. They wouldn’t have to go on an Obamacare exchange. And their employer would be paying part of their premiums. Our ruling Cruz said that by dropping spousal health insurance for 15,000 employees, UPS left employees’ spouses "without health insurance" and told them to, "go on an exchange with no employer subsidy." But Cruz ignores that the only spouses being kicked off the UPS plan would be the ones who already had access to an employer-sponsored plan in their own job. This means they wouldn’t be "without health insurance" and wouldn’t have to find coverage on an Obamacare marketplace. We rate the claim False.

pomt-03606	"Over the last 10 years, Texas created 33 percent of the net new jobs nationwide."	true	/texas/statements/2013/may/09/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-accounted-33-percent-nations/	In a May 9, 2013, advertisement, Gov. Rick Perry offered President Barack Obama a "handy checklist" about job creation to take back to Washington, D.C. The ad, which Perry’s campaign placed in the Austin American-Statesman the day Obama came to Austin to stress economic issues, said the checklist includes low taxes, lawsuit abuse reform, predictable and effective regulations, balanced budgets and accountable schools and a competitive workforce. And an indicator that the "Texas model" works, the ad said, is that while the U.S. lost 2.5 million net new jobs over the past five years, Texas created 530,000 net new jobs. Also, the ad said: "Over the last 10 years, Texas created 33 percent of the net new jobs nationwide." Texas has had a healthy economy compared with most other states. Still, we were curious if one in three of the nation’s net new jobs over the past 10 years was gained in Texas. By email, Perry spokesman Josh Havens referred to information attributed to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicating that Texas reaped more than 1.75 million net new jobs from March 2003 to March 2013, a period in which the United States as a whole accounted for 5.3 million net new jobs, Havens said. To our inquiry, a regional economist for the bureau, Cheryl Abbot, confirmed the net job gain figures provided by Havens. According to a spreadsheet she emailed our way, Texas topped 42 states with net job gains in the period, considerably outdistancing the No. 2 jobs-gainer, New York, which had a net gain of 458,000 jobs. States with net losses were Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio and Rhode Island. Among the states, Texas had the third-greatest percentage gain in jobs over the decade, 19 percent, trailing North Dakota (33 percent increase) and Utah (21 percent), the spreadsheet indicates. By email and in a telephone interview, though, Abbot said the bureau steers clear of using its employment estimates to declare how much of any national job gains are attributable to net job gains in individual states. That judgment has to do with technical difficulties comparing the results of surveys undertaken state by state to research intended to have national sweep, she said. Regardless, she said, "Texas has been a very powerful job creator; during the period, the state created 1.75 million net jobs – and that was equal to one-third of the net jobs created nationwide," which is slightly different from saying the state accounted for 33 percent of national net jobs gained. We sent Perry’s office the bureau’s standing cautionary note about using its figures to reach conclusions about how much each state contributes to national job gains. Havens replied: "The bottom line is, this is the most accurate way available to compare any single state’s job growth to the nation as a whole." We also tried a different way of gauging the degree that Texas job gains fit the national picture by adding up each state’s net job gains as estimated by the bureau. This delivered a slightly higher total for national jobs gained, 5.5 million. Dividing the 1.75 million net jobs gained in Texas into the higher total leaves Texas accounting for 32 percent of the nation’s net jobs gained. We also asked Jason Abrevaya, who chairs the University of Texas Department of Economics, to review the bureau figures. He said by email that they seem to hold up. If Texas had been performing at the average nationwide from 2003 to 2013, he added, one "would expect the state to account for roughly 8 percent," rather than 33 percent, of the net job changes, since Texas accounts for about 8 percent of the nation’s jobs. Our ruling Perry said: "Over the last 10 years, Texas created 33 percent of the net new jobs nationwide." That conclusion is supported by comparing state-by-state job gain estimates and a separate calculation of net job gains nationally, both by the federal government. This might be an imperfect way to explore this facet, but there also don't appear to be better approaches. We rate the claim as True.

pomt-02327	Says Sen. Thad Cochran "voted to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on ... the Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska instead of shifting the money to repair a bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/27/chris-chocola/did-mississippi-sen-thad-cochran-spurn-katrina-bri/	Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran was first elected to Congress in 1972, and was elected to the Senate six years later. But at age 76, Cochran is facing stiff competition for another term from a primary opponent -- Republican state Sen. Chris McDaniel. Cochran has long wielded influence as a senior appropriator, helping distribute federal dollars for projects back home. But McDaniel, a tea party favorite, is trying to turn that longtime asset against Cochran. In this quest, McDaniel is getting some support from low-tax, low-spending groups such as the Club for Growth. The club’s president, former Rep. Chris Chocola, R-Ind., recently penned an editorial in the Mississippi Conservative Daily supportive of McDaniel. One of Chocola’s claims caught our eye: "Sen. Cochran loves the power of pork so much that he once voted to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on probably the most famous pork project of all — the Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska — instead of shifting the money to repair a bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina. That’s a fact." Did a Gulf Coast lawmaker really spurn an urgent bridge-rebuilding effort in his own region for a widely reviled project in Alaska? We were suspicious, so we decided to take a look. The "Bridge to Nowhere" was a derisive nickname for a nearly $233 million bridge that would have connected the tiny Alaska city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport. The project became a national symbol of wasteful earmark spending back in 2003, until lawmakers ultimately killed it. Our friends at FactCheck.org put together a nice timeline of the "Bridge to Nowhere" saga when it became an issue in the 2008 presidential race. One of the episodes they included was a Senate debate in October 2005 -- shortly after Katrina hit, but a few years before the project was decisively shuttered. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., proposed an amendment to a transportation appropriations bill to strip funds earmarked for the Gravina bridge (and another Alaska bridge known as Knik Arm) and send them instead to Louisiana to rebuild the I-10 Twin Span bridge, which had sustained major damage from Katrina. Republican Sen. Ted Stevens -- who was both an Alaskan and a top Senate appropriator -- threatened to quit if the amendment passed, vowing, "I will be taken out of here on a stretcher." "I will put the Senate on notice — and I don't kid people — if the Senate decides to discriminate against our state, to take money only from our state, I'll resign from this body," Stevens said. "This is not the Senate I came to. This is not the Senate I've devoted 37 years to, if one senator can decide he'll take all the money from one state to solve a problem of another." Ultimately, Stevens prevailed, as the amendment failed by an overwhelming 15-82 margin, with Cochran voting against the amendment. Instead, the Senate soon voted to strip the bridge funding and give it instead to the Alaska Department of Transportation to be used as the department saw fit, either to build the two controversial bridges or for some other transportation purpose. That bill passed 93-1, with Cochran voting for the bill. The vote was widely seen as a way of upholding the traditional way of handling appropriations and lawmaker-backed projects. "Certainly all the appropriators banded together, along with most other members," said Steve Ellis, a vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that supported Coburn’s amendment. "I don’t think Cochran was afraid of Stevens. But philosophically, he agreed." Still, we’ll offer a bit of additional context. The effort to rebuild the I-10 Twin Span didn’t simply die after Coburn’s amendment was voted down. If anything, it was fast-tracked, and Cochran played a role in that. In December 2005, Congress passed the final version of the defense appropriations bill that included $629 million for the Louisiana bridge. "He fought that fight for months before the bill was finally signed into law," said Chris Gallegos, a spokesman for Cochran. A few months later, in April 2006, Time magazine ran a story crediting Cochran’s efforts at securing Katrina-related funding. "When the Louisiana congressional delegation publicly demanded a staggering $250 billion from the government to rebuild the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina, the move completely backfired," the magazine wrote. "It angered GOP conservatives, who then spent the next two months pushing for cuts in the budget and ignoring Louisiana and Mississippi. But then Mississippi Republican Thad Cochran got tough on behalf of his state. In a closed-door meeting last December, several Republican senators were talking about how to pass quickly a key bill that would provide money for the Defense Department so lawmakers could head home for the holidays. Cochran simply announced that ‘this bill won't pass’ unless it includes money for the Gulf Coast. ... "On Katrina, Cochran, along with other Gulf Coast lawmakers, created a detailed list of the region's essential needs that totaled about $35 billion. He then had dozens of meetings with other lawmakers, emphasizing how badly the region needed the money but never publicly blasting Congress for moving too slowly. In the end, he got $29 billion out of his colleagues, almost double the money (President George W.) Bush and congressional leaders had initially pledged." Construction on the new, 5.5-mile bridge, paid for in large part with Federal Highway Administration money, began on June 1, 2006. Building proceeded in several stages to allow traffic on the vital artery to continue flowing. The first structure was completed by April 7, 2010, and the second was finished by Sept. 8, 2011. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal inaugurated it by cutting a ribbon, allowing a 1940 Ford Tudor Deluxe, a 1971 Buick Regal, antique Chevrolets, a vintage fire truck and a Textron Marine & Land Systems armored car to cross from Slidell to New Orleans. Total price tag: $803 million, the most expensive single public works project in Louisiana history. Our ruling Chocola said Cochran "voted to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on ... the Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska instead of shifting the money to repair a bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina." Cochran did vote that way on a specific amendment. But just a few weeks later, Cochran played a key role in securing funding for the I-10 Twin Span bridge. It's misleading to suggest that Cochran supported the Bridge to Nowhere but not the project that was in his own neighborhood. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-01198	"The U.S. Constitution owes its notion of democracy to the Iroquois Tribes."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/02/facebook-posts/viral-meme-says-constitution-owes-its-notion-democ/	Shortly before Thanksgiving, a reader sent us a social media meme of the type that sends you scrambling back to your high school history textbook wondering, "Did my teacher mention this?" The meme features the following claim: "The U.S. Constitution owes its notion of democracy to the Iroquois Tribes, including freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and separation of powers in government. Only difference is the Iroquois included women and non-whites." It’s accompanied by a reproduction of Junius Brutus Stearns’ 1856 painting of the founding fathers signing the United States Constitution in 1787. We zeroed in on the meme’s underlying premise, that "the U.S. Constitution owes its notion of democracy to the Iroquois Tribes." As it turns out, this topic has inspired a passionate debate among historians for more than three decades. But we did find agreement among historians that the meme oversells its central point. The historical background Some four centuries ago, the nations of the Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, people united in a confederacy to establish peace in what is now upstate New York. The system of unified governance between the Mohawk, Seneca, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga and eventually the Tuscarora people enabled the Iroquois to become arguably the predominant Native American tribe in the northeastern United States prior to the arrival of European colonists. The similarity between the Iroquois federal-style government and the one the American colonists settled on after they wrote the Constitution has long intrigued historians. Could the Iroquois system of governance have been the inspiration for the United States’ newborn republic? Interest in this question crescendoed around the time of the 1987 bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution. Historians held conferences to sift through the evidence, and the U.S. Senate passed a resolution saying that "the confederation of the original 13 colonies into one republic was influenced by the political system developed by the Iroquois Confederacy, as were many of the democratic principles which were incorporated into the constitution itself." The topic has proven to be a polarizing one. Some supporters of the notion of Iroquois influence say that the historical establishment is reluctant to give Native Americans credit where credit is due. Skeptics counter that the evidence is largely circumstantial. "On balance, the consensus appears to be that although British North Americans were certainly aware of the confederal nature of the Iroquois government, the case for causation has not been made," wrote Alison LaCroix, a law professor at the University of Chicago, in The Ideological Origins of American Federalism, published in 2010. The case for Iroquois influence Scholars told PolitiFact that there are two broad areas of support for the notion that the Iroquois had a degree of influence on the Constitution. • Similarities in government structure. The Iroquois system, like the United States government of the past 200-plus years, was federal in nature -- the five or six individual tribes handled their own affairs, as the American states eventually would, and those tribes came together to form an overarching government to address issues of common importance. The Iroquois system also had aspects of representational democracy. "It is highly probable that Anglo-Americans during the revolutionary era looked to Haudenosaunee governance as a model of a successful collective polity, and borrowed elements of Haudenosaunee practice in developing revolutionary American constitutional governments," said Jon W. Parmenter, a Cornell University historian and author of The Edge of the Woods: Iroquoia, 1534-1701. • The colonists and members of the founding generation were aware of the Iroquois. The colonists knew about the Iroquois from holding diplomatic talks with them, and the revolutionary generation admiringly adopted some of their symbols, such as the Mohawk Indian costumes worn by participants in the Boston Tea Party. We know that in 1744, Canassatego, an Onondaga chief, addressed representatives from Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia at a treaty conference in Lancaster, Pa. "We heartily recommend Union and a good Agreement between you our Brethren," he said. "Never disagree, but preserve a strict Friendship for one another, and thereby you, as well as we, will become the stronger. Our wise Forefathers established Union and Amity between the Five Nations; this has made us formidable; this has given us great Weight and Authority with our neighbouring Nations. We are a powerful Confederacy; and, by your observing the same Methods our wise Forefathers have taken, you will acquire fresh Strength and Power; therefore whatever befalls you, never fall out one with another." Benjamin Franklin noticed and published these remarks, and they were "noticed by patriots," wrote the late Temple University anthropologist Elisabeth Tooker, generally a skeptic on the idea of Iroquois influence. Franklin, for his part, remarked at one point that if "six Nations of ignorant Savages" were "capable of forming a Scheme for such a Union," then the new nation of European origin should be able to as well. This is none too flattering a reference, but it does provide additional evidence that the founding generation was aware of the Iroquois example. About a decade after Canassatego’s speech, Franklin was involved in crafting the Albany plan, an early, pre-revolution attempt to unify the colonies that in some ways mirrors the Iroquois example. The structure of Iroquois government was also heard periodically during the debates over the Constitution in the 1780s, according to Donald A. Grinde, Jr., a historian at the University of Buffalo and co-author, with Bruce E. Johansen, of Exemplar of Liberty: Native America and the Evolution of Democracy. Grinde writes that James Wilson's notes on the constitutional convention mention Indian governance, as does John Adams’ 1787 volume, Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States, which was published on the eve of the convention. Adams, who would later become the second president elected under the current Constitution, was less enamored of the Indian example than Franklin was, but he nonetheless thought Indian governance worthy of study and consideration. The case against Iroquois influence Despite this, many scholars have concluded that the evidence is short of convincing. • The Iroquois government is in some ways radically different than the U.S. government. For starters, the Iroquois’ federal system arguably bears more resemblance to the United Nations than the American federal system, focusing primarily on diplomacy. The Iroquois council "was particularly concerned with matters of alliance, with the continuing firm alliance of the five member nations and alliances with other nations. It did not concern itself with the internal relations of the constituent nations," Tooker noted in a 1988 paper. More important, the Iroquois system is based on hereditary positions and clan-based leadership -- elements that are entirely foreign to the United States’ system (and arguably seem more similar to the British system the colonists were trying to escape). The Iroquois League’s governmental power was vested in a council of 50 chiefs known as sachems. Each sachem had a title that was essentially hereditary, and each of these titles belonged to a particular clan within a particular tribe. (The meme does have a point about the role of women: The successor to a League chief was chosen by the "clan mother," the senior woman of the clan.) The division of council seats was fixed, but without any relation to the member nation’s population size. Meanwhile, as the council’s "firekeepers," the Onondagas had the the responsibility of presenting the matter to be discussed, Tooker wrote. And the council acted based on consensus, rather than by majority rule, as became the system under the Constitution of 1787. "There is little in this system of governance the Founding Fathers might have been expected to copy," Tooker wrote. "It is doubtful, for example, that the delegates to the Constitutional Convention meeting during the legendary long, hot Philadelphia summer of 1787 would have proposed a system under which only their relatives could become members of Congress, and a system under which each legislator was chosen by a close female relative of the previous holder of the office. Nor does it seem likely -- even if John Adams had heeded his wife's admonition to ‘remember the ladies’ -- that if such a hereditary system had been adopted, the Constitutional Convention would have opted for matrilineal inheritance of office, which by its very nature excludes a son from succeeding to his father's position." • Even if there was some Iroquois influence, it wasn’t the primary shaper of the Constitution. This is where the Facebook meme really overplays its hand. You don’t have to be a total denier of Iroquois influence to acknowledge that the meme goes too far when it says "the U.S. Constitution owes its notion of democracy to the Iroquois Tribes." The traditionally cited sources of inspiration for the drafters, including ancient Greek and prior European thought, played a significant role -- almost certainly a decisive one. "Even if the Iroquois Confederation was similar to the Constitution, which it was not, and even if some Americans admired aspects of Indian culture, that does not mean the Framers emulated Native American systems," said Stewart Jay, a University of Washington law professor and author of Mortal Words: A History of the U.S. Constitution: Volume 1, Origins to World War II. Jay added that more broadly, the democratic nature of the U.S. Constitution was greatly refined and extended by the civil rights amendments adopted after the Civil War, which were hardly conceived with Iroquois principles in mind. Gautham Rao, an American University historian and author of the forthcoming At The Water’s Edge: Commerce, Governance and the Origins of the American State, concurred. "It is a fairly important idea that a great many societies and networks influenced American constitutional thought, the Iroquois among them," Rao said. "But it is not true that the concept of ‘democracy’ embodied in the U.S. Constitution was directly suggested by the Iroquois." Our ruling The Facebook meme said "the U.S. Constitution owes its notion of democracy to the Iroquois Tribes." There’s a grain of truth here: The Iroquois system of government was known to 18th century leaders in the colonies and the new republic, and it shared some similarities with post-revolutionary attempts at governance. However, the meme overstates the consensus among historians. Major elements of the Iroquois system are altogether absent in the U.S. government, including hereditary, clan-based governance, and the meme focuses on Iroquois influences to the exclusion of European precedents that are at least as important, and likely more so.

pomt-04904	Mitt Romney is proposing a tax plan "that would give millionaires another tax break and raises taxes on middle class families by up to $2,000 a year."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/03/barack-obama/obama-romney-would-cut-millionaires-taxes/	You comparison shop for cans of tuna. Mitt Romney rides on Donald Trump’s jet. A new Obama campaign ad shows those scenes to hammer at the lifestyle differences between struggling middle-class Americans and the Republican presidential candidate. Then it takes aim at Romney’s economic proposals. "Now he has a plan," the ad says, "that would give millionaires another tax break and raises taxes on middle-class families by up to $2,000 a year." We know from our previous reporting on Romney’s tax plan that it offers across-the-board cuts, including for the very wealthy. But a new independent study offers broader perspective on how taxpayers at all income levels would be affected by Romney’s plan. So we decided to take a look. Romney’s tax "plan" We need to be clear from the start that the problem independent analysts, journalists and fact-checkers have with digging into Romney's tax plan is that much of the "plan" isn't yet known. Romney has suggested general parameters: • The rate cuts would be paid for without adding to the deficit. • People at the high end "will still pay the same share of the tax burden they’re paying now." • Everyone would see tax rate reductions. He has outlined specific tax cuts on his campaign website. They include: cutting marginal rates by 20 percent on a permanent, across-the-board basis; eliminating interest, dividend and capital gains taxes for taxpayers earning less than $200,000; eliminating the estate tax; and repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax. Romney would also cut the corporate rate to 25 percent. To offset those cuts, Romney has hinted that he would eliminate some common tax write-offs and deductions for people with high incomes. The effect of Romney's plan Knowing all that, the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution that evaluates tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates, examined the effect of Romney’s tax rate cuts combined with the elimination of several common tax deductions. Those include the mortgage interest deduction, charitable giving deduction and the exclusion for health insurance. The center published its findings on Aug. 1, 2012. To try and keep with Romney's guiding principles, the authors eliminated deductions and write-offs -- starting with the deductions for top earners first -- until they came up with enough revenue to offset the $360 billion in tax cuts that are part of Romney's plan. They determined that people who earn $1 million or more in taxable income would see an average net tax decrease of $87,117. They’d save $175,961 from Romney's tax cut, but lose $88,444 in deductions. "They would still get a tax cut," said Adam Looney, one of the authors. "The dollar value of the tax cuts is just way bigger than the mortgage interest and other deductions. There’s no way to implement this plan in a way that doesn’t result in a pretty big tax cut for that group (those making more than $1 million)." People who earn between $500,000 and $1 million would see a cut of about $17,000, and taxes for people with incomes between $200,000 and $500,000 would decrease by about $1,800, the study found. But to make Romney's plan revenue neutral, deductions would also have to be removed for people with incomes below $200,000, and the effects of that would be significant, the study found. In fact, the elimination of the deductions would mean outright tax increases for everyone with incomes below $200,000. People with taxable income between $50,000 and $75,000, for example, would see an average net tax increase of $641. They’d save $984 from Romney's rate cut, but lose $2,672 in write-offs. The authors specifically noted that taxpayers with children whose income is below $200,000 would see their taxes go up by an average of $2,041 -- the figure highlighted in Obama’s ad. The reason for the increase is that the most popular tax breaks heavily benefit middle- and lower-income families, the 95 percent of the population earning less than $200,000 who carry mortgage debt and use employer-provided health insurance. And though Romney has suggested he would focus on taking the deductions away from the wealthy, the study concluded that alone would not make up the difference of the revenue sacrificed when rates are slashed. "Somebody has to foot the bill for those tax cuts," Looney said. "You have to tap into middle- and lower-income households." Bottom line: the study found that Romney couldn't keep all his goals based on what we know about his plan. Romney campaign’s response When the study appeared online, the Romney campaign posted a response on its website that did not specifically address the discrepancy. "President Obama continues to tout liberal studies calling for more tax hikes and more government spending. We've been down that road before – and it's led us to 41 straight months of unemployment above 8 percent," said Romney spokesman Ryan Williams. Looney is a senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings who has a Ph.D. from Harvard University. He served on Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers in 2009 and 2010. William Gale, another of the authors, is vice president of Brookings and director of its economic studies program. He served on President George H.W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers. Lanhee Chen, the Romney campaign’s policy director, later added in a press release that the study ignored the corporate tax rate cut Romney proposes and his deficit reduction plan. "These glaring gaps invalidate the report’s conclusions," Chen said. The Romney campaign said that the study ignored the assertion that lower tax rates will grow the economy -- which they say will translate into more tax revenues. That will help make the plan revenue neutral even with lower overall tax rates. Spending cuts, likewise, could help balance the tax cuts without having to raise taxes on people making less than $200,000. The study, for the record, did consider that possibility but concluded it was impossible to evaluate the effect of spending cuts without knowing what would be cut. They also noted that "government spending tends to benefit low- and middle-income households." We find nothing in the study that distorts Romney’s proposals. It makes assumptions favorable to Romney, namely that his plan would lead to greater economic growth and raise revenues. The Tax Policy Center, whose director is another former adviser to Bush, is well-respected for its unbiased work, and even the Romney campaign praised it in November 2011 for offering "objective, third-party analysis." Our ruling Obama said Romney is proposing a tax plan "that would give millionaires another tax break and raises taxes on middle class families by up to $2,000 a year." The claims are based on a study by the Tax Policy Center, which used what Romney has said about his tax plan and attempted to calculate outcomes for different groups of taxpayers. The study prioritizes the idea that the plan would be revenue neutral. In that scenario, millionaires lose deductions, but the lower rates would still decrease their tax bill by an average of $87,000. Middle-class taxpayers would see lower tax rates, too, but the loss of exemptions and deductions would hit them harder. People making $200,000 or less a year would see their taxes rise by an average of about $2,000. The study is making the point that Romney’s plan is untenable: to cut rates that much without adding to the deficit, something has to give. It necessarily makes some assumptions, and therefore these conclusions are not definite as long as the details of the plan remain unknown. For that reason, people should be cautious in calling this Romney's plan. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-08-03T11:25:14	2012-08-01	['None']

pomt-02267	Says Charlie Crist supports "cuts to the Medicare Advantage program."	false	/florida/statements/2014/apr/09/republican-party-florida/charlie-crist-supports-medicare-advantage-cuts-rep/	Gov. Rick Scott used his visit to an assisted living facility in Tampa to create a campaign video to bash President Barack Obama over potential cuts to Medicare Advantage. Scott’s Republican Party of Florida goes a step further by portraying his likely Democratic opponent, former Gov. Charlie Crist, as an Obama supporter. "I stand against Charlie Crist because he supports President Obama and the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program," said the Republican Party of Florida on Facebook April 1. They repeated the claim again on Twitter on April 9. It’s a fact that Crist supports Obama -- and the Affordable Care Act. (We traced Crist’s various positions on the law in 2010.) But does Crist support cuts to Medicare Advantage? Background on Medicare Advantage In Florida, about 1.4 million seniors are on Medicare Advantage while roughly 4.4 million are in traditional Medicare. The health care law tries to bring down future health care costs of Medicare largely by reducing Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans that are run by private insurers. The hope was that the increased competition from the private sector would reduce costs. But those plans are actually costlier than traditional Medicare. So the health care law reduces payments to private insurers. Advantage plans are required to offer basic health benefits that are at least as rich as original Medicare. But many offer extras, such as rebates on premiums, routine dental care, gym memberships and rides to the doctor, in order to compete for business. When the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010, one of the attempts to pay for subsidized health insurance was to cut payments to the Medicare Advantage program to bring costs more in line with traditional Medicare. The Congressional Budget Office has predicted these cuts would save the government about $156 billion over a decade. What Crist has said about cutting Medicare Advantage We searched for statements Crist made about Medicare Advantage starting in 2009 when he was Florida’s Republican governor. We found Crist has actually opposed changes to Medicare Advantage over the years. In December 2009, Crist released a statement in support of an amendment by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to protect Medicare and Medicare Advantage. As you’ll see from his rhetoric, Crist opposed the health care law back then: "Cuts to Medicare would adversely affect Florida’s seniors who have paid into the program and rely on its services for their important health needs. ... Many of Florida’s seniors rely on Medicare Advantage for supplemental or increased benefit options. Stripping away a needed benefit from our seniors in order to move toward a single-payer system where bureaucrats are inserted between doctors and their patients is not the health reform Americans deserve." In July 2010 -- after he became an independent while running for U.S. Senate -- Crist released another statement about his position on the health care bill. Here is a portion: "Had I been in the United States Senate at the time, I would have voted against the bill because of unacceptable provisions like the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. But being an independent, I have the freedom to be an honest broker for the people of Florida without regard for political party, and the reality is this: despite its serious flaws, the Obama health care bill does have some positive aspects. Repeal must be accompanied by a responsible substitute....." In August 2010, he made a similar statement in which he said if he had been a senator, "I would have voted against the bill because of unacceptable provisions like the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program." Again he called for a "responsible substitute." Miami Herald politics reporter Marc Caputo wrote a column about Crist’s "Obamacare conundrum" in March 2014. Caputo quoted a statement by Crist: "I don’t support the cuts to Medicare Advantage. In every major law, there are things you like and things you don’t. The president and Congress should fix it." It’s not an unusual position to support the law and yet speak against changes for Medicare Advantage. In an election year, dozens of Democratic members of the House or Senate have spoken against Medicare Advantage rate reductions. At the time of RPOF’s claim, Medicare Advantage cuts were still on the table -- so we will limit our rating to information available at the time. However, we will note that after the federal government’s announcement that it would not reduce payments to Medicare Advantage, Crist tweeted on April 7: "Great to learn that @BarackObama is reversing cuts to Medicare Advantage. This is great news for Florida seniors." So what evidence does the Republican Party of Florida have that Crist supports the cuts? "If he supports the law, he supports all of it," including Medicare Advantage cuts, RPOF spokeswoman Susan Hepworth told PolitiFact Florida in an email. One final footnote about Crist and Medicare Advantage. The federal government is depending on savings from Medicare Advantage to offset the costs of the Affordable Care Act. So we asked the Crist campaign, if Crist is against the Medicare Advantage cuts, what would he recommend to achieve the needed savings? We did not hear any specific solutions from Crist campaign spokesman Kevin Cate. "It’s the responsibility of the president and Congress to fix any cuts to Medicare Advantage," Cate said. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said Crist supports "cuts to the Medicare Advantage program." Crist has flip-flopped on a lot of issues, including the federal health care law. He used to oppose the Affordable Care Act, but now he supports it. The law tries to bring down future health care costs by reducing Medicare Advantage payments. But on the issue of Medicare Advantage, Crist has actually been consistent: He's been critical of the Medicare Advantage cuts for years. He specifically said he opposed the reductions in 2009 and 2010, and he still opposes them today. Crist doesn’t appear to have come up with other ways to save money on health care without reducing payments to Medicare Advantage. But our purpose here is to fact-check the claim that he supports the cuts, and we found no proof that he does. We rate this claim False.

pomt-09869	A former Clinton administration official and other economists agree that "if you keep extending these temporary unemployment benefits, you're just going to extend joblessness even more."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/04/michelle-malkin/michelle-malkin-says-former-clinton-official-says-/	It's a conundrum of compassion: If you provide someone with unemployment benefits, does he lose the incentive to find a job? On the Aug. 2, 2009, edition of ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos, conservative blogger Michelle Malkin asserted that even a liberal economist believes that unemployment benefits have a negative impact on joblessness because those benefits discourage people from taking jobs. "It was Larry Katz, who was the chief labor economist under the Clinton Labor Department, who came out with a study, and there are a lot of these smart economists who say this – that if you keep extending these temporary unemployment benefits, you're just going to extend joblessness even more," she said. Stephanopoulous expressed skepticism at the idea that Americans would choose "to take the unemployment benefits when a job is available." But Malkin was undeterred. "Well, it's 79 weeks already," she said. "And then they're going to extend it by another 13 weeks. And what happens is, according to these economists who have seen it, including this Clinton economist, is that people will just delay getting a job until the three weeks before the benefits run out." Malkin's fellow panelists joined Stephanopoulos in pushing back against Malkin's assertion. "But when businesses advertise the few job openings they have — they'll advertise 20 openings — they have 6,000 applicants," said Cynthia Tucker of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution . "So I don't think that's the problem at the moment." We decided to see if Malkin was correct. We contacted Katz, now a Harvard professor, and he said Malkin was probably referring to two papers he co-wrote in 1990 with fellow economist Bruce D. Meyer. One, "The Impact of the Potential Duration of Unemployment Benefits on the Duration of Unemployment," was published in the Journal of Public Economics in February 1990. The other, "Unemployment Insurance, Recall Expectations and Unemployment Outcomes," was published in The Quarterly Journal of Economics , in November 1990. We looked at the papers, and the first seems especially on point. The paper noted that in certain European countries, generous unemployment benefit policies often had a strong correlation with high rates of long-term unemployment. After looking at U.S. unemployment data from 1979 to 1983, the authors concluded that "the potential duration of [unemployment insurance] benefits has a strong impact on the duration of the unemployment." In fact, the authors wrote, "an increase in potential benefit duration from 6 months to 1 year is predicted to increase mean duration of unemployment by 4-5 weeks, and an increase from 6 months to 2 years is predicted to generate a 13-16 week increase in unemployment duration." To scholars, this was not a shocking result: It confirmed other research, and it has regularly been cited in subsequent studies. So Malkin was correct in summarizing Katz's work. But there is a significant caveat: Katz himself argues that his two-decade-old finding isn't valid in today's recession. In fact, the day before Malkin went on the air, the New York Times ran a front-page story headlined, "Prolonged Aid to Unemployed Is Running Out" that happened to quote Katz. The article said: "Traditionally, many economists have been leery of prolonged unemployment benefits because they can reduce the incentive to seek work. But that should not be a concern now because jobs remain so scarce, said Lawrence Katz, a labor economist at Harvard. For every job that becomes available, about six people are looking, Dr. Katz said. ‘Unemployment insurance gives income to families who are really suffering and can't find work even if they are hustling to look,' he said. With the economy still listing, he added, a temporary extension can provide a quick fiscal stimulus. And, Dr. Katz said, when people exhaust unemployment and health insurance, many end up applying for disability benefits, which become a large, unending drain on the Treasury." When we asked Katz about the discrepency between his remarks then and now, he explained that labor markets in the late 1970s and early 1980s were significantly different from today. Back then, it was common for companies making layoffs to later recall workers, and often workers accepted those jobs right as their benefits were coming to an end. Today, recalls rarely happen, and with the job market so tight, a job search can prove fruitless for many months. Most unemployed workers don't have the luxury of timing when they accept a job. For that reason, Katz told us in an interview, "I strongly favor extensions of UI benefits when the labor market is weak and the ratio of job seekers to job openings is very high" – in other words, like the situation is right now. As for Malkin's claim that other economists agreed with Katz' 1990 view that extending benefits merely prolongs unemployment, we found that they concurred that his old papers were sound — but they also agreed that the papers' conclusions aren't applicable to today's recession. They said that today's job market is so tight that if someone does turn down a job in order to remain on unemployment benefits, someone else who's unemployed will take that job instead, canceling out any extra time the first person stays on unemployment benefits. We spoke with several economists and found a consensus that the broader stimulative effect on the economy that comes from extending unemployment benefits outweighs any potential lengthening of how long some people choose to stay on unemployment. So let's review what Malkin said. She correctly characterized Katz's writings from nearly 20 years ago. However, due to the changed nature of the labor market in today's recession, neither Katz nor most economists we talked to believe that his findings have much relevance to the current situation. This undercuts Malkin's assertion that "there are a lot of these smart economists who say this – that if you keep extending these temporary unemployment benefits, you're just going to extend joblessness even more." For this reason, we rate her statement Half True.	None	Michelle Malkin	None	None	None	2009-08-04T18:04:17	2009-08-02	['Bill_Clinton']

pomt-02077	"Today, the five largest financial institutions are 38 percent bigger than they were back in 2008, when they were too big to fail."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/22/elizabeth-warren/elizabeth-warren-says-top-five-banks-are-38-percen/	Sen. Elizabeth Warren is making the rounds to promote her new book, A Fighting Chance. In addition to dispelling speculation about a presidential bid in 2016, the Massachusetts Democrat and former Harvard law professor continued to make a case for greater government intervention in the financial sector. On PBS Newshour May 19, 2014, Warren said there’s a need to "break up these banks," which have only gotten bigger since the financial collapse. "You know, you talked about during the financial crisis we were told these banks are too big to fail," Warren said. "Today, the five largest financial institutions are 38 percent bigger than they were back in 2008, when they were too big to fail." We found several other instances of Warren giving out this stat, and we thought it was worth a review. Doing the math Warren’s office said the anaylsis came from SNL Financial, a private bank researching firm, and they pointed us to a CNN article describing the report. It found assets from the top six banks were up 37 percent. That's six banks, not five, as Warren said, and the article was from September 2013, so it's a little outdated. Therefore, we decided to do the math ourselves. As we dug in, we realized there are two ways to interpret Warren’s statement. Was she comparing the current top five banks with their pre-recession size? Or was she comparing today’s top five to 2008’s top five? We decided to analyze it both ways. Here’s what we found when we looked at the top five banks in 2013 (the latest available data) and the top five of 2008 (we went with reported assets in the middle of the year, i.e. before Congress passed the bank bailout). Top five banks of 2013 Bank Total Assets JPMorgan Chase & Co. $2,415,689,000,000 Bank of America Corporation $2,104,995,000,000 Citigroup Inc. $1,880,382,000,000 Wells Fargo & Company $1,527,015,000,000 Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. $911,585,000,000 Total $8,839,676,000,000 Top five banks of 2008 Bank Total Assets Citigroup Inc. $2,100,385,000,000 JPMorgan Chase & Co. $1,775,670,000,000 Bank of America $1,723,269,816,000 Wachovia Corporation $812,443,000,000 Taunus Corporation $659,772,000,000 Total $6,411,757,816,000 If you do the math, the top five from the end of 2013 have 38 percent more assets than the top five banks of 2008. That would back up Warren’s claim. But let’s look at it the other way and compare today’s top five to their 2008 holdings. That gets us a different result. Bank Total Assets in 2013 Total assets in 2008 JPMorgan Chase & Co. $2,415,689,000,000 $1,775,670,000,000 Bank of America Corporation $2,104,995,000,000 $1,723,269,816,000 Citigroup Inc. $1,880,382,000,000 $2,100,385,000,000 Wells Fargo & Company $1,527,015,000,000 $609,074,000,000 Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. $911,585,000,000 $884,587,000,000* Total $8,839,676,000,000 $7,092,985,816,000 *Before 2009, Goldman Sachs was an investment group, not a bank holding company, so the data was not available through the Federal Reserve. The 2008 figure is taken from their in-house annual report. There’s still significant growth in those banks, but it’s about 25 percent, not 38 percent. It’s held back by Citigroup, which actually has fewer total assets than it did in 2008. Being in the top five doesn’t necessarily equate to "too big to fail," even though Warren seemed to imply as much. For example, Wachovia was a top five bank in 2008, and it no longer exists. It was absorbed by Wells Fargo during the fallout of the crisis. Warren’s comment "presumes simply that there is a threshold ‘too big to fail’ size, and implies that the top five having gotten bigger, they were already past that threshold, and (now) are even more ‘too big to fail,’ " said Satya Thallam, director of financial services policy at the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. "The size of financial institutions is not per se evidence of ‘too big to fail’ expectations." Other experts we spoke with echoed that sentiment. There are also other ways to measure bank size, such as total deposits, said Hester Peirce, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. "These are very tricky comparisons to make," Peirce said. "There’s not a clear way to measure how size has changed." How they got so big Warren does not mention how the banks grew, which experts we spoke with said is critical context. Let’s go back to the Wachovia/Wells Fargo example. In 2008, Wells Fargo was the sixth-largest bank, just outside Warren’s arbitrary cutoff. So a significant reason the top five have grown so much is from that one transaction, where two massive banks become one. And Wells Fargo/Wachovia is just one example. Lawrence White, a professor of economics at New York University, noted that Bank of America absorbed Merrill Lynch, which, at the end of 2007, had more than $1 trillion in assets, and JPMorgan Chase took on Bear Stearns, a top 15 financial institution before its collapse. During the financial crisis, the federal government was "desperate to have these banks merge," Peirce said. "That is a large contributing factor (in the growth of the top five)," she said. "I don’t think that’s the only thing that’s going on, but that’s one of the things that’s going on." That’s not to say these weren’t controversial decisions. Warren, for the record, opposed those efforts and has said they have made the "too big to fail" issue worse. But understanding how it happened is critical to forming an opinion on what the numbers actually mean. Peirce also said consolidation and growth among the top banks are not a new trend. In 2001, the five largest banks held about 27.5 percent of all assets; today it’s closer to 47 percent with the sharpest increases coming before the financial collapse. Our ruling Warren said, "the five largest financial institutions are 38 percent bigger than they were back in 2008, when they were too big to fail." Without fully understanding where her math was coming from, we had to find our own way to measure this. One way seemed to back her up in a narrowly defined time frame. A different method produced a lower number, though the trend is the same. Our experts took some issue with her loose characterization of "too big too fail" and some of the context she left out. But her underlying point is largely accurate. We rate her comment Mostly True.	None	Elizabeth Warren	None	None	None	2014-05-22T17:27:02	2014-05-19	['None']

pomt-02025	Due to actions by President Barack Obama, "the Burger King national headquarters announced this month that they will be pulling their franchises from our military bases."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/05/chain-email/burger-king-quitting-its-military-base-outlets-bec/	A reader recently forwarded us an email that bore some bad news for military families. "The Burger King national headquarters," the email said, "announced this month that they will be pulling their franchises from our military bases." The email continued, "Soon to follow will be Popeye's chicken, pizza franchises and the chain of barber and beauty shops which operates inside the gates of our military facilities. Reason? Obama's mandate that all companies who do business with the federal Government pay a $10.10 per hour minimum wage. … Alas, as with all things Obama, every time he does something to please his socialist friends, someone suffers. In this case it will be our military." (See the full text of the email here.) When we looked into it, we found that the email -- despite some over-the-top anti-Obama rhetoric -- was referencing a real issue. However, its most eye-catching claim -- that Burger King had announced it will be pulling its outlets from military bases -- was flat wrong. Let’s start with some background. Various fast-food restaurants operate at military bases in the United States and all over the world. The concerns raised in the email, which had been publicized by Republican lawmakers this spring, stem from two actions taken by the Obama administration that could affect how fast-food workers are compensated on some military bases. The first change is a 2013 determination by the Labor Department -- subsequently put on hold -- that fast food workers under federal contracts were due a $3.81-an-hour bump in compensation, something they had not qualified for previously. The second is a February 2014 executive order by Obama that mandated a $10.10 minimum wage for workers on federal contracts. Obama issued the order -- which doesn’t require congressional approval -- as a partial step after seeing his proposal for a $10.10 national minimum wage blocked in Congress. For technical reasons, fast-food workers on Army and Air Force bases are not affected. (Most Army and Air Force concessions are directly operated by the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, so fast-food workers on those bases are not under a federal contract.) However, outlets on Navy and Marine bases do operate by contract, and employers stand to be hit with significant pay increases for their lowest-paid workers (or put another way, workers stand to get a raise). The prospect that fast-food outlets could look at rising employee costs and choose to shutter their stores moved Russell Beland, deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for military manpower and personnel, to officially request a waiver of the compensation bump from the Labor Department. In addition, 40 Republican lawmakers, led by House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel Chairman Joe Wilson of South Carolina, wrote a letter in April warning Labor Secretary Tom Perez of the potential fallout. The lawmakers wrote, "Should these policy changes be fully implemented, we are concerned they will eliminate jobs, negatively impact recreational services on military bases, and limit the dining options for servicemen and women on military installations. … In addition, we understand that restaurants facing these additional labor costs have already determined that it would be cost prohibitive to offer military personnel these dining options and some may consider not renewing contracts and operations shutting down." A big part of the problem is that fast-food companies face a Catch-22. On the one hand, they would be forced to raise wages above what surrounding fast-food outlets pay. On the other hand, by law, they could not raise their prices above what those same surrounding fast-food outlets charge. So, unable to pass along the higher labor costs to customers, fast-food outlets would find their profits squeezed. The department appears to be listening. According to Military Times, a trade publication that covers the armed services, the Labor Department is "re-evaluating" wage determinations for fast-food workers and expects to "reissue industry-specific fast food wage determinations in the near future." (That would ease but not eliminate the problem -- it doesn’t appear that Obama’s $10.10 wage would be lifted under such an action.) How bad could the fallout be? Beland wrote that, without relief on the compensation increases, "up to 390 fast food concession operations would close on installations across the U.S. and its territories, with a loss of nearly 5,750 jobs, many held by military family members and veterans." This is a worst-case scenario. So far, the impact appears to be far more limited. Military Times reported that, according to the Pentagon, McDonald’s locations closed on three Navy bases in March, and Marine Corps officials said that another on a Marine base was slated to close. Another eatery, "I Love Country," closed at Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. That said, it’s not clear whether even these more limited closures were the direct result of the compensation increases (which hadn’t yet taken effect), or, for that matter, whether this rate of turnover is significantly higher than ordinary rates of closure on bases. "The specter of mass layoffs being raised is an illusion," George Faraday, policy director for Change to Win, a workers’ rights group, told the Fiscal Times. "If they care about the welfare of military spouses they should care about whether military spouses are making a living wage." Indeed, a 2013 survey by the National Employment Law Center, which supports higher wages, found that of 567 federal contract workers, 74 percent earned less than $10 an hour, and of these, nearly a quarter said they depended on Medicaid and one in seven said they used food stamps. So here’s what we have so far: Changes by the Obama administration could raise labor costs for fast-food restaurants on Navy and Marine bases (though not Army and Air Force bases). This could prompt some restaurants to leave, but there’s no sign of a mass exodus yet, and the Labor Department has pressed the pause button on a key part of the compensation increase. So what about the claim about Burger King picking up stakes? This part of the chain email is simply wrong. "No Burger King restaurants on military bases are being closed as part of a planned process or program," the company said in a statement to PolitiFact. "In the course of normal business, however, we and our franchisees continuously review the worldwide restaurant portfolio and make strategic decisions based on many factors including development opportunities, market conditions, restaurant profitability, lease length, overall brand presence and, in the case of military bases, troop movements." Our ruling The email said that due to actions by Obama, "the Burger King national headquarters announced this month that they will be pulling their franchises from our military bases." There is a legitimate question about whether compensation changes made by the administration could squeeze the profits of fast-food restaurants on Navy and Marine bases to the point where they feel the need to shutter their outlets. But the impact of such changes is speculative, and as far as the specific claim about Burger King is concerned, it’s pure fiction that the company announced a sweeping departure from military bases. We rate the claim False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2014-06-05T14:39:15	2014-06-05	['Burger_King', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-06385	"In the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it was the Democrats who cut $500 billion from Medicare. And they also put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2011/nov/01/allen-west/rep-allen-west-turns-talking-points-2010-health-ca/	Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West pulled out some familiar talking points on the 2010 health care law in a recent Fox News interview. It was Democrats who cut $500 billion from Medicare, he said. An unelected board will make decisions about health care for seniors and all Americans, he said. Similar statements by Republican politicians have earned rulings from Half True to False. But in the world of PolitiFact, specific word choice matters. How do West's words hold up? He spoke with Fox News host Neil Cavuto on Oct. 14, 2011. Here's part of their exchange: CAVUTO: "There's concern in your state, sir, that going after entitlements and going after the spending in entitlements, that you're going after granny, that you particularly are going after granny. And that's been the one thing the Democrats are trying to stick to you. What do you say?" WEST: "Well, they tried that. And, as a matter of fact, they have failed miserably, because, as a matter of fact, in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it was the Democrats who cut $500 billion from Medicare. And they also put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans." He then said he supported, instead, the premium support plan that's part of Rep. Paul Ryan's "Path to Prosperity." (Some Democrats have claimed the plan, which shifts the burden for rising health costs to seniors over time, eliminates Medicare. We've ruled that claim False.) We'll look at two claims from the interview, one at a time. The first is that, "In the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, it was the Democrats who cut $500 billion from Medicare." The second is that "they also put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans." Medicare cuts We've previously weighed statements that the 2010 health care law "cut Medicare." We've listed many among our sources for this item, but here are a few: The 60 Plus Association said the law "will cut $500 billion from Medicare. That will hurt the quality of our care." (We ruled that Mostly False.) On the campaign trail, Mitt Romney said "Obamacare takes $500 billion out of Medicare and funds Obamacare." (Half True) In Florida, Sen. Marco Rubio said, "The only people in this town that have voted to cut Medicare spending are the people who voted in favor of Obamacare. That’s a fact." (Mostly False.) In those fact-checks, we pointed out that the law doesn't take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. It attempts to slow the program's growth, trimming more than $500 billion in projected spending over a decade. Medicare spending will still increase, from $499 billion in 2009 to $929 billion in 2020. But those items include other context West doesn't include — he isn't talking about quality of care, for example. West didn't attempt to clarify that Democrats cut future spending, or cut the rate of growth. His spokeswoman, Angela Sachitano, provided evidence from the Congressional Budget Office and news sources that the reduction would result in lower projected Medicare spending over a decade. But West merely said "cut $500 billion from Medicare," a misleading oversimplification. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. 'Unelected bureaucrats' West's second claim, that the law "put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans," should also be familiar to loyal PolitiFact readers. Republican presidential candidate Rep. Michele Bachmann said something similar in an Oct. 11, 2011, debate: "These 15 political appointees (on the IPAB) will make all the major health care decisions for over 300 million Americans." We rated that False. Now, West's claim is more restrained. He doesn't say the board will make "all the major health care decisions," merely that it "will be making decisions about health care." So what is the board, and what is it tasked with? The health care law directs a new national board — with 15 members who are political appointees — to identify $15.5 billion in Medicare savings. It's forbidden from submitting "any recommendation to ration health care," as Section 3403 of the health care law states. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue. What it can do is reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of re-admissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some may argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives for giving chemotherapy to a Medicare patient, this could lead to an indirect form of rationing. But the board wouldn't make any health care decisions for individual Americans. And it wouldn't directly make decisions about health care "for all Americans." Instead, as PolitiFact Georgia has reported, it would make broad policy decisions that affect Medicare's overall cost. This statement also contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Our ruling West used two common talking points in his Fox News interview. The first, which we've checked repeatedly, is that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act "cut $500 billion from Medicare." The statement leaves out important details. The second, that the health care law "put in place the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 15 unelected bureaucrats, which will be making decisions about health care for our seniors and for all Americans," also ignores facts that would give a different impression. We recognize it's not always easy to give context in a fast-paced TV interview, but a just few more words ("will cut projected Medicare spending by" or "will be making decisions about Medicare spending") would have dramatically boosted West's truth quotient. Overall we find his claims Mostly False.

pomt-04860	Says U.S. Senate rival Eric Hovde "refused to pay his property taxes until he was taken to court."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/10/tommy-thompson/gop-senate-candidate-eric-hovde-didnt-pay-property/	Tommy Thompson and Eric Hovde continue bashing each other ahead of the Aug. 14, 2012 Republican primary for a Wisconsin U.S. Senate seat. In a TV ad released Aug. 3, 2012, the former governor says Hovde is "nothing like us." Then he makes several attacks on the political newcomer, including this one: "Hovde refused to pay his property taxes until he was taken to court." Let’s take a look. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported on the matter a few weeks before the ad began airing. In 2002, the City of Madison sued a Hovde family firm and other property owners over property taxes. After a judge ruled against Hovde’s firm, the firm settled the case in 2006 by paying the city $22,500 of the $35,900 the city had sought in court. Thompson’s evidence Asked for evidence to support the claim in the TV ad, Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir provided documents related to the lawsuit. That included a May 2002 letter from the city to Hovde’s firm that notes the basis for its action against the firm regarding one of its land parcels: "In 1996, the Wisconsin Legislature provided for the assessment of agricultural land based on its ‘use’ rather than its ‘market’ value. The goal was to keep land in agricultural use by reducing the property tax burden. A property tax penalty was created for converting agricultural land to another use." In other words, land that was being farmed would be assessed for property tax purposes based on its value as farmland, not on its value as property that could be developed. The difference, City of Madison treasurer Dave Gawenda told us, was key for farmland that borders developing areas. The property tax bill for land classified as farmland would easily be less than half of what it would be if the land were assessed based on its potential for development, he said. The letter to Hovde’s firm went on to order the firm to pay a $431 penalty for that particular parcel, given that the parcel was "changed from agricultural usage because the land was left fallow." So, for all the parcels involved in the lawsuit, Hovde’s firm had been paying lower property taxes based on the properties being classified for farming rather than some other type of usage, and the city was seeking penalties because the land wasn’t being used for farming. In December 2004, after the case against Hovde was consolidated with similar cases, Dane County Circuit Judge Michael Nowakowski issued the ruling that led to the settlement paid by Hovde’s firm. Siding with the city, the judge said the state law was intended to give farmers tax relief in order to preserve farmland, not as a "handout or windfall to the owners of agricultural land." Rather than going to trial, Hovde settled the case by paying a portion of the penalties the city sought. Hovde’s response When the Journal Sentinel article was published in July 2012, Hovde said he was unaware of the case until reporters told him about it, while his campaign spokesman, Sean Lansing, said Hovde "fought city hall over a tax structure that multiple businesses thought was unfair." When we asked Lansing to respond to Thompson’s claim, he reiterated the point about fighting city hall. He also said Hovde hadn’t refused to pay property taxes, but paid the settlement over the penalties after losing the court ruling. Hovde himself addressed the matter in two radio interviews. On Aug. 7, 2012, Hovde told conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee that the city, "even though we owned farmland, they wanted to assess the value at a fully developed property level." He equated the dispute to a homeowner contesting the assessed value of a home. The next day, Hovde told the morning show on WIBA-AM in Madison that "we ended up reaching a settlement. Every tax dollar was paid. I’ve paid every tax my whole life." Our rating Thompson stated: "Hovde refused to pay his property taxes until he was taken to court." Hovde’s firm didn’t refuse to pay property taxes, per se. But it did refuse to pay -- until losing a ruling in court -- penalties that were assessed for having the benefit of paying lower taxes without actually farming land, as required. We rate Thompson’s claim Mostly True.	None	Tommy Thompson	None	None	None	2012-08-10T13:25:55	2012-08-03	['United_States_Senate_election_in_Wisconsin,_2012', 'United_States']
pomt-14179	The Paris Agreement "is by far the largest number of countries ever to sign an international agreement on a single day."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/apr/26/ban-ki-moon/paris-agreement-sees-largest-number-countries-sign/	Using Earth Day as a backdrop on April 22, 2016, world leaders from 175 countries signed an historic agreement for climate change. Named for the city of Paris, the agreement was signed at the United Nations headquarters in New York. Senior adviser to President Barack Obama Brian Deese attempted put the agreement into perspective in a post on Medium: "Today, on Earth Day, nearly 170 countries will sign the Paris Agreement, reinforcing their commitment to the historic climate pact that was forged in December of last year. That’s the largest number of countries that have ever signed an international agreement in one day." United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon made a similar claim on the same day. "Today is an historic day," Ban told reporters at a press conference following the opening ceremony of the signing event in New York. "This is by far the largest number of countries ever to sign an international agreement on a single day." We wondered if Ban, and Deese were correct. The Paris Agreement was signed by leaders from 175 of the 193 countries in the United Nations. That is indeed a record, the United Nations confirmed. The previous benchmark was in 1982. "In 1982, 119 countries signed the Law of the Sea Treaty. That was the record until Friday," said Stéphane Dujarric, a United Nations spokesman. The Law of the Sea Treaty called for technology transfers and wealth transfers from developed to undeveloped nations. It also required parties to the treaty to adopt regulations and laws to control pollution of the marine environment. There are a few caveats worth mentioning. First, signing the agreement is not the end. The leaders must now go back to their home countries' governments to ratify and approve the agreement, which could take months or years. Fifteen countries ratified the agreement immediately -- Barbados, Belize, Fiji, Grenada, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Somalia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, State of Palestine and Tuvalu. Second, the record should be put into perspective. There are both more countries and more members of the United Nations today than ever. Until now, the 1987 Montreal Protocol was regarded as one of the most successful international treaties of all time. It was the first treaty in history to achieve universal ratification. It is has been ratified by every member of the United Nations and was ratified by 197 governments. This protocol deals with the protection of the Earth’s fragile ozone layer. This layer protects life on Earth from some of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays -- and, thanks to the treaty, is set to recover completely by around 2050. But the Montreal Protocol initially was signed by just 46 governments. The Paris Agreement goes into effect once 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions formally ratify the agreement. Among other things, the agreement proposes: a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels; to aim to limit the increase to 1.5°C; reduce the amount of global emissions, recognizing that the process will take longer in developing countries. Our ruling Ban said, the Paris Agreement "is by far the largest number of countries ever to sign an international agreement on a single day." That is correct, beating the previous record when 119 countries simultaneously signed the Law of the Sea Treaty in 1982. But there are two caveats. First, Signing does not equal ratification. Countries must still do that before the agreement takes effect. Second, it’s worth noting there are more independent nations today to sign an agreement than in year’s past.

pomt-11751	"Obama released 10 Russian agents from U.S. custody in 2010 during Hillary’s uranium deal."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/06/puppetstringnewscom/story-misleads-tying-obama-russian-spy-swap-hillar/	A headline points the finger at former President Barack Obama for releasing Russian agents. "Obama released 10 Russian agents from U.S. custody in 2010 during Hillary’s uranium deal," stated the Nov. 26 headline in Puppet String News. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. While Puppet String News is a fake news website, in this case the headline stems from real news. The Puppet String story linked to an October 2010 New York Times story which stated that Russian sleeper agents, arrested in the United States in the summer of 2010 and deported to Russia as part of a prisoner exchange, later received top government honors from President Dmitri Medvedev. In exchange for the Russian prisoners, Medvedev signed pardons for four men Russia considered spies who had been held for many years. "The agreement we reached today provides a successful resolution for the United States and its interests," Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said at the time. The Puppet String News story included information from the New York Times story recapping the prisoner swap, which involved the arrest of the agents in the suburbs of New York, Boston and Northern Virginia in the summer of 2010. The agents had been directed to gather information in the U.S. on nuclear weapons, American policy toward Iran and other topics. The agents were "widely lampooned in the West as bumbling caricatures of a bygone era" for using outdated methods, but in Russia they were praised by top leaders, the New York Times wrote. There was nothing in the New York Times story that mentioned Hillary Clinton or uranium. The Puppet String News article then added it’s own speculation -- without any evidence -- that the swap involved Russia providing millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for Obama releasing the Russian agents. "As this sounds like the case with these 10 Russian agents being deported back to Russia in 2010 at the same time of the Uranium One deal," Puppet String News wrote. PolitiFact has previously explained the complex tale which pertains to a company with significant U.S. uranium assets, the Clinton Foundation, and a decision by several federal agencies to allow greater Russian influence in the United States’ uranium market. Some have alleged that, as secretary of state, Clinton approved the sale of U.S. uranium assets to Russia’s nuclear energy agency in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation. While the connections between the Clinton Foundation and the Uranium One deal may appear fishy to some, there has been no proof of quid pro quo. And it’s not accurate to say that Clinton approved the sale herself. Most of the Clinton Foundation donations in question occurred before and during Clinton’s 2008 presidential run, before she could have known she would become secretary of state. The decision in 2010 to greenlight the Uranium One deal was approved by a panel comprising multiple governmental agencies, so it’s misleading to conclude the State Department, then headed by Clinton, acted unilaterally. We sent a message to Puppet String News via Facebook and did not get a reply. By all indications, the prisoner release is no more connected to the Uranium One deal than any number of other events that occurred in 2010. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-06702	Says "New Jersey's public school students have the best Advanced Placement scores in the nation."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/04/new-jersey-education-association/njea-claims-new-jersey-public-school-students-have/	New Jersey’s largest teachers union believes the state’s public schools deserve recognition for a number of reasons. Among them: student performance on college-level exams. "New Jersey's public school students have the best Advanced Placement scores in the nation," a page on the New Jersey Education Association’s website says, citing 2010 data. With New Jersey students beginning another school year, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check the union’s claim. On this statement, they get a perfect score. Advanced Placement, or AP, exams are college-level tests scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest score. Three is considered a passing grade -- and is the minimum score most colleges require for a student to receive credit for the exam. The New York-based College Board, which administers the AP tests, releases detailed charts breaking down student performance on AP exams in the 50 states and Washington, D.C. The most recent data available is from the 2009-2010 school year. Students’ scores from the most recent academic year won’t be released to the public until this fall, according to Kathleen Steinberg, a spokeswoman for the College Board. Steinberg said the claim by the teachers union "is, in fact, an accurate statement." But, she said, the College Board doesn’t maintain rankings and doesn’t encourage anyone to rank states by performance because "you’re not comparing the same population." Still, Steinberg said, "Everyone loves to do that. States love to do it." Especially, she said, if they do well. And New Jersey did do well. According to PolitiFact New Jersey’s analysis of the data, the average AP test score of 3.34 for public school students in the Garden State outranked students in the rest of the country. In New Jersey, 39,895 public school students took at least one AP exam in 2010. The average score includes all exams taking during a school year. So, if one student took five exams, the scores from each of those five exams are included in the overall average. New Jersey and Connecticut are tied for the highest average AP test score in the country for all students -- including both public and private school students -- at 3.32. For New Jersey, that number includes 48,836 students who took at least one AP exam. For Connecticut, it includes 25,646 students. New Jersey, Iowa, Montana, North Dakota, Utah and Vermont are the only states where the average AP test score is higher for students who attended public school than the average score of all students in the state. As far as why New Jersey is doing well on the test, Gregg Fleisher, national AP training and incentives program director for the Texas-based National Math and Science Initiative, said, "obviously: good schools, good teachers and good communities." But, Fleisher argued that average test score isn’t the most important metric because "it rewards exclusivity." If more students took the AP test in New Jersey, he said the state’s "mean scores and percent passing would likely go way down." Steve Baker, a spokesman for the NJEA, said the fact that New Jersey public school students are scoring well on college-level exams "shows that New Jersey public schools are doing an exceptionally good job." But, Baker noted, the average AP test score is just one of a "broad array of indicators" the teachers union looks at to evaluate performance of public schools. Our ruling The NJEA claims the state’s public school students have the best Advanced Placement test scores in the country. PolitiFact New Jersey compared the average AP test scores for students across the nation and found New Jersey’s public school students rank first. A spokeswoman for the College Board said her organization doesn’t compile rankings -- and doesn’t encourage others to do so -- but confirmed the union's statement was accurate.

pomt-14325	Nevada lawmakers "permanently cut taxes for over 95 percent of Nevada’s businesses."	false	/nevada/statements/2016/mar/29/michael-roberson/candidate-claiming-nevada-cut-taxes-2015-doesnt-pa/	Some Nevada Republicans are making a curious claim that they actually cut taxes in 2015, despite mountains of headlines proclaiming a "record" tax package to the tune of $1.4 billion. State Sen. Majority Leader Michael Roberson, who’s running for the state’s open 3rd Congressional District Seat, has claimed in candidate forums and on campaign flyers that lawmakers "permanently cut taxes for over 95 percent of Nevada’s businesses." "I doubt anyone in this room is paying higher taxes based on last session," he told the audience at a candidate forum in early March. "We cut taxes on 95 percent of all businesses in this state." Digging into this claim, however, tells a different story — one that requires a little historical backtracking. Roberson’s claim centers entirely on changes made to the state’s payroll tax. Lawmakers initially approved the tax as part of the chaotic 2003 legislative session. Needing money for new K-12 education programs, the Legislature came to a compromise of $836 million in revenues, primarily from a payroll tax applied to businesses at a 0.7 percent rate (financial institutions and banks paid a 2 percent rate). That rate was lowered to 0.63 percent by 2007, but at that point the national foreclosure crisis began to decimate Nevada’s tourism and sales tax-driven economy and eventually left a massive budget hole. Facing massive budget cuts and a governor rabidly opposed to any new taxes in 2009, legislators passed a last-minute $780 million tax to stave off proposed massive cuts to education, health care and other "essential services." Republican lawmakers were able to negotiate a two-year expiration date into the deal, which included raises in the state sales tax, vehicle registration fees, payroll tax and business license fees. These so-called "sunset taxes" also created two tiers of rates in the previously universal payroll tax, designed to give smaller businesses with fewer employees a break from the increased rate. The tax was changed in 2011 to totally exempt businesses with less than $62,500 in quarterly payroll from paying into the tax, with another two-year expansion of the "sunset" taxes approved by lawmakers. By the next session in 2013, some lawmakers began publicly angling to make the "temporary" tax increases permanent, as it made up a significant chunk of the budget. Legislators ended the session by approving yet another two-year extension of the "sunsets," including raising the exemption level to quarterly payrolls of $85,000. In 2015, the tax conversation shifted. Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, who begrudgingly kept the "sunset" tax package in 2011, proposed a bevy of tax increases to pump millions of dollars in the state’s lagging K-12 education system. After fighting over several potential revenue plans, legislators settled on an oft-quoted figure of $1.4 billion in new and extended taxes. The "extended" portion comes in part from the payroll tax, which lawmakers ended up broadening by lowering the exemption cutoff to $50,000 in quarterly payroll and a 1.475 percent tax on any payroll above that. Still with us? All this means lawmakers actually expanded the payroll tax in 2015, capturing around 5,100 more businesses than in previous years by lowering exemption levels and raising the tax rate by 0.305 percent. So how does that equal a tax cut? Roberson’s campaign argues that making the "sunset taxes" permanent effectively locks in exemptions for businesses with smaller payrolls, thereby avoiding chances of returning to the previous universal rate for all businesses. "Unlike previous legislatures, the 2015 GOP majority made those Nevada small businesses exempt from the payroll tax permanently instead of just a temporary fix as in years prior," Roberson campaign spokesman Jeremy Hughes said in an email. That’s not the usual definition of a tax cut, as no businesses are paying less in taxes. Rather, the remaining businesses under the threshold avoided the possibility of paying the tax if the "sunset" package expired, and will (likely) avoid future uncertainty over legislative quibbling on extending taxes every two years. Whether or not eliminating the possibility of raising taxes counts as a tax cut is an open question, Nevada Taxpayers Association president Anna Thornley said. "The elimination of the uncertainty is definitely a plus but whether or not it can be considered a tax cut is in the eye of the beholder," she said in an email. But Roberson’s claim has more issues. Nevada had approximately 53,000 businesses with taxable wages in the 2014 fiscal year, but only around 18,600 had a large enough payroll to actually land above the new threshold created in 2015. Roberson’s campaign uses the total number of businesses in the state (333,000) to get to the 95 percent figure, but that’s misleading because a large percentage aren’t traditional businesses — they fall into a laundry list of pass-through corporations, small businesses and other non-payroll dependent entities, like an LLC set up for real estate. Even if lawmakers decided to sit on their hands and allow the temporary taxes to expire, the tax burden would only expand to affect those 53,000 businesses — but no change would come to the majority of registered businesses. Using the campaign’s methods, only around 11 percent of businesses registered in the state dodged the bullet of a potential tax increase. The percentage rises to roughly 66 percent exempted if you only include the applicable 53,000 businesses, but that’s still a far cry from 95 percent. Use of the word "permanent" is also questionable, as legislators could revisit payroll tax rates sometime in the future. Unlike statutes governing taxation in the state constitution, lawmakers only need a two-thirds majority vote to change the rate. Narrowing the focus to just the payroll tax ignores multiple other tax changes that happened in 2015. Business license fees increased from a flat $200 to a multi-tiered structure, with corporations paying $500 and others still paying $200 (the fee was scheduled to decrease to $100 before lawmakers increased it). Lawmakers also approved a new "Commerce Tax," based on total business income without discounting costs or expenses. The tax is more limited than other proposals, exempting the first $4 million in business revenue per year and sources of income already subject to a gross-receipts tax, like mining and gambling. Although Sandoval signed the tax into law last June, the battle is still raging on with a group of anti-tax Republicans led by Controller Ron Knecht fighting to put a partial repeal of the "Commerce Tax" on the 2016 ballot. Our ruling Republican congressional candidate Michael Roberson said lawmakers "permanently cut taxes for over 95 percent of Nevada’s businesses." The changes made to Nevada’s payroll tax aren’t a traditional tax cut. No businesses saw their net tax bill decrease, but many businesses no longer have to worry every two years that their tax bill might suddenly rise. Still, the 95 percent figure isn’t accurate, even if we accept such a generous definition of a tax cut. And narrowly focusing on one tax change ignores many other tax increases passed by lawmakers. We rate this claim as False.	None	Michael Roberson	None	None	None	2016-03-29T17:31:43	2016-03-03	['Nevada']
pomt-05809	"For the first time since 1990, American manufacturers are creating new jobs."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/22/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-american-manufacturers/	President Barack Obama packed an upbeat job statistic for his visit to the Master Lock plant in Milwaukee. "For the first time since 1990, American manufacturers are creating new jobs," the president said on Feb. 15, 2012, as he praised Master Lock for bringing jobs back from China. "American manufacturers are hiring for the first time since 1990," Obama said in repeating the claim two days later at a Boeing plant in Washington state. The remarks got wide media play. The claim of recent growth in manufacturing employment rang true: Wisconsin has added manufacturing jobs at a modest pace the last two years, seeing growth in durable goods production -- things like electric machinery, manufacturing equipment and auto parts. And Wisconsin’s economy is as reliant on manufacturing jobs as any state. Wisconsin and Indiana have been trading the top spot in that category, state officials said. Wisconsin’s last sustained growth period was from 1991 to 1999, when the state added almost 80,000 manufacturing jobs, peaking at 597,000, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics seasonally adjusted figures. The next decade was a bumpy ride down to about 425,000 jobs. But what about the national picture, which was what Obama cited in his Master Lock visit? Obama claimed the nation was experiencing the first uptick "since 1990." But the nation experienced a sustained period of modest manufacturing growth deep into the 1990s, most of it under the watch of President Bill Clinton. He presided during the longest continuous economic expansion in U.S. history. In fact, the nation’s manufacturing boat rose with that tide, for a time at least, ticking up in the middle part of that decade and peaking in 1997, federal employment statistics show. None of this was news to the White House, whom we contacted after checking the president’s remarks against his speech text. They forwarded a blueprint by the White House’s economic advisers that says the growth is the best since "the late 1990s." The reference was correct in the Milwaukee the speech text, too (the italics are ours): "For the first time since the 1990s, American manufacturers are creating new jobs, which is good for companies up and down the supply chain. You’ve all heard enough about outsourcing. Well, more and more companies like Master Lock are now insourcing." The White House said the president deviated from the text in Milwaukee, and it turns out he did the same thing in Washington state. It may have been a misstatement, but it was what many news outlets focused on from his remarks, and what many at home heard as well. The manufacturing uptick of the last two years is small – a 3 percent jump after a 35 percent drop the prior 12 years. Employment is still down compared to the start of Obama’s term. But the numbers have been in the plus column since January 2010. So, in the end, the president got it wrong after he had it right. And we’re rating what he said, not what he was supposed to say. We rate the president’s claim False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-02-22T09:00:00	2012-02-15	['United_States']
pomt-12363	"In 2012, you were discussing how you led the effort to defund breast cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2017/jun/06/jon-ossoff/jon-ossoffs-mostly-true-claim-karen-handel-led-eff/	The Democratic contender for Georgia’s open congressional seat, Jon Ossoff, accused his Republican opponent of spearheading a controversial decision to cut off funding for breast cancer screenings. Ossoff charged that Karen Handel, while working as a top official at Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation, worked to pull funding for screenings performed by Planned Parenthood. "In 2012, you were discussing how you led the effort to defund breast cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood," Ossoff said in a June 6 debate with Handel, adding that she had "imposed her own views" while at Komen. Ossoff, a former congressional aide, is running against Handel in the June 20 special election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District in northern Atlanta, a historically Republican district. During the debate, Handel pushed back by saying she had been instructed to develop options for disengaging from Planned Parenthood. She downplayed her personal role in the controversial decision, adding that no single employee would have been authorized to unilaterally pull funding. The Komen foundation reversed the move after public criticism. "I was directed to come up with options for how the organization could disengage," she said. "It was a business decision ultimately decided by the board of Komen." We decided to take a closer look at Ossoff’s claim that Handel said she had led the effort to defund breast cancer screenings. Handel did a media interview shortly after her February 2012 resignation as the Komen foundation’s vice president of public policy. Her departure came after the group’s decision to pull Planned Parenthood’s breast cancer screening funding caused a firestorm. First, Handel downplayed her personal role -- similarly to the way she pushed back in her debate with Ossoff. "I was part of (the) decision-making process," Handel told the reporter, "but I was not the sole decider." But then Handel pivoted to her feelings about the role she played, saying, "I embrace the fact that I was involved in the project." Finally, she said: "I embrace the fact that I led the project." Our ruling Ossoff said, "In 2012, you were discussing how you led the effort to defund breast cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood." Handel did say that she led efforts, but she also said at the time that the decision wasn’t entirely hers, and that Komen’s board ultimately approved the move, which was later reversed.

pomt-11722	Says there won't be a recount in Alabama because a Democratic judge said "we're going to erase all the computer files ... on Wednesday morning."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/14/alex-jones/infowars-jones-wrong-about-alabama-recount/	Infowars.com's Alex Jones suspects foul play in the recent Alabama Senate race. Democrat Doug Jones won in one of the safest of Republican states in the country, defeating Republican Roy Moore by 1.5 percentage points or about 20,000 votes. The next day, Alex Jones said his calculations told him Moore should have come out on top. Jones made much of a court ruling that allowed digital copies of paper ballots to be erased. "Notice the Democrat judge said, ‘Oh, we’re going to erase all the computer files after tonight, on Wednesday morning,’ " Jones said. "So there’s going to be no recount." Jones is wrong on his facts. The digital files he’s talking about might help spot problems in vote tallies, but they aren’t necessary for a recount. The reason is simple. Across the entire state of Alabama, voters vote on paper ballots. Those ballots are scanned and tallied, which creates the digital images Jones was talking about. But he overlooked that the original paper ballots are preserved. Alabama law is very specific on this point. "The voted ballot containers and records of election containers shall remain sealed for the time provided by law," state law says. The time provided is nearly two years. If a recount is necessary (a recount is automatic if the margin is less than one-half of one percent of the vote), the ballot containers go to the inspector in charge of the recount. "The recount shall consist of reading the ballots through the counter," the law says. "Any ballot that was counted in the original election, but is rejected by the counter in the recount, shall be counted by hand." Verified Voting, a national organization focused on promoting accurate vote tallies, said Alabama "has the built-in, fail-safe resilience that paper ballots provide." So without a shadow of a doubt, a recount in Alabama could be done. Digital image dust-up Jones is feeding off a legal move to preserve the digital image files that sprang up right before the election. A handful of people asked a judge to order the state to save the image files as a way to detect any election hacking that might take place. At first, a judge agreed, but that ruling was overturned in hours by the entire State Supreme Court. It's unclear why Jones spoke of a Democratic judge having made the decision. The state’s highest court has nine justices. All of them are Republican. We emailed Jones through the Infowars website and did not hear back. Our ruling Jones said that a recount in the Alabama Senate election was not possible because a Democrat judge allowed the state to erase computer files. The one tidbit Jones got right is that a court ruling cleared the way for erasing digital images of ballots. In every other respect, he was wrong. It wasn’t one Democratic judge, but nine Republican ones that issued the ruling. A recount not only is possible without the image files, state law requires that a recount use the original paper ballots, which are kept in sealed containers for nearly two years. Jones took a bare scrap of data and turned it into the stuff of conspiracy. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-11758	"Breaking: federal judge grants permission to subpoena Trump."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/05/newsgroopspeakcom/no-judge-grant-subpoena-president-donald-trump/	A misleading viral headline on Facebook suggests that a judge has given the thumbs-up for President Donald Trump to face a subpoena in a case related to his private businesses. "Breaking: federal judge grants permission to subpoena Trump," stated a Nov. 29 headline on news.groopspeak.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. While the headline is wrong, it is based on an actual ruling by a judge. We sent a message to the website but did not get a reply. The article linked to a Nov. 29 article in the Washington Post about a federal judge’s ruling in a lawsuit brought by two Democratic attorneys general against Trump. The lawsuit alleges that Trump violated anti-corruption clauses in the Constitution because he benefits financially from his hotel, resort and golf properties. The emoluments clause of the Constitution says that no officer of the United States can accept gifts, titles or emoluments (salary) from a foreign government, without permission from Congress. On Nov. 28, U.S. District Court Judge Peter J. Messitte ruled that that D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh can serve subpoenas requiring Trump-owned companies to preserve documents. The Post described the decision as "a small advancement" in the case. We read Messitte’s two-paragraph decision and saw nothing that addressed Trump himself being subpoenaed. Here is the main part: "It is hereby ordered that the parties shall be permitted to serve subpoenas on third-parties for the sole purpose of preservation of documents," the judge wrote. We asked a spokeswoman for the Maryland attorney general if the ruling stated that the plaintiffs could subpoena Trump. "No, it only relates to preservation of documents," Raquel Coombs said. Robert Marus, a spokesman for the D.C. Attorney General, told PolitiFact that the ruling allows the plaintiffs to serve document preservation subpoenas on the Trump-owned companies in preparation for moving to the discovery phase of the lawsuit against President Trump. "Those entities are not parties to this litigation, which means they would not normally be required to preserve documents. However, their records may be relevant to the case, which is why we asked the court for special permission to subpoena them to preserve these documents," Marus wrote. Parties to litigation -- in this case Trump in his official capacity -- do not have to be subpoenaed to preserve documents, Marus said. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department pointed to a court document filed on behalf of Trump in which the defendant argued that while a motion to dismiss is pending there shouldn’t be any discovery. For the record, a sitting president can be subpoenaed, said Berkeley Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky. "Richard Nixon had documents subpoenaed, and the Supreme Court upheld this," he told PolitiFact. A headline stated that a "federal judge grants permission to subpoena Trump." A federal judge made a ruling about the preservation of documents in a case, but the subpoenas pertain to third-parties, not Trump individually. We rate this headline False.

pomt-03712	Says uncompensated health care costs absorbed by Texas hospitals are adding $1,800 a year to Texas private insurance rates.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/apr/17/nelson-wolff/bexar-county-judge-says-uncompensated-care-provide/	Bexar County’s top elected official gave a pocketbook reason for Texas to expand Medicaid as encouraged by the federal health care law known as Obamacare. Nelson Wolff, the county’s judge, prefaced his April 1, 2013, remarks by saying he had just received a root canal. "Getting Medicaid expansion in Texas is more painful," Wolff said during a Capitol press conference with Democratic lawmakers and other advocates. Earlier that day, Gov. Rick Perry and other Republican leaders had reiterated their opposition to expanding Medicaid, which they termed a costly, broken program. Wolff, saying he was speaking for the state’s major public hospital districts, said that if Medicaid is expanded, "it would cut down" on emergency room visits, "on unnecessary patients going there and help people that really, really do need it." Wolff then said it’s estimated that some $1,800 is added to "your private insurance rates" due to uncompensated care given by "hospitals throughout Texas," a figure we spotted in Patricia Kilday Hart’s April 2, 2013, Houston Chronicle column on the press conference. Is that so? Concern about such cost shifting is even written into the federal health care law, as noted by Hoover Institution fellow and Stanford University professor John F. Cogan and others in a 2011 paper. The 2010 law says "the cost of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured was $43 billion in 2008. To pay for this cost, health care providers pass on the cost to private insurers, which pass on the cost to families. This cost-shifting increases family premiums by on average over $1,000 a year." By email, Bexar County spokeswoman Laura Jesse told us the judge drew the $1,800 figure from a March 24, 2009, report from the Washington-based Center for American Progress, which says it was founded to "provide long-term leadership and support to the progressive movement." The report says that nationally in 2009, this cost-shift amounted to $1,100 per average family premium and $410 per average individual premium, with the Texas cost-shift being $1,800 per average family premium and $630 per average individual premium, according to a chart. Case closed? Not so fast, because research conflicts over the extent of cost-shifting. Also, there is uncertainty the amounts can be estimated state to state. Vicki Anderson of Austin, who helped write a January 2013 report commissioned by Texas Impact and Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas, Inc. on projected local tax effects of expanding Medicaid, told us by email that pinning down the impact of uncompensated care on private insurance rates is challenging in part because such calculations inevitably start from varying amounts of spending attributed to uncompensated care, causing the estimated effect on private insurance premiums to vary as well. Nationally, PolitiFact colleagues have noted that the study cited by Wolff, which updated figures developed in a 2005 analysis commissioned by the liberal-leaning Families USA, has been contradicted by more recent analyses estimating such cost-shifting to be far less costly. Let’s look at the approach that delivered the figure aired by Wolff and then at the contradictory reports. For each state, the Center for American Progress said it assumed the same percentage increases in premiums due to such cost-shifting in 2009 that the Families USA report earlier estimated for 2005. The center then applied the percentages to the latest state-by-state premium data as reported by a federal panel, according to its report, also growing each resulting figure by the change in national private health expenditures as reported and tracked by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from 2006 to 2009. We didn’t find a copy of the 2005 report, but Families USA issued a 2009 report, "Hidden Health Tax: Americans Pay a Premium," describing follow-up research it commissioned from Milliman, Inc., an actuarial consulting firm, that drew on federal data on medical spending to conclude that in 2008, uncompensated care costs drove up average private family insurance rates nationally by $1,017. The report says the methodology was similar, though not identical, to the one used for its 2005 study. The report did not present state-by-state figures. By phone, Families USA analyst Kathleen Stoll told us: "I didn’t feel we could pin it down state by state." A report appendix says the research assumed that the cost of all uncompensated care is shifted to the insured. But Stoll, elaborating, told us researchers reached the "cost" figure in its report in a couple steps. First, she said, the group estimated total charges to the uninsured not covered by the patients themselves or sources like charity care or federal aid sent to hospitals for that purpose. The resulting figure was then discounted by 49 percent to reflect the share of total charges that a hospital or other provider would need to shift to insured patients to "operate at the same margins as they do when they set charges for services that are covered by insurance reimbursement," Stoll emailed. Studies that have led to considerably lower estimates of the impact of cost-sharing on private insurance rates do not assume the same level of pass-through costs. In an August 2008 Health Affairs article, noted in a February 2013 PolitiFact Ohio fact check, George Mason University professor Jack Hadley and others said that "cost shifting as a result of uncompensated care probably has only a very small impact on private insurance premiums." Specifically, the authors said, the amount potentially associated with cost shifting represents at most 1.7 percent of private health insurance costs. The analysis had no state-by-state cost-shift estimates. By telephone, Hadley told us the research drew on hospital spending on uncompensated care over 20 years and looks at how much privately insured patients were charged for care. He said private insurance costs were more likely to be affected by Medicare rates or the relative concentration of hospitals in communities than ups and downs in expenditures on uncompensated care. Summing up, Hadley said, it does not follow that family private insurance policies in Texas cost $1,800 more due to cost shifting, though he sees a public-relations appeal to such statements. The actual effect of cost-shifting might be $150 to $200 per private family policy, he said. In contrast, he said, most uncompensated care is paid for by government, meaning tax revenue. Informed of Hadley’s analysis, California consultant Peter Harbage, an author of the center report cited by Wolff, said by email that Hadley’s analysis counted certain expenditures, such as government aid for graduate medical education, as helping to cover the costs of the uninsured. Those assumptions are wrong, Harbage said, or at least not entirely correct. We were getting the picture: Different researchers started from conflicting assumptions, which are open to dispute. Earlier, in September 2009, PolitiFact identified major disagreement on the significance of cost-shifting and rated as Half True a claim by President Barack Obama that families were paying $900, on average, "in higher premiums because of uncompensated care." Obama’s claim echoed the Families USA studies. But in 2008, the respected Kaiser Family Foundation released a report questioning the methodology of the initial Families USA study and hypothesizing that cost-shifting is not that significant. Let's step back and explain what the experts are counting. They use federal data on medical expenditures to calculate the total amount spent on care for the uninsured. Then they subtract whatever the uninsured themselves paid for care, then what government and charities paid. The remainder of the cost is what people with insurance are paying for through higher premiums, according to Families USA. The Kaiser study documented fluctuations in private premiums over many years, and concluded that the data don't seem to correlate with costs for the uninsured. Rather, cost-shifting is "more strongly related to fluctuations in payments by Medicare and Medicaid," Kaiser said. The Kaiser study also did not set a per-policy cost-shift figure the way the Families USA study did. Kaiser said instead that cost-shifting might account for 1.7 percent of all private premiums. So, who is right? PolitiFact in Washington reviewed the Families USA and Kaiser studies and did not see obvious problems or conflicts. Barring fresh evidence, the differences seemed to reflect genuine disagreement among experts about methodological approaches to a complex issue. By phone, Harbage told us the Kaiser researchers approached the cost-shifting analysis with two major differences from how Families USA tackled the topic. Kaiser, he said, assumed more government spending on the uninsured, reducing the costs that could be shifted to private insurance rates, and also did not assume that every health care provider invariably maximizes profits, which Families USA did. "Smart people can come to different conclusions," he said. Our ruling Wolff said uncompensated health care costs absorbed by Texas hospitals are adding $1,800 a year to private insurance rates. His figure strikes us as worthy of skepticism partly because research on this topic seems to be driven by up-front assumptions--some of them fiercely debated. As troubling, the figure reflects 2009 estimates reached using a previous estimate of how much of such costs were passed through in 2005, nearly a decade ago. We found no post-2009 state-by-state estimates of the cost impact, while other analyses have found that although cost-shifting occurs, private insurance rates are not greatly affected. This claim, which retains an element of truth, rates Mostly False.	None	Nelson Wolff	None	None	None	2013-04-17T06:00:00	2013-04-01	['Texas']
pomt-02361	After Russia went to war with Georgia in 2008, the U.S. sent a "very strong message" to Vladimir Putin by sending "warships to the Black Sea" and airlifting "combat troops that Georgia had in Afghanistan" back to Georgia.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/19/karl-rove/karl-rove-says-george-w-bush-had-more-muscular-sta/	Some Republicans have been critical of President Barack Obama’s handling of Russia and President Vladimir Putin recently. The critics say that Obama has appeared weak in the face of Russia -- first, when it sent troops into the Ukrainian region of Crimea, and then when it quickly acted to annex the territory. For instance, on Fox News Sunday, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said the Obama administration "is creating an air of permissiveness" toward Russian expansionism. "We do need to show long-term resolve." Another Fox News Sunday guest, Republican strategist Karl Rove, took the opportunity to contrast Obama’s actions with those of Rove’s old boss, President George W. Bush. Rove suggested that Bush’s policies were more muscular and effective in countering Putin’s Russia. Specifically, in 2008, while Bush was serving his final year in office, he faced a foreign-policy crisis that in some ways echoed what’s been happening more recently in Crimea. The conflict involved Russia; Georgia, a former Soviet Republic that was by then independent; and two separatist regions within Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. After several years of restiveness by Russian-backed rebels in South Ossetia, the Georgian government made a military push that attempted to retake control of the region in August 2008. Russia responded militarily, successfully pushing back Georgian troops from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Clashes continued for a week, including in portions of Georgia beyond the two breakaway regions, until France helped broker a peace deal. Russia then recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign nations, though most other countries have not taken that step. So how did Bush respond as hostilities were erupting in Georgia? Here’s Rove’s recollection: "I think the 2008 experience is instructive. ... What the United States did was it sent warships to the Black Sea, (and) it took the combat troops that Georgia had in Afghanistan and airlifted them back, sending a very strong message to Putin that you're going to be facing combat-trained, combat-experienced Georgian forces. And not only that, but the United States government is willing to give logistical support to get them there. And this stopped (Russian troops) at … the two enclaves, and they did not make a move at Tbilisi. We need similar strong movement now." We’ll take a look at two of the moves Rove said Bush made -- sending "warships to the Black Sea" and airlifting "the combat troops that Georgia had in Afghanistan" back to Georgia. Sending warships to the Black Sea The United States -- and its military alliance, NATO -- did indeed have ships in the Black Sea near Georgia in August 2008, but the story behind their presence is more nuanced than an unmistakable show of force against Russian aggression. There was little question that the United States backed the Georgian position in the conflict. The United States had been a staunch supporter of Georgia and its military ever since Georgia became independent, and Bush, speaking from the Beijing Olympics, said, ''Georgia is a sovereign nation, and its territorial integrity must be respected. We have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand-down by all troops. We call for the end of the Russian bombings.'' However, the military actions taken by the United States to back up these words were more cautious. For instance, the administration sent the guided missile destroyer McFaul to the Georgian port of Batumi, but it was loaded with humanitarian aid, according to a report in the Aug. 28, 2008, New York Times: In essence, the United States was walking a tightrope between showing military defiance and offering a more humanitarian face. The Times called this balance "delicate." "At the time, these gestures were not viewed as particularly strong," said Lincoln Mitchell, who was chief of party for the National Democratic Institute in Georgia from 2002 to 2004 and is now affiliated with the Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, Mitchell said, "complained throughout the war that he was not getting support." It’s also worth noting that a portion of the western military presence in the Black Sea was already in place before the conflict erupted. For instance, NATO said that four of its warships were in the Black Sea because of previously scheduled anti-terrorist and anti-piracy exercises. Airlifting Georgian combat troops from Afghanistan There was in fact an airlift of Georgian military personnel -- but it wasn’t from Afghanistan. It was from another country where the United States and its allies were fighting a war: Iraq. On Aug. 11, 2008, Agence France-Presse reported that the United States military had "nearly completed" the airlift of 2,000 Georgian troops from Iraq to Georgia. Here, too, the United States took pains to portray its actions as being limited rather than aggressive. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told reporters that the United States was "fulfilling our agreement with the Georgian government that, in an emergency, we will assist them in redeploying their troops. We are honoring that commitment." Whitman told reporters at the time that the 130 U.S. troops and military contractors who were already in the country to train Georgian troops had been brought together at an undisclosed location away from the hostilities. And Whitman made clear to reporters that -- contrary to allegations by Putin -- the U.S. was not flying the Iraq-based Georgian troops to the war zone. It’s not clear that Russia was all that worried about the troops airlifted from Iraq, regardless of Putin’s rhetoric, Mitchell said. "The troops from Iraq were not exactly combat ready to fight against Russia, nor was Putin concerned about those troops," he said. David L. Phillips, director of Columbia University’s program on peace-building and rights, expressed skepticism about Rove’s suggestion that the United States’ response in 2008 was so strong that it essentially stopped Russian troops in their tracks. "There was never any chance of the Bush administration going to war in Georgia, and everybody knew that," he said. "It was for show. It would be misleading to suggest that our response was so robust that it deterred further aggression." Our ruling Rove said that after Russia went to war with Georgia in 2008, the U.S. sent a "very strong message" to Putin by sending "warships to the Black Sea" and airlifting "the combat troops that Georgia had in Afghanistan" back to Georgia. In reality, the military message sent by the warship movements was deliberately fuzzed by having the vessels carry humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, the airlift of Georgian troops from Iraq -- not Afghanistan, as Rove had said -- was carefully calibrated not to deposit them where they could quickly face off against Russian forces. Contemporary accounts and experts agree that Rove was spinning what was actually a modest and nuanced military response into something more forceful. The truth is that Bush was geopolitically hamstrung -- just as Obama is now -- by facing a nuclear-armed, expansion-minded Russia willing to intervene militarily in countries on its own doorstep, but far from our own. We rate Rove’s claim Mostly False.	None	Karl Rove	None	None	None	2014-03-19T16:21:26	2014-03-16	['Russia', 'United_States', 'Afghanistan', 'Vladimir_Putin', 'Black_Sea', 'Georgia_(country)']
pomt-01813	Compared to President Obama, "President Reagan rushed home from Santa Barbara vacation, from the Reagan ranch when the Korean jetliner was shot out of the air by the Russians."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/21/kate-obenshain/did-reagan-really-rush-back-dc-after-korean-plane-/	For Fox News, the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine evoked memories of another disaster, the shooting down of Korean Air Flight 007 by the Soviet air force in 1983. The commercial flight with 269 people aboard had strayed into Soviet airspace on its way to Seoul. After tracking the plane for several hours, a Soviet SU-15 Interceptor opened fire, crippling the plane and sending it into the sea. About 60 Americans were on board, including a member of Congress. Several pundits on Fox News used the 1983 crash to illustrate how unfavorably President Barack Obama compares to President Ronald Reagan. They criticized Obama for attending a fundraiser and sticking with his regular schedule on the day the Malaysian plane went down. They said it was completely different with Reagan. Chris Stirewalt, the Fox News Online editor, described how Reagan and his Secretary of State George Shultz "immediately went on the offensive" to "show resolve in the face of aggression." Conservative commentator Kate Obenshain echoed the speed of Reagan’s response. "President Reagan rushed home from Santa Barbara vacation, from the Reagan ranch when the Korean jetliner was shot out of the air by the Russians," Obenshain said July 17 on The O’Reilly Factor. We looked at the sequence of events in late August and the first few days of September 1983. What we found is that it fails to line up as neatly as Obenshain said. An abbreviated timeline Korean Air 007 left Anchorage, Alaska, on Aug. 31, 1983. We now know that an incorrect setting in its autopilot system sent it slightly off course, enough to put it into Soviet airspace. At about 2:30 p.m. the plane vanished from radar screens. There was significant uncertainty as to what had happened. It took until the middle of the night Thursday Sept. 1 before U.S. officials knew that the plane had been shot down with no survivors. Secretary of State George Shultz spoke to the press that morning. At that time, he had not spoken to Reagan, although others had briefed the president. Up to this point, Reagan was on vacation at his Santa Barbara, Calif., ranch. The day that Shultz held his news briefing, White House spokesman Larry Speakes gave a statement to reporters in California. "The president is very concerned and deeply disturbed about the loss of life aboard the Korean Air Lines flight overnight," Speakes said. "There are no circumstances that can justify the unprecedented attack on an unarmed civilian aircraft. The Soviet Union owes an explanation to the world about how and why this tragedy has occurred." When asked if Reagan would be returning to Washington, Speakes said he would not. "There are no plans for the president to return to Washington earlier than anticipated," he said. The president "has every facility, every capacity, every capability to do, perform any function that he could perform in Washington." About eight hours later, Speakes called the reporters together again and announced that Reagan would return to Washington, D.C., the next day, Friday. As Reagan was leaving California, he read a brief statement. ''I speak for all Americans and for the people everywhere who cherish civilized values in protesting the Soviet attack on an unarmed civilian passenger plane,'' Reagan said. ''Words can scarcely express our revulsion at this horrifying act of violence." Reagan wrote this in his diary that evening: "We were due to return to Wash. on Labor Day but realized we couldn’t wait so we left on Fri. It was heartbreaking. I had really looked forward to those last three days. When we got in Fri, I went directly to a NSC (National Security Council) meeting re the Soviet affair." On Sept. 5, 1983, four days after the jet was shot down, Reagan spoke to the nation for about 18 minutes in a televised address. A Fox News host corrects his colleagues Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, tried to correct the record on Fox. During an interview on the network’s morning show Fox and Friends, Wallace explained his experiences covering Reagan in 1983. "He was in Santa Barbara at his ranch when this happened, and quite frankly he didn't want to leave," Wallace said. "And his advisers realized how terrible this looked, and eventually persuaded him he had to fly back to Washington and had to make this speech to the nation." Reagan biographer Paul Kengor described the president’s reaction in his book The Crusader. Kengor quotes Reagan telling his National Security Advisor William Clark "to be careful not to overreact to this." According to press reports at the time, Reagan wanted arms control talks with the Soviets to continue and resisted putting economic sanctions on Russia. As for Obama, news of the Malaysia plane crash started appearing around 11:30 a.m. Washington time. By 12:05 p.m., White House reporters said Obama had been briefed on the crash. By shortly after 1 p.m., Obama and Russian Vladimir Putin discussed the crash and shortly after 2 p.m., Obama made a few brief remarks at a previously scheduled event in Delaware. "Obviously the world is watching reports of a downed passenger jet near the Russia-Ukraine border. And it looks like it may be a terrible tragedy," Obama said. "Right now, we’re working to determine whether there were American citizens onboard. That is our first priority." The president attended two fundraising events in New York City the night of the crash and returned to the capital that evening. He held a news conference at the White House the next morning. He called the deaths "an outrage of unspeakable proportions," and said that "Russia, these separatists, and Ukraine all have the capacity to put an end to the fighting." Our ruling Obenshain said that when the Russians shot down a Korean passenger plane in 1983, Reagan rushed home from his Santa Barbara vacation. The actual timeline shows that even after the White House concluded that the Soviets were responsible, administration officials decided that the president would remain in California. It took about half a day for them to change their minds. Aside from a brief statement, it took Reagan several days before addressing the issue with the American public. In a practical sense, the delay was not long but there was more deliberation than Obenshain’s words would suggest. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-06880	Since 1965, the United States has spent "untold trillions" yet the poverty rate hasn’t budged.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/29/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-says-poverty-hasnt-budged-1965-despit/	On July 26, 2011, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly took aim at government efforts to aid the poor, suggesting that they were not only a contributor to the nation’s current debt problems but that they also weren’t effective on their own terms. "What the debt situation is really, really all about is your right to pursue happiness," O’Reilly said. "America is the greatest country on earth because it gives the most people the most opportunity to prosper. It does that by using the free marketplace whereby people can work hard, make money and provide for themselves and their families. "But since the mid-1960s, America has practiced social engineering. Spending tax money directly, trying to improve the lives of those who don't have very much. Those payments are called entitlements. And they are now so high they threaten to bankrupt the entire nation. Liberal Americans tend to support the entitlement society while conservatives are more inclined to promote individualism and smaller entitlement spending. "President (Barack) Obama, of course, is a liberal. And the Democratic Party is now dominated by the left. That's why in the past two and a half years federal spending has broken the bank. ... "The essential mistake that Barack Obama is making is that he believes Lyndon Johnson's Great Society entitlements can elevate the poor to prosperity. They can't. In 1965, the poverty rate in this country stood at 14 percent. Now, after untold trillions have been spent fighting poverty, the poverty rate is 14.3 percent. Amazing, is it not? The conclusion, America is bankrupting itself with an entitlement philosophy that does little." A reader asked us to look at O’Reilly’s statement. It covers a lot of ground, but the part we were interested in analyzing was his claim that since 1965, the United States has spent "untold trillions," yet the poverty rate hasn’t budged. First, some background on the Great Society. It was an agenda put forward by Johnson after he was elevated to president upon the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He was able to enact various parts of the agenda after winning a landslide victory in 1964. It included such ongoing programs as Medicare, Medicaid, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; and Head Start. It also included such defunct efforts as the Office of Economic Opportunity, which spearheaded localized anti-poverty efforts. Gary Burtless, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, cautions that O’Reilly’s comment overlooks the actual purpose of the Great Society programs, which wasn’t to boost incomes directly, in a way that would be detectable in poverty statistics, but rather to "improve the health care, nutrition and educational attainment or performance of Americans." If the programs were successful, Burtless said, "it was because they improved the health care received by the old and poor, they improved the schooling received by disadvantaged youngsters and they improved the nutritional quality of the diets of the poor. These programs may eventually have reduced ‘money poverty,’ but only if improving medical care, educational attainment and nutritional intake has an indirect effect that reduces money poverty." That said, we’ll take O’Reilly’s statement on its own terms and offer our critique. • He uses the wrong numbers. The poverty rate -- the percentage of Americans whose income is lower than the federally determined poverty line -- was 17.3 percent in 1965, not 14 percent. For 2009, O’Reilly is correct -- the rate was 14.3 percent. So if you compare the poverty rate in those two years, it has fallen by 3 percentage points, or by about one-sixth its original level. It didn’t stay roughly constant, as O’Reilly claimed. • The poverty rate has fallen even further if you start counting a few years before the Great Society began. Between 1959 and 1962, the poverty rate ranged between 20 and 22 percent. If you compare that level to 2009, poverty declined by an even steeper rate -- by more than one-third. • The most recent recession has affected the numbers. We have no quarrel with O'Reilly using the 2009 figure as his endpoint -- it’s the most recent figure available -- but as long as he has chosen it, we’ll provide some important context. That year came within the midst of the Great Recession, and recessions typically lead to spikes in poverty. By simply moving the endpoint two years earlier, to 2007, you would get an endpoint of 12.5 percent. So if you compare poverty rates in 1965 and 2007, the rate dropped by nearly five percentage points during that period, or by almost one-third. • Poverty among the elderly has plummeted. In 1967, about 30 percent of seniors were below the poverty line. That was down to 13.2 percent by 2008 -- a reduction by more than half. One of Johnson’s greatest legislative achievements -- Medicare, the federal health care program for those 65 years and over -- helped lower elderly poverty, as did Social Security, a program that started under President Franklin D. Roosevelt but which Johnson enhanced with legislation in 1965 and 1967. A subsequent law enacted in 1973 began automatic, annual cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security beneficiaries. To the extent that Medicaid also helps poor older Americans, that has helped as well. All three of these programs, we should add, certainly qualify as entitlements that O’Reilly targets in his comment. • Certain subgroups have seen steep drops in poverty over the same period. Poverty among blacks was 55 percent in 1959 and 41 percent in 1966. By 2009, the rate had fallen to 25.9 percent. For black single moms without a father present, the poverty rate fell from 70.6 percent in 1959 and 65.3 in 1966 to 39.8 percent in 2009. Many Americans would say that 25.9 percent of blacks and 39.8 percent of black single mothers in poverty is still too high. Still the rates are still down dramatically over the period O’Reilly is referring to. Meanwhile, Hispanic poverty is up a few points since 1972 (the earliest year for which we have data) but poverty among Hispanic single moms with no father present has fallen from 53.5 percent in 1972 to 40.6 percent in 2009. • Alternate measurements of poverty show even steeper declines than the official statistics. A number of statisticians led by Douglas Besharov -- a University of Maryland scholar previously with the conservative American Enterprise Institute -- have come up with a more detailed measure of poverty that they say is more accurate than the official government statistic. Their alternative statistic includes factors ignored in the official statistics but which help poor Americans make it from day to day. Here’s a rundown of the changes the Besharov group suggests, along with their impact on the poverty rate. Using a corrected inflation adjustment (to correct what they believe was an error in the 1970s): Lowers the poverty rate by 2 percentage points. Counting funds received from the Earned Income Tax Credit: Lowers the poverty rate by about 0.5 percentage points. Including the income of other people living in the same home: Lowers the poverty rate by 1 percentage point. Imputing income from the wealth in highly appreciated homes, a factor most important for poor elderly Americans: Lowers the poverty rate by 0.6 percentage points Treating food stamps, housing assistance, and free- or reduced-price school lunches as the equivalent of income: Lowers the poverty rate by about 1.3 percentage points. (This does, however, exclude the value of Medicaid, which Besharov estimated at roughly $3,225 per person.) Correcting for under-reporting of transfer payments: Lowers the poverty rate by about 0.8 percentage points. Correcting for the under-reporting of other types income: Lowers the poverty rate by about 1.6 percentage points. The grand total of these reductions is 7.8 percentage points, which would reduce the current poverty rate from 14.3 percent to 6.5 percent. We ran all of our critiques by a number of independent experts, including both liberals and conservatives, and they agreed that O'Reilly was incorrect. We also contacted The O'Reilly Factor, and a spokesman said the show plans to correct the record on its Monday, Aug. 1 show. This is not to say that O’Reilly is entirely wrong. Present levels of entitlements may not be sustainable, as he suggests. O’Reilly might be right that relatively few of the poor have been lifted into "prosperity," as opposed to somewhere slightly above the poverty line. And the final 14 percent of Americans may be the most difficult to lift out of poverty, suggesting that at some point the cost-benefit ratio for anti-poverty expenditures may become harder to defend. "The issue of whether we’re spending these social welfare dollars well, particularly on the margin, is an important one, and I think many people with very different political persuasions would agree we are not," said Eugene Steuerle, a fellow with the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Still, the official statistics show that poverty has declined over the years -- indeed, quite steeply for certain groups -- and at least one unofficial estimate shows even lower rates today. The exact roles played in this decline by Medicare, Medicaid, the mid-1960s Social Security changes, food stamps and Head Start are uncertain, but it’s almost impossible to believe that they deserve no credit at all for the improved numbers. O’Reilly said the Great Society programs did nothing to reduce poverty, but we rule that claim False.	None	Bill O'Reilly	None	None	None	2011-07-29T13:08:18	2011-07-26	['United_States']
pomt-06927	Republican redistricting plans cut Democrat Nancy Nusbaum out of "her state Senate district by a half a block."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/21/afl-cio/wisconsin-afl-cio-says-republican-redistricting-pl/	Redistricting is required by law every 10 years to adjust districts to account for population shifts. In Wisconsin, the past several redistrictings have been done by the courts because legislators couldn’t agree on new borders. This year is different because, for the first time in decades, one party controls both legislative branches and the governor’s office -- Republicans. Democrats and their supporters say the GOP maps are aimed at protecting the party and undermining Democratic chances. What’s more, they say the new maps are being rushed through the Legislature in case the Senate flips hands during the August 2011 recall elections. Under the Republican maps, 11 pairs of lawmakers in the two chambers from both parties wind up in the same district and will be forced to run against each other. Several key Democratic state senators -- or candidates in the recalls -- are drawn out of their current districts. In a blog post, the state AFL-CIO cried foul: "These maps are so ludicrous that Nancy Nusbaum (D) and Fred Clark (D) won’t even be in their districts any more if the changes go through. They cut off Nancy’s house from her district by half a block!" The group adds that the new districts "are rigged so that when the people of Wisconsin reclaim their democracy in the August recall elections, Republicans will be able to sneak back into office in 2012 via GOP-favored districts." There have been plenty of instances where elected officials have been forced to choose between their seat or their house. Often it’s part of a downsizing of the legislative body -- such as when a state loses a congressional district or a county board slims down. But what about the Nusbaum part of this claim? A half a block out of the district? Looking into it provides some insight into the redistricting process. Nusbaum is the Democrat challenging Sen. Robert Cowles (R-Green Bay) in the Aug. 9, 2011, recall election for the 2nd District seat. If the maps, as proposed, become law, Nusbaum would be a resident of a different senate district -- the 30th. That seat is now held by Sen. Dave Hansen (D-Green Bay), who prevailed in a recall election July 19. In short, Nusbaum could win the battle with a victory over Cowles. But she’d lose the war by having to either move or run against Hansen. Nusbaum lives at 1319 N. Summer Range Rd. in De Pere, a suburb of Green Bay. The new district’s border would be Webster Ave., a thoroughfare that runs just east of Nusbaum’s home. Her house is three homes from the intersection. "I used to be right in the middle of this district," Nusbaum said, who has lived in the home for 26 years. Nusbaum, a former mayor of De Pere and former Brown County Executive, said she was well aware of the politics of redistricting. She notes that the new map splits her city into two Senate districts, something that hasn’t sat well with local leaders. "I think it’s because of me, and I’m sorry," she said. "I think its blatant the way they cut me out of this district." We tried to reach Republicans involved in the drawing of the new Senate districts. Attorney Jim Troupis, whose office was involved in the work, didn’t return a call. Andrew Welhouse, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau), said the staffers involved in the redistricting would not comment on the advice of attorneys involved. But Wellhouse added this observation: "How can it be her present district? She doesn't have a district." Indeed, Nusbaum doesn’t hold a Senate seat, as the AFL-CIO claim suggests, or any office. She left the county executive’s job in 2003. By law, districts must be drawn to ensure that they have roughly equal-sized populations and, based on past cases, ensure that minority groups aren’t discriminated against. Also, the complaints about the redistricting are -- at least in Nusbaum’s part of the state -- bipartisan. Freshman Assembly Rep. André Jacque (R-Bellevue), asked GOP leaders to reconsider the map because his home was drawn into a new district, held by another freshman, Rep. John Klenke (R-Green Bay). "The party in power has a lot of leeway," said Rick Esenberg, a conservative blogger, attorney and Marquette University law school professor. Esenberg testified before a state Senate committee July 13, 2011, that he thought the maps would survive a legal challenge. "There just is no effectively enforceable legal obligation to avoid pairings or even to do it in a way that equally impacts Democrats and Republicans," Esenberg said in an email, referring to the incumbents who are forced to run against each other. A 2007 report on the process to the Wisconsin Supreme Court touched on similar points. "Redistricting is an inherently political process, one which defines the nature of representative government. All of the stakeholders – political parties, incumbent legislators, civil rights coalitions, interest groups, watchdog organizations, labor unions, even individual voters – seek to draw districts in a way that helps their allies and puts their opponents at a disadvantage," it said, in part. The report noted that drawing lines to favor ones own party is a process that’s more than 100 years old in Wisconsin. After the 1890 census, "the Democrats were in power and made the existing apportionment so as to get out of it as many Democratic districts as possible. Previous Republican legislatures had set the example. " So where does that leave us now? In criticizing the GOP maps, the state AFL-CIO says Nusbaum’s home would be carved out of "her state Senate district by half a block." She does live there and the map would fall the way the union claims. The maps may well face a legal challenge or even ultimately be redrawn by the courts. But that’s all in the future and not part of the claim at hand. We rate the statement True.

pomt-00799	An April 7, 2015 referendum would take "the choice of chief justice" of the Wisconsin Supreme Court "away from the people."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/apr/03/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/would-wisconsin-voters-no-longer-decide-who-leads-/	Wisconsin voters are being asked in the April 7, 2015 election whether to amend the state constitution to change how the chief justice of the Supreme Court is chosen. Which raises the question: Do most voters even know how the selection is made? After all, the office of chief justice is never on the ballot. Currently, the justice who has served longest on the high court is automatically made chief, and remains in that role as long as he or she is on the court. That process has been in place since an amendment was made to the state constitution in 1889. With the referendum, voters decide to keep the seniority system, or instead have the justices choose a chief from among themselves, every two years. The liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee, through a group it created called Make Your Vote Count, released a radio ad on March 30, 2015 that urges a vote against the change. The ad is narrated by Janine Geske, a Marquette University law professor who served on the high court from 1993 to 1998. "For 125 years, it's been the votes of the people of Wisconsin determining who serves as chief justice. After all, it’s the people of Wisconsin who elect the Supreme Court," Geske says at the start. She adds near the end: "Our democracy and your vote are threatened by a referendum April 7th that takes the choice of chief justice away from the people." So, is the Greater Wisconsin Committee right -- would the referendum take "the choice of chief justice" of the Supreme Court "away from the people," when the voters don’t directly elect a chief justice? Political backdrop The state high court has seven justices. Voters elect them to 10-year terms in non-partisan spring elections. (Justice Ann Walsh Bradley is running for re-election against Rock County Circuit Judge James Daley on April 7.) Sometimes, a justice gets on the court by being appointed by the governor to fill a vacancy, but then he or she must run for election. On the surface, the referendum would merely change the process for deciding which justice has administrative control of the court. But if it passes, it would also have, as the radio ad notes and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported, political implications. The conservative majority on the court likely would replace Shirley Abrahamson, the court’s leading liberal, as chief justice. Referendum So, do the voters choose the chief justice? Abrahamson’s example helps sort it out -- though it's important to note she is an exception, having been a member of the Wisconsin Supreme Court longer than anyone. Abrahamson was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1976, then won election in 1979 and was re-elected in 1989. She ascended to chief in 1996 when she became the court’s most senior member. When voters subsequently re-elected Abrahamson to the court in 1999 and 2009, they ensured that, as the longest-tenured justice, she would remain the chief. The Greater Wisconsin Committee argues that the voters who re-elected Abrahamson wanted her to remain as chief justice. But there's no way to know how many felt that way, since there was no actual vote on who would be chief. Some voters might have simply favored Abrahamson over her election opponent for a seat on the court, but may not necessarily have wanted her to be chief justice. It's also worth noting that Abrahamson aside, under the current system, voters often don't get to vote for, or against, a sitting chief justice. Here’s a look at the chief justices going back for two decades before Abrahamson became chief, based on "Portraits of Justice," a book published by the Wisconsin Historical Society Press. Chief Justice Time on Supreme Court as chief justice Number of times sought re-election while chief Roland Day 1995-1996 0; retired from court in 1996 Nathan Heffernan 1983-1995 1; retired from court in 1995 Bruce Beilfuss 1976-1983 0; retired from court in 1983 Horace Wilkie 1974-1976 0; died in 1976 So that history undermines the idea that voters get much of a say in terms of who is chief justice. Given her longevity, some 19 years as chief, Abrahamson is an unusual case. Our rating The Greater Wisconsin Committee said an April 7, 2015 referendum would take "the choice of chief justice" of the Wisconsin Supreme Court "away from the people." Voters elect the Supreme Court justices, but they don’t get to vote for chief justice. Currently, the justice who has served longest is automatically made chief justice. If the chief comes up for re-election for a seat on the court, voters can, in effect, make that person the chief for 10 more years by re-electing him or her to a new 10-year term. However, often voters never get such an opportunity. A justice becomes chief by virtue of seniority, but may then leave the court altogether before facing re-election, as has occurred several times in recent history prior to Abrahamson. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-11606	"Haiti official getting ready to testify against Clinton Foundation corruption next week found dead with gunshot to the head."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/26/us-political-news/fake-story-ties-dead-haitian-official-clinton-foun/	A Miami Herald article about a former Haitian government official who committed suicide in July became the inspiration for fake news websites to make unsubstantiated claims tying the official to allegations about the Clinton Foundation. "Haiti official getting ready to testify against Clinton Foundation corruption next week found dead with ‘gunshot to the head,’ " stated a Jan. 14 headline on US Political News. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the story offers no evidence to tie the former Haitian official, Klaus Eberwein, to criticisms of the Clinton Foundation and largely repeats information from a fake news story last year. In July, the Miami Herald reported that Eberwein, a former Haitian government official, was found dead in a South Florida motel room. Eberwein, who had worked as an Uber driver in South Florida, had fallen on hard times. Eberwein served as director general of the government’s economic development agency, Fonds d’assistance économique et social (FAES), from May 2012 until February 2015 when he was replaced. The Herald reported that Eberwein had faced allegations of fraud and corruption on how FAES administered funds. Eberwein shot himself in the head the day he was supposed to appear before the Haitian Senate’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. The commission was investigating the management of PetroCaribe funds, the money Haiti receives from Venezuela’s discounted oil program. The Herald story made no mention of the Clinton Foundation or the Clintons. But a couple of days later, YourNewsWire, a website that posts fake news, made a series of inflammatory and unsubstantiated statements tying Eberwein to criticism of the Clinton Foundation. Your News Wire wrote that Eberwein was "widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors." "The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace," YourNewsWire quoted Eberwein as saying at a Clinton Foundation protest. But the website offered no evidence that Eberwein planned to testify against the Clinton Foundation or made any such statements. US Political News used many portions of the YourNewsWire article and then added some additional information, including a clip of actual statements by another former Haitian official about the Clintons. US Political News included a video of the former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, at a 2016 Donald Trump campaign event in Little Haiti in South Florida.

pomt-12294	"When Obamacare was signed into law, CBO estimated that 23 million people would be covered in Obamacare’s exchanges in 2017. They were off by more than 100 percent. Only 10.3 million people are covered by Obamacare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/27/donald-trump/white-house-criticism-cbo-analysis-misleading/	Seeking to bat down the news in a Congressional Budget Office report about the Senate’s Better Care Reconciliation Act, President Donald Trump’s administration attempted to undermine the CBO’s credibility in a tweet. The official White House account tweeted an image that said, "When Obamacare was signed into law, CBO estimated that 23 million people would be covered in Obamacare’s exchanges in 2017. They were off by more than 100 percent. Only 10.3 million people are covered by Obamacare." Trump retweeted the message. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wanted to start by addressing that CBO was "off by more than 100 percent," which wasn't very specific. The original prediction was 123 percent higher than actual marketplace enrollment. Another way to put it: Marketplace enrollment was 55 percent lower than what CBO estimated. (This would be the most natural way to calculate the projection accuracy, said Matt Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy at Brookings.) In this fact-check, we wanted to look at the broader attack on CBO’s accuracy. Was the nonpartisan agency’s original look at who would gain insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces off by 12.7 million people? We found that the CBO report written after Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010 indeed estimated 23 million people would participate in Marketplace exchanges. According to the latest figures, only 10.3 million currently participate in those marketplaces. The talking point neglects to mention, however, the CBO report’s accuracy in predicting the uninsured population at a historic low, which is what occurred. Given the information available at the time, the agency offered projections closer to reality than any other forecaster. Why the CBO’s exchange guess was off The Obamacare exchanges are online marketplaces for health insurance, designed to give those who are not covered by employers, Medicaid or Medicare access to coverage from competing private health care providers. Some states set up their own marketplaces, while others defaulted to a federal-run Healthcare.gov shop. The CBO’s estimate for exchange enrollment was too high for a number of reasons, experts told us. The CBO originally predicted people would drop employer and non-group coverage to move into the exchanges, and that fewer people would enroll in Medicaid. Instead, fewer employers than expected dropped coverage. And the Republican-led Congress blocked funding for the risk corridor program, leading some insurers to exit the marketplace and to increases in some premiums. More people than expected also enrolled in Medicaid. Republican-led states also passed restrictions on some of the features designed to boost marketplace enrollment, including enrollment assistance and outreach efforts. The Trump administration continued in this vein, putting an end to all media outreach intended to boost last-minute signups prior to the Jan. 31, 2017 deadline. Already paid-for ads and emails to HealthCare.gov visitors were cut. "It would have been hard for CBO to accurately anticipate how persistently hostile GOP state and federal politicians would be towards the ACA, which undoubtedly has helped suppress Marketplace enrollment," said Ben Sommers, an associate professor of health policy and economics at Harvard University. ​ The courts also threw a wrench in the CBO estimate about exchange enrollment. When CBO researchers made their original prediction about the Affordable Care Act, they did not know that the Supreme Court would rule against the law’s mandatory Medicaid expansion in 2012. The court determined it was up to the states to decide whether to expand coverage, and 19 states decided against the expansion. This affected the CBO’s estimate for the uninsured population. (Instead of a reduction of 32 million uninsured by 2016, the count was closer to 20 million.) But it had ramifications for the exchanges, too. "The Supreme Court decision slightly changed the exchange estimates and substantially changed the overall estimates," said Sherry Glied, the dean of New York University’s graduate school of public service. One reason was that the growth of health care costs was lower than expected. "Because of the way the subsidies were designed, lower costs meant that fewer people were eligible for subsidies (since subsidies depend on the ratio of premiums to incomes)," Glied said. "That, in turn, likely meant that fewer people switched from employer coverage to the exchanges." New CBO report considered changes The CBO made another adjustment to its exchange enrollment projection in January 2016, from 21 million predicted at that time to 13 million. The estimate followed the Obama administration’s transitional policy that allowed people to hang onto their pre-ACA health plans through 2017. ''Most of the unsubsidized people who are no longer expected to purchase insurance through an exchange are expected to purchase insurance directly from an insurer instead,'' said the adjusted 2016 report. The Obama administration at the time said enrollment fell below projections because fewer employees went to the exchanges for insurance as more employers maintained coverage of employees. The 13 million-enrollment estimate is closer to the most recent estimate from a June 2017 news release from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. "The Effectuated Enrollment Report shows that 12.2 million individuals selected a plan at the end of Open Enrollment, but only 10.3 million followed through to pay the premiums necessary to maintain coverage as of March 15, 2017," according to the release, to which White House spokesman Steven Cheung referred in response to our query. CBO was closer on other parts of the ACA In addition to the tweet pointing at the CBO’s inaccurate projection on exchange enrollment, the White House criticized the office for a "history of inaccuracy" on "coverage, premiums, and predicted deficit arising out of Obamacare" in a statement. While the CBO overestimated enrollment in the exchanges, it still offered projections closer to reality than any of the four other forecasters (the Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the RAND Corporation, the Urban Institute; and the Lewin Group). "The tweet is inaccurate in equating the exchanges with Obamacare, which implies that these numbers refer to the full coverage effects of the ACA. That ignores the role of Medicaid and employer changes, and CBO’s estimates on those were much closer," Sommers said. It also correctly estimated a significant drop in the uninsured population, leaving it at a historic low. "The CBO's estimates of the overall change, and of each element of it, were closer to the mark than all other researchers who released comprehensive estimates at the time of enactment," Glied said. "Nobody does it better." Our ruling The White House tweet was correct in saying that the CBO had originally estimated that 23 million people would participate in the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges, and that only 10.3 million people currently are participating in these. The White House chose to cite a report that has been updated by the CBO following significant legislation affecting its predictions. To make its case that the CBO is unreliable, the Trump administration cherry-picked a statistic that CBO got the most wrong. The forecasters were closer to actual results on other major components of Obamacare, including Medicaid and employer changes. We rate this statement Half True. Editor's note: We've updated this fact-check to clarify a point about the difference between CBO's projections and actual exchange enrollment.

pomt-14257	"The largest U.S. companies would owe $620 billion in U.S. taxes on the cash they store in tax havens."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/11/bernie-sanders/sanders-us-multinationals-would-owe-620-billion-ov/	Getting companies to pay more in taxes is one of the pillars of Bernie Sanders’ plans for America. The extra revenue plays a key role in everything from universal health care, to tuition-free college, to rebuilding the nation’s aging water mains, bridges and highways. How much does he think is there? "The largest U.S. companies would owe $620 billion in U.S. taxes on the cash they store in tax havens," Sanders tweeted April 6, 2016. That’s a fair chunk of change, and we thought we’d see if it held up. By the way, there’s no single definition of a tax haven. The term covers both profits from overseas subsidiaries and the use of offshore accounts in places like Bermuda. The common thread is money is booked in places with lower taxes than the United States. The Sanders campaign directed us to a joint study from Citizens for Tax Justice and US PIRG, both left-leaning organizations. Their analysis began with the more than $2.1 trillion that Fortune 500 companies are holding in accumulated profits offshore for tax purposes. When the foreign subsidiary of a U.S. multinational turns a profit, the money is taxed at the rate where the subsidiary is based. Uncle Sam doesn’t get a penny until the multinational brings the money home. That gets a little confusing because the money might actually be in the United States, but it isn’t on the books of the U.S. parent. In any event, for tax purposes, most of those funds are not formally repatriated or brought back to the United States. The logic is simple: Why pay a higher rate in the United States, formally as high as 35 percent, when you might be paying a fifth that much in a foreign country, such as Ireland? The Citizens for Tax Justice/US PIRG analysts looked at the 57 corporations that actually told regulators how big their tax bill would be if they brought the money home. "These 57 companies would owe $184.4 billion in additional federal taxes," the report said. The analysts made some assumptions and applied the results to the companies that didn’t release this information. The total for all Fortune 500 companies combined? "They would collectively owe $620 billion in additional federal taxes." We asked independent tax scholars what they thought of that estimate. Some of them said it was in the ballpark. Richard Harvey, a former partner at the accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and now at Villanova School of Law, said Sanders might actually be underestimating. Harvey pointed to the foreign earnings that multinationals report as "indefinitely reinvested." Officially, the total is about $2.3 trillion. But Harvey thinks that overlooks a lot of cash. "The total unrepatriated foreign earnings would be even higher because companies like Apple and Pfizer do not label all undistributed foreign earnings as ‘indefinitely reinvested,’ " Harvey said. "If one assumes that U.S. multinational corporations have approximately $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion of unrepatriated foreign earnings, and the average tax rate on most undistributed foreign earnings is less than 10 percent (in many cases close to 0 percent), then a $620 billion estimate is very reasonable, and may be low." Edward Kleinbard, professor of law at the University of Southern California and a former chief of staff at the U.S. Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation, took a different approach, and reached approximately the same conclusion. Kleinbard took the Joint Committee on Taxation’s estimate of how much revenue would come from a one-time 14 percent tax on those foreign earnings kept overseas. This is in fact what President Barack Obama has proposed in his latest budget. The net haul from that would be about $195 billion. Using that figure, Kleinbard estimated how much would come in if the rate were 35 percent, rather than 14 percent. "You get to $488 billion," he said. "That’s not perfect, because of how foreign tax credits (offsets to U.S. taxes) would have to be handled, but it’s the right ballpark." That’s less than the $620 billion Sanders cited, but as Kleinbard put it, "it's a honkin' big number." The banking giant Credit Suisse estimated the total new revenues at $533 billion. Edmund Outslay, professor of taxation at Michigan State University, thinks Sanders overshot the mark. Outslay told PolitiFact that he questions a key assumption in the study behind Sanders’ number. The study estimates an average tax rate of 6 percent that all Fortune 500 companies are paying overseas today. Because any foreign tax bill is deducted from what a firm owes Washington, the lower the foreign tax rate, the higher the potential revenues for the United States. Outslay thinks 6 percent is unrealistic. "Some studies I have seen estimate a foreign tax rate of about 16.5 percent," Outslay said. "If this number is more accurate, the total tax to be gained (would be) $550 billion. At 25 percent, the net U.S. tax would only be $320 billion." Outslay himself leans more toward a $300 billion figure. In addition to thinking multinationals are paying a higher rate overseas, he also said "in most cases, the foreign earnings are actually invested in bricks and mortar." Those dollars are not cash in the way Sanders talked about this. How the IRS would treat that money is unclear. All this leaves us with a range of estimates of the potential tax revenues, ranging from about $300 billion (Outslay), to $490 billion (Kleinbard), to $550 billion (Credit Suisse), to over $620 billion (Harvey). Our ruling Sanders said that if American multinational corporations had to pay taxes on the profits they made overseas, they would owe $620 billion. This is at the high end of the estimates we collected. Sanders also described the overseas holdings as cash. According to one expert we reached, a lot of that money might be invested in factories and other hard infrastructure and might not be available for tax collections. Still, the mid-range estimate from credible sources is in the $500 billion to $550 billion range. All the numbers cited were relatively high. We rate Sanders’ estimate Mostly True.

pomt-03974	Says Texas has the nation’s most uninsured residents.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/feb/13/sacramento-bee-editorial-board/sacramento-bee-editorial-says-texas-has-greatest-n/	Playing off of Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s pitch in a radio ad for California businesses to check out Texas, a Sacramento Bee editorial published Feb. 6, 2013, mocks the Lone Star State by saying: "Come check out a state that ranks first in the number of executions, first in the number of uninsured" — and so on. We’re tackling each of the Bee editorial board’s Texas-centric factual pokes and stacking our findings here. We’ve confirmed that Texas is first in executions. For this story, we’re looking into the number of uninsured Texans. Stuart Leavenworth, who oversees the Bee’s editorial page, pointed out web postings by the Kaiser Family Foundation indicating how many residents of each state have health coverage. Nationally in 2011, the foundation estimates, some 16 percent of the population was uninsured. In Texas in 2011, the foundation says, 24 percent of residents had no health insurance — and that was the highest uninsured rate for any state. Some 22 percent of Nevada residents and 21 percent of New Mexico residents lacked coverage, according to the foundation, while California and Louisiana were among five states where 20 percent of the population was uninsured. The foundation cites as a basis for these percentages household surveys by the U.S Census Bureau, which suggest slightly different levels of the uninsured dependent on whether the cited survey is a one-day snapshot or one that encompasses several years. Regardless, Texas has consistently had the highest uninsured rate. Does it also have the greatest number of uninsured, as the editorial says? Not so. Another foundation chart indicates that California had 7.3 million uninsured residents, and Texas had more than 6.1 million. Of course, California’s population exceeds Texas’ by some 12 million. Separately, we found a lower tally for Californians under age 65 who lack coverage in a December 2012 article by Paul Fronstin of the Washington-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, which says its mission is to enhance the development of sound public policy through objective research and education. A summary of that article opens: "In 2011, California had the largest number of people under age 65 without health insurance — 7.1 million — of any U.S. state. The percentage of uninsured Californians has risen steadily over the past two decades; the state now has the seventh-largest percentage of residents without coverage in the United States." The summary says, though, that the state’s share of uninsured residents should drop as the federal law known as Obamacare takes full effect. By email, Fronstin agreed California has more uninsured than Texas, pointing to his own analysis of Census Bureau survey research released in March 2012. Still, he said, 27 percent of Texans under 65 are uninsured, compared with 22 percent of Californians. Our ruling The editorial says Texas ranks first among the states in its number of uninsured. Texas continues to have the nation’s greatest share of uninsured residents. However, California has about 1 million more uninsured residents. This claim has an element of truth, yet it’s wrong on the numbers. Mark it Mostly False.	None	Sacramento Bee Editorial Board	None	None	None	2013-02-13T15:56:07	2013-02-06	['None']

pomt-01272	"Every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/06/ben-cardin/does-raising-minimum-wage-result-job-growth/	Raising the federal minimum wage is a high priority for President Barack Obama, but the issue is mired in debate over whether or not raising the minimum wage would kill jobs. The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour, and the White House and some congressional Democrats want to bump it up to $10.10 an hour. As of December, a majority of Americans support a raise. On Election Day, voters in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota approved state-level increases to minimum wages. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., wants to see the minimum wage increased, and he defended the idea in an interview on Fox News Sunday Nov. 2, 2014. "Every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs, not a loss of jobs," Cardin said. The effect of minimum wage increases on job growth is at the core of this debate, so we wondered if Cardin’s claim was accurate. As you’ll see, the data is inconclusive, and there isn’t an expert consensus -- even among leading economists. Some data Because Cardin was talking about congressional action, we’re going to focus on federal minimum wage increases and nationwide job growth. We asked Cardin’s staff and some economists, and we did some digging around, but there doesn’t seem to be any published research that specifically answers the question: Was there job growth every year that Congress increased the federal minimum wage? (There’s plenty of research analyzing individual years, states or industries.) So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For every year Congress increased the minimum wage since 1978, we looked at how much employment grew or shrank a year after the new wage went into effect. (The first federal minimum wage went into effect in 1938, but it was not consistent across all industries until 1978.) We know this measure doesn’t account for other economic factors or state-level minimum wage increases. But we wanted to look at Cardin’s claim as literally as possible before turning to the larger debate. Below is a chart showing the years that Congress raised the minimum wage, employment the month that the change went into effect, and employment one year later, as well as the number of months that saw job growth. Year Wage ($) Employment - effective date (thousands) Employment - year later (thousands) Months of job growth Overall growth? 1978 2.65 84,595 88,810 12 Yes 1979 2.90 88,810 90,802 11 Yes 1980 3.10 90,802 91,037 8 Yes 1981 3.35 91,037 90,567 6 No 1990 3.80 109,688 108,367 2 No 1991 4.25 108,367 108,527 8 Yes 1996 4.75 120,677 123,945 11 Yes 1997 5.15 123,604 126,775 12 Yes 2007 5.85 137,984 137,421 5 No 2008 6.55 137,421 130,617 0 No 2009 7.25 130,617 130,395 4 No So Cardin’s claim isn’t literally true. Increasing the federal minimum wage isn’t always followed by national job growth, or loss for that matter. There were 12 solid months of job growth following the 1978 increase, but 12 months of job loss following the 2008 increase. Also, these minimum wage changes did not happen in a vacuum. The last three federal minimum wage increases (2007, 2008 and 2009) were followed by significant job losses, but that was all taking place amidst the global financial crisis. And the minimum wage increases in the 1990s that preceded job growth happened during an economic boom. The debate So what do the experts say? Economists are split over what effect minimum wage has on job growth. There’s some research that shows raising the minimum wage negatively impacts job growth, and a lot that shows it has an insignificant effect. For an idea of how split economists are, look at this University of Chicago poll. Researchers asked about 40 leading economists, if raising the federal minimum wage would make it "noticeably harder for low-skilled workers to find employment." In response, 34 percent agreed with the statement, 32 percent disagreed, and 24 percent were unsure. One of the most thorough reports on this debate comes out of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank. The report concludes that the "bulk of the best statistical evidence" shows little to no effect on employment when the minimum wage goes up. Those who say raising the minimum wage results in job loss generally follow the logic that when workers become more expensive, businesses will be less likely to hire them, and unemployment follows. David Neumark is an economist who has researched the issue and believes raising the minimum wage reduces employment for the lowest skilled workers. He noted, though, that the economy has grown over the long term, resulting in job growth in all wage and skill levels. "The causes of growth, and the business cycle as well, completely swamp (increases to) the minimum wage," said Neumark, director of the Center for Economics and Public Policy at the University of California Irvine. There are a few other things to keep in mind when it comes to minimum wage increases. First, it doesn’t affect that many people. Only about 2.6 percent of all wage and salaried workers in the United States are paid at or below federal minimum wage, according to 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Additionally, 23 states (and some municipalities) have minimum wages higher than the federal minimum wage. There’s also the question of whether or not minimum wage has actually increased. Yes, the sticker price gets higher, but those increases have not kept up with inflation. Adjusted for 2013 dollars, the current minimum wage is a couple of bucks lower than it was in the late 1960s. This Pew Research chart compares minimum wage in 2013 dollars to their unadjusted levels. All this means that small adjustments to the minimum wage have historically had little effect on employment, said David Gleicher, an economist at Adelphi University who has researched labor economics. "Thus there has been virtually no significant increase in prices because of higher costs, nor a significant increase in unemployment," Gleicher said. "At the same time, there has not been all that much of an increase in demand causing a significant increase in jobs." Our ruling Cardin said, "Every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs, not a loss of jobs." We looked at nationwide employment data in the years following minimum wage increases since 1978, and sometimes there was job growth, and sometimes there was job loss. Modern research tends to show that raising the minimum wage has little significant impact -- positive or negative -- on employment. Cardin got carried away when he said increasing the minimum wage is always followed by job growth. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-04557	"Barack Hussein Obama will ... force local authorities to allow Occupy protesters to live in parks."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/26/government-not-god-pac/government-not-god-pac-says-obama-wants-allow-occu/	An ad that ran in newspapers in Florida and Ohio alleges that in President Barack Obama’s America, protesters would be allowed to live in parks. "Barack Hussein Obama will move America to force local authorities to allow Occupy protesters to live in parks," it says, among a laundry list of claims on issues from abortion to gay parents to Islamic sharia law. Occupy Wall Street is a loosely organized movement that famously set up camp in Manhattan’s Zuccotti Park on Sept. 17, 2011, among other public spaces around the country. The city ultimately cleared out the protesters’ tents, and a New York judge upheld the city’s right to do that. Protesters could protest — they just couldn’t camp. Does Obama want to change the law? There’s a First Amendment right to peaceably assemble, but local governments are generally allowed to enforce time and place restrictions on those gatherings. Specifically, the Supreme Court has ruled that governments may outlaw sleeping in parks, even during protests. Clark vs. Community for Creative Nonviolence, a 1984 case that involved a tent city in Washington, D.C., established that as long as rules are content-neutral — apply to everyone equally, no matter their message — sleeping in public is subject to "reasonable time, place, or manner restrictions." One way the federal government might "force" local governments to allow protesters to live in parks might be to overturn that Supreme Court case, establishing precedent that the First Amendment right to assembly extends to camping out. A president can’t do that. That’s assuming he wanted to. William J. Murray, chairman of GINGPAC, provided us with three articles to back up the ad’s claim. The stories from the Washington Post, NBC New York and ABC document the president’s embrace of the protesters’ message: "I understand the frustrations being expressed," Obama said. But the articles don’t address whether Obama believes protesters should be allowed to camp out indefinitely in parks. We looked for evidence that Obama might be interested in forcing authorities to allow such a thing. We found the opposite. Take this exchange between a journalist and White House press secretary Jay Carney during a briefing on Jan. 20, 2012, which confirms the need to "balance" First Amendment concerns with "public safety and public health concerns" — in essence, current law. Carney, rather than criticize local police action, deferred to local authorities. QUESTION: The Occupy Wall Street protesters are making headlines again. As you know, over the weekend 400 protesters were arrested in Oakland and now, today, the National Park Service is expected to clear out protesters potentially as we speak from a site here in D.C. What is your reaction? And is the administration concerned that some of these protesters are taking things too far? CARNEY: Well, with regards to Oakland, that -- that's obviously a local law enforcement matter. Here in Washington, I would refer you for specifics to the U.S. National Park Service and the U.S. Park Police. And our position has been and continues to be that we need to balance First Amendment concerns of the right to demonstrate, the right to speak freely and -- with public safety concerns and public health concerns. And we understand that whether -- that local law enforcement, as well as in the case -- in this case the National Park Service and U.S. Park Police, are -- are weighing those considerations when they make these decisions and that's appropriate. We found no evidence Obama has sought such an accommodation for the protesters. The president himself didn’t raise the issue in several briefings and interviews we found that touched on the protests. Rather, he focused on the content of the protests, such as regulation of Wall Street. We chatted with Gene Policinski, senior vice president and executive director of the First Amendment Center, which followed the protests. Did the federal government show any indication of wanting to push against established law allowing local governments to outlaw camping? "I saw no evidence of that anywhere during the Occupy movement," he told us. "At the worst, it's a complete distortion. At the least, somebody misunderstands a request by citizens for due process." We reached out to Occupy Wall Street. "It sounds like a bunch of crazy propaganda nonsense," said Dana Balicki, a member of the press team. Our ruling An ad from GINGPAC claimed, "Barack Hussein Obama will move America to force local authorities to allow Occupy protesters to live in parks." There’s a First Amendment right to peaceably assemble, but local governments are generally allowed to enforce time and place restrictions on those gatherings. An expert from the First Amendment Center told us he saw no evidence that the president was interested in changing the law and we found no evidence of that in our searches.

pomt-04137	Says that according to "many reports and even our own data," the state of Texas spent more through Medicaid on orthodontia than all other states combined.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/jan/04/lois-kolkhorst/committee-chief-says-texas-government-spent-more-t/	A legislator featured at a breakfast during the September 2012 Texas Tribune Festival brought up orthodontia—I know, right?—and made a Texas-sized claim. Rep. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, who chairs the House Committee on Public Health, said: "It’s unacceptable that the state of Texas spent more than all 49" other "states combined, according to many, many reports and even our own data." The claim was heard and relayed to us by University of Texas journalism student Cody Permenter. Texas, No. 1 in recent Heisman Trophy winners, winter warm spells—and orthodontia? By email, Kolkhorst’s chief of staff, Chris Steinbach, said Kolkhorst drew on groundbreaking news reports by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, about Medicaid spending on orthodontia, as well as a congressional report published in April 2012. Since May 2011, the station has presented numerous reports exploring expenditures on what appear to have been many medically unneeded orthodontic procedures provided to children enrolled in Medicaid, the joint federal-state health program. In the initial May 13, 2011, broadcast, reporter Byron Harris said such expenditures are supposed to be authorized only when a child’s teeth are so crooked they could handicap the child. But, he said, required authorizations submitted by Texas practitioners had been rejected by a state contractor only when paperwork was flawed. "Under Medicaid, Texas spends far more on braces than any state in the country, more than the next 10 states combined," Harris reported. The segment showed Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, saying: "For whatever reason, it’s an area where we’ve had more trouble than other parts of Medicaid." Spending was described more dramatically in subsequent WFAA-TV reports, though wordings varied. For instance, a station anchor introduced a June 19, 2011, report by saying Texas "spent $184 million last year on free braces for kids covered by Medicaid. That’s more than the rest of the country combined." In an Aug. 18, 2011, report, Harris said the same Texas spending was "as much as the rest of the nation combined," a characterization repeated in a segment that aired a week later in which he said the state "now spends as much on braces for poor kids as the other 49 states combined." We wondered how the station researched spending in Texas and other states. By phone, Harris said that he and a producer contacted the states that, with Texas, comprise the nation’s 10 most populous: California, New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina. Harris said letters sent to officials in each state inquired into how much the state had spent in 2010 on orthodontic procedures the station had zeroed in on in Texas. "Nobody had ever asked for this before," Harris said. Resulting totals, according to a spreadsheet Harris forwarded to us, ranged from zero in Michigan to $1 million for Ohio and up to $19.4 million for California and $20 million for North Carolina. And the nine-state total, $126.7 million, ran well short of the $184 million spent in Texas. Harris said the station did not research spending in the 40 other states, which would have drained too much time. Instead, he said, "we just guessed" at how much the other states spent. He also agreed that such spending in the other 40 states could push the total for all other states over the Texas total. "It could go either way," he said. Harris later called us back, saying: "You can shoot our methodology" per the spending in the 40 other states, though it’s also worth noting that the state of Texas did not make its own comparison. "The proof is available," Harris said. Texas officials "chose not to go for it." The congressional report cited by Steinbach, issued April 25, 2012, by the Republican majority staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, says that "between 2008 and 2010, Texas’ Medicaid program spent more on orthodontics, particularly braces, than all 49 remaining states combined." But that comparison, also quoted in an Aug. 19, 2012, Wall Street Journal news article noted by Kolkhorst, does not appear to have been independently researched. A footnote in the committee staff report credits a Dec. 27, 2011, special report by WFAA, whose online summary of the report says: "Texas paid more for Medicaid-funded dental orthodontics than the other 49 states combined." The congressional report also quotes the then-Texas Medicaid director, Billy Millwee, as saying that because the state was focused on increasing the participation of dentists in Medicaid in accordance with a broad plan resulting from a lawsuit, the state had not noticed the stunning increase in spending on orthodontic services. In August 2011, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission announced that it was tightening its oversight of requests to pay for orthodontics through Medicaid. By phone, spokeswoman Goodman told us it’s not known whether Texas spent the same or more on orthodontics than what was spent in other states combined nor was it necessarily the agency's mission to prove or disprove that. She said by email that when state researchers asked the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services about a Texas-to-other-states comparison, they were told it would be difficult to compare states because of the different ways state Medicaid programs address orthodontic services. At the federal agency, spokesman Alper Ozinal told us state-specific figures for 2010 Medicaid spending on orthodontic procedures were not yet compiled. Goodman told us: "No doubt, there have been problems with orthodontic services and we paid for claims that didn’t meet the criteria for medical necessity," but significantly, she said by email, the state also ensured that more needy children received basic dental services. She sent a chart showing that Medicaid spending on orthodontic procedures escalated more than 200 percent from nearly $73 million in 2006 to $249 million five years later. Medicaid expenditures on other dental procedures in Texas increased at a faster clip--300 percent, from nearly $297 million to nearly $1.2 billion, according to the chart. Goodman noted, too, that in March 2012, the state shifted from a fee-for-service approach to Medicaid-funded dental services to a managed-care approach, a move that put the financial risk of providing services on contractors rather than the state. According to an Oct. 15, 2012, commission presentation, "there has been a significant decrease in the number of orthodontic prior authorization requests and approvals" since implementation of the managed-care method. Also, the presentation says, the commission’s inspector general had identified more than 50 probable "over-utilizers" of orthodontic services and identified $229 million in potential overpayments with 26 orthodontic providers placed on payment hold based on credible fraud allegations. Kolkhorst said her reference at the Tribune event to "our own data" reflected efforts by House aides to check spending in some other states. She emailed us what she described as her handwritten notes suggesting that 14 other states, combined, spent nearly $150 million on such procedures, about $35 million less than Texas alone. The notes show totals for the nine states separately checked by WFAA plus Arkansas, Colorado, Wyoming and Alabama and Hawaii, both shown as spending nothing on the procedures. "Without us actually calling all 50 states and adding it all up, which we could do, I am very confident ... that Texas spent in the ballpark of the 49 other states," Kolkhorst said. "It could be within $1 million or $10 million—the point being" that what Texas spent by itself was "incredible." Kolkhorst said that if WFAA had said Texas solely outspent the other most-populous states, combined, she would have said that and shouldn’t be penalized for echoing what she believed to be accurate reportage. Otherwise, she said, "it is now our job to research whatever the media puts out." Our ruling Kolkhorst said that according to "many reports" and "our own data," Texas outspent all other states combined on Medicaid-funded orthodontia. Texas experienced a toothsome spending spike; WFAA's reporting demonstrates the state spent more on orthodontic procedures funded by Medicaid in 2010 than the other most-populous states, combined. But relevant research has been limited to the spending in Texas and nine to 14 other states. Lacking complete backup information, this claim rates as Half True.

pomt-12847	Says former President Barack Obama "will be on new $1 dollar bill."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/03/blog-posting/old-internet-claim-obama-will-be-new-1-bill-still-/	A persistent, false claim running on numerous blogs says former President Barack Obama will replace George Washington on the $1 bill this year. The report is actually worthless. "Barrack Obama will be on new $1 dollar bill 2017," reads a headline on a Jan. 26, 2017, post on TrueAmericans.me. It included a illustration (shown above) of what such a dollar may look like. The same site posted a poll asking readers whether they supported the move. The claim was flagged by Facebook, which is trying to crack down on fabricated articles that resemble real news. The false story, complete with the misspelling of "Barack," appeared on several other websites in January. The story says Obama will displace George Washington, and that the public will be able to help choose from among several designs — in early 2016. That’s an easy clue that this fake story is both wrong and outdated. For the record, Obama will not be going on the $1 bill, although some new bill designs (including a $20 featuring Harriet Tubman) are in the works. The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing says there are no plans to redesign the $1 bill, because it’s seldom the target of counterfeiting. There are also some legal roadblocks. The U.S. Treasury does not permit living people to be on currency notes, and Congress has prohibited a redesign of the single greenback in its omnibus spending measures. The vending machine lobby convinced lawmakers to leave the dollar alone, mostly because it would be expensive for vendors to upgrade bill readers to recognize cash sans Washington. It’s hard to tell where the idea of Obama headlining the base unit of American currency originated, but contrived news stories about it go back to at least 2012. Supermarket tabloid Weekly World News ran a story falsely saying the Obama administration had approved a new design for all bills, including a dollar featuring the 44th president that would be worth 47 cents. The story made reference to the Dollar ReDe$ign Project, a branding experiment going back to 2010 that solicited new currency designs. Other blogs reran the Weekly World News story as fact. We found the version of the story currently in circulation on blogs going back to 2014, with the same faux dollar illustration. The United States Mint did strike a pair of bronze medals commemorating Obama’s two terms in office. You can buy replicas of both, but they are not legal tender. You also can buy several forms of joke bills featuring Obama from private online vendors, including denominations of $44, $2,008 and even $1 million. But Obama appearing on any real currency, like making it onto the United Federation of Britain’s $50 in the 2012 remake of Total Recall, will remain fictional for now.

pomt-12237	"I’ve got 15 days from my announcement to file paperwork with the FEC!"	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/14/kid-rock/kid-rock-announces-us-senate-run-needs-check-rules/	Musician and Michigan native Kid Rock lashed out at the media for allegedly bungling details about his intention to run for U.S. Senate, but it looks like this cowboy was a little too quick on the draw. Kid Rock (whose real name is Robert Ritchie) created a website, KidRockForSenate.com, announcing his interest in a 2018 campaign against Michigan incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat who has been in office since 2001. The site only offered a signup for email updates and a link to a "Kid Rock for U.S. Senate" web store. Previously, Kid Rock’s biggest foray into politics was a trip to the White House with Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent in April. He confirmed the site was real on July 12, 2017, via Twitter and Facebook, leading to a flurry of news stories saying he’s now a devil with a cause. Reporters for the Washington Post and the New York Times noted they didn’t find any Federal Election Commission paperwork for Ritchie’s campaign. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Kid Rock took exception to some of the coverage in a July 13 post on KidRock.com titled, "Once again the press is wrong." "First of all, I’ve got 15 days from my announcement to file paperwork with the FEC!" he wrote, without mentioning a specific report that he was refuting. "Second, I’m not signed to Warner Bros!!! — which simple fact-checking would have revealed. I have recently worked out a unique deal with BMG, Broken Bow, CAA and Live Nation to release music ON MY TERMS." He repeated that statement on Twitter and Facebook. People may have been confused about his current contracts because the July 13 post was actually the first time he had announced the new recording arrangements. Kid Rock spokesman Kirt Webster confirmed that his 2015 album First Kiss was his last with Warner Music Group. Webster also said Warner Bros. still does Kid Rock’s merchandising, so that’s why the Kid Rock for U.S. Senate web store is hosted by Warner Bros. Records. Don’t replace the Star-Spangled Banner with Bawitdaba just yet. Webster did not answer us when we asked if the Senate announcement was real, but Ritchie conspicuously released two new songs and announced a tour on July 14. But whether or not he’s on a lonely road of faith (these are Kid Rock lyrics, we hope you realize) to reach the Senate, Kid Rock’s explanation of FEC deadlines isn’t entirely accurate. The FEC website notes in its "Quick Answers to Candidate Questions" that how much money a potential candidate gets for or spends on a campaign determines the deadline for when they must file paperwork, not simply announcing an intention to run for office. If a Senate hopeful either receives $5,000 in contributions or spends $5,000 on a campaign, the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 says registration and reporting responsibilities take effect. FEC spokeswoman Judith Ingram said that a candidate has 15 days after that threshold has been reached to designate a principal campaign committee by either filing a Statement of Candidacy or a letter with the same information. Ten days after that, the committee must register a Statement of Organization. "If a person has announced or is acting like a candidate AND has passed that $5,000 threshold, s/he becomes a candidate and the requirement to register with and report to the FEC kicks in," Ingram told us via email. For a Senate seat, the paperwork would be filed through the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, she said. Ingram didn’t know whether Kid Rock would meet the threshold by either spending $5,000 on his website or taking in $5,000 through sales of t-shirts and trucker caps (at least one campaign veteran thinks so). We’ll know if Kid Rock officially files within the next couple weeks, because this is a story we will follow all summer long. Our ruling Kid Rock said, "I’ve got 15 days from my announcement to file paperwork with the FEC!" While he was quick to berate the press, Kid Rock oversimplified his explanation. Registration and reporting rules come into play after receiving or spending $5,000 on campaign activity, FEC rules say. Just saying you’re running for office doesn’t trigger the 15-day requirement, although it may be possible Kid Rock has already met that $5,000 limit somehow. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-15017	"More preschoolers are shot dead each year than police officers are in the line of duty."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/06/nicholas-kristof/nicholas-kristof-gun-deaths-preschoolers-police/	The Oregon shootings raise the question of what can be done to reduce the frequency of gun violence. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof argued in favor of smaller steps that might enjoy public support, such as requiring safe storage at home and a 10-year ban for anyone convicted of domestic violence or assault. Kristof said the country would do well to tackle this problem as a matter of public health. To drive home that point, he made a grim comparison. "In America, more preschoolers are shot dead each year (82 in 2013) than police officers are in the line of duty (27 in 2013), according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FBI," Kristof wrote in an Oct. 3, 2015 op-ed. A reader asked us to see if that was accurate. We found that it was, and for more years than the one he cited. We also stress-tested his comparison by defining preschoolers more narrowly than he did and for the most part, the comparison still holds up. The Federal Bureau of Investigation tracks the deaths of law enforcement officers, whether they serve in the smallest sheriff’s department or a large federal agency. In 2013, 26 officers died in shootings. (Kristof was off by one because he included a non-shooting death.) Counting the deaths of preschoolers is a bit more complicated. You have to decide the age range that defines a preschooler, and whether to include both accidental and intentional killings. We learned from Kristof that he took preschoolers to mean every child from a newborn to 4-years-old, and he included gun deaths under all circumstances. Since public health routinely focuses on accidents, that is consistent with Kristof’s approach and gun violence normally includes homicide. Kristof said he picked his age group based on the definition used by the U.S. Education Department. The agency’s guide to Title 1 services (aid for lower income children) leaves the range rather open-ended. It says "For the purpose of Title I, children from birth to the age that the LEA (Local Education Agency) provides a free public elementary education may receive preschool services." Some school districts might take children at age 5, in others, it might be 6. Kristof’s 0 to 4 seems defensible. However, we also found that the CDC often considers preschoolers to be children from the ages of 3 to 5. We used both age groups when we pulled death statistics from the CDC’s WISQAR fatal injury database. This table using FBI and CDC data shows the results. For the age range Kristof used, firearm deaths of preschoolers exceeded those of law enforcement officers in every year back to 2008. For the more restricted CDC age range, his statement held up in four out of the past six years. Our ruling Kristof said that more preschoolers are shot dead each year than are on-duty police officers. For children aged 0-4, that is accurate for the past six years. For children aged 3-5, the statement is true in most years, but not in every year. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Nicholas Kristof	None	None	None	2015-10-06T10:51:50	2015-10-03	['None']
pomt-05536	"Why was there no news coverage of this raid on the Arizona border? … Seizure was just five days ago. Right on the Arizona border!"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/10/chain-email/chain-email-says-media-ignored-recent-raid-arizona/	The photos tell a story. But is it the one a chain email says they tell? A screed popping into in-boxes in April 2012 says it depicts a raid on the U.S.-Mexico border, where U.S. border patrol, Mexican patrol, Arizona SWAT teams and "sheriff’s undercover agents" seized an impressive cache of assault weapons, ammunition, grenades and launchers. More than two dozen photos support the narrative: Tarps covered with weapons. Men in military garb sorting clips loaded with bullets. Unmarked SUVs. Recovered uniforms. Several images still carry Spanish-language captions. "Why was there no news coverage of this raid on the Arizona border?" the email says. "Seizure was just five days ago. Right on the Arizona border!" The message text includes a date: March 2, 2012. A reader sent us the message, saying she had received it from at least three people in recent days. We had to know: Did a significant raid take place in early March along the Arizona border that mainstream media failed to report? ‘WE MUST PROTECT OUR BORDERS!!!!!’ The email begins: This is terrifying that we are seeing NONE of this on the news!!! WE MUST PROTECT OUR BORDERS!!!!! This is the 2nd raid this year - this one took place on 3/2/12 at 3 am - Border Patrol, Mexican Patrol, AZ swat teams and sheriff's undercover agents. I worked with one of the agent's dad for 25+ years and he sent these pictures this afternoon. 3-7-2012 Our country is in BIG trouble....Why was there no news coverage of this raid on the Arizona border? Definitely NOT Jose wishing to come pick lettuce! This is exactly why we MUST support ARIZONA. This seizure was just five days ago. Right on the Arizona border! This is but one seizure that has taken place along the border over the past year. There have been many more like this (but you won't hear about it on major media news). Not a mention on ABC - CBS - NBC - MSNBC - or CNN news- - even on FOX. These photos and reports come from a Spanish language news source. Thank God for the border patrol and that they did not allow this to get in. Huge stash of assault rifles (grenade launchers in center!). So, was there an Arizona border raid? Um, no. The first clues are in the Spanish-language photo captions. They refer just to an operation by "the military," near the municipality of Higueras. One says the raid happened at 10 a.m. about a third of a mile from the Marin-Higueras highway. Another says at least 25 offenders escaped to the mountains. Any reference to the United States? No. Arizona? No. March 2012? No. A quick Web search for roads identified in the photo captions turns up another false note: a YouTube video posted not last month, but in May 2010. It includes the same images repeated in the email message. The Mexican town of Higueras, it turns out, is about 800 miles from the Arizona border. It’s more than 130 miles from Nuevo Laredo, Texas. (Or, by another measure, about 70 miles from the U.S. border.) Snopes debunked a version of this chain email in August 2010. A Newsweek article on May 17, 2010, says the Mexican military discovered a major training camp run by the Zetas drug cartel. Maybe you heard about the raid — back when it actually happened. Our ruling A chain email in April 2012 recycles images from a raid that happened nowhere near Arizona, and certainly not on March 2, 2012. "Why was there no news coverage of this raid on the Arizona border?" it says. "Seizure was just five days ago. Right on the Arizona border!" You didn’t see it on the news for an excellent reason: It’s not news. It’s instead a ridiculous claim that warrants a rating of Pants on Fire.

pomt-04781	The Obama administration "willfully leaked the existence of STUXNET (a computer worm used against Iran), allowing our enemies to learn more of our secrets and of our operations."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/24/special-operations-opsec-education-fund/group-says-obama-administration-willfully-leaked-e/	The group of former special forces soldiers and CIA officers behind the video Dishonorable Disclosure wants to make the case that the Obama administration is more than ready to sacrifice national security if it will boost the president’s popularity with voters. The group goes by the name Special Operations -- OPSEC, which stands for operations security. We have rated two other claims. One was about the White House working with Hollywood producers and giving away intelligent sources and methods, which we rated Mostly False. The other was about whether the Obama administration gave away the identify of of a Pakistani doctor involved in the effort to find Osama bin Laden, which earned a False. We now turn to the group's statement about the U.S. cyberattacks on Iran’s nuclear program. In the video, the announcer says, "This administration willfully leaked the existence of STUXNET, allowing our enemies to learn more of our secrets and of our operations." "When we stand up and admit that we were part of putting STUXNET together with our Israeli friends," Bill Cowan, a retired Marine Lt. Colonel, said. "We have really undermined our ability to one, have the Israelis or anyone else work with us on the technology side, and second, we have made it very clear to the Iranians, who did it and who they need to be coming back to pay back." We wondered if the Obama administration did reveal the nature of the computer worm STUXNET to the world, whether White House insiders shared information that they shouldn’t have, and in so doing, increased the national security threat to America. We asked the OPSEC group for supporting information. They referred us to a June 2012 New York Times article and comments from two senators. Zeroing in on STUXNET STUXNET was a complex computer program that infected the centrifuges used by Iran to enrich uranium. It had two main lines of attack. One would take over the centrifuges and cause them to speed up until they shattered. The other component was especially deceptive. It recorded the pattern of normal operations and fed those signals to the machine technicians so they would never see what was actually going on until it was too late. With 15,000 lines of code, it was more sophisticated and, as computer security experts eventually learned, more targeted than any worm seen before. Needless to say, it was intriguing. Much in the OPSEC claim hinges on what was known at various times, so let's start with a time line. First, it's important to note there were revelations about a possible U.S. computer attack before Obama took office. When President George W. Bush was in office, he pushed the idea of targeting Iran's computers as an alternative to an Israeli air strike, according to a January 2009 New York Times article. The article relies on unnamed "senior American and foreign officials" and says, "Mr. Bush embraced more intensive covert operations actions aimed at Iran" that included the possibility of attacking the country's computer systems and networks. We searched the Nexis database and found the earliest press reports on STUXNET came in late July 2010. Computer security firms had picked up an unusual virus that seemed to be found more in Iran than anywhere else. But there were just five articles in July and only two in August. The articles indicate the information came from private security companies, not the U.S. government. The number shot up to nearly 150 articles in September. By that time, the experts had begun to pick STUXNET apart -- and they were impressed. Its subtleties and single focus on one type of German-made computer control device attracted a lot of attention. By the end of the month, the British newspaper The Independent, had the headline "Has West declared cyber war on Iran? Experts say the computer virus found in a nuclear plant is the work of a foreign power." By October, reporters were talking about Israel as the likely force behind the virus. In November the Christian Science Monitor wrote of speculation that America and Israel had teamed up to build it. That same month, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acknowledged that Iranian equipment had been damaged.To some extent, not only was the worm complex, it was also an effective new weapon. In January 2011 came a more robust linkage to the United States when the New York Times reported that "strong clues" pointed to a virus "designed as an American-Israeli project to sabotage the Iranian program." The article detailed that U.S. government engineers had studied the vulnerabilities of the control units that ran the Iranian centrifuges. It said those were the access points that STUXNET exploited. It described the kind of centrifuge used in Iran, the so-called P-1, and reported that an "American expert in nuclear intelligence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Israelis used machines of the P-1 style to test the effectiveness of STUXNET." The article cited "officials familiar with the administration’s Iran strategy" as saying President Barack Obama had ordered researchers to move faster on a Bush administration project to target the electrical and computer systems around Natanz, Iran’s major uranium enrichment facility. In June 2012, the New York Times reported that Obama personally had endorsed the operation called Olympic Games that produced STUXNET. The article relied on unnamed "members of the president’s national security team who were in the room" when the president and his top advisers discussed using the worm. It repeated many of the details in the earlier article but tied STUXNET into a broader strategy. It conveyed the administration’s reservations of unleashing a new form of warfare. It offered the president’s rationale for moving forward: A cyber attack would be better than a bombing run by Israel. The attribution makes it clear that the Times reporter got considerable information from top officials in the Obama administration. The article cites "participants in the many Situation Room meetings" and "current and former American, European and Israeli officials involved in the program." Congress reacts Democrats and Republicans in Congress voiced alarm. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif, and Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., the chair and vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, issued a joint press release. They called the accelerating pace of leaks "unacceptable". They warned that "these disclosures have seriously interfered with ongoing intelligence programs and have put at jeopardy our intelligence capability to act in the future." Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized the administration. "Our friends and allies," McCain said on the Senate floor, "Especially the Israelis, who have been compromised on the STUXNET operation, the virus in the Iranian nuclear program, of course, feel betrayed. Obama shot back during a press conference. "The notion that my White House would purposely release classified national security information is offensive. It's wrong," Obama said. Obama said there were mechanisms to track down those who leaked and that if they were found, there would be consequences. Obama also said "as I think has been indicated from these articles, whether or not the information they've received is true, the writers of these articles have all stated unequivocally that they didn't come from this White House. And that's not how we operate." Actually, the source of the leak remains unclear. The person or persons were pretty clearly part of the administration, which could include the White House staff, the Pentagon or the CIA. The day of that press conference, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder named two federal prosecutors to investigate possible leaks of classified information by the Obama administration. Defining a leak The New York Times reporter who wrote the June story, David Sanger, was asked many times about White House leaks. On Face the Nation, Sanger diminished the administration’s role in his work. "I spent a year working the story from the bottom up, and then went to the administration and told them what I had," Sanger said. "Then they had to make some decisions about how much they want to talk about it. All that you read about this being deliberate leaks out of the White House, it wasn't my experience." Sanger underscored that the start of the story came when the worm spread out of Iran and was detected by computer security companies around the world. The time line of newspaper activity confirms the intense level of interest in STUXNET within the cyber community. The time line also shows that more than a year earlier, in 2011, a team of New York Times reporters had fleshed out and reported many of the details in the 2012 story with no apparent help from the Obama administration. As for inflaming Iran’s desire to get even, Sanger was skeptical. "I would say that the Iranians had figured out two years ago they were being attacked," he said. And they "strongly suspected the United States and Israel." But Steve Aftergood with the Federation of American Scientists, is less sanguine about the consequences. While Aftergood agrees that many people knew about STUXNET long before Sanger’s article, the implications of American acknowledgment of its role in unleashing the worm were potentially huge. "The STUXNET operation was essentially an act of war," Aftergood told us. That’s why the sources in Sanger’s story needed to remain anonymous. To speak openly would open create a legal opening for Iran. "A confirmed U.S. role in the operation would arguably entitle Iran -- under the laws of war -- to take reciprocal, proportionate offensive measures against the U.S., or to seek legal or financial remedies," Aftergood said. Our ruling The Special Operations OPSEC group said the administration "willfully leaked the existence of STUXNET, allowing our enemies to learn more of our secrets and of our operations." There are big holes in this argument. As the time line shows, public knowledge of STUXNET long preceded any comment from any Obama administration official. There was extensive coverage and speculation about possible U.S. involvement months before June 2012. Our enemies didn't need the Obama administration to tell them this -- there was plenty of coverage before there was any attribution to Obama's team. Still, it's clear that the Obama administration provided details -- including a quote from Obama himself in a meeting -- to the New York Times. So the administration -- broadly defined -- confirmed its operational role in the creation of the worm. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-11501	"So many of these shooters turn out to be communist Democrats."	pants on fire!	/north-carolina/statements/2018/feb/23/larry-pittman/nc-republican-says-many-mass-shooters-turn-out-be-/	Leave it to lawmakers and pundits to ascribe political motivations to people who may have none. It didn’t take long after the shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school for politicians and pundits to speculate on whether the suspect was left- or right-leaning. CNN’s Van Jones retweeted an account that suggested most mass shooters are Republicans. Meanwhile, a state legislator in North Carolina claimed on Facebook that most shooters are "communist Democrats," and a Congresswoman from New York made a similar claim. (Read about her claim here.) In NC, state Rep. Larry Pittman, a Republican state House member from Cabarrus County, near Charlotte, was reacting to a photo on Facebook that purported to show the Parkland shooter wearing a pro-Communism shirt. (It was not the Parkland shooter.) "So many of these shooters turn out to be communist Democrats, that I suspect they are doing these things to push for gun control so they can more easily take over the country," Pittman wrote. The post was later deleted and he apologized. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com There’s a lot we do know about the people who conduct mass shootings. For instance, they’re mostly white men. They’re usually young. And some have a history of mental illness. As for their political affiliation? Here’s what we found. Mass shooters since Columbine There is no universal definition for mass shootings. We looked at 19 shootings that have received significant national media coverage since the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. More than eight people were killed in each of the shootings. We found very few cases in which the political affiliation of the shooter could be verified. Omar Mateen, the shooter who killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, was registered as a Democrat in 2006. He voted in the Florida primary in 2016, according to reporting from Politico. A dating profile for Chris Harper-Mercer, who killed nine people at a community college in Oregon in 2015, said he was a Republican, according to reporting from CBS News. There was no evidence of his political affiliation beyond the profile. A friend of Aaron Alexis, who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013, said in a CNN interview that the shooter was "more of a liberal type." There were no other reports of his political affiliation. Politicians were the victims of a couple of recent shooting rampages that weren’t on our list of 19 mass shootings. In 2017, 66-year-old James Thomas Hodgkinson shot and injured six people at a congressional baseball game in Virginia — nearly killing House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Hodgkinson volunteered for the presidential campaign of Democrat Bernie Sanders and apparently targeted the Republican team. In 2011, 22-year-old Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in Tucson at an event hosted by Rep. Gabby Giffords, an Arizona Democrat. Loughner killed six and injured 13 others, including Giffords. Authorities reported that he was obsessed with Giffords. Inaccurate reporting There was speculation about the political leanings of some of the other shooters. ABC News falsely reported that James Holmes, who killed 12 people in Colorado in 2012, was a member of the conservative Tea Party. ABC apologized for the error. Breitbart News reported that Holmes may have been a registered Democrat, but also walked back that claim. Holmes’ political affiliation was never verified. Fake news websites claimed Devin Patrick Kelley, who killed 26 people in a Texas church last year, was linked to anti-fascist groups. PolitiFact debunked that claim. Websites made the same claim about Las Vegas shooter Stephen Craig Paddock. We debunked that, too. Paddock wasn’t registered to vote and his family said he didn’t have strong political views, according to a report from Fox News. There were also claims that Adam Lanza, who killed 20 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, was a Democrat. He was not registered to vote, according to the Washington Post. Most recently, our friends at Snopes debunked the claim that Nikolas Cruz, who allegedly killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, was a Democrat. A search of Florida’s voter database yielded no results for Cruz’s party affiliation. There was no reporting on the political leanings of the other 11 shooters. Is it relevant? Mass shooters are rarely motivated by a political agenda, experts told us. Mass shootings are often perpetrated by young men who are socially isolated or have a mental illness, experience a trauma or conflict that sends them reeling emotionally, and have easy access to guns, said Alan Lipman, professor at George Washington University Medical Center and founder of the Center for the Study of Violence. "Their motives are almost always, without exception, nonpolitical. And they don’t describe themselves as having a particular political motivation," Lipman said. Some — like Dylann Roof, who killed nine people at a church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015 — might channel their rage at a specific group of people, said James Alan Fox, criminologist at Northeastern University and author of "Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder." But that doesn’t mean they’re acting on a Republican or Democratic mission, he said. "Very few are motivated by any sort of political agenda in terms in parties. They might be anti-gay or anti-black or anti-white. You could argue those are political, I guess," he said. Even then, those beliefs are often born out of personal vendettas — not political propaganda, said Katherine Ramsland, professor of psychology at DeSales University. "Look at Stephen Paddock. We don't know his motive," Ramsland said in an email, referring to the Las Vegas shooter. "Devin Kelly — his political affiliation is secondary to his family disputes and need for payback. I just think it's overly simplistic to align a mass shooter's influence with a political ideology unless it's clear from the shooter that this was his (or her) driving issue." Other experts reacted similarly to the assertion that shooters tend to have common political beliefs. "Most of the school shooters are children who wouldn’t know a conservative from a communist," said Jack Levin, Northeastern professor and co-director of the Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict. "The idea of associating politics with these mass murders is absurd. It has absolutely nothing to do with it." Lipman agreed: "There is absolutely no evidence to show that mass killings are motivated by political ideologies of any type. All of the mass killings we’ve seen have been motivated by a lethal combination of a small subgroup of mental illnesses, and easy accessibility to weapons of mass killing during the peak symptomatology of those illnesses." Our ruling Pittman said many perpetrators of mass shootings turn out to be communist Democrats. We found no evidence to support that statement and experts say only a small fraction of mass shooters were motivated by a political agenda. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-10347	Says Obama flip-flopped on warrantless wiretapping.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/15/john-mccain/what-a-difference-eight-months-makes/	The campaign of Sen. John McCain, eager to portray Sen. Barack Obama as someone who won't stick to his principles, has alleged that Obama flip-flopped on warrantless wiretapping. McCain's spokesman said Obama reversed a vow to filibuster any bill that immunized phone companies from lawsuits for letting the government eavesdrop on their customers without warrants. "A few short months ago, Barack Obama outwardly opposed terrorist surveillance legislation, saying that he would filibuster any bill that includes immunity for American telecommunications companies that had been asked by the government to participate in the program," McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a news release on July 9, 2008. "Today, the U.S. Senate will approve legislation providing the immunity Barack Obama supposedly opposed, and despite his promise, he will not support a filibuster." At issue is a surveillance program launched by the National Security Agency after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The agency asked telecommunications companies such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. to help it monitor the international calls and e-mails of customers in the United States without warrants. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act requires court approval for domestic surveillance. Anyone who violates the law is subject to fines of up to $10,000 or five years in prison. So after the New York Times exposed the wiretapping program in 2005, the telecommunications companies were vulnerable to lawsuits from irate customers. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, 46 lawsuits have been filed against the phone companies. The Bush administration asked Congress last year to grant the telecom companies immunity from the lawsuits. McCain and most other Republicans supported a measure that would do so, but some Democratic leaders, under pressure from liberal bloggers and civil liberties advocates, opposed it. Obama was one of those leaders. In October 2007, Obama spokesman Bill Burton issued this unequivocal statement to the liberal blog TPM Election Central: "To be clear: Barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies." Key segments of the Democratic base — enjoying substantial influence in the run-up to the Democratic presidential primaries — were pleased. "This is the kind of leadership we need to see from the Democratic candidates," MoveOn spokesman Adam Green said at the time. But recently the Senate again took up legislation that would let the phone companies off the hook. It would also expand the government's domestic spying powers. Obama supported an amendment that would have stripped telecom immunity from the measure. But after that amendment failed, Obama declined to filibuster the bill. In fact, he voted for it. It passed the Senate, 69-28, on July 9. The House passed the same bill last month, and Bush said he would sign it soon. (McCain missed the vote because he was campaigning in Ohio, but he has consistently supported the immunity plan.) In a message to supporters, Obama defended his position, citing a phrase Democrats fought to include that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is the "exclusive" means of wiretapping for intelligence. The bill "is far better than the Protect America Act that I voted against last year... (because it) makes it clear to any president or telecommunications company that no law supersedes the authority of the FISA court." Obama also cited a provision requiring several inspectors general — who are internal government watchdogs — to investigate the program. "It will allow a close look at past misconduct without hurdles that would exist in federal court because of classification issues," Obama said. None of that, however, negates Obama's promise to filibuster "any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies." He declined to do so. Obama's campaign did not respond to our request for comment. But in this case, it's clear that the McCain campaign's accusation of a flip-flop is True.

pomt-05934	"In 2006, I went out and authored a letter with 24 other senators asking for major reform of Freddie and Fannie, warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/27/rick-santorum/sen-rick-santorum-says-he-warned-meltdown-and-bubb/	As Republican presidential candidates battled over mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in a debate in Jacksonville, Fla., Rick Santorum sought the high ground. "In 2006, I went out and authored a letter with 24 other senators asking for major reform of Freddie and Fannie, warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market," the former Pennsylvania senator he said. "I stood out, I stood tall and tried to get a reform, and we couldn't do it." We wondered, did Santorum sign such a letter, "warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market" before its collapse? The claim In the Jan. 26, 2012, debate, Fannie and Freddie came up in a question contributed by the public. "How would you phase out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Does the private mortgage industry need additional regulation?" That degenerated into a mudfest. Newt Gingrich, who once had a consulting contract with Freddie Mac, accused Mitt Romney of holding investments in the government-chartered entities. Romney accused Gingrich of also holding mutual funds that invest in them. Moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Ron Paul and Rick Santorum a followup question. "It seems they both acknowledge they both made money from Fannie and Freddie," he said "Should they return that money?" Santorum said: "Well, I would just say, in answer to the question, that as I mentioned last debate, in 2006, I went out and authored a letter with 24 other senators asking for major reform of Freddie and Fannie, warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market. I stood out, I stood tall and tried to get a reform, and we couldn't do it. The reform we'd need is to gradually decrease the amount of mortgage that can be financed by Freddie -- or underwritten by Freddie and Fannie over time, keep reducing that until we get rid of Fannie and Freddie." The letter Santorum's campaign didn't answer our request for the letter, but we tracked it down. (Update: Santorum spokesman Matt Beynon sent us a copy about 20 minutes after this item published. It matched the May 5, 2006, letter we found.) In fact, we've heard something like this claim before, from GOP presidential candidate John McCain in 2008. He said then that he had warned in 2006 "that the Fannie and Freddie thing was a very serious problem, and we had to work on it." We rated the claim Mostly False, noting, "We give McCain some credit for weighing in on problems surrounding Fannie Mae, even though he got involved after a comprehensive government report issued a loud alarm to anyone watching. However, his attempts to depict those efforts as some sort of early warning that could have lessened the current credit crisis just don't wash. All McCain was talking about then was the potential fallout of accounting troubles in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He didn't say anything about a freewheeling climate among creditors that had major financial institutions becoming badly leveraged on bad loans." We might say something similar about Santorum's letter. He did sign, along with 19 others, correspondence on May 6, 2006, to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. It noted that government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — "mammoth financial institutions" — held almost $1.5 trillion of debt. It warned: "We are concerned that if effective regulatory reform legislation for the housing-finance government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) is not enacted this year, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system and the economy as a whole. Therefore, we offer you our support in bringing the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act (S. 190) to the floor and allowing the Senate to debate the merits of this bill, which was passed by the Senate Banking Committee. ... "Congress has the opportunity to recommit itself to the housing mission of the GSEs while at the same time making sure the GSEs operate in a manner that does not expose our financial system, or taxpayers, to unnecessary risk." The letter, in other words, warned of the risk Fannie and Freddie might pose to the financial system if they couldn't cover their obligations. America's housing crisis in many ways functioned the other way around: By the summer of 2008 the effects of a deflating housing bubble — especially foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies — were affecting Fannie and Freddie, and the agencies didn't have enough money to meet their financial obligations. The U.S. government took them over on Sept. 7, 2008. (We've talked to an expert who said that Fannie and Freddie contributed to that bubble — though he acknowledged there were other players — and another who found it "absurd" they would be blamed for the crisis. "They were followers, not leaders," one said. Similarly, Columbia Journalism Review recently highlighted news organizations who exposed "the big lie of the crisis" — blaming Fannie and Freddie for the housing crisis instead of banks.) So, did the letter warn of "a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market," as Santorum put it? Not so much. It warned not of the danger of a housing bubble but of the danger of poorly regulated housing finance entities. Santorum, Fannie & Freddie Want more evidence that it wasn't a housing bubble Santorum was worried about? Santorum, who served in the Senate from 1995 to 2007 after a stint in the U.S. House, gets credit for supporting the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act in 2005, the year before senators' letter to their colleagues. The goal of the legislation, according to its official summary, was to set up stronger congressional oversight of Fannie and Freddie and other housing entities by a new Federal Housing Regulatory Agency. Santorum bucked a strong covert lobbying effort by Freddie Mac to kill the legislation, supporting it in committee — though he was not one of its co-sponsors. (The lobbying effort ultimately kept the bill from reaching the Senate floor.) But he didn't voice any concern over "a meltdown" or "a bubble" that we saw in news clips, press releases or transcripts of related hearings from 2005 or 2006. He focused his energy instead on an amendment to strengthen the entities' affordable housing goals. As National Mortgage News reported at the time, "Sen. Santorum supports the concept of an (affordable housing) fund that could pump billions of dollars into the construction and renovation of affordable housing." In Congress, Sen. Elizabeth Dole, R-N.C., a co-sponsor of the legislation, thanked Santorum in August 2005 "for taking a leadership role in addressing the need for a better focus by Fannie and Freddie on affordable housing." No word about a housing bubble. Our ruling Santorum said he "went out and authored a letter with 24 other senators asking for major reform of Freddie and Fannie, warning of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market." Indeed, he signed a letter along with a group of colleagues asking for reform of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. But it didn't warn of a meltdown and a bubble in the housing market. And we couldn't find evidence that Santorum voiced that concern in 2005 or 2006 in press releases, transcripts or news clips. Instead, he sponsored a successful amendment of a reform bill to boost the entities' commitment to affordable housing, a very different concern. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-04261	Says Mike Dovilla supports a plan "that could allow a foreign corporation to take over the Ohio Turnpike" 	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/12/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-attacks-mike-dovilla-over-pr/	Gov. John Kasich has talked of leasing the Ohio Turnpike to the highest bidder to bring in a new stream of cash to pay for some of the state’s infrastructure needs. But as the Republican governor has since found out, his idea has not fared well across Northern Ohio where the 241-mile toll road stretches from Youngstown, through Cleveland and beyond Toledo to the Indiana border. Even some of the governor’s fellow Republicans have stepped away from the idea, in part, because of a concern of their constituents. They assert that the turnpike is privately maintained with tolls from Northern Ohio residents who see no equity in privatizing the road to subsidize infrastructure problems in other parts of the state. Republican incumbent Ohio House Rep. Mike Dovilla lists himself among those conservatives not standing with the governor on this issue. But the Ohio Democratic Party isn’t buying it. The Democratic party and Dovilla’s opponent, former State Rep. Matt Patten, sent out campaign mailers that blasted Dovilla. The party said he supported unloading the turnpike to a private operator rather than keeping it in control of the Ohio Turnpike Commission, on whose board Dovilla serves as a non-voting member. "Now Dovilla has signed on to a dangerous plan that could allow a foreign corporation to take over the Ohio Turnpike," said a mailer paid for by the Ohio Democratic Party. A separate ad from Democrats states that because of Dovilla, "you could pay a foreign corporation every time you drive the turnpike." Dovilla called The Plain Dealer to cry foul, claiming he has been a frequent critic of the plan to lease the turnpike. The foreign corporation reference in the ads is in reference to the fact that Indiana within the past decade leased its toll road to a foreign company for a whopping payday. Ohio has cited Indiana as an example of what could occur here. While the mailers were sent to sway voters for Nov. 6’s election, Dovilla’s position on the Ohio Turnpike remains relevant. He holds a lead of just 305 votes in the unofficial tally from election night and the race likely will be decided by provisional ballots. And regardless of whether he holds onto that slim lead, the Kasich administration is expected to address the issue before the end of the year and the end of Dovilla’s current term. So Politifact Ohio decided to check who’s right. The Ohio Democratic Party notes that Dovilla on May 5, 2011 voted for the House version of House Bill 153, the state’s current two-year operating budget. The massive bill, whose comparison document alone was nearly 1,000 pages, contained a provision allowing Kasich to seek a deal to privatize a number of state-owned entities, including the Ohio Turnpike. "The fact is, Mike Dovilla voted for the House passed version of HB 153, which authorized the Kasich Administration to both study and sell the Ohio Turnpike," said Keary McCarthy, spokesman for the House Democrats. Dovilla argues that despite his vote, he never supported this specific provision. "I have been on the record in strong opposition to sale or lease of the Ohio Turnpike for more than a year," Dovilla told Politifact. "In telephone conversations and emails exchanged with constituents, communications with the governor’s office, and a statement on our campaign’s website, my position on this matter is crystal clear." Dovilla notes that the final bill budget bill approved by the legislature in June 2011 actually requires any turnpike lease deal Kasich might reach to be sent back to the full General Assembly for an approval. But McCarthy said that it was the Senate that put that language in the bill after the House had approved its version which Dovilla voted for. Once the bill was amended by the Senate and adjusted further by a conference committee, both the House and Senate then voted again on the bill — this time with the language requiring legislative approval of a turnpike lease deal. Dovilla again voted for the budget bill. He insists, "my vote in favor of the state operating budget, HB 153, was not a vote for privatization." McCarthy begs to differ and says Dovilla’s first vote signals his true intentions. So, who’s right? Politifact figured the best way to get at the root of this issue was to retrace what Dovilla claims has been his "long-standing opposition" to any form of privatization, even prior to last year’s budget vote. Dovilla sent Politifact several emails to constituents that purport to show him expressing his opposition: An email to a constituent dated April 21, 2011: "I share your concerns about the possible privatization of the Turnpike, particularly as this matter has been broadly drafted in the governor’s proposed budget." A message to all constituents on Oct. 11, 2011: "For a variety of reasons, I remain skeptical about any privatization of the toll road and its unintended consequences, including the potential for higher tolls and the diversion of commercial vehicles on to local roadways that cannot accommodate increased traffic volume." A message sent to all constituent dated May 29, 2012: "I am deeply concerned with the proposed sale or lease of our Turnpike. The privatization of the 241-mile toll road through a sale or lease to an entity that would very likely be foreign-owned, would have many unintended consequences that outweigh any potential benefits." And a message on Dovilla’s campaign website states that he "opposes the sale or lease" of the turnpike and is working to obtain state funding to put up sound-mitigation barriers in some the suburban areas lining the toll road. The Kasich administration is expected to reveal a report before the end of the year that lays out the state’s options for privatizing the turnpike. There is a small chance Kasich may opt to leave the turnpike as is but it is more likely the administration will propose some sort of deal to lease the toll road. So, where does that leave us in this spat between Dovilla and the Democratic party? The strength of the Democratic argument is that Dovilla’s initial vote was for a bill that — among hundreds, if not thousands, of other provisions — gave the governor sole authority to lease the turnpike without legislative input or authorization. The ad lists Dovilla’s House budget vote as a source for the claim. So there is an element of truth in the claim. Hard to ignore that Dovilla did vote for the House version of the bill which, if not later amended, would have allowed the governor alone to strike a turnpike privatization deal. That means that despite Dovilla’s stated opposition, he did vote to give Kasich the power to do exactly what the state representative says he vehemently opposes -- although the final version of the legislation did not confer that power to Kasich. But the strength of Dovilla’s argument is that while he supported the majority of the budget bill he did not agree with everything in it. And he provided documentation that indicates he has in fact opposed leasing the turnpike. Rarely these days is any Statehouse bill of a single intent or purpose. Such is the case especially with budget bills, which are typically thousands of pages, containing budget provisions for dozens of state agencies, departments, boards and commissions. It is unreasonable to conclude that a vote in favor of such a massive document indicates 100-percent support of everything within it. Those are critical facts that would give a listener a different impression of the claim. On the Truth-O-Meter this statement rates Mostly False.

pomt-15353	"We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/08/bernie-sanders/sanders-child-poverty-higher-america-any-other-maj/	One plank of Bernie Sanders’ increasingly popular presidential platform is his focus on decreasing poverty and income inequality in America. In a recent appearance on CNN, he decried the influence Wall Street has had on economic policy, and the wealth disparities and class differences that have arisen in the United States. The junior senator from Vermont promised that his administration would look elsewhere to alleviate Americans’ economic problems: "There are a lot of great public servants out there, great economists who for years have been standing up for the middle class and the working families of this country, who know that it is an international embarrassment that we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth." Sanders’ remark about the American rate of childhood poverty surprised us. But it’s not the first time Sanders has made this claim, so we decided to see if we could corroborate it. Different surveys, but America always near the top Jeff Frank, Sanders’ press secretary, clarified that when the senator said "major country," he meant a member nation of the OECD, an international economic group composed of 34 generally wealthy countries. (OECD stands for the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.) Frank also said that Sanders was referring to a 2012 UNICEF report on childhood poverty in which the United States ranked 34th out of 35 countries with a childhood poverty rate of 23.1 percent, besting only non-OECD member Romania. The report primarily uses data from 2009. According to that report, Sanders’ statement would be true; however, a later UNICEF report from 2014 with more recent OECD data put the U.S. rate of childhood poverty lower than that of Israel, Mexico, Spain, and Greece, as well as that of non-OECD Latvia. (Romania was not included.) The OECD also released its own report on childhood poverty in 2014, using data from 2010. According to that, the United States has less childhood poverty than Chile, Mexico, Turkey, Israel — all of which are OECD members — and Romania. Matters are further complicated by the fact that the two UNICEF reports use different metrics for determining how to set the threshold for childhood poverty. The 2012 report (and the OECD report) defines impoverished children as those living in households below 50 percent of the median national income. The 2014 report changes this relative poverty line to 60 percent of the 2008 median national income despite its results being from 2012. This is because the report aims to measure the impact of the recession on childhood poverty, something that could not be done if the poverty line were adjusted to the new national income, since incomes would presumably trend downward. Relative vs. absolute poverty Using a relative income line in both studies clarifies the confusion that many Americans may feel in seeing that the United States — with a higher income per capita than most other comparatively democratic nations — has such a high rate of childhood poverty. Since the reports define poverty as a household earning less than a certain percentage of the national income, countries with higher levels of income inequality are also more likely to have higher rates of poverty. The inverse is also true: thus, the Nordic countries, known for the parity of their wealth distribution, have the lowest rates of childhood poverty. As a result of this approach, some commentators have criticized the report for missing the point of a measurement of poverty. One can be less well-off, the argument goes, without being poor, since being poor is defined instead by a lack of access to certain key goods, not by where one’s income falls relative to everyone else’s. Nevertheless, other measures of child well-being tend to confirm what the high childhood poverty rate suggests: According to a UNICEF report on 29 similarly affluent countries, American children rank 25th in safety, 27th in education, and 23rd in housing and environment, among other metrics. These results are less open to charges of political bias; the education ranking, for example, bases its findings mostly on school participation rates and international test scores. The 2012 UNICEF report also defends itself against the charge of primarily measuring income inequality by pointing out that all forms of measuring poverty are relative, because poverty itself is a relative concept, specific to a certain time and place: "Any poverty line intended to represent a minimum acceptable standard of living in the industrialized world today implies higher standards of food, clothing, housing, water supply, sanitation, health care, education, transport and entertainment than were available to even the wealthiest households of previous eras." The report also points out that using an "absolute" poverty line — determined at some fixed income and pegged only to inflation — becomes less useful as time passes and incomes rise. This is the approach of the U.S. government, which sets a number of different poverty thresholds predicated on the basic needs of different sizes of families. From the 1960s to the year 2000, the fixed poverty line fell from 50 percent to 30 percent of median income. Our ruling Sanders said, "We have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth." His office later clarified that "major country" referred to those nations that were members of the OECD. The 2012 UNICEF report he pointed to agrees with him, but two studies released since then, including another one from UNICEF, show that while the United States does consistently have one of the highest rates of childhood poverty in the world, there are several OECD members with higher rates, notably Israel and Mexico.

pomt-05660	Says 85 percent of Milwaukee shootings involve "people with extensive criminal records shooting other people with extensive criminal records."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/19/edward-flynn/85-percent-shooting-suspects-and-victims-milwaukee/	If the nation has a more data-driven police chief than Milwaukee’s Edward A. Flynn, we’d like to know. We think his middle initial might stand for Analysis. Yet we couldn’t help wonder about a statistical claim that Flynn, a former Massachusetts public safety commissioner under then-Gov. Mitt Romney, made on Feb. 9, 2012. In the first of what are billed as monthly sit-downs with Milwaukee public radio station WUWM-FM (89.7), Flynn was asked which issues city residents say are most important for police to address. Reducing "measurable" serious crime is a concern of both city and suburban Milwaukee residents, Flynn replied, adding: "Perversely, in a way, people who actually live in the city recognize an extraordinary amount of our violent crime is highly concentrated among criminals perpetrating violence upon other criminals. It doesn't minimize its importance as a public safety issue; but they recognize that a lot of concerns in their neighborhoods are what we would call quality of life problems or lower-level crime problems. "For the average resident of this city, they're much more concerned about a burglary than they are about a shooting because 85 percent of our shootings are people with extensive criminal records shooting other people with extensive criminal records. It's bad, we've got to solve the crime, we've got to break up the violence. But most folks recognize they're not a likely victim." The 85 percent figure caught our eye. Is it true 85 percent of Milwaukee’s shootings involve "people with extensive criminal records shooting other people with extensive criminal records"? Flynn spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz said the chief based his comment on a 2011 annual report by the city’s Homicide Review Commission, which annually reviews all types of homicides as well as non-fatal shootings. The report wasn’t released until nearly a month after Flynn’s radio interview, but he had been told of the findings, said Mallory O’Brien, the commission’s director. One important note about the 2011 report, before we get to the numbers, in terms of Flynn’s reference to "extensive criminal record": It provides complete prior arrest data for only some of the suspects and victims involved in the 2011 shootings. Included are juvenile and adult arrests for felony and misdemeanor crimes, as well as non-criminal ordinance violations, but not minor offenses such as speeding. So, Flynn is setting a relatively low bar for "extensive criminal records" in that not all arrests, of course, lead to convictions or even criminal charges. And because complete prior arrest data are not available for all the people involved in the 2011 shootings, some assumptions are made by O’Brien the study’s author. That being said, O’Brien, a PhD epidemiologist, said her experience in doing the annual reports gives her confidence in making assumptions about the prior arrests of shooting suspects and victims. So, as the chief himself might say, let’s get to the numbers. Non-fatal shootings: In non-fatal shootings in 2011, 97 percent of the 177 suspects and 86 percent of the 473 victims had at least one prior arrest. The report doesn’t say how many. However, O’Brien said a closer analysis of non-fatal shootings during a six-week period in July and August 2011, when non-fatal shootings increased, found that suspects had an average of 7.5 prior arrests and victims had an average of about six. O’Brien said that based on her past studies, she would expect that the rest of the suspects and victims in the non-fatal shootings in 2011 had a similar number of prior arrests. So, more than 85 percent of the people involved in non-fatal shootings had at least one prior arrest. And there’s a strong indication, though not complete numbers, that most people involved in the non-fatal shootings had at least several prior arrests. Homicides: For all homicides in 2011 -- those involving guns and those that didn’t -- 57 percent of the 72 suspects and 62 percent of the 66 homicide victims had at least six prior arrests. O’Brien said that based on past studies she has done, most homicides involve guns and it’s unlikely that arrest records would vary greatly between the people involved in shooting homicides versus non-shooting homicides. So, a clear majority, but less than 85 percent, of the people involved in fatal shootings likely had at least six prior arrests; although, again, the study doesn’t provide hard numbers on that point. We asked James Alan Fox, a criminology, law and public policy professor at Northeastern University in Boston, about Flynn’s claim. He said from a national perspective, most shootings involve people with an arrest history, although he couldn’t say how extensive that history is for the typical shooting suspect or victim. Our rating Flynn said 85 percent of Milwaukee shootings "are people with extensive criminal records shooting other people with extensive criminal records." The thrust of his statement -- that the vast majority of shooting suspects and victims have a criminal history, is accurate. But he made a specific statistical claim that isn’t fully supported by the study he cites. And as compared with charges or convictions, prior arrests as a measure of a person’s criminal record is on the lower end of the scale. In sum, Flynn’s claim was partially accurate, but left out important details -- our definition of Half True. Editor's note: This item was changed on 3/20/2012 to fix a confusing reference to median arrests. The change was made initially for print, but not changed immediately online.

pomt-12121	"Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/17/donald-trump/donald-trump-retells-pants-fire-claim-about-gen-pe/	After a terrorist deliberately crashed a van into a crowd of people in Barcelona on Aug. 17, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to condemn the attack. He then suggested that the world should get tougher on terrorism. "The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona, Spain, and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong, we love you!," Trump tweeted. He later followed up, writing: "Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!" The person who needs a lesson, however, is Trump. Trump has made this claim about U.S. Army Gen. John Joseph "Black Jack" Pershing before. During a Feb. 19, 2016, rally in North Charleston, S.C., Trump referred to an anecdote from the aftermath of the Philippine-American War of 1899-1902, when the United States sought to exert its authority over the Asian archipelago, which it had recently obtained from Spain after winning the Spanish-American War. After taking the reins of power from Spain, the United States faced armed opposition, and the three-year war led to the deaths of more than 4,200 American combatants, more than 20,000 Filipino combatants, and as many as 200,000 Filipino civilians, according to the State Department. After the war, Pershing served as governor of the heavily Muslim Moro Province between 1909 and 1913. This period was notable for its continuing insurgencies. "They were having terrorism problems, just like we do," Trump said, according to a February 2016 account in the Washington Post. "And he caught 50 terrorists who did tremendous damage and killed many people. And he took the 50 terrorists, and he took 50 men and he dipped 50 bullets in pigs’ blood — you heard that, right? He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pigs’ blood. And he had his men load his rifles, and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people. And the 50th person, he said: You go back to your people, and you tell them what happened. And for 25 years, there wasn’t a problem. Okay? Twenty-five years, there wasn’t a problem." In Trump’s most-recent telling, 25 years became 35 years. But either way, neither version of the story adds up. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Did it happen? The idea that pig’s blood could serve as a weapon against Muslims has been around in popular culture for decades. For instance, a 1939 Hollywood movie, The Real Glory, stars Gary Cooper as a doctor on the Philippine island of Mindanao who drapes a captive in pigskin "to serve as an abject lesson to all would-be attackers," Luis H. Francia, a Filipino-born professor of Asian American Studies at Hunter College, wrote recently. The best evidence U.S. troops used pigs as a tactic against Muslims comes from a memoir by Pershing titled My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917, which was republished in 2013 by the University Press of Kentucky. In the memoir, Pershing writes that another commanding officer in the Philippines, Col. Frank West, had in at least one case seen to it that bodies of Muslim insurgents "were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins." In a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T. Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: "Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom. It is the only possible thing we can do to discourage crazy fanatics." While these writings do provide strong evidence that United States forces used pigs as a tactic against Muslim insurgents, there is no evidence that Pershing himself committed these acts. Experts have been skeptical the practice was widespread or directly authorized or ordered by Pershing. "This story is a fabrication and has long been discredited," said Brian McAllister Linn, a Texas A&M University historian and author of Guardians of Empire: The U.S. Army and the Pacific, 1902-1940. "I am amazed it is still making the rounds." Christopher Einolf, a professor at DePaul University and author of America in the Philippines, 1899-1902: The First Torture Scandal, added that he trusted the conclusion of the late military historian Frank E. Vandiver, who told About.com in 2003 that "I never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences. This kind of thing would have run completely against his character." Indeed, other historians noted that Pershing pursued a less brutal approach to "pacifying" the rebels in the southern Philippines than Leonard Wood, one of his predecessors. "He did a lot of what we would call ‘winning hearts and minds’ and embraced reforms which helped end their resistance," said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. "He fought too, but only when he had to, and only against tribes or bands that just wouldn’t negotiate with him. He wasn’t solely committed to fighting as people like Trump who tell the pig blood story imply." Another wrinkle: Historians said the premise that the rebels would have been motivated by a fear of pigs is not as certain as Trump suggests. It’s unclear how religiously observant the insurgents were and whether such a policy would have made a difference in their actions. "The Moros were fighting for a lot of reasons, not just because they were Muslims," Janda said. "This is another fact that gets lost in many modern discussions of terrorism." Details aside, Trump’s point about terrorism is wrong To many of the historians we checked with, the idea that Pershing’s actions stopped "radical Islamic terror" was actually the bigger problem with Trump’s parable. "Even if the tale is true, the pacifying effect that Trump claims is nonsense," said Michael H. Hunt, an emeritus historian at the University of North Carolina and author of Arc of Empire: America's Wars in Asia from the Philippines to Vietnam. The region "remained in constant unrest during the period of American rule and into the period of independence, right down to the present." Silbey of Cornell agreed. "Where Trump’s remark becomes ridiculous is in the idea that this actually worked," he said. "The Moro War did not end until 1913, and even that’s a bit of a soft date, with violence continuing for quite a while afterward. Defilement by pig’s blood isn’t -- and wasn’t -- some magical method of ending terrorism." If anything, a more complete account of the Moro insurgency involves some subplots that run contrary to Trump’s narrative. "The Ottomans under Sultan Abdul Hamid II sent a letter to the Sulu Moros asking them not to resist the Americans at the start of the Moro Rebellion, and the Moros on Sulu complied," Janda said. "It’s a nice example of diplomacy working to our advantage, and a reminder that then and now, not all Muslims or Moros are the same and that many were and are U.S. allies." Our ruling Trump said that Pershing stopped "radical Islamic terror" for 35 years. Of the eight historians we checked with the first time we heard Trump speak about Pershing, all were at least skeptical that the specific tales of Pershing actually took place, and some expressed disbelief even more forcefully than that. But more critically, the historians took issue with Trump’s suggestion that the tactic -- if it was even used at all -- actually worked to end tensions, noting that unrest persisted for years.

pomt-08480	"When Washington liberals wanted to take away our guns, Chet said no."	false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/12/chet-edwards/rep-chet-edwards-says-he-said-no-washington-libera/	Jon Stewart, host of Comedy Central's faux-news program "The Daily Show," wryly noted on its Sept. 29 episode that the Obama administration's track record is "why you see so many Democrats running ads proudly touting their party's accomplishments." Then flowed a montage of Democratic campaign ads denouncing President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California. The last clip? A Sept. 17 ad for Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Waco: "And when Washington liberals wanted to take away our guns, Chet said no." "Those are the ads that Democrats are running?" Stewart marveled. On Stewart's cue, we wanted to know more about Edwards' supposed showdown with gun-averse liberals. Megan Jacobs, an Edwards' spokeswoman, sent us a statement citing several pieces of legislation to defend his boast. Namely, on March 17, 2009, Edwards was one of 65 House Democrats who sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. "As strong supporters of the Second Amendment, we were very concerned to see your recent remarks suggesting that the administration will push for reinstatement of the 1994 ban on 'assault weapons' and ammunition magazines," the letter says. "Many of our constituents lawfully own and use these firearms and ammunition magazines that would be affected by a new ban." The letter concludes: "We would actively oppose any effort to reinstate the 1994 ban or to pass any similar law. We urge you to abandon this initiative and to focus instead on effective law enforcement strategies to enforce our community laws against violent criminals and drug traffickers." What prompted the letter? Jacobs pointed us to a February 2009 article on ABC News' website that quotes Holder saying: "As President Obama indicated during the campaign, there are just a few gun-related changes that we would like to make, and among them would be to reinstitute the ban on the sale of assault weapons." Obama's campaign website said in 2008 that he supports making the expired federal assault weapons ban permanent "as such weapons belong on foreign battlefields and not on our streets." Some background: In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed legislation prohibiting the sale of 19 types of semi-automatic assault weapons — like AK-47s, Uzis and revolving-cylinder shotguns — and imitation models of those guns. The law didn't apply to more than 650 other types of firearms that were manually operated by a bolt, pump, lever or slide action, were permanently nonfunctional and antique firearms. Also, the ban was set to expire in 2004 unless Congress reauthorized it, which it didn't. Edwards told us he voted for the ban in '94 after a 1991 shooting in Killeen left 24 dead. He said he opposed the ban's reauthorization because he didn't think it was effective in significantly reducing gun violence. We wondered how many Texans would be affected by bringing back the ban. Tim Carroll, a spokesman with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told us that the agency doesn't track how many people own assault weapons. Carroll also told us that when the 1994 ban was implemented, it did not apply to firearms anyone already owned. Meaning: No one would had their guns taken away. Speaking to Edwards' pro-gun bonafides, Jacobs noted that the congressman drew an "A" rating from the National Rifle Association, meaning it considers Edwards a "solidly pro-gun candidate" who "has supported NRA positions on key votes in elective office," according to an explanation of the ratings on the NRA's website. The letter to Holder signed by Edwards is one of 11 reasons the association lists on its website for endorsing the congressman. Other reasons include legislation Edwards cosponsored to repeal a gun ban in the District of Columbia, legislation he cosponsored to extend federal protections to state right-to-carry license and permits nationwide and legislation he cosponsored to prohibit gun confiscation during states of emergency. We did not find fresh signs the Obama administration is pushing to return the ban, though there have been reports about assault weapons in the news. In May, Mexico President Felipe Calderon asked a joint session of the U.S. Congress to renew the ban to help Mexico's war with drug cartels. In June, Reuters reported that police in the Texas border city of Laredo seized 147 AK-47 assault rifles bound for Mexico. And on Sept. 28, Colton Tooley, a 19-year-old student at the University of Texas at Austin, sprayed several rounds from an AK-47 on campus before killing himself. Of course, Edwards' ad says liberals wanted to take away "our guns" — not just assault weapons. The statement Jacobs sent us further says that "since Democrats gained a House majority since 2007, numerous bills have been introduced that require the registration of guns that would limit gun ownership." Edwards' statement singles out Pelosi and Reps. Henry Waxman, George Miller and Barbara Lee of California and Barney Frank of Massachusetts as liberals "on the opposite sides of Edwards on many key gun-related votes." The statement cites a host of Edwards votes on gun issues, including: a 2003 vote to protect firearms manufacturers and dealers from being sued for damages resulting from the misuse by others of their firearm or ammunition and a 2004 vote not to extend the assault weapons ban. This year, Edwards was one of 159 cosponsors of legislation "to restore Second Amendment rights in the District of Columbia." The bill would prohibit the District from restricting a person's right to carry a firearm at his or her home, personal land or business, repeal D.C's registration requirement to possess firearms and repeal a ban on semiautomatic weapons. In 2005, Edwards voted to prohibit the use of federal funds to enforce a D.C. law requiring certain firearms to be unloaded and disassembled. In 2008, he voted to overturn the D.C. ban. Still, we did not track with Edwards' logic. While it's evident he's supported legislation that is considered pro-gun and said "no" to legislation that isn't, we didn't see anything showing that Washington liberals were coming to take our guns away. As we neared completion of our review, Edwards told us that "the reason a lot of gun-control legislation has not come up, been introduced, but it's been killed," is thanks to "Democrats like me and those who have opposed it." Edwards cited 2009 legislation by Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Illinois, which sought to create a licensing system for certain firearms and a record system tracking the sale of those firearms. Specifically, Edwards said he objected to a provision requiring applicants seeking a firearm license to submit "a clear thumbprint" and "a current, passport-sized photograph of the applicant," according to the bill. "If I'm a citizen in Texas and I say I'm not about to be fingerprinted or photographed to keep a handgun, then I am in violation of the law" he said. "The federal government would have the right to take that gun away." Those who failed to comply with Rush's proposal, which never came to a vote, would have been subject to a fine or imprisonment or both, but we saw no language stating that guns would be taken away. In a letter Edwards sent a constituent in January, he said, "I oppose this bill and do not believe there should be a national gun licensing system." Edwards told us that he has gone to Democratic leaders in the House and said, "Don't allow these gun control bills to come to the floor. Not many have. That's my point." Edwards also pointed to legislation he supported to expand gun rights in the District of Columbia, which prohibited gun owners from keeping handguns in their homes. In June 2008, the Supreme Court overturned D.C.'s ban."They wanted to be able to take guns away, I wanted to stop them from legally being able to take those guns away," he said. Where does that leave us? Edwards makes a case that he’s steadfastly opposed efforts to impose gun controls. However, none of his cited measures would "take away" anyone’s weapons. It’s overblown claims like this that keep the Truth-O-Meter in business. His statement is False.	None	Chet Edwards	None	None	None	2010-10-12T06:00:00	2010-09-17	['None']
pomt-05379	Says Mitt Romney is proposing a "tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/08/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-mitt-romneys-tax-plan-gives-mill/	President Barack Obama has repeatedly argued that his Republican rival Mitt Romney is pursuing policies that favor the rich. Recently, Obama offered a specific claim about how wealthier Americans would benefit from Romney’s tax plan. In a May 5, 2012, campaign speech in Columbus, Ohio, Obama said, "My opponent won’t tell us how he’d pay for his new, $5 trillion tax cut -- a tax cut that gives an average of $250,000 to every millionaire in this country." We wondered whether Romney’s tax proposal really would be so generous to millionaires. (The Romney campaign didn't respond to our inquiry for this story.) First, some background on what Romney is proposing. Here are some of key elements of his plan, according to the campaign’s website. For individuals: • Cut marginal rates by one-fifth on a permanent, across-the-board basis • Eliminate interest, dividend, and capital gains taxes for taxpayers with an adjusted gross income below $200,000 • Eliminate the estate tax • Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax For corporations: • Cut the corporate rate to 25 percent • Make permanent the research and development tax credit • Switch to a territorial tax system • Repeal the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax The Romney campaign's website states that lowering both individual and corporate tax rates will stimulate economic growth. High tax rates "discourage work and entrepreneurship, as well as savings and investment," the website states. "With 54 percent of private sector workers employed outside of corporations, individual rates also define the incentives for job-creating businesses. Lower marginal tax rates secure for all Americans the economic gains from tax reform." And in a speech on March 30, 2012, Romney affirmed his plan to cut taxes for everyone: "Taxes should be as low as possible, in line with those of competing nations, and designed to foster innovation and growth. That's why I will cut marginal tax rates across the board. " For an independent assessment of Romney’s plan, we turned to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a think tank that, among other things, evaluates the tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates. While judging tax proposals is subject to some degree of interpretation, the Tax Policy Center has a significant degree of respect in tax circles. The Tax Policy Center looked at two versions of Romney’s tax proposal. We will use the analysis of the more recent of Romney’s two plans, which the group published in March 2012. Before we look at the center’s analysis, we should note that the group ran two sets of numbers. One version, known as "current law," essentially gives Romney credit for extending the tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush and for an annual adjustment in the Alternative Minimum Tax. Under this calculation, taxpayers’ savings from these two extensions are added to the total tax cuts from Romney’s tax proposal itself. The other version, known as "current policy," assumes that the Bush and AMT tax cuts will be extended, with or without Romney. This method only counts the taxpayer savings from the new proposals in Romney’s tax plan -- a smaller amount of tax savings than Romney would see under the "current law" calculation. It turns out that the "current policy" calculation is the one that backs up Obama’s claim. The Tax Policy Center found that under Romney’s proposal, people with $1 million or more in annual cash income will receive an average tax cut of $250,535. Those in the millionaire category will receive an 11.8 percent increase in after-tax income, easily the highest of any income group. Collectively, the tax savings for millionaires would amount to nearly one-third of all the tax benefits that result from Romney’s plan. The "current law" analysis shows even bigger gains for millionaires. By this method, the average tax cut for someone with cash income north of $1 million a year would be $390,876, according to the Tax Policy Center. And the higher you go on the income scale, the bigger the tax cuts become. Under the center’s more restrictive "current policy" method, the top one-tenth of 1 percent of taxpayers -- those earning $2,868,534 a year -- would get an average tax cut of $725,716. That accounts for 19.4 percent of all the tax cuts’ benefits. Our ruling Even using the more restrictive of the Tax Policy Center’s two calculations, Romney’s tax plan would save millionaires almost exactly what Obama said -- $250,535.

pomt-15003	"In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/09/ben-carson/ben-carson-says-mahmoud-abbas-ali-khamenei-vladimi/	It sounds like the opening to a joke: A young Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Russian President Vladimir Putin walk into a Soviet-era Moscow university … But it’s a claim that was made with a straight face by Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson -- on national television, three times. First, on the Oct. 5, 2015, edition of the Fox News show Hannity, Carson said Putin’s "relationships go way, way, way, way back, you know? 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University -- that's when Putin first got to know the Ali Khamenei, and also Mahmoud Abbas." Then, on Oct. 8, Carson said much the same thing to CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer. Putin "already has substantial ties in the Middle East," Carson said. "In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin." And then again to Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC on Oct. 9: Putin "has longstanding relationships with people in that area. In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was in that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that was when they first became familiar with Putin." Really? Three future world leaders -- and three people many Americans consider adversaries -- found themselves kicking around a university in Moscow in 1968, building ties that would serve them decades later? We had to check it out. When we asked Carson’s staff whether they had any supporting evidence, aide Ying Ma wrote back, "Thanks for your inquiry. We are not in the habit of providing Googling support to the media. If there is a specific aspect of Dr. Carson's statement that you wish to challenge, please let us know and we can go from there." We did have difficulty finding any support for the claim, and we forwarded what we found to the campaign but did not hear back. Here’s a rundown, point by point. Mahmoud Abbas The portion of the claim dealing with Abbas has the most supporting evidence, but even here it’s not all that clear-cut. It’s fairly well documented that Abbas -- the head of the West Bank-based Palestinian government -- did do some academic work in the Soviet Union. This part of Abbas’ biography gained some attention in 1995, when Abbas became a key Palestinian figure in the Oslo peace accords. Reports surfaced that Abbas had written a doctoral thesis in the early 1980s titled, "The Other Side: The Secret Relationship between Nazism and the Zionist Movement." Critics, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center, criticized the thesis for seeming to minimize the Holocaust, and he later distanced himself from some of its conclusions. The importance of Abbas’ thesis for our fact-check is that it was presented at a Soviet university, variously described as Oriental College, the Institute of Oriental Studies or Moscow State University. Oddly, Wikipedia is the only source that cites Patrice Lumumba University, an institution of higher education in Moscow that was designed to serve an international student clientele and which has been linked by some observers to the KGB. (It’s now known as Peoples' Friendship University.) We did track down one possibly credible source placing Abbas at Lumumba -- a 2010 article from Ria Novosti, a state-owned news agency. "Contrary to popular myths, (Patrice Lumumba University) released from its walls not too many successful politicians -- about a dozen future ministers and only two future leaders of their countries," the article said. In addition to a president of Guyana, the article cited Abbas, "who graduated from the law faculty," the article said. Still, a degree from Patrice Lumumba doesn’t appear in most biographies of Abbas. He is more often listed as having earned his law degree (or in some tellings, a bachelor’s degree) from the University of Damascus. In addition, most bios place Abbas working for Palestinian organizations in 1967 and 1968. He would have been 33 in 1968, the year Carson cited. So what do we know about Abbas? We know for sure that he took "short visits" to Moscow to defend his doctoral thesis around 1982 (where, apparently, "he always drank coffee with cardamom," according to a 2005 Russian media account by a former professor). It’s also conceivable that Abbas had some connection with Patrice Lumumba University, though the evidence of that is equivocal. But there’s no hard evidence that Abbas was at Lumumba in 1968, which is what Carson said. Ali Khamenei There is no mention in the official biography of Iran’s supreme leader that he ever studied in the Soviet Union, and the timeline that’s known would have made it difficult for him to have done so. We did not hear back from the Iranian mission to the United Nations, but Ali Alfoneh, a researcher at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, looked into the question in 2012 when he was at the American Enterprise Institute. He wrote, "According to Khamenei’s official biography, he travelled to Iraq in 1957 to study at the Theological Seminary in Najaf. Since the People’s Friendship University was first established (as Lumumba) in 1960, the young Khamenei could not have used his journey to Iraq as a cover for his studies in the Soviet Union." On the other hand, Alfoneh continued, Khamenei’s biography says he spent a "clandestine life" in Tehran between March 1966 and March 1967, after which he was arrested by the police and imprisoned. The existence of this "clandestine" period may have fed the rumor that he spent time studying in Moscow. Certainly a period studying in the "godless" Soviet Union would be something Khamenei -- the head of a theocracy -- would want to keep under wraps. In an interview, Alfoneh said he isn’t convinced of the Khamenei-in-the-Soviet-Union claim. "I'm very skeptical," he said. So where did this rumor come from? The allegations garnered attention in 2010 when RT, a network tightly controlled by Putin’s Kremlin, aired a piece about the 50th anniversary of Peoples' Friendship University and mentioned in passing that Khamenei was an alumnus. (We tried to contact the university, but didn’t get a response. Neither Abbas nor Khamenei is listed among the school’s "eminent graduates.") The earlier citations of this claim aren’t well sourced, either. It appears to have surfaced initially in a 1989 column by Smith Hempstone, a journalist and future U.S. ambassador to Kenya, that ran in a small, western Pennsylvania newspaper. We also found a brief article in a Russian newspaper from 2003 that mentions the claim in passing. None of these approximate a primary source. A half-dozen experts on the region unanimously told us that they doubted Khamenei ever studied in the Soviet Union -- or that he did so in 1968, when he would have been 29. "I've never seen it corroborated," said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. John Limbert, a professor of international affairs at the U.S. Naval Academy, called the idea "bizarre." And David Houghton, a senior lecturer in the defense studies department at King’s College of London, called it "unlikely in the absolute extreme." "The Soviet Union is the absolute last place where one could expect to find Khamenei at any stage in his career, and I personally do not believe that he ever studied there or had any links to Putin," Houghton said. "It looks like a rather daft conspiracy theory to me." Vladimir Putin The biggest problem for the Putin portion of Carson’s claim is the calendar: In 1968, Putin would have been 16 years old. According to his official biography, "in 1960-1968, Vladimir Putin attended Primary School No. 193 in Leningrad. After the eighth grade, he entered High School No. 281, a chemistry-focused magnet school under the aegis of a technology institute, completing his studies there in 1970." "It’s pretty difficult to imagine that he could have met Messrs. Abbas and Khamenei under any circumstances at age 16 in Moscow, unless he ran into them randomly on the street on some kind of school or family trip — if, indeed, they were actually there," said Fiona Hill, director of the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. In addition, Putin grew up in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). That is a 9-to-10-hour car ride from Moscow and Patrice Lumumba University. "He studied between 1970 and 1975 in the law faculty of Leningrad State University," said Richard Sakwa, a professor of Russian and European politics at the University of Kent. "The claim by Ben Carson is garbled rubbish." A defense The closest we came to any of this making sense was an interview with Cliff Kincaid, who runs a group called America’s Survival, Inc. Kincaid published a paper titled, "Communists and Muslims: The Hidden Hand of the KGB" that raises many of these claims. Kincaid made the case that Carson was saying Abbas and Khamenei could have been agents of the KGB, and if they were, Putin, who rose to colonel in the KGB, would have known them. "Carson was clearly saying that Putin, as a former KGB colonel and later head of the FSB, the new name for the KGB, would have knowledge of Abbas and Khamenei attending Patrice Lumumba University, a KGB-controlled institution," Kincaid told PolitiFact. "That made them subject to KGB influence, if not KGB agents. Whether Putin personally met them in his younger years is beside the point. … Please report these facts rather than nitpick Carson on the ages of the various players." We hereby report those "facts." Still, this isn’t what Carson said. Our ruling Carson said, "In the class of 1968 at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, Mahmoud Abbas was one of the members of that class, and so was Ali Khamenei. And that's where they first established relationships with the young Vladimir Putin." This is one of the more bizarre claims we’ve heard so far in the 2016 presidential campaign, and that’s saying something. Abbas may have attended the university, though we don’t know for sure, or when. No credible evidence has yet surfaced to place Khamenei as a student in the Soviet Union -- ever, much less in close proximity to Abbas, or in 1968. And Putin would have been a teenager in 1968, attending school 450 miles away. The idea that the three men developed lifelong ties as students in the late-1960s-era Soviet Union is ridiculous.

pomt-02784	Obamacare medical device tax "has led to the loss of thousands of jobs" in U.S.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/dec/06/ted-poe/medical-device-makers-attribute-layoffs-partly-oba/	A reader asked us to check whether a medical tax in the Obamacare law killed thousands of jobs, as her Texas congressman recently told her via email. U.S. Rep. Ted Poe, whose district covers parts of Harris County, wrote Oct. 24, 2013, just after a partial government shutdown had ended, describing measures fellow Republicans proposed to avert the shutdown while altering or defunding President Barack Obama’s health care law. One amendment, Poe said, would have repealed "the costly medical device tax, which has led to the loss of thousands of jobs across the nation." PolitiFact has written about the tax before -- particularly to quash a persistent myth that the outdoor sporting goods chain Cabela’s once charged customers for a medical tax "hidden in Obamacare." It’s a 2.3 percent levy on the sale of most medical devices; exceptions include items normally sold directly to the public such as eyeglasses, bandages and hearing aids. The tax, which took effect Jan. 1, 2013, is one of the provisions in the Obamacare law meant to offset costs of expanding health coverage to the uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Poe spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes told us by email, "Congressman Poe has met with several people in the health care industry who have told him the medical device tax included in the Affordable Care Act has led to thousands of layoffs. We have also read examples of this in the news." Hynes cited news stories from 2012 and 2013 describing more than 2,000 completed or planned U.S. job cuts that medical device makers attributed in part to the tax. The Republican National Committee rounded up those examples and others in a Sept. 30, 2013, web post. Among them: Citing the tax specifically, Smith & Nephew cut "nearly 100 jobs" in Memphis and Andover, Mass., according to a Jan. 31, 2013, news story in the Memphis Daily News. Kalamazoo, Mich.-based medical technology corporation Stryker expected to complete laying off about 1,000 employees worldwide by the end of 2012, according to a Nov. 19, 2012, Kalamazoo Gazette news story. Stryker named the tax as one reason for the cuts in an earlier press release, the story said. The company didn’t give locations for the job cuts, but an earlier warning identified at least 107 in the U.S., the Gazette said. Citing the tax as one reason, Welch Allyn announced 120 buyouts and layoffs in Central New York as part of global cuts, according to a Sept. 10, 2012, Syracuse (N.Y.) Post-Standard news story. Boston Scientific increased planned job cuts worldwide by 900 to 1,000 positions, according to a Jan. 29, 2013, Associated Press news story. Company president Michael Mahoney said the tax played a role, according to a Jan. 30, 2013, Minneapolis Star Tribune news story. A July 27, 2012, Indiana Business Journal news story said Cook Medical Inc. halted plans to build five plants similar to one employing 300 people; an executive told the Journal the medical tax left the company with "fewer resources to be able to spend on those kinds of projects." Medtronic’s CEO predicted in a March 22, 2010, Wall Street Journal news story that the tax would cost his company 1,000 jobs. A May 22, 2013, Star Tribune news story said Medtronic announced 1,000 cuts worldwide in 2012 and 2,000 cuts worldwide in 2013, with about half of the latter in the U.S. The story cited "pricing pressures and sluggish sales" for the May 2013 cuts, but didn’t mention the tax. That story said Medtronic competitor St. Jude Medical, another global company, had announced 800 job cuts in 2012. An earlier Star Tribune news story had reported that executives said the tax was one factor. In total, the news stories pinned at least 1,300 job losses inside the U.S., though most companies did not specify where the cuts would fall. The U.S. medical devices industry, said a July 24, 2013, Forbes news story, "employs 400,000 Americans directly and is indirectly responsible for almost 2 million more that supply and support the highly-skilled workforce." The GOP web post pointed to a 2011 study financed by the Advanced Medical Technology Association, or AdvaMed. It said that the excise tax would cause 10 percent of device manufacturing to move offshore, leading to the loss of 43,000 U.S. jobs. PolitiFact Ohio wrote in a 2012 fact-check that analysis by the research service Bloomberg Government found the AdvaMed study was "not credible." The publisher of an online journal covering the medical device industry, Brian Johnson of MassDevice.com, told Boston public radio station WBUR in a Sept. 30, 2013, interview, that "the tax is costing the industry thousands of jobs." "In 2012, publicly traded medical device companies cut 10,000 jobs, in part, to brace for the impact of the tax, although it’s impossible to determine how much the tax actually added to those job loss numbers." By phone, Johnson told us, "The long and the short of it is that it's nearly impossible to determine if the tax alone was the cause of layoffs, or if the company used the tax as a good cover for layoffs that were going to happen to begin with. The medical device industry is facing some pretty substantial headwinds that have nothing to do with the excise tax," such as the high costs associated with negotiating and completing sales of such devices. Cutting to the bottom line, the Boston radio station asked Johnson, "So, is this really worth shutting the federal government down over? Don’t these guys make billions of dollars a year? Why can’t they just pass that 2.3 percent on to their customers?" Johnson said hospital purchasing groups have united in a campaign that "has been effective in keeping most medical device companies from trying to pass the buck," and said that because the tax is on all sales, "even companies that are losing money have to pay it. This means the tax disproportionately harms young, innovative start-up companies." Also, he said, the industry is skeptical of predictions that business will boom as more people join the health-care system. "Medical device makers argue that the new enrollees in health insurance plans will be young and not in need of the technology they create, such as cardiac stents, hip and knee implants and surgical devices," he said. Our ruling Poe said "the costly medical device tax" in the Obamacare law "has led to the loss of thousands of jobs across the nation." News stories indicate more than 2,000 such cuts were planned or made partly because of the tax. An industry analyst has said that "the tax is costing the industry thousands of jobs," but also told us that "it's nearly impossible to determine if the tax alone was the cause of layoffs."

pomt-12167	Because of the failure to pass a repeal bill, "Obamacare remains the law of the land ... This means more than 300,000 Georgians below the poverty line will still not have access to the insurance Obamacare promised."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/aug/03/david-perdue/gop-senator-david-perdue-blames-obamacare-leaving-/	Chalk up Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., as someone who was unhappy about the Senate’s failure to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. After the Senate fell one vote short of overturning key elements of President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, Perdue offered a statement, reprinted here in part: "Throughout this entire process, we have witnessed everything that’s wrong with Washington. The Senate had a real opportunity to dismantle the most damaging parts of Obamacare. As Republicans have railed against the failures of Obamacare for the last seven years, Democrats have failed to acknowledge any shortcomings of Obamacare and refused to try to fix a broken system. "Now, due to an unworkable budget process and politicians who put their political self-interests ahead of national interest, Obamacare remains the law of the land. This means that the poorest among us will continue to be fined because they can’t afford Obamacare. This means more than 300,000 Georgians below the poverty line will still not have access to the insurance Obamacare promised. Additionally, this means the Medicaid expansion will continue as an open-ended government program that cannot be sustained." We wondered whether Perdue was right that the failure to pass the repeal bill means that "more than 300,000 Georgians below the poverty line will still not have access to the insurance Obamacare promised." Perdue’s office told PolitiFact that he correctly stated that even with Obamacare in place, 300,000 Georgians below the poverty line can’t get insurance. The data we found showed that to be the case. However, in decrying the demise of the GOP bills, Perdue glosses over the fact that independent experts say the Republican replacement bills would not have solved this problem; in fact, they would have made it worse. Senate bill tax credits According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 309,000 people in Georgia are in the "coverage gap" -- a no-man’s-land where their income puts them above current Medicaid eligibility for their state but below the lower limit for premium tax credits for plans purchased on the ACA’s online marketplaces. The House and Senate bills would have addressed this, but only in a limited way. "Both the House and Senate bill would have offered these individuals tax credits," said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at the RAND Corp. But while these tax credits are "arguably better than nothing," Eibner said, it’s not really a viable policy solution for insuring hundreds of thousands of additional Georgians. That’s because the policies available would have such large deductibles that they’d either offer little protection from health care costs or scare off customers from buying a plan in the first place. While the tax credits in the Senate bill would have required relatively small premiums for those in poverty, the independent Congressional Budget Office estimated that the deductible for a typical plan under the Senate bill would be $6,000, likely making it "unaffordable for a person with income under the poverty level," Eibner said. And for the House bill, Eibner said, the CBO estimated that a low-income older person "could face net premiums in the range of $13,600 to $16,100, even after accounting the tax credits available." Such realities played into the CBO’s conclusion that the Senate bill nationally would leave 22 million fewer Americans insured by 2026 than if current law continued. The CBO’s estimate for the House bill was 23 million fewer Americans insured. As for Georgia specifically, the Senate bill would have increased the number of uninsured Georgians by 376,000 in 2022, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute. For the House bill, the Urban Institute projected an additional 304,000 uninsured Georgians in 2022. Bottom line: Those Georgians might have "access" to policies, as Purdue put it, but that’s a far cry from actually getting insurance, much less adequate insurance. The reality, independent experts say, is that the coverage they’d have access to doesn’t offer out-of-pocket costs that are affordable enough to get many new people on the insurance rolls. In fact, any of the repeal-and-replace proposals would have decreased the number of people with insurance substantially compared to current law. No state Medicaid expansion There’s another problem: Georgia turned down an opportunity under the Affordable Care Act to expand Georgia’s eligibility for Medicaid. The state would have had to pick up about 10 percent of the bill, with the federal government paying about 90 percent. The most recent analysis by the Urban Institute found that Medicaid expansion in Georgia -- which is still on the table if the GOP-led state wanted to accept it -- would reduce the number of uninsured Georgians by between 460,000 and 556,000 people in 2021. In other words, the state could have covered even more low-income Georgians than Perdue’s 300,000 by expanding Medicaid under Obamacare. (And, as we noted above, it’s unlikely that the Republican bills would have covered those 300,000.) "To blame the ACA for the state government of Georgia’s decision not to expand Medicaid eligibility is a tremendous distortion," said Urban Institute health policy specialist Linda Blumberg. Our ruling Perdue said that because of the failure to pass a repeal bill, "Obamacare remains the law of the land ... This means more than 300,000 Georgians below the poverty line will still not have access to the insurance Obamacare promised." Perdue has a point: Even with Obamacare in place, 300,000 Georgians below the poverty line can’t get insurance. However, in the context of decrying the failure of the Republican bills to advance in Congress, this observation is misleading. While the Senate and House bills would have offered tax credits to low-income Americans, independent analysts agree that these tax credits wouldn’t open the door to affordable insurance for low-income Americans. Perdue’s criticism of Obamacare is also problematic. In reality, the ACA’s Medicaid expansion could have covered even more than 300,000 low-income Georgians had it not been rejected by Perdue’s fellow Republicans in Georgia.

pomt-13037	"President Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (was) a fancy name for almost a trillion-dollar spending bill. The ARRA was supposed to fix our crumbling roads and bridges," but now, "we have absolutely nothing to show for it."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/nov/29/eric-bolling/foxs-eric-bolling-exaggerates-shortcomings-stimulu/	President Barack Obama will soon hand over the keys to the White House to one of his biggest critics. But the outgoing president’s 2009 stimulus bill -- officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- still drives some of his opponents to distraction. During a commentary on Nov. 26, 2016, Fox News host Eric Bolling called the stimulus measure Obama’s "biggest failure." "President Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (was) a fancy name for almost a trillion-dollar spending bill," Bolling said. "The ARRA was supposed to fix our crumbling roads and bridges. Remember shovel-ready jobs? Well, guess what: I recall union thug head Richie Trumka laughing, saying, 'I guess those shovel-ready jobs weren't shovel-ready. Ha ha ha.' Not funny, Trumka. That's hard-working Americans handing over their well-deserved, hard-earned money to the government, only to have it wasted on you and your union thug friends. Really, really not funny, Richie. President Obama spent a trillion of your tax dollars and we have absolutely nothing to show for it." Bolling’s description of the stimulus didn’t match up with what we remembered about the bill, so we decided to take a deeper look. We found Bolling exaggerated several key points about the legislation -- its main purpose was not to fix crumbling roads and bridges. An effort to contact Bolling through Fox News was unsuccessful. Some of the law’s shortcomings In 2009, as the country was reeling from the Great Recession, Obama signed into law a stimulus package that ultimately cost just over $800 billion. (Earlier estimates had been higher, so we won’t quibble with Bolling’s calling it a $1 trillion bill.) Even observers who see some value in the act acknowledge that it was far from perfect. Michael Grabell, a journalist with the investigative project ProPublica, wrote a book, Money Well Spent? The Truth Behind the Trillion-Dollar Stimulus, the Biggest Economic Recovery Plan in History. He concluded in a 2012 op-ed that a lesson of the stimulus is that "government can create jobs — it just doesn’t often do it well." Grabell wrote that "money was spread far and wide rather than dedicated to programs with the most bang for the buck. ‘Shovel-ready’ projects, those that would put people to work right away, took too long to break ground. Investments in worthwhile long-term projects, on the other hand, were often rushed to meet arbitrary deadlines, and the resulting shoddy outcomes tarnished the projects’ image." In addition, some economists, primarily from the center-left, have argued that the infrastructure investment was doomed because it was too small to be effective. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said that the federal expenditures on infrastructure ended up having less of an impact than expected because they were dwarfed by pullbacks in infrastructure spending by states and private companies during the same time span. "The net effects on employment are hard to determine," Burtless said. Even as stimulus dollars were circulating through the economy, "there was a huge decline in private construction of structures -- homes, apartments, shopping centers, factories, office buildings," along with severe cutbacks in infrastructure projects funded by cash-strapped states. Meanwhile, many conservative economists blame the stimulus for the relatively weak recovery. "Usually the debate about whether we have ‘anything to show for it’ has to do with growth and jobs," said Daniel Mitchell of the free-market Cato Institute. "And by both measures, it is very fair to say we got nothing. Indeed, we probably got negative consequences, with an abnormally weak recovery and expansion:" That said, most of the experts we contacted said that Bolling overstated his case. The stimulus was not primarily an infrastructure bill The "shovel-ready" aspects of the stimulus tended to attract a disproportionate share of attention. But officially, that was only one of the act’s goals, and if you look closely at how the funds were allocated, only a fraction of the total was ever intended to go to infrastructure. According to the Council of Economic Advisers’ final report to Congress on the stimulus, which was current through February 2014, about 35 percent of the expenditures went for tax cuts for individuals and businesses; about 18 percent went for aid to cash-strapped state governments to offset cuts to health and education programs; and about 14 percent went for "safety net" expenditures paid to individual Americans, such as added unemployment payments. That leaves 34 percent of expenditures going to "public investment" -- hardly a trivial amount in an $804.6 billion bill, but still a distinct minority of the total outlay. And the amount actually spent on metal-and-concrete infrastructure was even smaller than that, since the "public investment" category also covers spending on such things as Pell grants, education for disabled students and scientific research. In his book, Grabell estimated that only about $80 billion, or roughly one-tenth of the act’s spending, was devoted to what people would normally think of as "infrastructure," and of that, only about $27 billion was spent specifically on roads and bridges. So roads and bridges accounted for just over 3 percent of all spending under the act. So by the numbers, it would be at least as accurate to call the stimulus a tax cut bill as it would be to call it an infrastructure bill. It’s wrong to say that "we have absolutely nothing to show for" the money spent First, while the impact of the tax cuts and individual payments are harder to envision than a highway or a bridge, they were an unsung success of the stimulus, Burtless said. "The tax cuts, income and payroll, and the increases in government transfer payments largely succeeded in cushioning American households’ net after-tax incomes from the drubbing they would have received in the absence of the stimulus," Burtless said. In the meantime, the infrastructure spending in the stimulus, despite their shortcomings, did build things. "The notion that the New Deal built bridges and dams while all the stimulus did was fill potholes isn't entirely true," Grabell wrote in his book. "Generations from now, there will be countless projects that communities can point to as the enduring legacy of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The $80 billion for roads, runways, waterworks, rails, federal buildings, and parks was one of the largest investments in the nation's infrastructure since President Eisenhower established the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s." Just to cite a few of the bigger projects, the Recovery Act helped push to completion the $1 billion DFW Connector highway in Dallas-Fort Worth; a $650 million elevated truck route to the Port of Tampa; a new Cleveland Innerbelt Bridge; a tunnel connecting Oakland and Contra Costa County, Calif.; new light rail lines in Salt Lake City and Dallas; a courthouse in Austin; a hospital at Camp Pendleton in California; a veterans' facility at Fort Bliss in Texas; and new headquarters for the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard. And the list of projects funded by the act runs to nine pages in his book, even though that’s just a partial accounting. Of course, even though the act produced tangible results, it’s reasonable to question whether it did so in the most efficient way possible. "If you want to interpret (Bolling’s) statement very narrowly, I’m sure you can find a few infrastructure projects that otherwise would not have taken place," Mitchell said. "But even with this narrow interpretation, keep in mind that the normal test for a positive outcome involves cost-benefit analysis. Dumping a bunch of money into the maws of state and local governments is highly unlikely to generate good results." And Grabell said it’s important not to oversell the impact of the stimulus’ reach. "Despite the historic investments and endless list of projects, the Recovery Act in the end created not a crater but a dent in America's overwhelming infrastructure needs," he wrote. "It replaced or repaired more than 1,000 deficient or obsolete bridges, but America has more than 150,000 bridges in such conditions." Our ruling Bolling said the stimulus was "a fancy name for almost a trillion-dollar spending bill. The ARRA was supposed to fix our crumbling roads and bridges," but now, "we have absolutely nothing to show for it." Infrastructure efforts under the stimulus can fairly be critiqued for shortcomings in efficiency and for their relatively modest impact on promoting job growth and reducing the backlog in needed repairs and expansions. However, Bolling seriously overstates his case. Contrary to what he said, the actual expenditures in the stimulus bill on infrastructure were dwarfed by a combination of tax cuts and safety-net payments. And both these tax cuts and individual payments and the infrastructure projects funded by the bill undermine his assertion that "we have absolutely nothing to show for" the act.

pomt-13463	Says Hillary Clinton had an "undercover nurse" with her at the Sept. 11 memorial ceremony in New York.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/13/blog-posting/hillary-clinton-undercover-nurse-story-bogus/	Hillary Clinton’s health scare in New York at a Sept. 11 memorial ceremony fueled plenty of speculation and conspiracy chatter on the Internet. It’s now bubbling into the mainstream media. We thought it was time to intervene on one line of thinking. In a tweet on Sept. 11, @Ten_GOP said photos showed Clinton with an "undercover nurse." (The account is not the official account of the Tennessee Republican Party.) It didn’t take too long for people to connect the image with an image of Clinton’s personal physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack. And from there, it journeyed to the pages of online newspapers and the accounts of Fox News television personalities. Here’s the treatment from the Express of the United Kingdom: And Sean Hannity of Fox News: And Lou Dobbs of Fox Business: Just one problem: The woman pictured is neither Bardack nor an "undercover nurse." It’s a former Clinton staffer, Christine Falvo. Falvo worked in Clinton’s New York Senate office from 2001-09, and also worked with Clinton while she was secretary of state. Falvo left the State Department in 2012 to work for Rubenstein Communications. "If there is anything I can ever do to be helpful to you, please don't hesitate to let me know," Falvo wrote to Clinton in May 2012. "I want to be a resource whenever needed!" According to the New York Post, Falvo was working as a volunteer advance person for Clinton at the 9/11 event. Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon also identified the woman holding Clinton's hand in the photo as Falvo to the Washington Post. Falvo worked on 9/11 issues while she worked for Clinton in the Senate. We reached out to Falvo and will update this post if we hear back. Our ruling Bloggers started a rumor that photos showed Clinton with an "undercover nurse" at the Sept. 11 memorial in New York. The undercover nurse then became Clinton’s personal doctor. Neither is true. The woman in the photos is a former Clinton staffer who was helping at the memorial.

pomt-08025	In preparing a rules package for the 112th Congress, the GOP had no discussions with Democrats.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/07/steny-hoyer/steny-hoyer-says-gop-didnt-consult-democrats-new-h/	Whenever a new party takes control of the House of Representatives, one of the first and most important battles usually concerns the rules the chamber will operate under for the next two years. On Jan. 4, 2011 -- one day before the Republicans officially took the gavel in the House -- Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., released a statement critical of the rules proposed by the new Republican majority. It was titled, "Meet the New Republicans -- Same as the Old Republicans." "As the 112th Congress begins," the statement said, "the 'new' House Republicans are starting off by returning to their old ways. Their rules package shows that while they made promises to the American people that they would govern differently and cut the deficit, they are already failing to live up to their pledge. ... Already they have shut Democrats out of the process in developing the rules package: "• Number of Democrats in the room when package was written: 0. "• Hours of discussion with Democrats: 0. "• Number of Democratic amendments allowed: 0." For this fact check we're focusing on the question of discussion with Democrats. First, some background on the House Rules Committee. Though it's not well-known among the public, the panel is highly influential. It sets the terms of debate for most significant bills that pass through the chamber -- how much time is allotted for debate, for instance, and what amendments will be allowed. It's also one of the purest forms of partisan control in a legislative chamber that gives almost untrammeled power to whichever party is in the majority. Most committees are populated roughly in proportion to the two-party balance in the House, but the Rules Committee, in contrast, typically has about a two-to-one ratio in favor of the majority, and only rarely do members deviate from their party's position. The guidelines that the Rules Committee follows are largely set out in the rules package offered at the beginning of the year. That makes the rules package a high-stakes vote -- and one that is all but certain to be won by the majority party. Given this background, it is a longstanding tradition that the rules package is put together by the majority, with limited minority input. So in the broad sense, Hoyer is right to characterize the process as one driven by Republicans. And as Hoyer surely knows, the Democrats did it the same way when they were in charge. That said, there's evidence that the Republicans engaged in more than "zero" discussion with Democrats. After the GOP won the majority on Nov. 2, 2010, party leaders appointed Greg Walden, R-Ore., to head the transition effort, which played a role in preparing the new rules package. Several media accounts documented that Walden reached out to Democrats during this process, and these stories named names. Politico.com wrote that Walden "consulted with Rep. Robert Brady, the Philadelphia Democrat who runs the House Administration Committee; New Jersey Rep. Robert Andrews; Massachusetts Rep. Michael Capuano, who ran the Democrats’ 2006 transition to power; and Washington Rep. Brian Baird, whom Walden calls his best Democratic friend." (Baird retired after the last Congress, but the two talked during the lame-duck session in December.) A spokesman for Brady confirmed to PolitiFact that Walden reached out "formally and informally" and that "discussions" were held during the transition from Democratic to Republican control. Meanwhile, The Hill reported that Andrews and Brady were handpicked by none other than outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. For his part, Capuano, who chaired his party's transition to the majority in 2006, told the Washington Post that he offered the following wisdom to Walden: "The majority will not be the majority forever, and the majority should treat the minority as they would want to be treated when they're in the minority." Hoyer's camp counters that these Democrats were part of the transition process rather than the rules-writing process. In a technical sense that's true, but a major part of the transition effort was to write a draft of the rules package. In a Jan. 5, 2011, op-ed in Politico.com, Walden recalled the process of putting together the transition team, and he writes that the rules package played a large role in its work. "The morning after Election Day, I organized a team of 22 lawmakers to re-write the rules that govern how the House does business and to scour the Capitol Hill operations for inefficiencies," Walden wrote. And when the draft rules package was unveiled in late December, Walden was prominently featured. In its coverage of the draft unveiling, FoxNews.com reported that "the reforms largely reflect the work of the GOP transition team led by Chairman Greg Walden of Oregon and House Rules working group chairman, Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah." Hoyer is correct that transition team wrote the draft rules package rather than the final one, which had some modest differences. He’s also right that the final rules package -- which includes many provisions that Democrats oppose -- was written by Republicans alone. That is the way the process has worked in the House for as long as anyone can remember. But we believe Hoyer significantly overstepped when he said that there was "zero" Democratic input in the process. The Democratic input may have been only advisory, but GOP leaders did reach out to several Democrats for conversations on the rules package draft – something the Republicans were under no obligation to do. So we rate Hoyer's statement False.	None	Steny Hoyer	None	None	None	2011-01-07T10:37:44	2011-01-04	['United_States_Congress', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-12599	"There was a very large infrastructure bill that was approved during the Obama administration, a trillion dollars. Nobody ever saw anything being built."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/04/donald-trump/donald-trumps-skewed-portrayal-obamas-stimulus/	Just over eight years ago, when Barack Obama was just as new to the Oval Office as Donald Trump is now, he signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, more commonly known as the stimulus. Its supporters give it a measure of credit for making the Great Recession milder than it could have been. But critics, including Trump, argue that it was a whole lot of nothing. He said as much at a town hall for CEOs on April 4, 2017. "You know, there was a very large infrastructure bill that was approved during the Obama administration, a trillion dollars," Trump said. "Nobody ever saw anything being built. I mean, to this day, I haven't heard of anything that's been built. They used most of that money on social programs, and we want this to be on infrastructure." We have fact-checked claims about the stimulus from the time it was being proposed, as well as more recent claims on its results. Let’s take another look at the question of what the stimulus did, and didn’t, achieve. The stimulus was not primarily an infrastructure bill In February 2009, Obama signed into law a stimulus package that ultimately cost just over $800 billion. (Earlier estimates had been higher, so we won’t quibble with Trump’s rounding it up to $1 trillion.) The "shovel-ready" aspects of the stimulus tended to attract the most attention. But officially, that was only one of the act’s goals, and if you look closely at how the funds were allocated, only a fraction of the total was ever intended to go to infrastructure. According to the Council of Economic Advisers’ final report to Congress on the stimulus, which was current through February 2014, about 35 percent of the expenditures went for tax cuts for individuals and businesses; about 18 percent went for aid to cash-strapped state governments to offset cuts to health and education programs; and about 14 percent went for "safety net" expenditures paid to individual Americans, such as added unemployment payments. That leaves 34 percent of expenditures going to "public investment" -- hardly a trivial amount in an $804.6 billion bill, but still a distinct minority of the total outlay. And the amount actually spent on metal-and-concrete infrastructure was even smaller than that, since the "public investment" category also covers spending on such things as Pell grants, education for disabled students and scientific research. Michael Grabell, a journalist with the investigative project ProPublica, wrote a book, Money Well Spent? The Truth Behind the Trillion-Dollar Stimulus, the Biggest Economic Recovery Plan in History. In his book, Grabell estimated that only about $80 billion, or roughly one-tenth of the act’s spending, was devoted to what people would normally think of as "infrastructure," and of that, only about $27 billion was spent specifically on roads and bridges. So roads and bridges accounted for just over 3 percent of all spending under the act. By the numbers, then, it would be at least as accurate to call the stimulus a tax cut bill as it would be to call it an infrastructure bill. Meanwhile, saying the bill spent money on "social programs," as Trump did, is an exaggeration at best. Perhaps the safety net expenditures (14 percent of the law’s outlays) and aid to governments for health and education (18 percent) could be considered "social programs," although not all observers would agree on that label. Either way, they would total less than a third of expenditures. It’s wrong to say that nothing was built Even observers who see some value in the act acknowledge that it was far from perfect. For instance, Grabell concluded in a 2012 op-ed that a lesson of the stimulus is that "government can create jobs — it just doesn’t often do it well." Grabell wrote that "money was spread far and wide rather than dedicated to programs with the most bang for the buck. ‘Shovel-ready’ projects, those that would put people to work right away, took too long to break ground. Investments in worthwhile long-term projects, on the other hand, were often rushed to meet arbitrary deadlines, and the resulting shoddy outcomes tarnished the projects’ image." That said, the infrastructure spending in the stimulus, despite its shortcomings, did build things. "The notion that the New Deal built bridges and dams while all the stimulus did was fill potholes isn't entirely true," Grabell wrote in his book. "Generations from now, there will be countless projects that communities can point to as the enduring legacy of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The $80 billion for roads, runways, waterworks, rails, federal buildings, and parks was one of the largest investments in the nation's infrastructure since President Eisenhower established the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s." Just to cite a few of the bigger projects, the Recovery Act helped push to completion the $1 billion DFW Connector highway in Dallas-Fort Worth; a $650 million elevated truck route to the Port of Tampa; a new Cleveland Innerbelt Bridge; a tunnel connecting Oakland and Contra Costa County, Calif.; new light rail lines in Salt Lake City and Dallas; a courthouse in Austin; a hospital at Camp Pendleton in California; a veterans' facility at Fort Bliss in Texas; and new headquarters for the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard. And the list of projects funded by the act runs to nine pages in his book, even though that’s just a partial accounting. Was it worth it? Of course, even though the act produced tangible results, it’s reasonable to question whether it did so in the most efficient way possible. "Keep in mind that the normal test for a positive outcome involves cost-benefit analysis," Dan Mitchell, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us for an earlier fact-check. "Dumping a bunch of money into the maws of state and local governments is highly unlikely to generate good results." And Grabell said it’s important not to oversell the impact of the stimulus’ reach. "Despite the historic investments and endless list of projects, the Recovery Act in the end created not a crater but a dent in America's overwhelming infrastructure needs," he wrote. "It replaced or repaired more than 1,000 deficient or obsolete bridges, but America has more than 150,000 bridges in such conditions." Our ruling Trump said, "There was a very large infrastructure bill that was approved during the Obama administration, a trillion dollars. Nobody ever saw anything being built." In practice, the stimulus had a mixed record. Beyond that, though, Trump’s characterization is flawed. The single biggest portion of the law actually consisted of tax cuts. As for the infrastructure portion of the law, it did indeed produce results, even if they were somewhat more underwhelming than its backers had initially hoped. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-09801	Photo of "tea party" protests shows crowd sprawling from Capitol to Washington Monument	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/14/blog-posting/blogger-claim-photo-shows-millions-tea-party-prote/	In the competitive world of Washington protests, crowd size is often a matter of dispute. Organizers usually boast of huge crowds, while police and the news media offer much smaller estimates. So supporters of Saturday’s “tea party” protests against President Barack Obama were quick to highlight their big turnout. To bolster countless claims on blogs and Facebook, many posted a photograph that showed a gargantuan crowd sprawling from Capitol Hill down the National Mall to the Washington Monument. But it turns out the photo is more than 10 years old, apparently taken during a 1997 Promise Keepers rally. On Saturday, estimates about the crowd spread quickly through the conservative blogosphere. Many writers, including author Michelle Malkin, pegged the number of people between 1 million and 2 million. Those reports were largely based on information from people in the crowd. Malkin, for example, updated her blog at 12:34 p.m. noting that, “Police estimate 1.2 million in attendance. ABC News reporting crowd at 2 million,” and she cited a Twitter post from Tabitha Hale, writer of Pink Elephant Pundit, who was in Washington for the protest. Many bloggers said the media was unfairly reporting much smaller numbers, and many included the photo. “I have no doubt that Washington Democrats are well aware of how many people turned out, even as their media outlets try to downplay the event,” said Power Line, a conservative blog that linked to the photograph from Say Anything , another conservative Web site. “ 'Media’ estimates range from 60,000 to 500,000 to around 2 million (yes, 2,000,000),” wrote John G. Winder for the conservative blog Cypress Times. “Those estimates, the language employed, and the visuals chosen for use in reporting the rally and representing the people gathered, vary greatly based solely on bias.” In the mainstream media, crowd estimates varied. The New York Times reported that “thousands” of protesters “filled the west lawn of the Capitol and spilled onto the National Mall,” while Fox News wrote that “tens of thousands” marched on Washington. CNN said “reporters at the scene described the massive crowd as reaching the tens of thousands.” Pete Piringer, public affairs officer for the D.C. Fire and Emergency Department, said the local government no longer provides official crowd estimates because they can become politicized. But the day of the rally, Piringer unofficially told one reporter that he thought between 60,000 and 75,000 people had shown up. “It was in no way an official estimate,” he said. We asked Piringer whether there were enough protesters to fill the National Mall, as depicted in the photograph. “It was an impressive crowd,” he said. But after marching down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol, the crowd “only filled the Capitol grounds, maybe up to Third Street,” he said. Yet the photograph so widely posted showed the crowd sprawling all the way to the Washington Monument, which is bordered by 15th and and 17th Streets. There’s another problem with the photograph: It doesn’t include the National Museum of the American Indian, a building located at the corner of Fourth Street and Independence Avenue that opened on Sept. 14, 2004. (Looking at the photograph, the building should be in the upper right hand corner of the National Mall, next to the Air and Space Museum.) That means the picture was taken before the museum opened exactly five years ago. So clearly the photo doesn’t show the “tea party” crowd from the Sept. 12 protest. Also worth noting are the cranes in front of the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. According to Randall Kremer, the museum’s director of public affairs, “The last time cranes were in front was in the 1990s when the IMAX theater was being built.” It appears that the photo was actually taken in 1997 at a rally for Promise Keepers, a group for Christian men. According to the group’s Web site, nearly 1 million people attended the event. Photos of the Oct. 4, 1997, event that were posted on various Web sites in 2003, 2008 and earlier this year show either the same picture or a similar photo that has identical tents and what appear to be TV screens in the same locations. Conservative bloggers who originally posted the picture have backed down. Malkin, like some of her conservative cohorts, retracted the number she had attributed to ABC when the network chastised FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe, whose organization arranged the event, for inaccurately telling the crowd that the news organization had reported the crowd at 1 million to 1.5 million people. Malkin linked to the ABC story on her site, and changed her blog post headline to “Celebrating the 9/12 rallies; Turnout estimated at 2 million; Update: How many?; FreedomWorks in error.” Say Anything updated its original post to say that the picture was “of the wrong rally.” An accurate photo “clearly shows that (the rally) didn’t take place on the mall nearly as extensively as the image I mistakenly posted does.” Power Line took the picture down all together. But because mistakes can still live forever on the Internet and many people who saw the photo on Facebook were unaware it was found to be the wrong picture, we decided to still rate it on the Truth-O-Meter. And Pants on Fire it is. UPDATED: We updated this item to include new details about the Promise Keepers photos.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2009-09-14T11:55:33	2009-09-12	['None']
pomt-14907	"Iowa's Republican caucus stopped mattering years ago. It in no way determines the party nominee."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/nov/04/trevor-noah/daily-shows-trevor-noah-says-iowa-gop-caucuses-don/	Iowa Republicans might have had good reason to stiff The Daily Show, but the move drew a predictable reaction. The party turned down the program’s request to cover a major gathering of the presidential contenders saying they thought the program would come only to make fun of their state. New host Trevor Noah was miffed. "Our problem isn't with Iowa as a state, it's with its bloated role in the American elections," Noah said. "I don't understand, especially because Iowa's Republican caucus stopped mattering years ago. It in no way determines the party nominee, let alone the general election winners. Ask Mike Huckabee and even less-President Rick Santorum." We thought we’d look into Noah’s assertion that Iowa’s GOP caucus no longer matters and that it "in no way determines the party nominee." Strictly by the numbers, Iowa’s Republicans don’t have a great track record of picking the ultimate nominee. There have been seven contested caucuses since the party held its first one in 1976. Out of that, the party’s voters can boast three hits and four misses. In baseball, they’d be a valuable .400-plus hitter. But in politics, not so much. "At best, Iowa Republicans have a mediocre record of picking the eventual nominee in the caucuses," said Peverill Squire, a political scientist at the University of Missouri. "The Iowa caucuses, particularly on the GOP side, matter less in 2016 than they did a decade or two ago." This table shows how both the Republican and Democratic caucuses have performed over the years. Green means success. Democrats have a better batting average, but a few details for contests in both parties bear noting. In 1972, the Democrats held the first caucus and it barely registered on the political scene. South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, the eventual nominee, campaigned for all of about two days in the state. In 1976, the category of Uncommitted was allowed and while Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter came out on top with 28 percent, Uncommitted took 37 percent. In 2012, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum got the most votes, but out of nearly 60,000 votes cast between him and Mitt Romney, his margin of victory was a microscopic 34 votes. (The race was so close that the Iowa GOP initially called the caucuses for Romney.) Romney went on to take the nomination. So Iowa Republicans didn’t pick the ultimate winner, but they came incredibly close. Where does this leave us? If you measure the Republican Iowa caucus against who gets the nomination, it does poorly. But political scientist Dennis Goldford at Drake University in Iowa said that’s a false premise. Goldford said he doesn’t know any serious observer who expects that out of Iowa. "It’s more likely to tell you who won’t be the president, or who won’t be the nominee," he said. Squire echoed that view. "The traditional role of the caucuses in both parties has really been to winnow the field," he said. Goldford said the significance of the caucuses stems entirely from Iowa being the very first step in the nomination process. Under new rules, candidates will gain delegates to the nominating convention. But the impact goes beyond delegates at a convention. "What they do is reveal unexpected strengths and weaknesses among the candidates," he said. A second-place finish for a candidate thought to be a dark horse can be seen as a win. The same result for a front runner is seen as a loss, with potential repercussions in the primaries that follow. Squire reminded us that Iowa is important in another way. With only one exception, one of the top three finishers in Iowa has gone on to become the Republican nominee. From this comes the old saw -- there are three tickets out of Iowa. In 1980, Ronald Reagan came in second. George Bush took third in 1988, and in 2012, Romney was second by a whisker. The outlier is John McCain in 2008. He came in fourth but in an historic recovery, became the Republican nominee. Squire argued that shaping the field, rather than being a King-maker, is healthier for the democratic process. Our ruling Noah said that the Republican Iowa caucuses "stopped mattering years ago" and "in no way determines the party nominee." Noah has a point about the track record of the GOP caucus picking the eventual nominee, but he pushes it too far when he says they have no impact on the nomination process. Generally, winning or doing reasonably well in Iowa puts a candidate on the path to the nomination. We rate this claim Half True. Update: This post has been updated to note that the Iowa GOP initially called Romney the winner in 2012.

pomt-12830	"The murder rate in our country is the highest it’s been in 47 years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-murder-rate-highest-47-years/	One of President Donald Trump’s biggest campaign themes was that the United States is experiencing a crime plague of historical proportions. On Feb. 7, the newly elected chief executive invited a group of county sheriffs to the White House -- and proceeded to cite a startling crime statistic. "The murder rate in our country is the highest it’s been in 47 years, right?" Trump said. "Did you know that? Forty-seven years. I used to use that -- I’d say that in a speech and everybody was surprised, because the press doesn’t tell it like it is. It wasn’t to their advantage to say that. But the murder rate is the highest it’s been in, I guess, from 45 to 47 years." There’s a reason the press didn’t tout that figure — the statement was incorrect. Trump has, on occasion, accurately stated a statistic along these lines. A day after talking with the sheriffs, Trump offered a more accurate version of this statistic during an address to the Major Cities Chiefs Association winter conference. And during the second presidential debate, Trump said, "We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years." However, there’s a difference between saying the country’s largest cities experienced their biggest annual increase in homicides in more than four decades (as Trump said during the debate) and saying that the country is experiencing its highest murder rate overall in more than four decades (as he told the sheriffs). The national homicide rate is considerably lower than its peak in the 1990s: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The chart does show a clear spike between 2014 and 2015, but it’s not enough to reverse a decades-long trend in the national homicide rate. The preliminary statistics for 2016 -- which are not an apples-to-apples comparison to the full-year numbers used in this graph -- suggest that homicides rose once again between 2015 and 2016, by 5.2 percent. But what’s also clear in this graph is that the overall homicide rate -- even accounting for the upward bumps in 2015 and potentially in 2016 -- is nowhere near the peak levels of the 1990s. The following graph shows raw totals (not rates) for murders going back to 1971. This graph shows the same peak period -- the early 1990s. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Specifically, the number of murders declined by 42 percent between 1993 and 2014, even as the U.S. population rose by 25 percent over the same period. So while homicides have recently risen -- a legitimate concern, experts say -- they are far below their high levels of the early 1990s, when the nation’s population was much smaller. "Violent crime rates are up compared with historic lows, and they are still very, very low compared with just five or 10 years ago," Raymond Paternoster, a University of Maryland criminologist, told us in October. Alan Lizotte, a University at Albany criminologist, agreed. "A small increase between two time points is not an increase when the 20-year trend is downward," he said in October. "If it went on for several years, it might indicate an increase." Our ruling Trump told the sheriffs, "The murder rate in our country is the highest it’s been in 47 years." Actually, the highest murder rates in recent memory occurred during the early 1990s; after that, the rate fell dramatically until 2014, at which point it ticked up. That uptick did represent the biggest single-year rise in more than four decades, but that’s very different than what Trump said. We rate his statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d4a8c2c5-682b-4ac1-b7fc-4da07af9731a	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-02-08T12:31:28	2017-02-07	['None']
pomt-00694	Says the recall elections that aimed to remove him and other Republican officials from office "cost tens of millions of dollars to run."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/may/04/scott-walker/historic-recall-elections-wisconsin-cost-tens-mill/	One of the accomplishments that made Scott Walker a leading Republican presidential contender was becoming the nation's first governor to survive a recall election -- one of three gubernatorial races he won in four years. The 2012 recalls of Walker, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and three GOP state senators were brought on by Walker's Act 10 -- a 2011 law that sharply curtailed collective bargaining powers for most public employees in Wisconsin. The measure drew massive protests in Madison. While on an April 27, 2015 trip to Massachusetts, Walker touched on those events during in an interview with Howie Carr, a talk show host who is syndicated on more than 20 radio stations in New England. "They caused damage to the Capitol," Walker said of the protesters, "(and) the recall elections cost tens of millions of dollars to run -- the impact on the taxpayers. It was just -- what we found is the Left never stops." We rated as Pants on Fire a 2011 claim by Mike Huebsch, then Walker's secretary of administration, that damage by protesters to the Capitol building would cost $7.5 million to repair. The actual estimate was $347,500. So, what about the governor's claim that the recall elections cost tens of millions of dollars to run? It suggests at least a couple of tens of millions -- or $20 million -- was spent. But the actual total falls short of that. In September 2012, there were news reports on an announcement by the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, which oversees state elections, that the recalls cost more than $14 million -- $6.3 million for the primaries plus $7.2 million for the recall elections. The largest costs were poll workers salaries and staff wages. They were borne by local taxpayers, since municipalities administer elections. In addition, the Government Accountability Board itself spent $663,000, primarily to process petitions signed by more than 931,000 people in order to get the governor’s recall on the ballot. The state board also had previously announced that a separate round of Senate recall elections, in July and August of 2011, cost state and local taxpayers $2.1 million. So that's a total of nearly $16.3 million, which is sizable, particularly since it hadn't been budgeted. But it's short of tens of millions. Our rating Walker said "the recall elections" that aimed to remove him, the lieutenant governor and several state lawmakers from office "cost tens of millions of dollars to run." His claim suggests at least $20 million was spent, but the tally was $16.3 million. That's more than a single ten, but less than "tens of millions." For a claim that has only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-15243	"The stock market does better when you have a Democratic president in the White House."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/04/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-stock-market-has-done-better-/	Does the stock market boom under Democratic presidents? Hillary Clinton said so during a town hall in Nashua, N.H., on July 28, 2015. "You know the evidence is pretty clear that under Democratic presidents, going a ways back, people do better," Clinton said, at around 5:30 in this video. "And not only working people, middle class people. Even the stock market does better when you have a Democratic president in the White House." We wondered: Is it true that "the stock market does better when you have a Democratic president in the White House"? We took a closer look. Scrutinizing the stock ticker There have been a couple studies addressing this question, and they all agree: For whatever reason, going back more than a century, the stock market has done better under Democratic presidents than Republican presidents. A 2012 report by CMC Markets, an international financial firm, found that since 1900, the United States’ stock markets have posted an average annual return of 15.31 percent under Democratic presidents, compared to just 5.43 percent under Republicans. Another study from 2012 by Adviser Perspectives newsletter, using somewhat different methodology, found that since 1900, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 8.7 percent annually under a Democratic president, compared to 5.7 percent under Republicans. And calculations by The Economist found that the Barclays U.S. equity index gained a cumulative 300 percent under Democratic presidents between 1929 and 2011, compared to about zero under Republican presidents. To bring the data up to date, we checked in with Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at S&P Equity Research in New York. He had previously found a big Democratic advantage in stock market gains through 2012. From 1901 through July 31, 2015, Stovall found, the stock market gained 8.7 percent under Democratic presidents, compared to 5.3 percent under Republican presidents. The same pattern held in Stovall’s data since the end of World War II — in fact, it was even more pronounced. Since 1945, the markets gained 11.2 percent under Democratic presidents and 6.3 percent under Republican presidents. And it wasn’t just the stock market that chalked up better performance under Democratic presidents, according to a July 2014 paper by Princeton University economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. They found a performance gap between the parties that was "startlingly large" over a wide variety of economic metrics. "The U.S. economy not only grows faster, according to real GDP and other measures, during Democratic versus Republican presidencies, it also produces more jobs, lowers the unemployment rate, generates higher corporate profits and investment, and turns in higher stock market returns," Blinder and Watson wrote. "Indeed, it outperforms under almost all standard macroeconomic metrics." What does this mean? So, multiple studies show that Clinton’s claim is numerically correct. But what, if anything, can we conclude from it? Experts said it’s best not to go overboard in drawing conclusions about White House control and stock market performance. Here are some of the reasons why. • A lot of this stems from luck and timing. Republicans are cursed by having Herbert Hoover on their presidential roster. The stock-market decline was so quick and deep under Hoover that it continues to hobble the party’s stock-market performance all these decades later. Meanwhile, starting at such a low point was a huge help to his Democratic successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt. In fact, if you remove Hoover from the GOP column, the average monthly return for Republicans improves significantly, from a 0.38 percent average monthly return to a 0.61 percent monthly return. The Hoover-free GOP number is within striking distance of the Democratic mark of 0.73 percent, said Lawrence J. White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. White doesn’t argue that it’s fairest to remove Hoover from the GOP’s calculation. Rather, he said, it’s a reminder that relatively small changes due at least in part to unlucky timing can have big effects on the end result. • Partisan labels are only somewhat helpful. "What matters is the relationship of policy to the stock market, not partisan labels," said Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute. "Economic policy under Bill Clinton was far more market-oriented than it was under either Bush or Nixon." • A "good" stock market is harder to define than one might think. For instance, a healthy year-over-year increase in the stock market may sound good, but if it comes with high volatility throughout the year, that can be a lot less pleasant for investors, said Tom Arnold, a professor of finance at the University of Richmond Robins School of Business. Meanwhile, "down markets are buying opportunities and up markets are selling opportunities for the purpose of cashing in on profits, possibly from securities purchased in a down market," Arnold said. " ‘Better’ in one market is usually at the cost of another market." • Market results don’t align neatly with presidential terms. "The stock market makes an anticipatory assessment of a president and his policies shortly after his election — or even before the election," White said. "So the market's anticipation of what an incoming president will do occurs during the last few months of the incumbent’s presidency." He noted that this factor was even stronger prior to 1936, when the new president was inaugurated on March 4, leaving four months of stock market anticipation in the previous president’s column. • A president is only one factor in determining stock market performance. Perhaps most important, experts urge caution in ascribing too much credit to a president for how the stock market performs on his watch. Often — including now, during a period of strong stock-market gains — Congress is held by the opposing party. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve, which plays a crucial role in the economy by directing the nation’s monetary policy, operates independently once appointments are made by the president and confirmed by Congress. And a host of other factors that a president can’t control, including technological advances and international economic trends, play a role as well. In their paper, Blinder and Watson focus on two factors as most important in determining economic performance. One is the presence or absence of an energy price shock -- something that, unfortunately for the GOP, hit during the presidencies of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and George W. Bush, compared to just once under a Democrat, Jimmy Carter. The other factor they pointed to is what economists call "total factor productivity," defined as the portion of economic output not explained by the amount of inputs used in production. Think of it as the economy’s special sauce, or its extra bang for the buck. Although it’s unclear why, Democratic presidents have benefited from higher total factor productivity, most clearly during the technology boom under Bill Clinton, which produced significant productivity gains. Hillary Clinton’s campaign emphasized to PolitiFact that she didn’t say that the president is the only factor that went into stock market results. Still, our experts agreed that while the numbers to back up her claim are clear, the meaning and significance of those numbers should be taken with a grain of salt. "I wouldn't place much weight on it, one way or the other," White said. Our ruling Clinton said that "the stock market does better when you have a Democratic president in the White House." The numbers back her up, but it’s worth noting that luck, timing and several other factors in the broader economy also play a role in determining stock market performance. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-14711	"Both Cruz and Rubio are missing the vast majority of their votes."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/03/rand-paul/rand-paul-overstates-missed-votes-ted-cruz-not-mar/	While most 2016 candidates have spent the past few weeks campaigning around early primary states, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has had a light schedule NBC Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked Paul why he hasn’t hosted a public event since Dec. 16 in Nevada. Paul said he’s been attending to other responsibilities, such as spending time with his family, performing pro-bono surgeries (he’s an ophthalmologist), and hosting fundraisers — not to mention his job as a senator. Paul went after the voting records of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. "I mean, I have a job as senator," Paul said Jan. 3. "I'm one of the few of the candidates that actually shows up to vote. Both Cruz and Rubio are missing the vast majority of their votes. But I feel an obligation to the taxpayer that pays my salary." Critics have attacked Rubio’s Senate voting record throughout the 2016 cycle, so we decided to dig in a little further and see how it compares to the records of Cruz and Paul. We found that Paul far overstated when he said Cruz and Rubio missed "the vast majority of their votes." The votes Paul used his busy Senate schedule as an excuse for not hosting many campaign events in the latter half of December, but there wasn’t too much going on at Capitol Hill during this time. The Senate has been in recess since Dec. 18 and won’t be back in session until Jan. 11. Paul didn’t specify a time frame, but his campaign sent over data for his, Cruz’s and Rubio’s Senate careers. We found the same data on the website GovTrack. In the chart below, we’ve counted the career absentee rate for each of the current or former senators running for president. Senator Career absentee rate Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) 13.3 percent (197 out of 1,482) Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 12.4 percent (124 out of 996) Rand Paul (R-Ky.) 4.0 percent (59 out of 1,482) Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 3.6 percent (102 out of 2,835) Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y., 2001-2009) 9.5 percent (249 out of 2,616) Rick Santorum (R-Pa., 1995-2006 ) 1.9 percent (79 out of 4,156) Concerning their career absentee rates, Rubio has the worst record, missing 13.3 percent of all votes. He’s followed by Cruz at 12.4 percent and Clinton at 9.5 percent. Paul and Sanders have both missed closer to 4 percent. All five are far away from the median career absentee rate for all current senators, 1.7 percent. Santorum comes close with 1.9 percent. However, no candidate has missed a "vast majority" of his or her votes. Another way to interpret Paul’s statement is that he is specifically referring to votes cast during the 2016 election cycle or in recent months. Here are the current senators’ records from October through December of last year, as well as for 2015 as a whole. (We chose October through December because GovTrack breaks down its data into three-month periods.) Senator Oct.-Dec 2015 votes missed (out of 67) Oct.-Dec 2015 absentee rate 2015 votes missed (out of 339) 2015 absentee rate Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) 39 58.2 percent 120 35.4 percent Ted Cruz (R-Texas) 20 29.8 percent 80 23.6 percent Rand Paul (R-Ky.) 14 20.9 percent 20 5.9 percent Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) 19 28.4 percent 28 8.3 percent Between the months of October and December, specifically, Rubio did miss a majority of his votes, skipping 39 out of 67 total votes. Notably, Rubio missed the Dec. 18 final vote on a major spending bill, while Cruz and Paul both voted against it. However, Cruz did not miss a majority of his votes in that time period. Neither Cruz nor Rubio missed a majority in 2015 overall. Paul and Sanders have had a better voting record throughout the 2016 election so far than Cruz and Rubio, but Paul’s statement inflates the gap. Our ruling Paul said "Rubio and Cruz are missing the vast majority of their votes" in the Senate. Paul has a point that he has a better Senate voting record than Cruz and Rubio. And over the past three months, Rubio has missed a majority of his votes, skipping out on nearly 60 percent as he campaigns for president. This doesn’t hold for Rubio’s 2015 record or his Senate career. And Cruz has not missed a majority of his votes over any of those time periods. Paul’s criticism goes too far in saying both candidates are "missing the vast majority of their votes," so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01185	"In 1990, the U.S. led the world in the percentage of 25-34 year olds with college degrees. Today we are in 12th place."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/05/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-us-was-1st-college-degrees-199/	Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has toyed with running for president in 2016, is a member of Congress who loves to share statistical claims on social media. Sometimes it’s on Twitter; other times it’s in memes tailored for Facebook. A reader recently sent us a new meme featuring an image of the populist senator alongside a claim he made about higher education. It said: "Forty years ago, some of our great public universities, as well as many state colleges, were virtually tuition free. Today, the cost of college is unaffordable for many. In 1990, the U.S. led the world in the percentage of 25-34 year olds with college degrees. Today we are in 12th place. Things need to change. Higher education must become affordable for all." We decided to see whether Sanders was right that the United States led the world in 1990 for young people with college degrees but now ranks 12th internationally. Checking the second part of the claim -- that the United States is currently in 12th place -- is pretty straightforward. It’s confirmed by statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of advanced industrialized nations. For 2012 -- the last year for which statistics are available -- there were 11 countries with higher rates of college education. According to OECD, the countries ranking higher than the United States were South Korea, Japan, Canada, Russia, Luxembourg, Ireland, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and Norway. The top finisher, South Korea, had a rate more than 20 percentage points higher than the United States. We had more trouble finding data for 1990. When we asked Sanders’ staff for the source, they pointed us to a scholarly paper published by BBVA Research, titled, "Educational Attainment in the OECD, 1960-2010." In Table 14, the paper offers college attainment data for OECD countries for each five-year increment between 1960 and 2010. However, this measurement is not exactly the same one as used in 2014. It looks at attainment of the "second cycle of higher education" in each country, which isn't exactly the same as rates of receiving an undergraduate degree. So this data does not allow for an apples-to-apples comparison. The most direct comparison we could find was OECD data from 2000. That year, the United States ranked fourth after Canada, Japan and Finland. It’s worth noting that two of the countries ranking ahead of the United States in 2012 -- Russia and Israel -- were not surveyed in 2000. So their inclusion in the 2012 data slightly exaggerates the severity of the U.S. decline. Still, experts told PolitiFact that if you extrapolate back from the 2000 data to 1990, the United States was certainly among the highest ranks of countries in rates of college degrees. "There could be some niceties to quibble with, but probably nothing that would make his statement wrong in any significant way," said David Bills, an education professor at the University of Iowa. "The statement is generally accurate." Bills and other experts did question whether there’s a straight-line link between high tuition and low degree rates, as Sanders argued. "My guess -- and it’s mostly a guess -- is that students being academically underprepared leads to more noncompletion than tuition does," Bills said. Ben Wildavsky, director of higher education studies at the Rockefeller Institute of Government, concurred. "The key thing to understand is that U.S. degree-attainment rates haven’t gotten worse – the rest of the world has gotten better," Wildavsky said. "So this doesn’t particularly say anything about affordability, I think. But it’s reasonable to say that we need to increase degree production to meet the needs of the changing economy." Our ruling Sanders said that "in 1990, the U.S. led the world in the percentage of 25-34 year olds with college degrees. Today we are in 12th place." There are some quirks in the data, but experts agree that the general trend line is roughly as Sanders says it is. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2014-12-05T17:07:48	2014-12-05	['United_States']
pomt-05319	On support for Ronald Reagan's policies	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/17/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-once-distanced-himself-ronald-reagan-n/	Ronald Reagan is the ultimate icon for Republicans. But has Mitt Romney flip-flopped on his support for the Gipper? The flip-flop charge was raised by the Democratic National Committee in an video advertisement. Separately, one of Romney’s Republican primary opponents, Newt Gingrich, charged that Romney has demonstrated insufficient warmth for the late president. In this item, we’ll ask whether Romney has flip-flopped on his degree of support for Reagan. We’ll start by noting that the Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gauging whether they did. What Romney said during his 1994 Senate campaign In 1994, when Romney was challenging Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the two had a debate in which Kennedy, a liberal Democrat, claimed that child poverty rates rose during the Republican administration of Reagan and his vice president, George H.W. Bush. "Under the Reagan/Bush economic programs, under the economic programs you want to return to, the total number of children that are living in poverty, the total number of children out of wedlock -- this has happened, you know we’ve had Republican presidents during this period of time and the cutting back of support systems for children and most of all for families to get jobs," Kennedy said. "If you’re not going to provide a climate and an atmosphere for men and women to be able to work and provide for their children, you’re going to see the breakdown of the family as well." Kennedy said discussions about supporting families shouldn’t be used to score "political hits," prompting Romney to fire back that he wasn’t politicizing the issue -- Kennedy was. "I mentioned nothing about politics or your position at all," Romney said. "I talked about what I’d do to help strengthen families, and you talked about Reagan-Bush. Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I’m not trying to return to Reagan-Bush." We looked and couldn’t find any other references to Romney distancing himself from Reagan, beyond the 1994 debate comment. Still, this example does strike us as a high-profile and unmistakable case of rhetorical distancing on Romney’s part. Romney’s statements as a presidential candidate By the time Romney began running for president -- which meant courting a staunchly conservative Republican base, rather than independents and Democrats as he had in Massachusetts -- Romney’s tone changed. During his first presidential campaign in 2007, Romney blasted primary rival John McCain for voting against President George W. Bush’s tax cuts during a campaign event in New Hampshire. "That's failing Reagan 101," Romney said, holding up Reagan as the standard to which Republicans should aspire. Then, in a debate in October 2007, Romney was asked whether the primary candidates would support the Republican nominee if it was someone else. Yes, Romney said, then added, "I want that nominee, however, to come out of the same mold as Ronald Reagan." Romney has continued to offer praise of Reagan as the 2012 campaign approached. In May 2010, Romney spoke at the annual Reagan lecture at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, Calif. He was talking about America’s position in the world. "I’m optimistic about the future because I recognize that there is a growing awakening among the American people that this administration has put us on the wrong track and that the principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them." After some applause, Romney continued by elaborating on Reagan-like policies emphasizing low taxes, balanced budgets and strong families. While speaking about the need to keep America strong for the sake of world peace, he paraphrased "that wonderful line" of Reagan’s: "(Reagan) said, ‘Of the four wars that were begun during my lifetime, not one of them was begun because America was too strong.’ And he’s absolutely right," Romney said. We found other examples of Romney's fealty to Reagan's legacy: • When he proposed a detailed economic plan last year, Romney included a provision for a new "Reagan Economic Zone," an international free-trade area designed to reward nations that have "embraced free enterprise and open markets." • On Dec. 16, 2011, at a Fox News-sponsored debate, Romney referred to Reagan in explaining his change of heart on abortion. Both Romney and Reagan started off favoring abortion rights before shifting to an anti-abortion stance. "I've learned over time, like Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush and others, my experience in life over, what, 19 -- 17, 18, 19 years has told me that sometimes I was wrong," Romney said. "Where I was wrong, I've tried to correct myself." • On Dec. 15, 2011, the Romney campaign unveiled a group called "Reaganites for Romney," featuring officials who served in political or policy roles during the Reagan Administration. "These individuals were part of a movement that changed America and the rest of the world," said Romney. "The smaller government policies of the Reagan era helped turn around a struggling economy and create millions of jobs. And the strong defense of freedom around the world led to the crumbling of empires and dictatorships."

pomt-05860	The polls "show over half of Americans identify themselves as being pro-life."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/feb/12/barth-bracy/rhode-island-right-life-executive-director-barth-b/	Protesters from Occupy Providence, who staged a controversial counter-protest to an anti-abortion rally at the State House on Jan. 26, 2012, were the focus of a Feb. 3 appearance by Barth Bracy, executive director of Rhode Island Right to Life, on WPRO radio. "They came to disrupt and shout down our rally," Bracy said. "They claim to represent the 99 percent. Apparently they haven't seen the polls that show over half of Americans identify themselves as being pro-life. And they decided that they're about taking a stand for abortion, for public funding for abortion and they're about shouting down the pro-life movement." Do opinion polls show that more than half of Americans identify themselves as "pro-life" instead of "pro-choice" -- the terms abortion opponents and abortion rights supporters use to describe themselves? When we asked Bracy for the source of his numbers, he sent us to a 2009 Gallup Poll in which 51 percent of respondents identified themselves as "pro-life" and 42 percent said they were "pro-choice." That was a reversal from 2008, when 50 percent identified themselves as "pro-choice" versus 44 percent as "pro-life." It was the first time that abortion opponents have had a majority since Gallup started asking respondents, "would you consider yourself to be pro-choice or pro-life." But since then, the percentage in the "pro-life" category has dipped below 50 percent and hasn't recovered. By May 2011, those identifying themselves as "pro-life’ were back in the minority, 49-45 percent but with a 4-point margin of error. In the most recent Gallup poll, conducted in July, it was a dead heat: 47-47. "We did see a shift from the more pro-choice view which prevailed for much of the 1990s and 2000s after Obama took office in 2009, which has softened a bit since then to a more even divide," Jeff Jones, Gallup Poll managing editor, said through a spokeswoman. "The variation we have seen the last two years is due to sampling error, which tends to be a bit more of a factor when we are looking at things with a basically 50-50 split as we see here. I generally would say Americans have been evenly divided on abortion since July 2009." Also, the margin of error increased when Gallup began calling cell phones in 2008. It used to be plus or minus 3 points. Now it's plus or minus 4 points. Thus, the margin hasn't been large enough for either side to claim a majority since that May 2009, survey. We also checked with PollingReport.com, which logs abortion poll results going back to the 1990s. The only other survey that has posed a similar question, albeit with slightly different wording, is a Fox News/Opinion Dynamics Poll that has asked people if they are "more pro-life or more pro-choice." There, again, more people called themselves "pro-life" beginning in 2009. The highest "pro-life" score in that poll was 50 percent, in January 2011 (the most recent), with a margin of error of 2 percentage points. With 42 percent saying that they are "pro-choice," you could say that the Americans with a clear opinion are in the "pro-life" camp, but Bracy didn't word his comment that way. Bracy said he was using the 2009 data because that was what stuck in his head, and joked, "Is it 2012 already?" Our ruling Barth Bracy said the polls "show over half of Americans identify themselves as being pro-life." To us, that means greater than 50 percent of the population now feel that way. That was true for one Gallup poll that is now nearly three years out of date. Although 51 percent in that survey said they were "pro-life," the level of support has dipped a bit in subsequent surveys. Gallup frequently polls people on this question, and its polls show that anti-abortion advocates have clearly gained ground since the mid-1990s, when fewer than 40 percent of Americans identified themselves as "pro-life." Given the margin of error, the polls reveal a fairly even divide between the two sides. But the most recent polls show that, despite some surges of support, it is not correct to say that more than half of Americans call themselves "pro-life." We rule Bracy's statement as Mostly False. Gallup's next survey on the question will be released in May. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-08024	New provisions of the health care law bar the use of flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts to pay for aspirin and other non-prescription health needs.	true	/virginia/statements/2011/jan/07/pat-mullins/gop-chairman-mullins-says-health-care-bill-end-pre/	Republican Party of Virginia Chairman Pat Mullins kicked off the New Year attacking recent side effects of health care overhaul on Flexible Spending Accounts, which allow workers to pay medical expenses with pre-tax dollars. In an e-letter titled "FSA at Work? Jim Webb Just Made It a Lot Less Useful," Mullins staples Virginia’s senior Senator to new provisions of the health care law that took effect Jan. 1. "Desperate for tax dollars to pay for their $1 trillion health care takeover, Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, and Jim Webb decided to pick the pockets of consumers who opted to take responsibility for their own health care costs and remove the ability of consumers to use FSA and HSA plans to pay for things like aspirin and other non-prescription health needs," Mullins wrote. He later reiterates the point, writing: "Until this week, consumers could use their accounts to set aside pre-tax money for medical expenses. But thanks to Webb and other tax happy Democrats, over-the-counter drug purchases are now off limits to FSA and HSA accounts." There’s plenty of confusion about health care reform, so we checked to see if his claim about over-the-counter drugs is correct. As a source, Mullins cited a news report from KSAT 12 out of San Antonio, Texas. The report says, "Over-the-counter medications will no longer be reimbursable through a health care flexible spending account, or FSA, even if the account has a grace period. So, Dec. 31 is the last day to stock up on pain relievers, allergy tablets, antacids and more for people who want to use them to exhaust their use-it-or-lose-it FSA." Not convinced San Antonio’s KSAT 12 is an end-all source for health care reform, we dug deeper. According to the Internal Revenue Service guidance on flexible spending accounts, a new provision "as added by the Affordable Care Act, provides that...beginning after December 31, 2010, expenses incurred for a medicine or a drug shall be treated as a reimbursement for medical expenses only if such medicine or drug is a prescribed drug (determined without regard to whether such drug is available without a prescription) or is insulin." In other words, you will no longer be able to use FSAs to pay for your aspirin, antacids and other over-the-counter drugs if they’re not prescribed by a physician. What about HSAs -- tax-advantaged health savings accounts? Pretty much the same. The IRS says that "a distribution from an HSA...for a medicine or drug is a tax-free qualified medical expense only if (1) the medicine or drug requires a prescription, (2) is an over-the-counter medicine or drug and the individual obtains a prescription, or (3) is insulin." Otherwise, those "non-qualified expenses" will be taxed at 20 percent rather than the current 10 percent for HSA plan participants. So, while the recently enacted portion of the health care law will not stop consumers from being able to buy over-the-counter drugs through their plans, it will require a prescription to do so. On that count, Mullins stays relatively safe by employing the phrase "non-prescription health needs" at the end of his claim. True, those items like aspirin can still qualify for reimbursement with a prescription, but then they would not longer be "non-prescription." But the same phrase also presents a problem for Mullins because other "non-prescription" items such as medical supplies and first-aid items remain eligible for reimbursement without a prescription. "Over-the-counter medications are treated differently than over-the-counter medical items like Band-Aids, which are covered without a prescription," said Michael Waxman of Save Flexible Spending Plans. If you’re wondering why these changes are taking place, the answer is likely money. "I think [federal officials] were just looking for revenue raisers," Mike Thompson, a human resource services principal with the PwC recently told the Washington Post. As that story notes, employee contributions to FSAs are made on a pretax basis, reducing earnings and thus the amount workers pay in income tax. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, tightening up the tax break on over-the-counter purchases will generate an estimated $5 billion in federal revenues through 2019. And one last note: Webb, as Mullins said, did vote for the massive health care reform bill that limits the use of flexible spending accounts. Let’s look back. Mullins says health care law provisions that took effect Jan. 1 will "remove the ability of consumers to use FSA and HSA plans to pay for things like aspirin and other non-prescription health needs." It’s true that as of Jan. 1, FSA and HSA plans no longer offered reimbursements for over-the-counter drugs without a prescription. However, those same items could be covered with a prescription. Mullins misses a caveat by not noting that non-prescription items like crutches, bandages, and health supplies like diagnostic devices and blood sugar test kits remain covered. But his comments seem directed at drugs. We find his claim True.	None	Pat Mullins	None	None	None	2011-01-07T15:18:41	2011-01-03	['None']
pomt-01131	Says that in 2008, President Barack Obama said normalization with Cuba would first require "liberation of all political prisoners and some basic steps toward freedom, including freedom of the press, political parties, labor unions."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/dec/23/mario-diaz-balart/2008-obama-said-normalization-cuba-would-require-d/	President Barack Obama’s announcement that the United States and Cuba would proceed toward normalized relations put Miami’s Cuban-American GOP Congressional delegation in the national spotlight. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio and U.S. Reps Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen held a press conference Dec. 18 to bash Obama’s announcement. Diaz-Balart characterized Obama’s position as a significant change from what he said during the 2008 campaign. Back in 2008, during Obama’s first White House bid, the future president said that "before normalization would take place, there would have to be liberation of all political prisoners and some basic steps toward freedom, including freedom of the press, political parties, labor unions, etc.," Diaz-Balart said at the press conference. "Then, once again, President Obama -- breaking his own word, breaking his own pledge -- has decided to do something absolutely without precedent, and that is to give an anti-American terrorist dictatorship exactly what they have been asking for." Is Diaz-Balart correct about what Obama, then a senator, said would be his criteria for normalizing relations with Cuba? We went back to his campaign speeches and statements to find out. Obama’s 2008 campaign position on Cuba Obama’s historic announcement to normalize relations with Cuba was announced jointly by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. Plans call for opening embassies in Havana and Washington, easing travel restrictions and increasing the amount of money that Cubans on the island can receive from relatives in the United States. and other Americans. Those traveling to Cuba from the United States will also be able use credit cards on the island, and Cuba may be removed from the State Department’s list as a state sponsor of terrorism. However, the longstanding trade embargo – strengthened in 1996 with passage of the Helms-Burton Act -- remains in place. Only Congress has the power to abolish it. Under Helms-Burton, the embargo can only be lifted when Cuba holds free and fair elections, releases political prisoners and guarantees free speech and workers' rights. While Obama promised that the United States will continue its efforts to spread democracy to Cuba, we don’t see anything in what’s been released that would require Cuba to promote democracy or establish freedom of the press, political parties and unions in order to normalize relations. Under the agreement, Cuba released 53 political prisoners, pledged to loosen Internet controls and agreed to permit enhanced access for the International Red Cross. Cuba also released USAID worker Alan Gross and an unidentified spy who had been imprisoned in Cuba for the last 20 years. The United States released three imprisoned Cuban spies in Florida. Gross was a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development who’d been held since his arrest on Dec. 3, 2009. Cuban authorities charged him with smuggling satellite communications equipment to the country as part of the USAID’s pro-democracy programs. Media outlets have identified the spy as 51-year-old Rolando Sarraff, a former Cuban intelligence agent arrested by the Castro government in November 1995. During the 2008 campaign, Obama sometimes talked about his criteria for normalizing relations with Cuba and lifting the embargo in the same breath, making it appear that his criteria overlapped. During the Democratic presidential primary in 2007, Obama wrote an op-ed for the Miami Herald in which he called for "unrestricted rights'' for Cuban-American travel and remittances to the island. "Accordingly, I will use aggressive and principled diplomacy to send an important message: If a post-Fidel (Castro) government begins opening Cuba to democratic change, the United States (the president working with Congress) is prepared to take steps to normalize relations and ease the embargo that has governed relations between our countries for the last five decades," Obama wrote. When Fidel Castro -- the island nation’s longtime dictator -- resigned in February 2008, Obama said, "If the Cuban leadership begins opening Cuba to meaningful democratic change, the United States must be prepared to begin taking steps to normalize relations and to ease the embargo of the last five decades.'' (When he stepped down, Fidel Castro turned over power to his younger brother, Raul.) A spokeswoman for Diaz-Balart also pointed to a speech Obama gave in Miami in May 2008. "My policy toward Cuba will be guided by one word: 'libertad,' " he said, citing the Spanish word for "freedom." "The road to freedom for all Cubans must begin with justice for Cuba's political prisoners, the right of free speech, a free press, freedom of assembly, and it must lead to elections that are free and fair. That is my commitment." Obama called for a new strategy on Cuba, and held out the possibility of a meeting with Castro "at a time and place of my choosing, but only when we have an opportunity to advance the interests of the United States, and to advance the cause of freedom for the Cuban people." Then Obama turned to the embargo: "I will maintain the embargo. It provides us with the leverage to present the regime with a clear choice: If you take significant steps toward democracy, beginning with the freeing of all political prisoners, we will take steps to begin normalizing relations." We sent Diaz-Balart’s statement to a spokesman for Obama. "I think its fair to report that there was significant progress here (regarding) the political prisoners – they released a large (number of prisoners) that we specifically requested," Eric Schultz said. "The president has always been flexible on specifics (regarding) negotiations and clear there would be some give and take." Schultz pointed to various statements by Obama in which he addressed normalizing relations with Cuba, including an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on May 20, 2008. Blitzer asked Obama about charges leveled against him by his Republican opponent, Arizona Sen. John McCain. McCain had said that Obama wanted to sit down unconditionally for a presidential meeting with Raul Castro. Blitzer asked Obama, "Are you ready to normalize relations with Raul Castro’s regime?" Obama replied: "No. ... I have never said that I was prepared to immediately normalize relations with Cuba." Obama added, "If we could see progress on a whole host of issues, then we should move in the direction of normalization, because what we have done over the last 50 years obviously not has worked for what is the primary criteria of U.S.-Cuban policy, which is making sure that the Cuban people have freedom." As for meeting with Castro, Obama said that "what I have said is I would be willing to meet without preconditions, but with a lot of preparation. And this is the same argument that we've been having with respect to Iran." Obama on embargo in 2004 Just a footnote that’s beyond the scope of Diaz-Balart’s claim: Obama articulated a more conciliatory position on Cuba when he ran for U.S. Senate in 2004 then he did four years later when he sought the White House. "I think it’s time for us to end the embargo in Cuba," Obama said on Jan. 20, 2004, in a speech at Southern Illinois University. "And the Cuban embargo has failed to provide the source of raising standards of living and it has squeezed the innocents in Cuba." The embargo, he said, has "utterly failed in the effort to overthrow Castro, who’s now have been there since I was born. So, it’s time for us to acknowledge that that particular policy has failed." Our ruling Diaz-Balart said that in 2008, Obama had said that normalization with Cuba would first require "liberation of all political prisoners, and some basic steps toward freedom, including freedom of the press, political parties, labor unions." Obama did suggest such a linkage in 2008, though his phrasing was open to some interpretation. And on other occasions during the 2008 campaign, Obama offered a vaguer formulation for how Cuban relations could be normalized. On those other occasions, Obama said that if he saw unspecified steps toward democratic change in Cuba, he might pursue normalized relations with Cuba. Diaz-Balart’s claim glosses over these nuances, so we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Mario Diaz-Balart	None	None	None	2014-12-23T16:21:05	2014-12-18	['Cuba', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-14078	Nevada Democratic Party leaders "hijacked the process on the floor" of the state convention "ignoring the regular procedure and ramming through what they wanted to do."	false	/nevada/statements/2016/may/18/jeff-weaver/allegations-fraud-and-misconduct-nevada-democratic/	Supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are furious over the results of Nevada’s state Democratic Party convention in Las Vegas. Sanders supporters loudly protested both during and after the convention, which saw Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton officially claim 20 pledged delegates to Sanders' 15. Nevada’s delegate allocation process is complex, but Sanders supporters have accused the state Democratic Party of various crimes including ignoring attempts to change the rules, rigging the process in favor of Clinton and disqualifying several dozen delegates that supported Sanders. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver reiterated those concerns during a May 18 interview on CNN with John Vause. "There was a horrendous breakdown, where the leadership there in Nevada hijacked the process on the floor, created a tremendous amount of angst among people who were there attending the convention, who were supporters of Sen. Sanders, by ignoring the regular procedure and ramming through what they wanted to do," he said. There’s little disagreement that the convention was chaotic. PolitiFact Nevada was at the convention and saw it firsthand. But does the Sanders campaign’s complaints have merit? What was at stake Nevada’s presidential caucuses were held back in February, which saw Clinton defeat Sanders by a roughly 5 percent margin among the roughly 80,000 voters who participated. But Nevada’s process of allocating delegates isn’t so cut and dried, as PolitiFact has previously explained. Only 23 of the state’s 43 delegates are officially locked in as a result of the February caucuses. Clinton won 13 of that pool, while Sanders won 10. Another group of eight are so-called "superdelegates," who aren’t bound to any candidate and independently decide who to support. (Five currently support Clinton and one backs Sanders in Nevada.) That leaves 12 delegates technically up for grabs at the state convention in May. That number is made up of five pledged "party leader and elected official" delegates and seven "at-large" delegates awarded proportionally, so whichever campaign has the majority at the state convention "wins" the odd-numbered delegate from those two groups. Barring a total collapse from either campaign, this means that one candidate was to get seven delegates at the state convention and the other was to get five. As PolitiFact wrote in April, the process is supposed to look something like a Matryoshka doll — smaller amounts of delegates at each step of the process, but retaining the same proportions of the initial February caucus. But that model was essentially broken during the April county conventions, where less than half of Clinton’s allocated county delegates showed up, leading Sanders to declare a surprise victory and allocated delegate advantage over Clinton (2,124 to 1,792) heading into the state convention. Convention confusion Tensions were already mounting in the weeks before the convention, with a small group of Sanders supporters filing a lawsuit against the state party (which was dismissed by a Las Vegas judge) and creating a petition demanding the convention rules be changed. The fight over rules had been going on since April, according to an email chain posted by Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston, between Sanders superdelegate Erin Bilbray and party chairwoman Roberta Lange. Supporters of Sanders believed that the convention rules, which have been largely the same since 2008, gave an unfair amount of power to Lange, the convention chair. The rules specifically lay out that all convention votes must be done by voice vote, and that only the convention chair can declare the winner or call for a more specific method of voting among the thousands of delegates. The rules, which can be read here, also state that any amendment attempts must be approved by two-thirds of the convention delegates — which would be difficult given the nearly even number of Clinton and Sanders backers present. Sanders backers say the continuing nature of the presidential primary necessitated more rule changes. The Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for comment. In a previous statement, the campaign detailed several allegations of misconduct from the state party, which we considered as part of this fact-check. "At that convention the Democratic leadership used its power to prevent a fair and transparent process from taking place," the campaign said in that statement. However, there were no last minute rule changes sprung on convention-goers — the rules had been publicly available weeks in advance, largely unchanged for three presidential cycles, and given to both campaigns. The first major fight happened in the morning, with the convention being gaveled in nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled 9 a.m. start time. In a voice vote, Lange approved adoption of a preliminary credentials report showing more Clinton than Sanders delegates. Immediate howls of protests from the Sanders contingent emerged, many of whom rushed the dais and started screaming insults and obscenities directly at Lange. Although several videos from the event appear to have louder "nays" than "yeas," both preliminary and final delegate counts showed that Clinton supporters outnumbered Sanders supporters in the room. And trying to determine the outcome of a voice vote from a video of around 3,000 delegates is somewhat arbitrary to begin with. The only person with authority to call for a different voting mechanism is the convention chair: Lange. Regardless, upset Sanders supporters rushed the main stage, hurling obscenities at Lange and other members of the party’s executive board and booing over remarks from California Sen. Barbara Boxer delivered on behalf of the Clinton campaign. The Sanders campaign later alleged that Lange refused to accept petitions to change the rules, which is inaccurate. In an interview, Lange said the board received a handful of petitions to change the convention rules but not all of them met the requirement to have signatures by 20 percent of convention goers. Lange said the proper procedure for an amendment to the rules would have been during a short period for public comment before the temporary rules were adopted as permanent. None of the three Sanders supporters who spoke, including Nevada superdelegate Erin Bilbray, made any motion to amend the rules during that time, so they were approved as written. Volunteers circulating the petitions changing the rules abandoned their efforts after the permanent rules were adopted, saying they missed their chance to introduce them. Either way, any rule change would require a two-thirds majority vote which would be highly unlikely given the Clinton campaign's public opposition to any rules changes. More controversies erupted after the party’s credentials committee, which consisted of five Clinton and five Sanders backers, released their report showing that Clinton delegates narrowly outnumbered those of Sanders 1,695 to 1,662 — a 33-delegate margin. Again, Nevada’s delegate allocation rules meant that whichever campaign had the majority of delegates at the state convention would win two delegates to the national convention. Minority Report A constant complaint is that the party’s credentials committee unfairly disqualified 64 Sanders delegates — detailed in a "minority report" and read to delegates by a pro-Sanders credentials committee member. Sanders supporters were upset because that number of delegates would have tipped the balance and presumably swung the two national delegates back to Sanders. But there are a lot of misconceptions and misunderstandings associated with the report, which was written and circulated by Sanders campaign staffers. Annette Magnus, an activist and credentials committee member, said the 64-delegate figure stems from a list of delegates submitted by the Clinton campaign of Sanders delegates who weren’t registered as Democrats by May 1, which is required under the rules. Magnus said the committee spent much of Saturday investigating the delegates called into question, and eventually seated six of them. The remaining 58 delegates were rejected because they were either not Democrats by May 1 or the party could not confirm their name or address. "There was not a vetting process at county convention like the state level convention," Magnus said. Importantly, the state party reported only eight of the rejected delegates even showed up to the convention, so even if they had been seated it would not have flipped the majority. "It didn't affect the outcome in any way," Magnus said. Regardless, the switch in two delegates matters little in the contours of the national delegate race. Including superdelegates, Clinton has a commanding 763 delegate lead over Sanders after the May 17 primaries, according to the Associated Press. Clinton currently leads the delegate count in Nevada 25-16, with two superdelegates still undecided. Security concerns With so many questions about the Nevada convention, we wanted to address two other points. Images and videos circulated after the convention was called to a quick close alleging that Lange "illegally" ended the convention despite motions for a recount. Lange — who said she was forced to take a security detail to even go to the bathroom during the convention — said police and Caesars Entertainment hotel officials told her that the convention had to be immediately adjourned due to ongoing security details. Casino spokeswoman Jennifer Forkis said the event ran over its allotted time by about four hours, meaning security hired for the event would soon leave their shifts. "Without adequate security personnel, and in consultation with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and event organizers, a decision was made that it was in the best interest of everyone in attendance to end the event," Forkis said in a statement. Secondly, an ongoing debate has emerged post-convention over questions of violence and allegations of chair-throwing from Sanders supporters. There’s no clear evidence of a chair being thrown, but the post-adjournment attitude was tense with Sanders delegates screaming obscenities and pushing back barriers between the crowd and the main stage. Our ruling Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Nevada Democratic Party leaders "hijacked the process on the floor" of the state convention "ignoring the regular procedure and ramming through what they wanted to do." Caucuses and delegate math can be incredibly confusing, and the arcane party structures don’t reflect how most people assume presidential selection works. But the howls of unfairness and corruption by the Sanders campaign during Nevada’s state Democratic Convention can’t change the simple fact that Clinton’s supporters simply turned out in larger numbers and helped her solidify her delegate lead in Nevada. There’s no clear evidence the state party "hijacked" the process or ignored "regular procedure." We rate this claim False.

pomt-12780	"Most of these mass shootings take place in (areas) where you're not allowed to have a concealed weapons permit."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/feb/21/richard-corcoran/do-most-mass-shootings-happen-gun-free-zones/	In the wake of mass shootings at the Pulse night club in Orlando and at the Fort Lauderdale airport, Florida lawmakers are expected to act on a series of bills to expand where people can carry their guns. The bills would allow concealed-carry permit holders to carry their guns in places such as airports, schools, college campuses, police stations and polling places. Florida leads the nation in conceal-carry permits with more than 1.7 million permits. Republican House Speaker Richard Corcoran supports expanding the list of where permit holders can carry their guns, possibly as a way to avert future attacks. (So does President Donald Trump, who promised to get rid of gun-free zones in schools and military bases.) "Most of these mass shootings take place in arenas where you're not allowed to have a concealed weapons permit," he told CBS4 Miami’s Jim DeFede on Feb. 12. (By "arenas" Corcoran seemed to be referring to places in general, not sports arenas.) Corcoran argued that people who commit mass shootings say they chose certain areas because they "knew nobody had guns." That raises an interesting question, but it’s separate from the focus of this fact-check: whether most mass shootings happen in places where concealed carry permits don’t apply, or "gun-free zones." Corcoran was citing research from a pro-gun advocate who reached that conclusion. But anti-gun advocates have argued that the data isn’t so clear cut; they see other patterns in the statistical evidence. Overall, the evidence remains murky and depends on how researchers define "gun-free" or "mass shooting." Varying definitions of mass shootings Corcoran’s spokesman said he was referring to the numbers of mass public shootings compiled by economist John Lott, president of the pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center. Lott’s research has been quoted by those who support expanding gun rights, but academics often attack his research as flawed. His book More Guns, Less Crime has been a subject of ongoing academic and policy debates as well numerous fact-checks. His book argues that crime data over multiple years shows reductions in crime in states that have "right to carry" laws. But many other academics have said his work doesn’t account for other factors that influence crime rates, and that he manipulates the data to reach his conclusions. The National Academies of Sciences concluded in 2005 that "no link between right-to-carry laws and changes in crime is apparent in the raw data." Before we delve into the numbers compiled by Lott, we will explain why it’s complicated to make sweeping claims of mass shootings in gun-free zones. There is not an agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a mass shooting -- even the federal government has cited various criteria at times. FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer pointed to a 2012 law setting the threshold for a "mass killing" as three or more people killed, but another report by the federal Congressional Research Service says that "mass murder" has been defined generally as a threshold of four or more deaths. Lott points to the types of shootings the FBI included in this study of active shooter situations, but that study clearly says it isn’t covering all mass shootings. Lott said he included mass shootings in which four or more were killed that occurred in public, and he excluded those that occurred within the commission of another crime such as an armed robbery. Lott’s data showed that between 1988 and 2015, about 3.8 percent of mass shootings occurred in areas where guns were allowed. Everytown for Gun Safety found that among 133 mass shootings between January 2009 and July 2015, 70 percent took place in private homes while 13 percent took place in "gun-free zones," where carrying of concealed guns were prohibited. Another 17 percent took place in public areas where the carrying of firearms are allowed. Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, who has disagreed with Lott’s findings, pointed to research by Louis Klarevas, a professor at the University of Massachusetts-Boston. In Klarevas’ book Rampage Nation, he said that Lott has used too loose a concept of gun-free zones. Klarevas disagrees with gun advocates who define a "gun-free zone" as simply an area that bans private citizens from carrying a gun. For example, Lott characterized Fort Hood and Washington Navy Yard, military sites attacked by gunmen, as gun-free despite the presence of armed security. "There’s an obvious logical problem with such a conceptualization: How can a place be a gun-free zone if guns are present?" Klarevas writes. "The implication is that rampage shooters are only deterred by armed civilians, not by armed guards and cops. But that’s an absurd suggestion." Klarevas uses three definitions: he refers to "gun-free zones" as places where civilians are not allowed to carry guns, and there aren’t armed personnel stationed on the property. He calls "gun-restricting zones" as places where civilians can’t carry guns, yet armed security is routinely present -- such as military facilities or certain college campuses. He refers to places that allow civilians to carry guns as "gun-allowing zones." Using these categories, Klarevas examined 111 shootings since 1966 in which six or more people had been killed in each incident -- regardless of whether it occurred in a public or private location or if it was in the commission of another crime. He found 13 took place in gun-free zones and five took place in gun-restricting zones. That means that the majority occurred in areas where there was no evidence that private guns were prohibited. Since Klarevas includes mass shootings in private residences or during the commission of another crime, that means that he counts several additional incidents that aren’t factored in by Lott. For example, as a mass shooting in a "gun-allowing zone," Klarevas counts a gunfight between two rival biker gangs in Waco,Texas, in 2015 that left nine people dead. So that’s an example of a shooting that wasn’t in a gun-free zone that is omitted from Lott’s calculations. The two also disagree on how to characterize whether guns were allowed at certain locations. Lott says that the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon was in a gun-free zone and points to a school policy that bans possession of firearms "except as expressly authorized by law or college regulations." Umpqua Community College spokeswoman Anne Marie Levis previously told PolitiFact Florida the school’s gun-free policy didn’t apply to students with a valid permit. "UCC was never designated as a ‘gun-free zone’ by any signage or policy," she said. "Umpqua Community College does comply with state law by allowing students with concealed carry licenses to bring firearms on campus." Our ruling Corcoran said, "Most of these mass shootings take place in arenas where you're not allowed to have a concealed weapons permit." Corcoran cites research by an advocate for gun rights who used a strict definition to define places where guns were not allowed. In reality, there are places where concealed weapons are permitted, places where police or security officers openly carry weapons, and places where concealed weapons are not permitted. Additionally, there are different ways to define mass shootings. We found that advocates for more gun control analyzed the data and reached different conclusions. Our assessment is that it is difficult to draw broad conclusions about the motivations of the perpetrators of mass shootings or whether they are influenced by gun restrictions. We rate Corcoran’s statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3a9f4fdc-aed8-4f53-9794-18cf41d2bea7	None	Richard Corcoran	None	None	None	2017-02-21T15:13:48	2017-02-12	['None']
pomt-10171	Obama "has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/26/john-mccain/mccain-repeats-questionable-tax-claim/	During the presidential debate, John McCain said Barack Obama voted to raise taxes on the middle class. "He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year," McCain said. "That's not true, John. That's not true," Obama said, interrupting him. "And that's just a fact. Again, you can look it up," McCain said. We looked it up already because it's not the first time McCain has made this statement. To support the claim, the McCain campaign has pointed to two votes Obama made on budget resolutions, one in March 2008 and another in June 2008. Problem is, neither of these votes actually raised taxes, nor were they expected to. Instead, the votes approved budget resolutions, which are blueprints for the federal budget. The resolutions set targets for the committees that write legislation on taxes and spending. Obama joined Democrats on what were largely party-line votes, expressing the desire to roll back the Bush tax cuts in order to fund popular programs. The tax cuts would have been rescinded on people making about $42,000 and higher. The McCain campaign is correct that Obama voted for the measures, which expressed approval for tax increases. But it's inaccurate to suggest votes on nonbinding budget resolutions, which don't have the force of law and don't include precise details on taxes or spending, are the same as votes on legislation that sets policy. The statement also suggests that Obama as president would favor tax increases for incomes of $42,000. He does not. Obama's tax proposals are crafted so that tax increases hit those couples $250,000 or more a year, or $200,000 for singles. He also proposes a $1,000 tax credit on income for working families ($500 for singles). McCain here makes his statement on a vote that would not have directly changed the tax code. We find the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13860	"You know what (Saddam Hussein) did well? He killed terrorists."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/07/donald-trump/was-saddam-hussein-good-killing-terrorists-donald-/	To the surprise of some observers, Donald Trump has recently given a few campaign-trail shout-outs to Saddam Hussein -- a man the United States twice went to war with. Most recently -- though not for the first time -- Trump gave the late Iraqi dictator some credit at a campaign rally in Raleigh, N.C., on July 5, 2016. "Saddam Hussein was a bad guy. Right?" Trump said. "He was a bad guy. Really bad guy. But you know what, he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good they didn't read (them) the rights. They didn't talk. ... Today, Iraq is Harvard for terrorism. You want to be a terrorist? You go to Iraq. It's like Harvard. OK? So sad." This prompted bipartisan criticism, including from Hillary Clinton’s campaign. But Trump proceeded to double down on his statement. Trump largely repeated his message at a rally in Cincinnati on July 6, and said in an interview with the Cincinnati Enquirer the same day, "That’s not praising Saddam Hussein. I would say maybe it’s the opposite. But when it comes to terrorism, I said he did a good job because he killed terrorists." We wondered: Is it accurate for Trump to say that Saddam Hussein "killed terrorists"? Experts told us that Trump has a point -- though one that’s undercut by missing context and questionable relevance. Trump’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry. Who’s a terrorist? Complicating any analysis of Trump’s assertion is the fact that, as we have previously noted, there is no single definition of terrorism. Hussein may have considered some of his domestic opponents terrorists, but not everyone else would agree. Indeed, Hussein could be a ruthless foe of those who threatened his monopoly on power, and many of these would be considered Islamists in opposition to Hussein's historically secular regime. Yet he was not averse to leveraging Islamic terrorists to advance his own ends beyond Iraq’s borders. "Saddam rarely used the term ‘terrorists,’ " said Joseph Sassoon, an associate professor at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and author of Saddam Hussein’s Baath Party: Inside an Authoritarian Regime. "One side can see certain people as freedom fighters while others perceive them as terrorists. A case in point: Palestinian suicide bombers. Israel and the U.S. saw them as terrorists while Saddam' regime gave each suicide bomber's family a large gift of about $50,000." So one weakness with Trump’s claim is that many of the "terrorists" Hussein killed weren’t necessarily killed for their "terrorism," and many would not have been considered "terrorists" by anyone beyond Hussein's own circle. Where Trump has a point That said, perhaps the strongest argument for Trump’s assertion is to compare what went on during Hussein's regime and what has happened afterward. His often brutal clampdowns had the side effect of keeping all types of dissent, including terrorism, in check. Since his ouster, instability has often reigned, allowing violence, including terrorism, to flourish. In fact, ISIS -- perhaps today’s most feared terrorist group -- emerged in the chaos of post-war Iraq when it was known as al-Qaida in Iraq. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, blamed both Bush and Clinton for supporting a war in Iraq that destroyed the country’s governing structures. "They also cast out the Sunni elite and Iraqi military from the top of society down to the bottom of society, eliminating their pensions, jobs and futures. This misguided and destructive action infuriated a large swath of Iraqi society, many of whom joined al-Qaida and became ‘terrorists’ according to the U.S. definition. The U.S. has been trying to kill them ever since." Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, agreed that while Trump’s phrasing was "imprecise," the difference in the prevalence of terrorism before and after the Iraq War is "no comparison." "The Iraq War has been devastating to U.S. interests and an enormous boon to jihadists," Gartenstein-Ross said. "The Iraq War made us less safe." Focusing on the relationship between Hussein and terrorism also offers a useful corrective to the incorrect theory that Hussein had some sort of connection to perpetrating the 9/11 terror attacks, experts said. CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen made this argument in a provocative column headlined, "Trump gets it right on Saddam." Bergen wrote that post-war analysis by the U.S. intelligence community has failed to turn up any significant links between Hussein and al-Qaida, the perpetrator of the 9/11 attacks. "Saddam's government kept meticulous records," Bergen wrote. "The Defense Intelligence Agency had by 2006 translated 34 million pages of documents from Saddam's Iraq and found there was nothing to substantiate a ‘partnership’ between Saddam and al-Qaida." Subsequent analysis of 600,000 additional documents by the Pentagon-affiliated Institute for Defense Analyses similarly concluded that there was no smoking gun, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence also found no "cooperative relationship," Bergen wrote. Where Trump’s argument falters On the other hand, Trump has ignored some crucial context in making a sweeping assertion about Hussein's rule. Here are some of the problems. • Hussein actively sponsored terrorism, as well. Indeed, Iraq was on the official U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism between 1979 and 1982, and then again between 1990 and 2004, when Hussein ruled the country. "He did kill some terrorists, but he supported others, such as Abu Nidal and the MEK cultists from Iran," said John Limbert, a former high-ranking State Department official who now teaches international relations at the U.S. Naval Academy. In the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard, editor Stephen F. Hayes offered a lengthy recap of Hussein's terrorist connections in a piece titled, "Trump Is Clueless on Saddam and Terror." "Saddam Hussein opposed terrorists who opposed him," Hayes wrote. "He supported and funded virtually all others—including jihadists who targeted the United States, its interests, and allies." According to Hayes’ account, Hussein supported the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood in the early 1980s; aided the escape and offered refuge to Abdul Rahman Yasin, a conspirator in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center; and supported a suicide-bomber plot to assassinate former President George H.W. Bush during a visit to Kuwait. Hayes, like Bergen, cites the 2008 Institute for Defense Analyses study, but he focused on a broader definition of terrorist activities, rather than just the 9/11 link. Hayes wrote that the report concluded, "Evidence shows that Saddam's use of terrorist tactics and his support for terrorist groups remained strong up until the collapse of the regime." • How Hussein handled "terrorists" represents a small part of his legacy. Focusing on how Hussein handled terrorists overlooks a much bigger issue -- his massive violations of Iraqis’ human rights. On the eve of the Iraq War in 2003, the New York Times reported that "accounts collected by Western human rights groups from Iraqi émigrés and defectors have suggested that the number of those who have ‘disappeared' into the hands of the secret police, never to be heard from again, could be 200,000." And that doesn’t include an even larger number believed to have been killed during the Iran-Iraq War and the Persian Gulf War. "He didn't just kill terrorists," Limbert said. "He gassed and otherwise murdered Kurds, Shia, and anyone else he didn't like." • Hussein's model of handling isn’t a viable option for the United States. Put simply, the United States is a democratic nation with a constitution, not an authoritarian dictatorship. Indeed, some have criticized the Obama administration for a lack of due process in drone strikes on terrorists overseas -- a far more limited action than the kind of mass killings Hussein oversaw. "Reasonable people can differ on whether Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism constituted a threat great enough to go to war in an attempt to eliminate it," Hayes concluded in his article. "But no reasonable person can cite Saddam Hussein as a model for an approach to handling jihadist terror." Gartenstein-Ross agreed that any discussion of Hussein's methods of controlling terrorism are, at most, academic rather than practical. "I absolutely do not find Saddam’s methods of dealing with terrorism applicable to the United States," he said. "Extreme repression like that is a self-defeating strategy." Our ruling Trump said Saddam Hussein "did well. He killed terrorists." Trump has a point in saying that Hussein's Iraq was free of the widespread Islamic terrorism that flourishes there now. On the other hand, Hussein's opposition to terrorism sprung largely from a desire to eliminate opponents to his rule; by contrast, he was willing to support terrorism as long as it advanced his interests beyond Iraq’s borders. And it’s not as if Hussein's methods offer a helpful model for a democracy like the United States.

pomt-15041	Student loans from the federal government issued between 2007 and 2012 are on target "to produce $66 billion in profits for the United States government."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/01/elizabeth-warren/uncle-sam-track-make-66-billion-profit-6-years-stu/	Campaigning for U.S. Senate candidate Russ Feingold, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- who has been talked up as a potential vice-presidential candidate -- hammered on an issue that she, Hillary Clinton and other national Democrats have seized on: Student loans. During her Sept. 26, 2015 speech at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, given with a group of students arrayed behind her, Warren cited an oft-repeated statistic about the $1 trillion in outstanding student loan debt. Then she suggested that the federal government is an exploitative lender. "Right now, the United States government charges an interest rate on student loans that covers the administrative costs, covers the bad-debt losses, covers the cost of funds and then -- on top of all that -- makes a profit for the government," Warren said. "How much profit? Well, let me just give you a little slice of the loans, where we've got particularly good data. The loans that were put out between 2007 and 2012 -- that cohort of loans -- is on target right now to produce $66 billion in profits for the United States government." Warren went on to say that the government has already spent the "profits." As we’ll see, there’s an odd anomaly at work here. In making the $66 billion profit claim, Warren relies on one gold-standard source -- the federal Government Accountability Office. But another gold-standard source -- the Congressional Budget Office -- says the accounting method used to produce that figure is flawed. Indeed, when the CBO has employed both the official method (which was mandated by Congress) and its own preferred accounting method, any projection of "profit" for the government from student loans turns into a loss. That’s because CBO’s preferred method of projecting takes into account more of the risks assumed by the government, such as defaults during hard economic times. How student loans work To help students attend college, as a 2012 PolitiFact item reported, the federal government in 1965 took three important steps: Guaranteeing student loans against default; promising a certain interest rate to the banks (even if the rates students paid were lower); and paying additional fees to banks for administration and collection of student loans. The result: Millions of Americans earned college degrees. But the system required billions of dollars in federal subsidies and produced lucrative revenue streams for banks. Some in Washington, especially Democrats, sought alternatives. In 2010, a law essentially eliminated the middle man -- the banks. The federal subsidies to the banks were replaced with direct loans administered by the Department of Education and funded through the U.S. Treasury. The Huffington Post has reported that the government is forecast to generate billions in profits from making student loans. And Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has said the government has turned student lending into a "profit center." But it’s not so clear cut. Warren's evidence To back Warren's claim, her Senate office referred us to a January 2014 report from the Government Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress that examines matters relating to the receipt and payment of public funds. It estimated that the $454 billion in student loans the government disbursed from 2007 to 2012 will generate about $66 billion in "subsidy income" -- or what Warren calls profit. So, Warren cites a figure from a respected source. But as we said, the figure uses an accounting method that the Congressional Budget Office has called into question. Other views The Washington Post Fact Checker detailed some of this in examining a similar claim, when Warren said the federal government made $51 billion from student loans just in 2013. Her statement earned two Pinocchios -- the Post’s rating for a statement that contains significant omissions or exaggerations. As The Fact Checker noted, that projection was made using the mandated accounting method, which potentially underestimates the cost of the loans to the American taxpayer. The Congressional Budget Office’s preferred accounting method -- known as fair value -- essentially assesses the risk as private firms would if they made the same types of loans. We found that the CBO has pointed out the shortcomings of mandated method. In fact, it has argued for using fair value, saying it better takes into account the risks of lending to students. (Some organizations, such as the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, have argued that fair value makes federal credit programs such as student loans appear more expensive than their actual cost to the government.) There is quite a difference, depending on which accounting method is used. In a May 2014 report, the Congressional Budget Office did student loan projections for 2015 through 2024. During that 10-year period, using the official accounting method that Warren relied on in making her claim, the loans are expected to generate a "profit" of $135 billion. But using the "fair value" accounting method CBO prefers, the projection is an $88 billion loss to the government. That’s a swing of $223 billion. Our rating Warren said student loans issued by the federal government between 2007 and 2012 are on target "to produce $66 billion in profits" for the government. Warren accurately cites an estimate from a Government Accountability Office report -- but that estimate was made with an accounting method that the Congressional Budget Office says is misleading. As the CBO has pointed out in another report, using that accounting method, student loans are projected to generate $135 billion in "profit" from 2015 to 2024 -- but using the CBO’s preferred accounting method, they are projected to produce an $88 billion loss. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True. More on student loans Russ Feingold says U.S. Senate opponent Ron Johnson "is opposed to all government-assisted student loans." Mostly True. Hillary Clinton says Scott Walker rejected legislation to make college loan payments tax deductible and the result was "to raise taxes on students." False.

pomt-03515	U.S. Rep. John Barrow’s plan "puts the IRS in charge of your health care."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/jun/04/national-republican-congressional-committee/gop-group-targets-barrows-health-care-votes/	U.S. Rep. John Barrow, a Democrat from the Augusta area, keeps arguing he agrees with many Republicans regarding the federal health care law, aka "Obamacare." Repeal and replace, he says. Is there a doctor around to examine Barrow? Republican activists ask. Republicans overwhelmingly want the entire law repealed, polls show. Barrow’s position is not strong enough, some GOP activists say. The National Republican Congressional Committee recently announced it was paying for mobile billboards to drive through Barrow’s district to criticize what it says is his approach to health care. "Congressman Barrow’s Plan: Put the IRS in charge of your health care," the ad says. The ad includes a telephone number for anyone "fed up" with his plan. The ad quickly made the rounds on several political news sites, including The Atlanta Journal Constitution’s Political Insider blog. PolitiFact Georgia recently fact-checked a somewhat similar claim by the National Republican Senatorial Committee against Barrow and rated it Mostly False. We wanted to find out if the NRCC accurately reflected Barrow’s stance on this issue. NRCC spokeswoman Katie Prill said the billboard was based on Barrow’s votes against repealing the health care law. "The IRS is in charge of implementing Obamacare," Prill said in one email. The IRS, under fire for its role in scrutinizing some tea party groups and others, is in charge of determining whether individuals have insurance and collecting fines. The Washington Post Fact Checker column recently examined this issue and determined the NRCC claim deserved two Pinocchios, which means there were significant exaggerations or omissions. Other federal agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, are also involved in implementation of the law. Health and Human Services has taken the lead in organizing its implementation, providing information to the public about the law and providing oversight. Barrow, who fashions himself as a moderate, is consistently one of the top Republican targets during election season. He’s the last white Democrat serving in the U.S. House from the Deep South. The five-term congressman has thus far successfully avoided GOP efforts to oust him. Barrow’s camp says the claim is specious for several reasons. First, they note the congressman voted in 2010 against the legislation to create the contentious health care law. Second, his office says Barrow’s approach to the law is similar to that of many Republicans. He wants to repeal some of the most controversial aspects of the law and keep some elements of it. Barrow wants to remove: The Independent Payment Advisory Board, which is designed to examine quality and access to care under the law, the effects of changes in payments to providers. The individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance or face a tax penalty. An employer mandate that businesses with more than 50 full-time employees offer health care coverage to their employees or pay a penalty of $2,000 per worker above 30 employees. The congressman wants to keep the provision that allows children to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they’re 26 years old. Third, and most pertinent to the NRCC’s claim, Barrow voted against legislation in April 2011 that would fund as many as 16,500 IRS employees House Republicans said were needed to implement the health care law. "Further proof that the NRCC is twisting the facts and exaggerating to make their claims," said Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo. Prill pointed out that Barrow voted three times against repealing the law, most recently in May 2013 in a 229-195 vote. Every House Republican voted to repeal the law while only two Democrats voted in favor of repeal. The Democratic-led U.S. Senate has not supported repeal. Barrow’s votes on portions of the health care law have been across the spectrum. "There are a lot of good things in the bill. I don’t believe in voting against the parts that are good. ... We need to amend it, not end it," Barrow said after his vote in January 2011 to retain the law. Prill said Barrow’s position is insufficient. "At the end of the day, John Barrow had the opportunity to repeal this law and he chose not to. Whether it was political pressure from (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi or because he truly believes in this law, he made the decision to keep Obamacare in place and for it on Georgia families. It seems like if John Barrow really wanted to fix our health care system, he would have voted for repeal." To sum up, the NRCC says in its mobile billboard that Barrow’s health care plan "puts the IRS in charge of your health care." Barrow didn’t vote to create the federal health care law. However, the NRCC points out that Barrow’s voted three times against repealing Obamacare, which they say is allowing the law to be implemented. Barrow supports repealing some of the most contentious parts of the law. Barrow’s camp says what’s most important in this debate is the congressman voted against legislation that would fund additional IRS agents to implement the health care law. The billboards, they say, are disingenuous. It’s not really his plan. The IRS will be involved in the implementation of the law, but so, too, will other federal agencies. We believe the billboards omit some important context. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05862	"Preventive care … saves money, for families, for businesses, for government, for everybody."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/10/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-preventive-care-saves-money/	It’s been a staple of health care politics for years -- the claim that preventive care saves money. A little money up front, lots of money saved on the back end. Patients living longer and healthier lives. That makes sense, right? But while there’s little doubt that preventive care saves lives, the money is a different story. In general, academic studies do not support the idea that paying for preventive care ultimately saves money. We first published that conclusion in 2009, when we rated True a claim by New York Times columnist David Brooks that preventive care does not save the government money. When President Barack Obama claimed it did save money in a September 2009 speech to Congress, we rated it False. On Feb. 10, 2012, Obama revived this line of argument. His comments came during a media briefing to announce a partial reversal of a policy that would require church-affiliated organizations such as hospitals to provide a package of free preventive coverage, including contraception. Catholic groups criticized the policy -- which was set in motion by Obama’s health care law in 2010 -- on the grounds that it conflicted with churches’ religious beliefs. In announcing a partial shift of policy, Obama said, "As part of the health care reform law that I signed last year, all insurance plans are required to cover preventive care at no cost. That means free check-ups, free mammograms, immunizations and other basic services. We fought for this because it saves lives and it saves money –- for families, for businesses, for government, for everybody. That’s because it’s a lot cheaper to prevent an illness than to treat one." However, as we wrote in 2009, it’s not true that preventive care generally "saves money." Brooks' critique relied on estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. "The evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall," CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in an Aug. 7, 2009, letter to Rep. Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate. Elmendorf explained that while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests adds up: "But when analyzing the effects of preventive care on total spending for health care, it is important to recognize that doctors do not know beforehand which patients are going to develop costly illnesses. To avert one case of acute illness, it is usually necessary to provide preventive care to many patients, most of whom would not have suffered that illness anyway. ... Preventive care can have the largest benefits relative to costs when it is targeted at people who are most likely to suffer from a particular medical problem; however, such targeting can be difficult because preventive services are generally provided to patients who have the potential to contract a given disease but have not yet shown symptoms of having it." In fact, a government policy to encourage prevention could end up paying for services that people are already receiving, including breast and colon cancer screenings and vaccines, Elmendorf said. Other studies backed up the CBO's analysis, including a Feb. 14, 2008, article in the New England Journal of Medicine that was written in response to campaign promises for more preventive care. "Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention ... are overreaching," according to the paper. "Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs." They write that "the vast majority" of preventive health measures that were "reviewed in the health economics literature do not" save money. "Some preventive measures save money, while others do not, although they may still be worthwhile because they confer substantial health benefits relative to their cost," the authors write. "In contrast, some preventive measures are expensive given the health benefits they confer. In general, whether a particular preventive measure represents good value or poor value depends on factors such as the population targeted, with measures targeting higher-risk populations typically being the most efficient." Meanwhile, a separate study conducted by researchers from the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that, while interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease would prevent many strokes and deaths, "as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention activities will substantially increase costs." To make sure that the data hadn’t changed dramatically since we last looked at this issue, we contacted Peter J. Neumann, director of the Center for the Evaluation of Value and Risk in Health at the Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies at Tufts Medical Center. He was one of the three co-authors of the New England Journal of Medicine article. He said the patterns his group found in 2008 have not shifted dramatically since then. "Sometimes preventive measures save money, sometimes not," Neumann said. "The general message is that it depends." Milton C. Weinstein, one of Neumann's co-authors, agreed. "In general, the comparative effectiveness literature supports the general proposition that preventive care does not save money," said Weinstein, a professor of health policy and management at the Harvard School of Public Health. Our ruling As a general notion, the idea that "preventive care … saves money, for families, for businesses, for government, for everybody" is no more true today than it was in 2009. Yes, preventive measures often save lives and keep patients healthier. Certain preventive measures may save money as well. But the findings of CBO and physicians who have studied the medical literature indicate that Obama’s sweeping generalization that preventive services save money is not accurate.

pomt-00984	One Texas city "has a law that says that women can only have six dildos."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/feb/09/alcee-hastings/florida-democrat-texas-law-says-women-dildos/	U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., messed with Texas when he bashed the state during a congressional hearing on Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare. At a Feb. 2 House Rules Committee hearing, lawmakers were discussing Texas’ decision not to participate in state health care exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. At one point, Hastings said, "I don't know about in your state, which I think is a crazy state to begin with, and I mean that just as I said it." U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, a Texas Republican, decried Hastings’ comment as "defamatory." "I wouldn’t live there for all the tea in China, and that’s how I feel," Hastings said. Hastings refused to apologize, vowing that Burgess would have to "wait until hell freezes over" to get an apology. (The spat later drew national attention when The Daily Show with Jon Stewart parodied the "Southern Slam.") Then, on Feb. 5, CNN posted an article quoting Hastings, and the fur flew again. "One of their cities has a law that says that women can only have six dildos, and the certain size of things. And if that ain't crazy, I don't know what is," Hastings said. In this article, we will fact-check Hastings' claim that a Texas city has a law about dildos and their sizes. We contacted a spokeswoman for Hastings but did not get a reply. Texas law struck down In the 1970s, Texas banned the promotion of "obscene devices," defined as items "designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs." Such devices include, but are not limited to, "a dildo or artificial vagina." Part of the statute said, "A person who possesses six or more obscene devices or identical or similar obscene articles is presumed to possess them with intent to promote the same." Being presumed to promote sex toys is not necessarily the same as barring people from owning six or more of these devices. It seems clear the goal of the statute was to ban the sale of these devices, while Hastings’ claim suggested that Texas cops would go after individuals who owned a lot of dildos. In 1985, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that the statute did not violate an individual's right to privacy, concluding that there was no constitutional right to "stimulate another's genitals with an object designed or marketed as useful primarily for that purpose." Violating the law carried a punishment of up to two years in jail. But in 2004, stores that wanted to sell such devices sued to overturn the law, and in 2008 a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court of Appeals’ Fifth Circuit struck down the Texas law, concluding that it violated the 14th Amendment to privacy. "Whatever one might think or believe about the use of these devices, government interference with their personal and private use violates the Constitution," the court ruled, noting that Mississippi, Virginia and Alabama had similar statutes at the time. Courts have struck down nearly identical laws in Louisiana, Kansas, Colorado and Georgia. The court relied on another famous Texas case, Lawrence v. Texas, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the state’s anti-sodomy law was unconstitutional. After the ruling, then-Attorney General (and now governor) Greg Abbott asked for another hearing by the full appeals court. But the request was denied, and that court informed Abbott that he would have to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which he decided not to do. The Austin American-Statesman reported at the time that the law was rarely enforced, though in 2003 a Texas woman was arrested for selling erotic toys at a Tupperware-type party. The charges were later dropped. Jennifer Kinsley, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs, is now a law professor at Northern Kentucky University. She told PolitiFact that she wasn’t aware of any cities that had adopted obscene devices legislation. "In fact, I think those types of laws at the municipal level would be pre-empted by the state statute, which as you found has been declared unconstitutional," she said. "I do know that retailers throughout Texas sell more than six sexual devices now." We should note a separate case stemming from the 2004 sale of a vibrator by a store in Corpus Christi, Texas. In July 2008, a state appeals court affirmed a lower-court ruling that upheld a guilty verdict in a case involving the state dildo ban as well as a municipal ordinance prohibiting the operation of a sexually oriented business without a permit. Legal experts say that technically, federal rulings are not directly binding on state courts, but plaintiffs would be assured of relief if they pursued their case in federal court. Our ruling Hastings said that one Texas city "has a law that says that women can only have six dildos." There's a law, now invalid, along those lines — though it was intended to prevent the sale of such devices, not the ownership of them. In addition, it was a statewide law, not a city law, and more importantly, it was struck down by a federal appeals court more than six years ago. Hastings’ office did not provide supporting evidence for an existing city law that sets a dildo limit. There’s some obscurity because the law is still on the books. But experts told us that, as a practical matter, the law has no teeth, and stores today in Texas can, and do, sell more than six dildos. We’ll reconsider our ruling if additional information comes to light, but for now, we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7774d4b2-29c4-4558-ab83-8805021bcc8c	None	Alcee Hastings	None	None	None	2015-02-09T16:02:17	2015-02-05	['None']
pomt-01940	The wages of about 60,562 state and local government employees would be affected if the minimum wage is increased to $10.10 in Georgia, for a combined cost to taxpayers of more than $164 million annually.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/25/georgia-restaurant-association-georgia/benefits-minimum-wage-increase-debated/	In his 2013 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama called on Congress to raise the national minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $9 an hour. By executive order, he has since set $10.10 an hour as the standard for individuals working on new federal service contracts. The issue took off in legislatures across the country this year, with some familiar arguments. Supporters say a higher base wage will stimulate the economy. Critics says jobs will be lost when employers can’t offset their higher costs with higher prices. Thirty-eight state legislatures considered minimum-wage bills this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In Georgia, Senate Bill 314 called for raising Georgia’s minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, but it didn’t get so much as a hearing. Last week, the Georgia Restaurant Association released study results forecasting a potential loss of 21,000 jobs, 12,700 held by women, if the federal minimum wage goes to $10.10 an hour. The study, conducted by Trinity University labor economist David Macpherson, also found that about 60,562 state and local government employees in Georgia would be in line for raises, with a $10.10 hourly minimum wage. The cost to taxpayers would be more than $164 million annually, benefits included. PolitiFact scribes decided to look deeper into the study’s findings on the impact to the wallets of government workers -- and taxpayers. A bit of background. Georgia’s minimum wage is technically $5.15 an hour (Georgia Code 34-4-3) and has been that since 2001. But the vast majority of Georgia employers (some say more than 99 percent) must comply with the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which means they have to pay their employees the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Although the president initially wanted Congress to increase the hourly minimum wage to $9, he has since aligned with leading Senate Democrats who are pushing for a $10.10 hourly minimum and getting pushback from the GOP-controlled House. (A 40-hour-a-week employee making $10.10 an hour grosses about $21,000 a year.) The independent Congressional Budget Office analyzed two options: 1). raising the minimum wage to $10.10 in three steps -- in 2014, 2015 and 2016. After reaching $10.10 in 2016, the minimum wage would be adjusted annually for inflation as measured by the consumer price index. 2). a $9 hourly minimum wage done in two steps -- in 2015 and 2016. After the minimum reaches $9 in 2016, there would not be any subsequent increases for inflation. Among the CBO’s major findings was that a minimum wage increase to $10.10 an hour could lift 900,000 workers out of poverty. (By the second half of 2016, about 16.5 million people would be earning higher average weekly wages if the $10.10 minimum wage were implemented, CBO estimates show.) But it also could cost 500,000 jobs. The White House and congressional Democrats -- who have been trying to make a federal minimum-wage increase a top issue in this year’s elections -- took issue with the CBO report (which relied on 60 different empirical studies to formulate its estimates.) Others, including Macpherson, consider it spot on. We reached out to Macpherson, the author of the Georgia Restaurant Association’s study, to find out how he came up with his conclusions. He said he used data from the U.S. Census Bureau on government employees and followed the CBO’s methodology. Specifically, he looked at the wages paid to state and local government workers in Georgia in 2011, 2012 and 2013. He found that 60,562 -- or 10.4 percent of about 550,000 state and local government workers in Georgia -- were making below $10.10 an hour and would likely still be making under $10.10 an hour by 2015. His calculations of the costs to governments -- and hence taxpayers -- of raising the workers’ pay to $10.10 an hour took into account other expenses, including higher Social Security, Medicare, workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance, he said. (In salaries alone, it would cost $150.8 million annually, the study found.) Most of the government workers would likely keep their jobs, unlike in the private sector, where businesses have "the profit incentive," Macpherson said. Governments, he said, have alternatives, including raising taxes. "Raising wages is an admirable goal, but the evidence suggests that accomplishing this goal with a blunt wage mandate could do more harm than good," the study says. It also notes, however, that "to the extent that state or local governments reduce hours or employment in response to the minimum wage hike, (the study’s) estimate of the cost of the hike would be overstated." We know the study’s cost are off at least slightly. That’s because Macpherson’s study counted all local and state government workers in Georgia, including city of Atlanta employees who, as of this year, are making at least within 10 cents of the proposed $10.10 minimum wage. The Atlanta City Council last year agreed with Mayor Kasim Reed’s 2014 budget recommendation that, among other things, raised all employees’ salaries to a minimum of $10 per hour. Macpherson said he didn’t think Atlanta’s numbers would change his overall cost projections by much. But he said that would depend on how many Atlanta city workers were affected by the wage change, a detail PolitiFact could not immediately determine. State Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, a co-sponsor of this year’s minimum-wage legislation, said the move by Atlanta officials may help make the case that raising the minimum wage isn’t a major financial burden. "I don’t have any reason to believe it created a hardship of any sort for the city," Fort said. David Cooper, an economic analyst with the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, said raising the minimum wage to $10.10 might have a spillover effect on the salaries of about 90,000 state and local government workers, given that adjustments might have to be made to the salaries of their supervisors, as well. Cooper also questioned whether Macpherson’s cost projections might be too high. About 900,000 Georgians of all walks would receive salary increases if the minimum wage were increased to $10.10, for a collective $1.3 billion in new wages, he said. That would generate about $136.5 million in new tax revenue and could be enough to reduce some government benefits these workers currently can receive, Cooper said. "It’s probably budget neutral, if not budget positive," he said. Wesley Tharpe, a tax and economic policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said the economic research is clear. "Minimum-wage increases have a negligible effect on employment but are a proven means to boost family incomes and lift people out of poverty," Tharpe said. In summary, the researchers took the same basic approach as the CBO to try to gauge the potential impact of moving to a $10.10 minimum wage for state and local government workers. But it’s hard to say for sure what the cost to taxpayers might be. To do that, you would have to consider, among other things, the potential savings when some of these workers no longer receive food stamps, heating assistance or other taxpayer-funded poverty programs. We also know the projections are at least somewhat off because Atlanta workers already work for $10 an hour at minimum. And no one can forecast how local governments would respond -- they could cut jobs to fund a wage increase. There is some truth to the statement. But a lot of context is missing. That’s PolitiFact’s definition of Half True.	None	Georgia Restaurant Association	None	None	None	2014-06-25T00:00:00	2014-06-25	['Georgia_(U.S._state)']

pomt-06341	Says Mitt Romney "is committed to overturning Roe vs. Wade, and he supports such amendments that define a life as beginning at the moment of conception."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/08/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-mitt-romney-supports/	In a Nov. 3, 2011, conference call with reporters, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla. -- the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee -- took aim at Mitt Romney, the frontrunner in the Republican presidential primary. In the 11-minute conference call, Wasserman Schultz focused on Romney’s stance on abortion -- particularly on the notion that "personhood" begins at fertilization. The issue was in the news because of a ballot measure being considered by Mississippi voters on Nov. 8, 2011. The measure -- which, if passed, would be the first of its kind adopted in the nation -- asks, "Should the term 'person' be defined to include every human being from the moment of fertilization, cloning, or the equivalent thereof?" Supporters of abortion rights say the measure, if passed, would threaten not only abortion but also in vitro fertilization and some forms of contraception that act by preventing an already fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus, thus causing a miscarriage. Experts say the Mississippi measure conflicts with the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in the United States. In Roe, Justice Harry Blackmun wrote for the majority that if the "suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment." For this reason, the Mississippi measure could provoke a reconsideration of the landmark -- and controversial -- decision. After noting the Mississippi measure and similar proposals circulating in other states, including her home state of Florida, Wasserman Schultz said, "We’re seeing this support for this dangerous approach from top leaders in the Republican Party, including Republican front-runner Mitt Romney.... Now Romney is committed to overturning Roe vs. Wade, and he supports such amendments that define a life as beginning at the moment of conception." We have already addressed the question of whether Romney changed his position on abortion -- we concluded rival candidate Jon Huntsman’s charge that Romney changed his stance on abortion was True. In this item, we’re only looking at Romney’s position as it stands today. We didn’t hear back from the DNC, but we were able to collect a couple of statements that seem relevant to analyzing Wasserman Schultz’s comment. • The Huckabee interview. In an Oct. 2, 2011, interview with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee -- a onetime Republican presidential candidate who now hosts a talk show on Fox News -- Huckabee asked Romney, "Would you have supported the constitutional amendment that would have established the definition of life at conception?" Romney answered, "Absolutely." According to a slightly longer excerpt of the conversation provided to PolitiFact by the campaign, it's unclear whether Huckabee and Romney are referring to a state constitutional amendment or a federal one. • The Iowa town hall meeting. On Oct. 20, 2011, Romney held a town hall meeting at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa. One audience member asked him, "You were on Gov. Huckabee's show a few weeks ago, and one of the things that you folks talked about was that you would support a life-begins-at-conception amendment. Now, that would essentially mean banning most forms of birth control. Ninety-eight percent of American women, including me, use birth control. So could you help me understand why you oppose the use of birth control?" Romney answered, "Life begins at conception. Birth control prevents conception. My own view is this, and let me … clarify my view so that you understand that. What I believe is the right course with regards to abortion and life is that I would like to see the Supreme Court return this right to the states and let states create their own legislation with regards to life. That's my view. And states will make different decisions, which is their right to do so. And my view is I'm not out campaigning for an amendment of some kind. I am campaigning to see justices ultimately appointed to the Supreme Court that will follow the Constitution (and) return to the states the right to make this decision themselves." The exchange prompted a lengthy report on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show and gained traction on liberal blogs. • What the Romney campaign says. In both a Nov. 3, 2011, New York Times blog post and a statement released to PolitiFact, the Romney campaign did not address his stance on personhood measures specifically. But the campaign told us that "Mitt Romney is pro-life, and as he has said previously, he is supportive of efforts to ensure recognition that life begins at conception. He believes these matters should be left up to states to decide." We see two questions here: First, do these comments support Wasserman Schultz's contention that Romney "is committed to overturning Roe vs. Wade"? And second, do these comments support Wasserman Schultz's claim that Romney "supports such amendments that define a life as beginning at the moment of conception"? The answer to the first question is pretty straightforward. The experts on bioethics and constitutional law whom we contacted agreed that Romney’s position -- that he "would like to see the Supreme Court return this right to the states and let states create their own legislation with regards to life" -- equated to seeing Roe vs. Wade overturned. "If the states are free to define what a ‘person’ is under the Constitution, then one state might say that an embryo or fetus is a person, and another state could say only born infants are persons," said Paul A. Lombardo, a law professor at Georgia State University. "That would certainly negate Roe vs. Wade." The second question is more complicated. We see at least two complicating issues. First, the wording of personhood measures varies and may continue to do so if the movement expands across the country. While Wasserman Schultz referred to the Mississippi measure and the potential Florida measure earlier in the call, her statement here is structured more broadly. We interpret it to mean that Romney supports personhood measures generally. "Romney may support some forms of personhood amendments but not others" that are worded differently, said I. Glenn Cohen, a Harvard Law School professor and co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics. Second, experts say there is a difference -- a subtle, but potentially important one -- between Romney’s stated view and what the Mississippi measure says. "Strictly speaking, what Romney says supports Wasserman-Schultz's claim," Christopher Tollefsen, a philosophy professor at the University of South Carolina and author of the 2008 book, Embryo: A Defense of Human Life. "The wiggle room is that the Mississippi amendment goes beyond the claim that ‘life begins at conception’ to the claim that ‘personhood begins at conception.’ Romney might agree with the first and disagree with the second and not support the Mississippi amendment for that reason." Tollefsen explained that "to say that something is a ‘person’ is to say that it has a particular kind of moral status -- the sort of thing you can't kill and that deserves the protection of the law. Some philosophers, such as Peter Singer, think that the embryo, or fetus, is a human being, but is not a ‘person’ -- that although it is a human being, it can still be killed, until it reaches, say, consciousness, or the ability to feel pain." Tollefsen added that this would be "in some tension with Romney’s claim about the sanctity of life. If you think that ‘sanctity of life’ means you can't kill any human being and that the embryo is a human being, then effectively you do think that the embryo is a ‘person’ in the relevant sense." Romney could also take the position that he opposes the amendment on pragmatic grounds. "He could object to the Mississippi amendment as being on a collision course with the Supreme Court in a context in which Mississippi was bound to lose," Tollefsen said. "A lot of pro-lifers object to it for precisely this reason." (Tollefson added that this explanation would disappear if Huckabee was asking about an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.) Cohen agrees that Romney has some "wiggle room" on the issue. "Romney says he believes life begins at conception, but he does not say the state should necessarily legislate to that effect," Cohen said. "He could say he believes this as a moral, personal or religious matter, but not in terms of what individual states have the right to do, in part because of views about women or others' autonomy." Our ruling Wasserman Schultz’s claim that Mitt Romney "is committed to overturning Roe vs. Wade" is well supported by his comments at the town hall, and Romney laid the groundwork for supporting personhood measures in his Huckabee interview. We think, however, that Wasserman Schultz makes too much of a blanket statement about his views on personhood measures. Our experts tell us that it’s possible for a politician who said what Romney has to oppose some personhood measures based on their wording. On balance, we rate Wasserman Schultz’s statement Mostly True.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2011-11-08T17:43:01	2011-11-03	['None']

pomt-02218	"Did you know US population growth is at its lowest since the Great Depression?"	true	/virginia/statements/2014/apr/21/robert-sarvis/robert-sarvis-says-us-population-growing-slowest-r/	Robert Sarvis, a Libertarian candidate for the U.S. Senate, wants to open the nation’s borders. "Did you know US population growth is at its lowest since the Great Depression?" he tweeted on April 1. "RT if you support liberalizing our immigration laws." "RT," if you’re wondering, means retweet. That cleared up, we didn’t know that the nation’s population growth had reached an 80-year low. So we decided to look at data from Sarvis’ primary source: the U.S. Census Bureau. We found mid-year population estimates dating back to 1900. The lowest point was from mid 1917 to mid 1918, when the U.S. began sending troops to Europe for World War I and the nation’s population actually decreased by 60,000, or 0.06 percent. That’s the only time since the start of the last century when the number of people decreased. Save that year, population growth hovered between 1 and 2 percent until 1931 when, in the teeth of the Great Depression, it dropped to 0.78 percent. It bottomed at 0.59 percent during the 12-month period beginning in July 1933. U.S. Population growth did not climb above 0.8 percent until mid 1939. From there U.S. population growth increased gradually through the ‘40s, peaking at 2.05 percent in 1950, and staying above 1 percent until 1973. It generally hovered at slightly below 1 percent through 2009. In 2010, as the nation was slowly emerging from recession, the growth rate plummeted to 0.84 percent, followed by 0.72 in 2011, 0.74 in 2012 and 0.72 in 2013. Indeed, the last four years mark the four lowest points of population growth since the Great Depression. And the growth rates of 2011 and 2013 are at the bottom of the time span. William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institute, says U.S. population growth is closely tied to the economy. During bad times, couples delay having children. In 2012, only 12.6 percent of U.S. women aged 15-44 had children, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s the lowest birth rate in records dating back to 1940. Women in that age group had 3.95 million babies in 2012, a drop of 368,000 births from five years earlier. Immigration has slowed since the start of this century, but has been rebounding in recent years. In 2001, there was a net increase of nearly 1.2 million immigrants in the U.S. and that dropped to 726,000 in 2009. Last year, there was a net increase of 843,000 foreigners. Our ruling Sarvis said the U.S. population growth is at its lowest level since the Great Depression. The figures back him up and we rate his statement True.

pomt-03165	On support for Ted Cruz	half flip	/texas/statements/2013/sep/06/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-who-accused-ted-cruz-not-getting-facts/	In June 2012, conservative Dan Patrick of Houston charged Ted Cruz with airing mistruths in his U.S. Senate bid against Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. Patrick, a Republican state senator, subsequently said he would vote for Dewhurst in the Dewhurst-Cruz primary runoff. Patrick, now challenging Dewhurst and others for his party’s 2014 lieutenant governor nomination, recently complimented Cruz by describing him as Reaganesque. In an Aug. 20, 2013, Texas Tribune interview, Patrick also said he would support Cruz for president should he seek that office. Has Patrick flip-flopped on Cruz? Chris Elam, spokesman for Republican Jerry Patterson’s lieutenant governor campaign, suggested as much. Elam was quoted Aug. 30, 2013, on the Dallas Morning News Trailblazers blog as calling Patrick’s recent ardor for Cruz "a complete 180″ from Patrick’s criticisms of Cruz when the pair traded shots on a radio talk show June 28, 2012. "Today he equates Cruz with Reagan?" Elam said. "A year ago, he sounded very different." By telephone, Patrick told us that much changed between the described moments. "The fact is, this time last year, Ted was not yet a proven commodity on the political stage," Patrick said. "He had not held office." Patrick also said: "At that time, I thought" Dewhurst "was more qualified." Cruz, a former state solicitor general who hadn’t previously run for office, upset Dewhurst for the Republican Senate nomination, before going on to win the general election. Patrick told us he was among Republicans who wholeheartedly supported Cruz once he was the nominee. Patrick and Cruz repeatedly clashed on the June 2012 radio program noted by Patterson’s camp. For instance, Patrick objected to Cruz’s descriptions of state Senate actions related to spending and unsuccessful measures related to so-called sanctuary cities and in-state college tuition for the children of illegal immigrants. According to a recording of the show posted online by commentator Scott Braddock, Patrick said several times Cruz was not getting his facts straight, including one exchange that started with Cruz saying Patrick had already endorsed Dewhurst in the Senate primary runoff. "Time out, Ted," Patrick replied. "That’s a lie… You’re just flat-out wrong." Patrick went on to say he planned to vote for one of the two. Cruz also said Patrick was asking questions planted by Dewhurst’s campaign. "That’s just not true," Patrick replied. After Cruz said a study indicated some Texas Senate Democrats had more success than conservative Republicans in passing proposals on Dewhurst’s watch, Patrick said the cited researcher didn’t understand the legislative process "and I am beginning to think you don’t." Then again, Patrick also said positive things about Cruz, calling him a good orator and a fighter. "Both of you are good people," Patrick said in reference to Cruz and Dewhurst. On July 26, 2012, Patrick said in a Facebook post that he was voting for Dewhurst: "He is well qualified based on the job he has done in Texas helping us pass the most conservative legislative package in the nation, limiting spending, and creating the best economy in the country," Patrick wrote. Patrick also wrote: "Cruz is a bright and talented lawyer who is also a fiery orator. I respect those who see it differently. I'm not going to be critical of Cruz. He may well win and if he does we will rally around him in November." By phone, Patrick recently called Cruz the Republicans’ best communicator since President Ronald Reagan. He told us that as a senator, Cruz "has walked the talk. He has taken on the establishment. Our party needed this kick in the pants." Patrick also suggested his aired support of Cruz for president is distinct from his declared vote for Dewhurst in the 2012 primary runoff. "You’re dealing with three different races--U.S. Senate, lieutenant governor and president," Patrick said. Our ruling Patrick sparred with Cruz in June 2012--even deeming one Cruz claim a lie--and later revealed he was voting for another Republican for the Senate seat that Cruz later won. But Patrick also praised Cruz at the time as an orator and a fighter. Some 14 months later, Patrick saluted Cruz as a communicator, going so far as to invoke Reagan, while saying he would support him for president should he run. Patrick said this reflects his judgment of Cruz as a stick-to-his-guns officeholder. Our sense is it's incorrect to say Patrick has suddenly boarded the U.S.S. Cruz. Still, we see a substantive gap between accusing someone of lying and otherwise mangling facts and then committing to their possible presidential candidacy.

pomt-06770	China is or soon will be "the largest English-speaking nation" in the world.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/19/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-says-more-english-speakers-china-unit/	Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. undoubtedly knows more about China than any other presidential candidate. After all, the 51-year-old Republican served as President Barack Obama’s first U.S. ambassador to China before returning in the spring to run for president. He's also been deputy assistant secretary of commerce for Asia, U.S. Ambassador to Singapore and deputy U.S. trade representative. He speaks Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese Hokkien. His ties to the region date back to 1979, when he lived in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary, and he first visited mainland China three decades ago. In a July 26, 2011, appearance at Dartmouth College, Huntsman made a surprising claim about China during a question-and-answer session following his speech. When an audience member who had recently traveled to China asked Huntsman for his thoughts about the "huge imbalance" between the millions of Chinese studying English and the far fewer number of U.S. students studying Chinese, Huntsman replied: "Would you like the answer in Chinese or English? It’s interesting to note that the largest English-speaking nation today, or soon to be, is China." Huntsman went on to say he had visited Chinese universities "and I always found that they were keenly interested in English, in our political system, in our economic system, in trying to figure out what makes America so unique. In order to crack that code, they had to master English. So you found lot of students who were very, very interested in learning English." The same enthusiasm, he asserted, was also evident in Chinese high schools and middle schools. Yo, it’s painful enough that our blenders are made in China, but could this mean that even our slang is soon to be imported from Guangzhou? For Huntsman’s statement to be accurate, China, with a population of more than 1.3 billion, would need roughly 300 million English speakers to best the United States, which has the third-largest population in the world. That’s because most, though by no means all, U.S. residents (population 309 million in the 2010 Census) speak English. Then there’s India, a former British colony with a population of 1.2 billion, second only to China. The most popular language in India is Hindi, spoken by 41 percent of the population, and there are 14 other official languages, ranging from Bengali to Sanskrit, according to the CIA Factbook. English is a "subsidiary official language" in India "but is the most important language for national, political, and commercial communication," the Factbook reported. Asked for substantiation of China’s mega-English status, Huntsman’s New Hampshire spokesman, Michael Levoff, cited a a 2011 "English Proficiency Index" from EF, or Education First, a company that offers language training in more than 50 countries. "Indeed, although it is very difficult to measure the number of people who speak English in each country because of different definitions of proficiency, the British Council estimated in 2010 that India had anywhere between 55 and 350 million English speakers while a report published by Cambridge University Press estimates that China has 250 to 350 million English learners," the EF English Proficiency Index stated. "It appears that China is poised to surpass India in the number of English speakers in the coming years, if it has not already done so." But academic experts who follow the globalization of English said the issue of proficiency cannot be ignored. It’s one thing to be an "English learner," another to be a skilled "English speaker." Put another way, plenty of Americans took four years of high school Spanish and were "learners" at the time, not "speakers." Now they visit Cancun and can barely remember, "¿Dónde está el baño?" ("Where is the bathroom?") David Crystal, an honorary professor of linguistics at the University of Wales-Bangor, and author of The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language, said by e-mail that he believes "India is still ahead of China at present," and that Huntsman’s use of "or soon to be" is "the operative phrase." Equally important, Crystal said statistics about both countries are "very much guesswork" and he noted that both India and China are cited as "low proficiency" countries in the EF Index. "On the whole, proficiency in India is greater than in China, and English teaching measures are more solid. So I’d be distinctly suspicious of claims being made about China," Crystal wrote. Indeed, a 2006 Cambridge University Press paper by Jian Yang of Seattle University, "Learners and Users of English in China," concluded that China had a "huge English-knowing population of 200-350 million," but that most were not "proficient bilingual users of the language." But, as Huntsman said, interest in English is growing fast in China, and five years is a long time in that context. Victor Mair, a professor of Chinese language and literature at University of Pennsylvania, said by e-mail that English "is widely used" by Chinese companies, that many radio and TV programs are presented in English, and that "the craze for learning English is palpable." A 2009 forum sponsored by the British Council reported that there are approximately 50,000 English language training institutes in China, and that People’s Daily in 2008 said there are about 300 million "consumers" of English language training in China, mainly between the ages of 20 and 40, with another 350 million children of school age offering a huge potential for further growth. But again, those are learners, not necessarily speakers. Mair said he agreed with Crystal about the quality of English in India as opposed to China, but also said there is credence to Huntsman’s claim. "Countless Indians speak the most beautiful English you can imagine, but there are few Chinese who do so," said Mair, who estimates that each country now has around 350 million English speakers. English translations in China are sometimes so notorious that they’ve come to be known as "Chinglish." One often-cited sign meant to say "Be Careful Not to Slip and Fall," but it reads, "Slip and Fall Down Carefully." Mair, who writes about such translations on UPenn’s Language Log blog, recently posted about a Chinese airline’s sign that meant to say "Please wait behind the one meter line" but read "Wait outside rice-flour noodle." So are the Chinese about to eat our lunch when it comes to our native tongue? Would most Chinese with some knowledge of English really understand that last sentence? There is some truth to Huntsman's underlying point that there is tremendous growth in English proficiency in China. But it's important to note there is a significant difference between English learners and speakers. The statistics and our interviews with experts indicate China is still far away from having the largest number of speakers. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-08460	"Joe Garcia raised utility rates on families."	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/14/david-rivera/david-rivera-wrong-Joe-Garcia-utility-rates/	In a 33-second video called "One of Them," Republican state Rep. David Rivera launches several attacks against his South Florida Congressional district rival Joe Garcia. The claims accuse Garcia of defending Nancy Pelosi's "reckless spending and debt" and of being a "Washington insider." In the ad, average Joe-like actors take turns weighing in on Garcia's alleged political shortcomings and transgressions: A narrator spells out the gloom and doom as Average Joes -- you know, taxpayers -- pipe in. "Washington insider Joe Garcia doesn't get it. He defends Pelosi's reckless spending and debt. 'Our children will pay the price.'(Average Jane) Joe allowed tax dollars to be used to send our jobs overseas. 'That's outrageous.' (Average Joe). Joe Garcia raised utility rates on families. 'He lied to us.' (Average Joe) And Joe Garcia takes money from Washington's culture of corruption. 'He's one of them.' (Average Jane) 'Haven't we been through enough?' (Average Jane, as Average Joe beside her shakes his head.) We were curious about Rivera's claims, and decided to focus on the one that, gasp, targets not just Florida taxpayers but Florida families! "Joe Garcia raised utility rates on families." As evidence of Garcia's alleged utility-rate hike, the Rivera campaign points to a matter that came before the Florida Public Service Commission in February 1997. Garcia served on the commission from August 1994 to June 2000. The background: Florida Power Corp. at the time served 1.3 million customers in 32 counties in north, west and central Florida. The power company had the highest rates among the state's four largest utilities then, and it had been placed on the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's "watch list," which included 14 of the country's most troubled facilities. It was also under investigation by the Public Service Commission. Among Florida Power's facilities was the Crystal River nuclear plant, and that plant had shut down in September 1996. By February 1997 it was still not producing power, and it wasn't expected to resume production until later that year. What Rivera claims is that on Feb. 18, 1997, Garcia approved a rate hike for Florida Power that amounted to $88 million. The rate hike was to allow the company to recover costs associated with the long shutdown of the Crystal River plant. As evidence, the campaign cited a PSC "vote sheet" signed by Garcia and stamped "approved." Wading through PSC records in current cases isn't easy, and a case more than 13 years old can be a bureaucratic labyrinth. What we found is that Rivera's justification for the claim mixes up two meetings, leading to a faulty conclusion. Here's what happened: On Feb. 18, 1997, the PSC voted on an accounting issue that was discussed at a hearing in 1996. Garcia was there and voted in favor of the staff recommendation. That's why his name is on the vote sheet. But that vote didn't involve a rate hike. The next day, Feb. 19, the PSC met again -- but the transcript of that meeting shows Garcia was not there. The commission voted again, but technically the vote was to approve a fuel charge for Florida Power, not on a rate hike. When utilities spend more on fuel than they had budgeted to provide power, they can petition to pass that extra fuel cost on to their customers. With Crystal River shut down, Florida Power had additional costs it wanted to pass on, and the PSC approved asking customers to pay the difference. That charge was described in the St. Petersburg Times as $88 million. Again: Two different meetings, two different votes, two different issues. We went back to the Rivera campaign. Spokeswoman Leslie Veiga again cited Garcia's vote on Feb. 18, 1997 -- a vote that, we know now, had nothing to do with raising utility rates. The Rivera campaign's insistence in sticking to the ad is surprising, because painting Garcia as a rate hiker is contrary to his image. For example, a Miami Herald editorial on Aug. 23, 2000, after Garcia had left the PSC, described him as "committed to consumer protection, yet admirably even-handed." Another on June 10, 2000, called him "the consumer-friendly head of the PSC." In his time as PSC chairman, Garcia supported bringing "merchant plants" into Florida, plants that were not regulated by the state but allowed to sell their power wholesale to other utilities. The state's utilities opposed the move. The St. Petersburg Times said on April 21, 2000: "Garcia had lobbied heavily in favor of merchant plants, much to the dismay of the utilities he regulates. He argued that merchant plants would bring more robust competition to the wholesale market, which in turn would lower electricity prices for consumers and businesses. Moreover, the investment in such plants was being borne by the companies, not ratepayers." In fact, Garcia's efforts were so strenuous that on April 5, 2000, Sen. Jack Latvala, R-Palm Harbor, stormed out of a hearing to blast Garcia for siding with the merchant plants, The Palm Beach Post reported. The move ultimately was rejected by a Florida Supreme Court decision that the PSC lacked the legislative authority to approve the plants. To wrap it up, then, the Rivera claim is wildly off the mark -- on two counts. First, the evidence Rivera offers that Garcia "raised utility rates" is for a different vote on an accounting issue. Second, the next-day vote (the one Garcia missed) to pass on fuel cost to customers wasn't a rate hike -- though we acknowledge that to customers, it surely felt like one since the monthly bill went up. The ad is plainly not accurate given Garcia's consumer-friendly stands. In fact, it reminds us of the statement made by Average Joe in the Rivera ad ("he lied to us"). So we rate the claim False.

pomt-00454	"President Trump continues to disrespect patriotic transgender Americans who want to serve their country."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/20/tammy-baldwin/lgbtq-advocates-back-sen-baldwins-statement-trump-/	Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the first openly gay person to the serve in the Senate, has been a champion of LGBTQ rights. At a June 2018 Human Rights Campaign event, Baldwin gave a speech in which she praised volunteers on the front lines of the "fight for equality" and also aimed a couple barbs at the Donald Trump administration. On August 17, 2018, PolitiFact Wisconsin did a fact check on the first barb: The Trump administration "has banned the CDC even using the word ‘transgender,’" Baldwin told the crowd, which booed in response. The statement was based on a Washington Post report. But that story was later countered by several other published reports that indicated the words were not banned. Rather, it was suggested that other words be used in some cases — in part to temper controversy during the budget process. We rated the claim False. See that claim here. Now, PolitiFact Wisconsin turns its attention to the second part of Baldwin’s claim: "President Trump continues to disrespect patriotic transgender Americans who want to serve their country." Evidence When asked to back up Baldwin’s claim, campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt directed PolitiFact Wisconsin to news reports of nationwide demonstrations that erupted following the proposed transgender ban. Background Trump, citing concern over military focus and medical costs, announced on Twitter in June 2017 that he would ban transgender individuals from serving "in any capacity" in the U.S. military. The president tweeted the following: After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you. The action was aimed at reversing an Obama administration decision to begin allowing transgender troops to serve openly in the U.S. armed forces. Several groups filed lawsuits against the ban, including Lambda Legal and OutServe-SLDN in Seattle, according to The Hill. "A federal court in Seattle thwarted an administration request for a stay of an earlier injunction that halted the ban while a government appeal is heard," the report said. On July 18, 2018, The Hill reported that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld a block on the implementation of the ban, which was first announced by President Donald Trump in 2017. "The court's move enables transgender people to continue enlisting in the military until the opposing parties go to trial, expected in April 2019," The Hill stated. On August 6, 2018, Reuters reported that a U.S. court ruled the Trump administration could not enforce an updated policy barring certain transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, becoming the second court in the country to rule against the government since it unveiled the policy. "A federal court in Seattle thwarted an administration request for a stay of an earlier injunction that halted the ban while a government appeal is heard," the report said. Gerald Coon, president & CEO of Diverse & Resilient, a Wisconsin organization working to end violence against LGBTQ+ people, commented on the position of military leaders. "All four military service chiefs have gone on record to state that there is no harm in having transgender personnel serving in the military," Coon said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. "Efforts to disqualify transgender people from serving in the military do not improve our national security." Peter Renn, Lambda Legal western regional office senior attorney, supported Baldwin’s claim. "Yes, Senator Baldwin’s statement is correct," Renn said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. "The Trump administration has been unrelenting in its crusade to ban qualified transgender people from serving our country, but every federal judge to consider the ban has halted the administration’s efforts at every turn, finding that the ban unconstitutionally targets a minority group for discrimination." Tom Warnke, media relations director of Lambda Legal, confirmed that the organization filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration. Lambda Legal is a nonprofit legal organization: "Lambda Legal is the oldest and largest national legal organization whose mission is to achieve full recognition of the civil rights of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender people and everyone living with HIV through impact litigation, education and public policy work," according to its mission statement. Our rating Tammy Baldwin told a Human Rights group that "President Trump continues to disrespect patriotic transgender Americans who want to serve their country." There are ample reports that the administration is continuing its attempts to bar transgender individuals from the military, including updating and adjusting its policy as court rulings roll in. Having said that, it’s important to note that the issue is still winding its way through the courts, so a ban is not in place at this time. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-04435	Under Maggie Hassan's leadership, "we increased state spending in the middle of the great recession by 24 percent leading up to and following it."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/12/ovide-lamontagne/republican-lamontagne-paints-opponent-hassan-tax-a/	A central strategy of Republican candidate for governor Ovide Lamontagne's campaign has been labeling Democratic rival Maggie Hassan as a liberal spender of epic proportion. It's a strategy that’s proven successful before. In 2010, Hassan, the state Senate’s top Democrat, was swept from office during a political landslide that gave control of the Senate and House back to Republicans who painted their Democratic rivals as tax-and spend liberals. "If you look at state spending, the truth is under Maggie's leadership we increased state spending in the middle of the great recession by 24 percent leading up to and following it,'' Lamontagne said in the midst of his 90-minute debate with Hassan at Rivier University in Nashua late last month. PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to check the accuracy of that statement. Hassan was elected to the state Senate in 2004 and spent six years in office. She became a chief budget writer in 2007-2008 and was Senate Majority leader in 2009-2010. The great recession peaked between 2007 and 2009, which covers her time in office. Democrats controlled the Senate during those years and she played a critical role in state budget decisions. We checked with the Lamontage campaign and they backed up their 24 percent spending claim by pointing to state budgets signed into law before the two-year budget cycle even begins, not what was actually spent. In Fiscal Year 2006 and 2007, when Republicans were last in charge of the Legislature, the total budget they passed was $9.3 billion. The budget for the following 2 years was $9.7 billion. Meanwhile, the two year budget for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, the second under Sen. Hassan’s leadership, was $11.5 billion, which is in fact a 24 percent increase from four years earlier. "Those numbers don't lie," said Lamontagne Communications Director Tom Cronin. However, those numbers aren’t the state’s actual spending. The sitting legislature can make budgetary changes along the way, so the two-year approved budget isn’t the same as what gets spent. "Every appropriated budget doesn't mirror what gets spent and it can change in either direction, less gets spent in some bienniums, more has to get spent in others,'' said Legislative Budget Assistant Jeff Pattison. "The appropriated budget is an important statement because it does represent what the Legislature had intended to spend. But it's never the final picture.'' For example, the budget agreed to for 2010-11 that Hassan helped craft called for $11.5 billion in spending, but the state’s independent auditors confirmed what actually spent was $10.7 billion during that time. State spending is typically measured two different ways: One way is to include total spending, which includes federal grants. The other way is measure spending from state taxes and fees, which lawmakers have greater control over. Put another way, the state of New Hampshire plans to spend $10.4 billion over the next two years, which includes federal funds, but only 26 percent of that, $2.6 billion, comes from state taxes and fees. Lets look at the numbers: Using the total spending figures from all sources in the state budget for the 12-month period that ended on June 30 of that year, according to the state’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for FY2011, spending did go up while Hassan was in office, but not by as much as Lamontage says. Fiscal 2006: $4.4 billion Fiscal 2007: $4.5 billion Fiscal 2008: $4.8 billion Fiscal 2009: $4.9 billion Fiscal 2010: $5.4 billion Fiscal 2011: $5.3 billion So, total state spending over the years Hassan was in the Senate went up 20 percent, not 24 percent. Now, looking at spending from state sources that budget writers have more control over presents an even leaner spending picture. Here are the amounts actually spent from state taxes and fees in the state budget for the 12-month period that ended on June 30 of that year. (It should be noted that in 2010 and 2011, $180 million to operate the state-owned liquor stores and to support local school construction costs was removed from the state's books. For the purpose of testing the accuracy of Lamontagne's statement and comparing spending over those years, we added that money back in.) Fiscal 2006: $1.35 billion Fiscal 2007: $1.39 billion Fiscal 2008: $1.51 billion Fiscal 2009: $1.44 billion Fiscal 2010: $1.38 billion* Fiscal 2011: $1.33 billion* These numbers reveal spending from state revenue sources actually went down slightly during Hassan’s time in office. Steve Norton, executive director of the non-partisan New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies, said lawmakers often make tweaks to the budget, but the depth of the recession required Governor John Lynch and Democrats controlling the Legislature to make deep spending cuts. In the fall of 2009 and spring of 2010, Lynch and Democratic legislative leaders adopted two rounds of spending cuts totaling more than $233 million. These included freezes on hiring, out-of-state travel and purchasing, laying off nearly 200 state workers, restructuring state debt, closing some programs and making the university system return $25 million in state aid. Another maneuver was removing the State Liquor Commission off state spending books putting its $90 million budget in an independent enterprise account. Another $90 million was saved by issuing state-backed bonds rather than paying cash to cover the state costs for local school construction projects. Hassan cites these cuts on the campaign trail, saying she helped decrease spending during her final two years in the legislature when she was majority leader. However, she is using the numbers from state taxes and fees, not total spending. "There is no support for the notion that we overspent. In fact we were the first Legislature to actually cut state spending in decades of legislative control under Republicans,'' Hassan claimed at the first debate the two had at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics last week. The Hassan campaign pointed to the state's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report that concluded state spending declined by 8 percent -- from $2.95 billion for the two-year 2008-09 period, down to $2.7 billion in 2010-11. Again, these figures look at strictly state spending and leave out the federal numbers. While Hassan is correct spending did go down in that second, two-year cycle when compared to the first two years she helped write the budget, but adding back in the $180 million for the liquor stores and school construction, the decrease is more like a 2.2 percent from the previous two years, not 8 percent. Our ruling In trying to paint his challenger as a big spender, Lamontagne pointed to four years of state budgets when Hassan was in the Senate. While the proposed budgets show a 24 percent increase from all sources, total spending went up by 20 percent, which is slightly less. And looking at the money state budget writers have the most control over -- funds spent from state taxes and fees -- spending actually went down a hair, since the Democrats twice reopened the budget to make cuts. Based on this analysis, we find the claim of state spending having gone up 24 percent to be Half True.	None	Ovide Lamontagne	None	None	None	2012-10-12T18:01:16	2012-09-27	['None']

pomt-04595	The national debt of $16 trillion, is "enough to buy both the Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds 1,918 times."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/21/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-national-debt-enough-buy-indians-/	"A billion here, a billion there," goes a quip about federal spending that's often attributed to the late Sen. Everett Dirksen, "and pretty soon you're talking real money." Pretty soon, or eventually, you're talking trillions -- which is what the national debt reached in the 1980s, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. On Sept. 4, 2012, the accumulated debt topped $16 trillion. Looking to put perspective on the size of what he called "a dangerous milestone," Sen. Rob Portman released a list of things the money could do. For example, he said, it's "enough to buy both the Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds 1,918 times." As fans of baseball, as well as fact checking, PolitiFact Ohio decided to see if Portman’s quip was fair or foul. We checked with his staff, and they referred us to Forbes, which is famous for its money-related lists. Among them is its compilation of Major League Baseball team values. We dug in. The Indians were ranked 26th of the 30 teams -- below Toronto and above Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Tampa Bay and Oakland -- with a value of $410 million. The Reds were ranked 24th, with a current value of $424 million. At the top end, by the way, were the Yankees at $1.8 billion, followed by the Dodgers at $1.4 billion and the Red Sox at $1 billion. With pencil and paper in hand, we checked the math. With a combined value of $834 million, by our calculation, the Tribe and the Reds could be bought 19,184 times for $16 trillion -- 10 times more than Portman’s release claimed. Unless, of course, the Dolan family and Bob Castellini, owners of the Indians and the Reds, respectively, held out for more. While we were at it, we wondered how football would rate, because Forbes also compiled a list of NFL team values. They ranked the Cleveland Browns 21st of the 32 franchises at $987 million, which Forbes called "the present value of the transaction" in which Jimmy Haslam is buying the team from Randy Lerner for $1.05 billion. The Cincinnati Bengals were 26th, at $871 million. Sixteen trillion would cover the $1.858 billion combined price of the Browns and Bengals 8,611 times. With that, let’s check the score. Portman’s staff readily acknowledged their their baseball calculation error when we pointed out the lowball estimate. Somewhere in the proccess they dropped a zero. (For the record, 16 trillion has 12 zeroes, which was more than our pocket calculator could handle.) But Portman's point was that $16 trillion is a whopping amount of money, and on that count he is accurate Whether it matches the value of the two baseball franchises 1,918 times or 19,184 times, it’s still a whopping amount of money. Correcting the math error only makes that point more forcefully. Another way to look at it is he was correct in saying that you could, theoretically, buy the Indians and the Reds 1,980 times with $16 trillion -- but you'd still have $14.3 trillion left to play with. That’s additional information that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly True.

Bruce Rauner tours the state seeking support for changes he wants before he’ll sign a budget, he frequently says Illinois has the highest property taxes nationwide. He uses the claim to try to build support for a property tax freeze, something he wants before he’ll sign a state budget. Illinois now has gone 22 months without one.

No doubt, Illinois property taxes are high. But we were curious where the differences in rates were coming from, and whether or not one was more accurate than the rest. So we reached out to CoreLogic, WalletHub and the Tax Foundation to ask about their methodologies.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;strong&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Let&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;rsquo;s start with CoreLogic&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/strong&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;To calculate their property tax rates, CoreLogic responded that they first collected the annual tax amount for every property in the state. The market value of each property was information already contained in their databases. To calculate the tax rate, it was then just a matter of dividing the annual property tax by the fair market value of every property, To arrive at a state-level property tax rate, CoreLogic used the median tax rate, or the middle value in the range of rates they had collected.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;strong&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Wallethub used a slightly different approach&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/strong&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;WalletHub used 2015 data from the U.S. Census Bureau to calculate their property tax rates. Using reported values for annual property taxes and property value, WalletHub used these numbers to find the median property tax amount and the median home value in each state. Dividing the two, Wallethub arrived at its figures for each state&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;rsquo;s property tax rate.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;strong&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;The Tax Foundation also used Census data&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/strong&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;However, whereas WalletHub used the median home value and tax rate, the Tax Foundation used the average property tax rate.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;That explains one reason why Illinois property tax rates may be different. Although the median, or middle value, is often close to the average value, the two numbers are not necessarily the same. This could easily result in differences large enough to shift a few states in national rankings.&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Another reason for differences may be the source of the initial data. The Tax Foundation and WalletHub used 2015 values obtained by the Census Bureau to calculate property tax rates.

Are Illinois property taxes really the highest in the country? Different sources say different things Illinois’ property tax rankings vary depending upon where you look. The Tax Foundation, an independent, nonpartisan think tank, ranked Illinois third in the nation in property tax burden. Popular personal finance sites like WalletHub placed Illinois property taxes as second highest in the nation, with New Jersey claiming the top spot. In fact, we could only find one source that ranked Illinois first in property tax burden. CoreLogic, a California-based corporation that provides various private and public clients with analytics on a variety of property and finance questions, ranked Illinois as the state with the highest property taxes. Looking at these three sources, Illinois was ranked first, second and third across the nation in property tax burden (with rates of 2.67 percent, 2.3 percent, and 1.98 percent, respectively). No doubt, Illinois property taxes are high. But we were curious where the differences in rates were coming from, and whether or not one was more accurate than the rest. So we reached out to CoreLogic, WalletHub and the Tax Foundation to ask about their methodologies. Let’s start with CoreLogic To calculate their property tax rates, CoreLogic responded that they first collected the annual tax amount for every property in the state. The market value of each property was information already contained in their databases. To calculate the tax rate, it was then just a matter of dividing the annual property tax by the fair market value of every property, To arrive at a state-level property tax rate, CoreLogic used the median tax rate, or the middle value in the range of rates they had collected. Wallethub used a slightly different approach WalletHub used 2015 data from the U.S. Census Bureau to calculate their property tax rates. Using reported values for annual property taxes and property value, WalletHub used these numbers to find the median property tax amount and the median home value in each state. Dividing the two, Wallethub arrived at its figures for each state’s property tax rate. The Tax Foundation also used Census data However, whereas WalletHub used the median home value and tax rate, the Tax Foundation used the average property tax rate. That explains one reason why Illinois property tax rates may be different. Although the median, or middle value, is often close to the average value, the two numbers are not necessarily the same. This could easily result in differences large enough to shift a few states in national rankings. Another reason for differences may be the the source of the initial data. The Tax Foundation and WalletHub used 2015 values obtained by the Census Bureau to calculate property tax rates. CoreLogic, however, depended on data in their internal servers to do those calculations. Although likely similar, it is plausible that there was enough variation to cause a difference in results. Although individual approaches may have varied, the final results differ only slightly: Illinois consistently ranked in the top three for highest property taxes in the nation. Our ruling Rauner tweeted, "Our families have the highest property taxes in the country." Using information from CoreLogic, WalletHub and the Tax Foundation, we found Illinois was ranked first, second, and third in highest property taxes, respectively. Reaching out to each of these sources, it appears that different methodologies and possible variations in original data may have accounted for the slight difference in final property tax rates. However, whichever metric you use, Illinois has one of the highest property tax rankings in the nation. Therefore, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-05812	"[W]hen adjusted for cost of living, Georgia ranks first nationally in teacher salary and benefits."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/22/jan-jones/ga-head-class-teacher-compensation/	There’s apparently one major lesson that Georgia teachers should be sharing with their students. You can do better as a public school teacher here than any other state in America, says one influential state lawmaker. "[W]hen adjusted for cost of living, Georgia ranks first nationally in teacher salary and benefits," said Rep. Jan Jones, a Republican from north Fulton County who is also House speaker pro tem. Jones’ comments were posted on The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Get Schooled blog. Many readers were surprised by her claim. Some said this was a case for the Truth-O-Meter. Jones used a February 2009 study by the John Locke Foundation, a Raleigh, N.C.-based think tank that supports limited government, to help back up her claim. She also did some research on her own, looking at states that had higher average salaries and determining that there were other factors -- such as differences in cost of living -- to conclude that Georgia teachers lead the nation in total compensation. "I couldn’t find any factors that led me to believe that anyone had jumped ahead of us," she said. The John Locke Foundation report focused on teacher compensation in the foundation’s home state, North Carolina. Although Georgia ranked 17th in average salaries, the Peach State finished first in overall annual compensation. How did the foundation reach that conclusion? It used a formula that included the National Education Association’s average salaries ($53,270 for Georgia) in 2008, pension contribution rates and a cost-of-living formula to measure compensation. They concluded that the average Georgia teacher’s annual compensation was $72,393. The average years of experience for Georgia of 12.9 was slightly below the national average of 14.6. Interestingly, the difference between average salary and total compensation was higher for Georgia than any other state, at $19,123. The percentage difference between average salary and total compensation for Georgia was 35.9 percent. The only other state with a higher percentage difference was Arkansas, at 36.7 percent. Tax dollars contributed to Georgia teacher pension plans were 9.28 percent in 2009, which the Locke Foundation used to calculate Georgia’s pension contribution. The national average was 10.16 percent, Locke reported. The Georgia contribution rose to 9.74 percent in 2010, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Georgia’s cost-of-living index was 0.909, which was lower than every state except Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Georgia had the same cost-of-living index as Texas. Much of the research we found shows Georgia ranks in the lower half of the nation when it comes to cost of living. In late 2011, Georgia had the 16th lowest cost of living in the nation, according to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center. Jeff Humphreys, director of the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth, looked at the Locke Foundation’s study and thought the general approach it used to measure cost of living was "reasonable." Humphreys noted the study used ACCRA, a well-known index that measures cost of living in the nation’s larger cities and metropolitan areas. The foundation apparently used the cost of living of each city in a state to calculate the entire state’s cost-of-living index. The company that runs ACCRA told PolitiFact Georgia it does not measure cost of living for the entire state. In general, though, Humphreys said salaries are based on simple supply and demand. "To get enough teachers to move into those states, they have to pay more," Humphreys said. "It’s really market economics at its best." We found no research that considered other factors such as pensions and cost of living to calculate teacher compensation. According to one website, www.teachersalaryinfo.com, Georgia was behind 18 other states and Washington, D.C., in teacher pay in 2009, the most recent year available. The average salary was $51,050. Another website, Teacher Portal, ranked Georgia third behind Illinois and Delaware in its "salary comfort index." It used a number of sources to come up with the average salary figure, but noted "[f]inding accurate beginning and average salaries for teachers by state is a tricky business." The conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation did its own research on teacher salaries in 2011, but it did not include a state-by-state comparison. A senior policy analyst there, Jason Richwine, suggested other factors such as health insurance, life/disability insurance, retiree health care, and paid leave need to be included in any such comparisons. Tim Callahan, spokesman for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators, dismissed Jones’ claim. He argued that many Georgia teachers have had furlough days, had their salaries frozen and faced other cuts that Jones did not consider. "That doesn’t pass the laugh test," Callahan said of Jones’ claim. Jones, who said she became interested in the subject from her time as vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee, countered that teachers in several other states have similar financial circumstances. "I’m comfortable with my conclusions," the lawmaker said. As we mentioned, there is little research on total teacher compensation nationally. The independent experts we spoke to looked at the Locke study and found its methodology was sound, but they found some areas to quibble about. We also wonder about the cost-of-living calculation used since ACCRA doesn’t measure it for the entire state. The statement is based in some solid methodology, but we believe there are too many variables to consider and not enough research in order to make a true apples-to-apples comparison here. Under our rating system, that’s a Half True.	None	Jan Jones	None	None	None	2012-02-22T06:00:00	2012-02-06	['None']

pomt-09734	The Baucus health care bill "could be used to ban guns in home self-defense."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/20/gun-owners-america/gun-rights-group-says-health-care-bill-could-harm-/	The Gun Owners of America has recently taken aim at an unlikely subject: health care reform. In the last few weeks, GOA has sent out several action alerts to members criticizing the health care reform bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee last week. The bill, authored by Finance Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., was supported by all of the committee's Democrats, as well as Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine. It will now be merged with another Senate health care bill and go to the full Senate. On Oct. 9, 2009, the day before the Finance Committee began voting on amendments to the Baucus bill, GOA sent an alert to members titled, "ObamaCare Could be Used to Ban Guns in Home Self-Defense." The conservative group speculated about the impact of the health care bill on gun owners, hypothesizing that, in a bid to control spiraling health care costs, the administration will target people who have "excessively dangerous" behaviors that officials believe raise the cost of health care. The group warned that gun ownership — particularly keeping "a loaded firearm for self-defense" — is likely to be high on that list. The memo accuses Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius — who would have significant influence over any new health care policy — of having a "well-established antipathy to the Second Amendment" because she vetoed concealed-carry gun legislation when she was governor of Kansas. The Obama administration is so antigun, the group contends, that "it is even possible that the Obama-prescribed policy could preclude reimbursement of any kind in a household which keeps a loaded firearm for self-defense." In this item, we'll scrutinize the claim that the Baucus bill "could be used to ban guns in home self-defense." To start, we turn to the committee-passed version of the legislation itself. The sweeping health care bill would leave in place the current private insurance system in which most people get coverage from their employer. But the bill would set federal rules for the individual market — that is, for policies purchased by people who are self-employed or have lost their coverage. President Barack Obama and other Democrats have often said the new rules are needed because companies that sell policies on the individual market are often able to impose restrictions about pre-existing conditions and put limitations on coverage. The rules for the individual market would also apply to the "small group" market, which serves smaller employers and their workers. We looked carefully at the language in the Baucus bill and found no mention of either "gun" or "firearm." So there's no explicit support in the bill for the group's claim. Okay, says GOA, but guns could still be a target because of the emphasis on discouraging unhealthy behaviors. "The ObamaCare bill already contains language that will punish Americans who engage in unhealthy behavior by allowing insurers to charge them higher insurance premiums," the group said in its alert. The group is right that the bill does allow higher premiums based on behavior — specifically, the use of tobacco. The Baucus bill would allow insurers to alter premiums based on tobacco use, age, family composition and cost differences in different geographical regions. The bill establishes a series of ratios for how much these factors can be used to adjust premiums upward. Tobacco users, for instance, could be charged 1.5 times the standard rate under the bill. (There is no such provision in the House bill.) Another provision could provide a loophole that allows behavioral factors to play a wider role in setting premiums. The bill would expand some rules now in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, that allow employees to be rewarded if they participate in wellness programs. Taking part in a wellness program — such as tobacco cessation or a gym membership — can mean lower premiums or co-pays. The bill would increase the size of discounts that can be offered to beneficiaries who enroll in these programs. Some advocacy groups and labor unions have warned this could be a sneaky way of excluding less-healthy workers. And Mike Hammond, GOA's legislative counsel, said that such policies indicate that the bill "is going in a behavioral direction." So, GOA has a point that the Baucus bill opens the door to rating health insurance premiums based on behaviors. But the group is making a huge leap to suggest that could mean the government would target gun owners. In the alert, GOA leaves out two important pieces of context. — People with "unhealthy behaviors" would actually get stronger protections under the Baucus bill . Currently, states oversee the individual insurance market with a patchwork of rules. According to the Senate Finance Committee, only one state fully bars premiums from being adjusted for any reasons. Seven states allow limited adjustments for reasons such as age, while 11 allow premiums to vary based on health factors. The remaining 31 — a majority of all states — have not passed any laws restricting what factors insurers can use in setting rates. Under Baucus's bill, the federal rules would take over and put restrictions on when insurers could charge higher premiums as we explain above. This means that for most states, gun owners — or people with other behaviors that the government might theoretically deem "unhealthy" — would actually get more explicit protection under the Baucus bill than they have now. Today, laws in most states would not keep an insurer from discriminating against gun owners in setting premiums; under the Baucus bill, gun owners would have this protection enshrined in law. — There's no indication in the bill that gun ownership is contemplated as a future factor in premium-setting . Even if you assume that health care reform is rushing headlong into a new era in which behavior defines health premiums — which is just speculation at this point — there is nothing in the Baucus bill that says, or even suggests, that gun ownership would be cited as a behavioral factor. Every behavioral factor explicitly cited in the bill concerns pure medical issues, such as a lowered cholesterol level, maintainance of a certain body mass index, quitting smoking or losing a specified amount of weight. GOA's Hammond argues that in his experience, bills that start narrowly have a tendency to expand their reach. "So I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that what can be done will be done," he said. But we find insufficient evidence to support the group's overheated rhetoric. Ultimately, we find that while the GOA is right that a more behavioral approach to pricing health care seems to be gaining steam, it is a giant and overly speculative leap to say that the Baucus bill "could be used to ban guns in home self-defense." There is nothing in the bill itself to indicate that is contemplated. We find the statement False.	None	Gun Owners of America	None	None	None	2009-10-20T13:50:18	2009-10-09	['Max_Baucus']

As part of her answer, she talked about reducing gun violence in cities, and mentioned Philadelphia's struggle with that. "You know, more than one person, on average, a day is murdered in Philadelphia," Clinton said. "And Mayor (Michael) Nutter is very committed, as the mayor of this great city, to try to do what he can to stem the violence." A murder a day means more than 365 murders per year. Last year, Philadelphia did hit that unhappy milestone with 392 murders. That was down slightly from 2006, when there were 406 murders. This year, though, murders have declined since the beginning of the year. The home page of the Philadelphia Police Department tracks the year's murders, and the day after the Philadelphia debate, the number stood at 87, down from 114 on the same date a year ago. At that rate, the murder rate is about 20 percent less than a murder a day. So previous year's statistics do bear out Clinton's point, but the statistics for 2008 do not.

pomt-08220	"Since the first of the year, 153 businesses at last count had moved out of California to Texas."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/nov/18/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-153-businesses-have-moved-cali/	Looks like Gov. Rick Perry has a new favorite number. During the campaign, he frequently touted an 850,000-net-job gain during his tenure. On the media circuit to promote his new book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, he seems fond of 153. "Since the first of the year, 153 businesses at last count had moved out of California to Texas," he said on "Fox & Friends" Nov. 4. Then on Nov. 8, he said it to host Greta Van Susteren on Fox News's "On the Record." Later that day he told the host of Comedy Central's "Daily Show," Jon Stewart, that "153 businesses have moved out of California to Texas since the first of the year through August." Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger told us that "the 153 figure came from a Dun & Bradstreet analysis of California business migration from January 2010 to August 2010." Dun & Bradstreet is a New Jersey-based business-intelligence company with a global database of some 171 million companies in more than 190 countries. "Texas was the largest recipient of outbound California business migration with 153 companies," she said. When we asked her for the analysis, she directed us to a D&B official. Mark Muckerman, D&B government relations director, told us that the company conducted an internal exercise — most of which he said has not been shared outside the company — of "interstate moves of business locations," or businesses that have relocated out of state. He said that 153 businesses relocated from California to Texas from January through August. However, Muckerman said, the D&B count does not mean that 153 individual companies pulled up stakes in California to settle in Texas. Muckerman offered this example: If one company with five offices in California keeps its headquarters in state and moves its branches out of state, including one to Texas, that would figure into the D&B count that Perry cites. Muckerman revealed one other caveat. He said the "interstate moves" don't include new business locations. So if a California company decided to open a brand-new packaging facility in Texas, it wouldn't be counted among the businesses that have moved from California to Texas. Muckerman said he didn't know how Perry learned of D&B's internal report though he presumes someone at D&B spoke to someone in the governor's office. We wondered how many business sites moved from Texas to California. Muckerman told us there were 92 such moves, leaving Texas with a net gain of 61 business sites from the Golden State. How did California rank in landing business sites from other states? Muckerman declined to disclose that information. Lacking more data from D&B's research, we struggled to evaluate the significance of 153 business sites having moved to Texas from California over the past eight months. Muckerman said that "from a purely economical development viewpoint," any gain from another state is good news. Putting Texas' numbers in perspective, he said, 19,585 business sites in the D&B database showed a change of address from one state to another between January and August. Of those, 1,280 relocated from other states to Texas, which ran second to Florida in relocations. Florida's haul was 2,032, Muckerman said. Where does that leave us? Wishing for more data. And if it surfaces, we'll consider revisiting this subject. Still, based on the limited information D&B has shared, it looks like Texas netted 61 business sites from California from January through August, less than half the one-way total that Perry cites. Also, as D&B advised us, not all of the 153 sites that came here from there necessarily reflect whole companies making the move east. Instead, the 153 moves could have involved individual offices or branches of firms that continue to do business in California. We rate Perry's statement Half True.

pomt-00610	"We spend more money on lobbying than we do on campaigns."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/01/george-will/george-will-we-spend-more-lobbying-campaigns/	The indictment of former House Speaker Dennis Hastert is more striking for what was left out than for the charges themselves. Hastert allegedly paid a man about $1.7 million since 2010. According to press reports, the goal was to hide a sexual encounter that took place decades ago when Hastert was a high school wrestling coach. But the indictment said nothing about a potential act of blackmail. Instead, federal officials charged Hastert with scheming to skirt banking laws and lying to FBI agents about his cash withdrawals. The missing details have spurred a lot of speculation, but conservative pundit George Will stepped back and focused on how Hastert, who never made much money as a teacher or a congressman, could cover the payments. On Fox News Sunday, Will said it was all about Hastert’s post-congressional career as a lobbyist. "Big government becomes big by being deeply involved in the allocation of wealth and opportunity," Will said on May 31, 2015. "Lobbyists are important. That's why we spend more money on lobbying than we do on campaigns. They become important precisely because they know how complicated the government is, where the levers and pulleys and widgets are, to make it work. And he made the most of that value." Will pointed no fingers but said this was "an unfortunate glimpse of how hard government is." We were intrigued with Will’s comparison of lobbying and campaigns and decided to look into the numbers. We reached out to Will, and while we didn’t hear back, we suspect he based his statement on federal expenditure data. According to government figures on the Center for Responsive Politics website, Will is correct. Spending on lobbyists exceeds all the money that flows during elections. And the political scientists we reached said on top of that, a lot of lobbying never makes it into the official tallies. The numbers In every election cycle since 2008, more money has gone into lobbying at the federal level than into political campaigns. The campaign totals include money tied to candidates, the parties, Super PACs and so-called dark money that largely goes unreported. As this table shows, the pattern holds even in presidential election years. The dollar amounts are in billions. 2-Year Cycle Lobbying Campaigns 2008 $6.17 $5.286 2010 $7.02 $3.632 2012 $6.64 $6.286 2014 $6.48 $3.769 Source: Center for Responsive Politics: Campaigns - Lobbyists This data only covers federal spending. A lot of money goes into lobbying and elections at the state and local levels, too. But while there are some numbers on campaign activities in the states, there is little reporting on lobbying. So we’re limited to comparing the dollars at the federal level. Hidden lobbying We contacted several political scientists, and they all said that Will is even more correct than the official numbers show. James Thurber is director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. "The official count of federal level lobbyists is only the tip of the iceberg," Thurber said. "The number of shadow lobbyists is much greater." Thurber points to people like former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle who offers his services as a strategic adviser and doesn’t show up as a registered lobbyist. But Daschle’s advice can be worth a lot to outfits that do business with the government. Thurber said the focus on lobbying Congress is important, but it misses efforts to shape what happens in the executive branch. "I say there’s more lobbying going on in the executive branch in terms of procurement and writing regulations," Thurber said. Tim LaPira, a political scientist at James Madison University, estimates that the actual amount of lobbying is double the official count. Political scientist Jeffrey Berry at Tufts University said lobbying firms only have to disclose legislative lobbying and even that doesn't necessarily include everything in a firm's contract with a client. Berry said a lot of activity flies beneath the radar. "What goes on at corporate headquarters to support the Washington lobbying office is generally unreported," Berry said. "For trade associations, what’s reported typically does not include what member firms do on instructions from the staff of the trade group. And the list goes on." Hastert and lobbying dollars Will noted that Hastert made his real money after he left Congress. While we can’t know Haster’s exact income in his work for the firm of Dickstein Shapiro, he’s listed as a lobbyist on contracts worth many millions of dollars. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, in 2009, Hastert lobbied for three groups with a total contract value of $260,000. By 2013, the total was over $4.5 million. While it dipped the next year, it was still over $1.7 million. Some of the biggest contracts were for the tobacco company Lorillard and the mining company Peabody Energy. Thurber at American University said Hastert didn’t need to have any particular expertise with tobacco or energy. "He knew the process inside government, and he knew what role particular people played in that process," Thurber said. Frank Baumgartner at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said only the highest ranking former members of Congress command top dollar from private interests. "Either these lobbyists are hoodwinking their clients, or they really are able to open doors that people with lesser experience at the highest levels of Congress cannot open," Baumgartner said. Our ruling Will said that more money is spent on lobbying than on campaigns. In terms of the expenditures reported at the federal level, that is correct. In every election cycle since 2008, more money has gone toward lobbying than elections. The experts we reached said the official lobbying numbers fail to capture a lot of activity. Will’s statement is accurate. We rate it True.	None	George Will	None	None	None	2015-06-01T10:19:07	2015-05-31	['None']
pomt-13568	On the Iran nuclear deal	half flip	/nevada/statements/2016/aug/23/jacky-rosen/did-jacky-rosen-flip-flop-iran-nuclear-deal/	The National Republican Congressional Committee accused a Nevada Democratic candidate of flip-flopping on an important national security issue — the nuclear deal with Iran. In a recent blog post, the NRCC claims Democratic House candidate Jacky Rosen, a former Henderson synagogue president, is flip-flopping on support for the arrangement. "Despite all warning signs, Rosen initially supported the deal," the group said. "Then, realizing how detrimental her position could be to her election prospects, Rosen reversed course and said she would have opposed it." Rosen’s position isn’t exactly a complete flip-flop. Her initial support for the deal wasn’t as clear or as strongly stated as the blog says. We decided to weigh her statements on PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter, which examines a candidate’s record on a topic without casting a value judgment on any changes. Republicans have sought to tie Democrats (including in Nevada) to the 2015 diplomatic arrangement with Iran, which aims to extend the time it takes for the country to make a nuclear bomb in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Rosen, a former Henderson synagogue leader and political newcomer, has addressed the deal publicly on just a handful of occasions. She made her first remarks about the deal in an interview (audio) with the Las Vegas Sun and a PolitiFact Nevada reporter in April, saying Obama "made the best deal" he could. "Just being an ordinary citizen, I do believe that he made the best deal that he thought he could at the time or he probably wouldn't have made it," she said at the time. "That being said, it doesn't mean that we don't watch everything they do. It doesn't mean that we don't watch where money gets invested into Iran. Where they're spending their money. It doesn't mean that we don't keep watching them. It doesn't mean we don't keep improving on the agreement where we have to or imposing sanctions where we have to. A month later, Rosen again addressed the deal, but this time she struck a different tone. She told political reporter Jon Ralston that she would have voted against the deal had she been in Congress at the time.She said it said didn’t reflect a change in position. "I guess as I have had a chance to think about and clarify it, it hasn’t changed," she said. "I did say I want to hold their feet to the fire, I want to look at where the money goes, and I don’t want a nuclearized Iran." PolitiFact reached out to the Rosen campaign, which provided a statement from the candidate saying that her position on the deal has been "clear and consistent." To help prove the point, the campaign also provided an email exchange from late March to early April between Rosen campaign manager David Furr and a staff member at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee over an Israel policy paper including her position on the Iran deal. The paper reflects what Rosen said to Ralston in May. "If Jacky had been in Congress when the vote on the Iran deal had occurred, she would have opposed the deal," the paper reads. "But now that it has been agreed, the United States must demand that Iran abide by the agreement completely, and any cheating or subversion of the agreement should be dealt with swiftly." A few caveats do apply — this paper wasn’t previously available publicly, so there would be no way for voters to know her position. Rosen also doesn’t list any foreign policy positions (or any issues, for that matter) on her website. Our ruling Rosen has only been quoted a handful of times on the Iran deal. In April, she expressed measured support of the deal (without using the word "support"), saying she believed it was the best deal Obama could have reached, and that it could be improved. Her view the next month was more articulated. She said she would have voted against it as a member of Congress. Because she has partially changed her position, we rate Rosen’s position as Half Flip.

pomt-02152	On in-state tuition for illegal immigrants.	full flop	/florida/statements/2014/may/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-opposed-state-tuition-dreamers-he-embra/	After more than a decade of failed attempts, the Florida Legislature approved in-state tuition for DREAMers -- college students who were brought to the United States illegally as children. The legislation passed through both chambers by wide margins in the final week of the legislative session, during an election year when Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic rival Charlie Crist are battling for the Hispanic vote, which represents about 14 percent of the state’s electorate. Both candidates and their political parties have accused their opponent of not siding with Hispanics in the past and pandering now that they want votes. Scott campaigned in 2010 in favor of an Arizona-style immigration law and in 2013 vetoed a bill to give DREAMers driver’s licenses. (The term "DREAMers" comes from the DREAM Act, federal legislation that would give such young people legal status.) But this year he appointed Carlos Lopez-Cantera, a former Miami-Dade legislator of Cuban descent, as his running mate and is courting Hispanics. As the Republican-led Legislature appeared poised to pass the bill in April, the Republican Party of Florida attacked Crist for opposing in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in 2006. As a Republican candidate for governor at the time, Crist did oppose the tuition break, though he supports it now. We rated the party’s claim True. But Crist isn’t the only candidate in the governor’s race to change his mind about DREAMers tuition. On the morning of the final day of the legislative session, the Florida Democratic Party accused Scott of flip-flopping on DREAMers tuition. Their weapon: an interview Scott gave in 2011 to a conservative news program. We decided to put the topic of in-state tuition for DREAMers on PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter. The Flip-O-Meter doesn’t pass judgment on whether a politician flipped; we simply measure whether he did flip and to what extent. Scott on tuition before 2014 While Scott has said a lot about in-state tuition in recent weeks, we found he said very little about it before 2014. In September 2011, Scott was asked about the topic during a friendly interview on Newsmax, a conservative website. At the time, Scott was in Orlando for the Presidency V conference the Florida GOP was hosting. The main topics of the interview were the importance of Florida in the presidential election, Scott’s opposition to Obamacare and his effort to grow jobs and improve the economy. The reporter briefly touched on immigration: "Two huge issues. Let’s talk about immigration and Rick Perry’s giving in-state tuition to illegal alien children. Where do you stand on that?" Scott replied: "Well, my position on immigration has been clear for a long time. I believe the federal government ought to do their job. You know, secure our borders. Come up with an immigration policy that Americans understand and people who want to come to this country understand. But with regard to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants I completely oppose it." Then the interview turned to repealing Obamacare. In an April 2013 interview with the Sun-Sentinel, Scott showed support for allowing citizen children born here to parents who came here illegally -- which is different than the current bill which pertains to children who came here illegally. From the Sentinel: Question: "Do you support a bill allowing children born here of illegal immigrants to qualify for college tuition as residents?" Scott: "Absolutely, yes. If you were born in this state or in this country, and you are resident of this state, you ought to get in-state tuition. ... " Question: "What about noncitizens brought to this country at a very young age by their parents?" Scott: "The issue you're dealing with there is that we're taxing our own citizens to pay for an education system. So what's fair? Right now our universities are always asking for more money as it is. So, I think the right thing is if you were born in this country and you have the residency requirements of this state, you get in-state tuition." The bill in 2014 The bill approved by the Legislature this year offers in-state tuition rates to undocumented students who attended a Florida high school for at least three years. That reduced rate is about three to four times less than what out-of-state students currently pay. A Senate analysis estimates about 1,300 students would qualify each year. The Legislature has failed to pass similar bills since 2003, but this year it succeeded largely because of the support of House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel. The House swiftly passed it 81-33 in March. After some snags, the Senate approved it 26-13 on May 1. The Senate tweaked the House version so it returned to the House again and passed 84-32 May 2. What Scott said about the bill in 2014 This year, Scott was initially hard to pin down on DREAMers tuition. In early February in a meeting with the Legislature’s Hispanic caucus, he was cautious: "I’ll certainly consider it," Scott said. "I want all tuition to stop growing." When asked about the House bill April 1, Scott reaffirmed his support for the Senate version, which included getting rid of the tuition differential that raises the cost for all students. "I'm going to work with the Senate and the House to make sure we have a bill that lowers tuition for all Floridians," he said. But as the bill stood on shaky ground in the Senate in mid April, Scott made his support clear. In a joint statement with former Republican Govs. Jeb Bush and Bob Martinez, Scott said: "Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition rate at universities their peers and classmates do. We want our students to stay here in Florida when they go to college and when they choose a career, and that means we must make college more affordable for all those students who call Florida home. The Florida Senate should take immediate action to move SB 1400 forward." During a press gaggle in Fort Lauderdale a few days before the end of the session, Scott said he "absolutely" supported the bill. A reporter asked Scott: "When did that change? When did you have that change of mind as far as supporting in-state tuition?" Scott: "I haven’t changed my mind at all. I want lower tuition for all Floridians. These are the things that the bill does. For individuals that grew up in our state, they deserve the same tuition as ... everybody else and all their peers. And this is something that Charlie Crist opposed. He opposed in-state tuition for children of immigrants. But on top of that it reduces the 15 percent differential and the inflationary change in tuition every year. ... They have caused tuition to be too expensive so lower-income, middle-income families can’t afford their tuition, and Charlie Crist is the one who signed those bills." In follow-up questions, Scott focused on his overall goal of reducing college tuition in general: Question: "You said you had always been in favor of in-state tuition for DREAMers. I did a quick search before I came here and I couldn’t find comments you made about that before this year. Can you be a little more specific about your support before this year?" Scott: "It’s the right thing to do. As you know I’ve always focused on lower tuition for all Floridians and whether it’s those that grew up here they’re not getting in-state tuition, those that are seeing this 15 percent plus inflationary increase we need to get tuition lower so all of our students -- low-income middle-income everybody -- can afford college and university." Question: "So you’ve always supported in-state tuition for DREAMers throughout your tenure as Governor?" Scott: "I have always supported lower tuition for all Floridians." On May 1, after the Senate passed the bill, Scott said he looked forward to signing the bill. After the House took its final vote on the bill May 2, Scott said in a prepared statement: "The Florida Legislature embraced fairness for all students today by taking action to lower the costs of higher education for every family in Florida. Students who have spent their childhood here in Florida deserve to qualify for the same in-state tuition. We are trying to right the wrongs of the previous administration that raised the price of a college education and opposed providing in-state tuition for children of immigrants. The Legislature did the right thing, and I look forward to signing this historic legislation." Spokespersons for Scott referred us to Scott’s comments in a May 2 press gaggle when a reporter asked Scott about the video from 2011 which showed his opposition to in-state tuition for DREAMers. But Scott didn’t address his own flip-flop in his response. Our rating In September 2011, Scott said in a TV interview that he "completely" opposed in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. But by April 2014, he supported it. For his complete change of stance, we give Scott a Full Flop.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-05-02T17:12:05	2014-05-02	['None']

pomt-14786	Despite attention on global warming, "fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980" and "SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/04/george-will/even-global-warming-propaganda-americans-carpoolin/	The two-week climate conference now under way in Paris, where President Barack Obama hopes for an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has generated attacks from conservatives such as syndicated columnist George Will. On Nov. 30, 2015, the first day of the United Nations gathering, Will made a two-part claim that we want to check. He made the statement on Fox News’ "Special Report," and it was replayed the next day by Milwaukee radio talk show host Charlie Sykes, whose guests are nearly always fellow conservatives. Despite 30 years of "propaganda" about global warming, Will stated, "fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980. SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country. The American people may profess occasionally to be concerned about global warming, but their behavior tells you that none of this propaganda has had any effect." The size of the cars Americans drive and how often they carpool are only two ways in which people produce greenhouse gases -- those such as carbon dioxide from vehicles that trap heat in the atmosphere and, scientists believe, contribute to global warming. But let’s see how clean Will’s claim is. Greenhouse gases A little first on greenhouse gases. When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker stated in September 2015 that the Obama administration’s own Environmental Protection Agency has said its Clean Power Plan "will have a marginal impact on climate change" (Half True), we noted that the United States and China are considered the world’s top greenhouse gas polluters. And as PolitiFact National reported the same month, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said it is "extremely likely" that humans are causing climate change, and "very likely" that greenhouses gases are the driver. We’ve also noted that according to the EPA, greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in the United States amount to 27 percent of all sources of greenhouse gases, second only to electric power generation. Now to the first part of Will’s claim. Carpooling The latest census figures show that slightly more than 9 percent of Americans carpooled to work in 2014. As Will suggested, that’s down from nearly 20 percent in 1980, which was the first census to survey about carpooling. Driving alone rose from 64.4 percent to 76.5 percent. Among the reasons, according to experts: The rate of car ownership has risen, work schedules are less predictable, more people work from home and busier Americans want more freedom in managing their commutes with other tasks, such as getting kids to soccer practice. The other part of Will’s statement, however, goes off road a bit. SUVs We’ll note that, strictly speaking, there are traditional sport-utility vehicles, such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, which are built on a truck platform; and the newer crossover-utility vehicles, which are built on a car chassis. They include the Honda CR-V and the Buick Encore. Traditional SUVs peaked with a 17 percent market share in 2002, according to the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research, an independent research group. In 2014, they made up only 7.1 percent of all new vehicle sales. But many people, as well as automotive experts, refer to both types of vehicles simply as SUVs. The car site Edmunds.com told us that SUVs have reached their highest-ever market share in 2015, at 35.5 percent of sales. And the Center for Automotive Research provided us similar figures. In 2014, traditional SUVs and crossovers accounted for 34 percent of new-vehicle sales, as high as any year going back to 1995. Our rating Will said that despite attention on global warming, "fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980" and "SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country." Will is correct on carpooling to work and essentially correct on SUVs, when taking into account both traditional SUVs and the smaller crossover vehicles. But it’s worth noting that the market share for the traditional SUVs is down from its peak in 2002. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-06092	"I think with the exception of the last year or maybe the last two years, we were at 100 percent" when it came to contributing to the Providence pension fund.	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/06/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-providence-made-full-p/	On the Christmas Day edition of WPRI’s "Newsmakers," talk turned to the public employee pension problems in Rhode Island. Former Providence Mayor and now U.S. Rep. David Cicilline was asked how often his administration properly funded the city's pension system. Cicilline initially said the city made its annual required contribution (ARC) -- the amount that experts say is needed to properly fund that system -- every year during his eight years as mayor. But then he backed off a bit, not always finishing his sentences. "We made it every year and I think the last year . . . One thing that we set out [to do] -- we had a plan that made sure we made 100-percent contribution to the system to keep us current, which doesn't deal with the unfunded liability but it stops the bleeding," he said. "I think with the exception of the last year or maybe the last two years, we were at 100 percent. I think the last year it was 90 . . ." At that point, WPRI reporter Tim White broke in and asked, "You're saying you made the ARC six times in your administration?" "Yeah, I think to the 100 percent," Cicilline said. "I think two years we got over 90 but didn't . . . But the unfunded liability occurred because -- and this happened in Providence for many years before I took office -- that the city didn't make its 100-percent contribution." Since he left the mayor's office, Cicilline has come under a lot of fire over how he managed the city's finances, so we decided to check his statement. We turned to the latest report by Buck Consultants, which determines how much Providence is supposed to put into its pension program each year. The report also lists how much the city was supposed to invest each year and how much it actually did. The report goes back to the fiscal year ending June 30, 1996, when the city invested all of the $16.1 million that it was supposed to. But in following years, the contribution started to fall. With Vincent "Buddy" Cianci Jr. in his second era as mayor, the level dropped to 93.6 percent, then 57.5 percent, then lower still. During Cianci's last year in office -- 2002 -- it was 64.2 percent. Cicilline is correct when he says that the contribution level rose after he took over from acting Mayor John Lombardi. During the 2003 fiscal year -- when Cicilline had been at the helm for only six months -- the contribution rate rose to 80.1 percent. The amount kept rising, but the contribution level didn't hit or exceed 100 percent until the 2007 fiscal year, more than three years after he took office. Over the subsequent three years it averaged 100 percent -- 100.2 percent in 2007, 100 percent in 2008 and 99.8 percent in 2009 -- but then dipped a bit to 97.7 percent. By then, the price tag for financing the city's employee pension program had grown to $50.3 million, more than three times what it was in 1996. Fiscal year ending June 30 Mayor(s) Annual Required Contribution Percent Contribution 1996 Vincent "Buddy" Cianci $16,136,000 100.00% 1997 Cianci $21,089,000 93.58% 1998 Cianci $35,701,000 57.52% 1999 Cianci $37,445,000 56.15% 2000 Cianci $37,415,000 60.00% 2001 Cianci $38,899,000 60.60% 2002 Cianci $42,442,000 64.18% 2003 Cianci, John Lombardi, David Cicilline $42,008,000 80.25% 2004 Cicilline $46,321,000 85.99% 2005 Cicilline $49,329,000 92.15% 2006 Cicilline $51,454,000 96.22% 2007 Cicilline $50,584,000 100.20% 2008 Cicilline $54,200,000 100.00% 2009 Cicilline $48,509,000 99.80% 2010 Cicilline $50,299,000 97.66% When we asked Cicilline's office about his statement, spokeswoman Raymonde Charles said that "as it turns out, his recollection wasn't that far off. "With the exception of two of the budgets proposed and implemented during his administration, the city's pension contributions were made at 100 percent or within just a few percentage points, and in one year, even in excess of 100 percent." But that wasn't the question. The question was how many times the Cicilline administration funded the pensions at 100 percent. And particularly during the 2004-2006 fiscal years, where the payment was at 96 percent or less, the shortfall was $2 million to $6 million. At the end of the 2010 fiscal year, Providence's pension fund had only 34 percent of the $1.26 billion it needed, according to the report. Our ruling U.S. Rep. David Cicilline said that "with the exception of the last year or maybe the last two years, we were at 100 percent" when it came to the amount Providence contributed to the city's pension fund during the eight years he was mayor. But those last two years were not the exception.

pomt-09410	“Rick Perry had planned to retire from the legislature until his best friend, David Weeks, and I talked him into switching parties and running for the GOP nomination for agriculture commissioner.”	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/19/karl-rove/karl-rove-says-he-and-consultant-david-weeks-persu/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry draws mention in GOP consultant Karl Rove’s autobiography with attention focused on Perry’s win for lieutenant governor in 1998 and Rove's role in his pivotal earlier switch from the Democratic to Republican party while he was a third-term member of the Texas House. Rove writes: “Rick Perry had planned to retire from the legislature until his best friend, David Weeks, and I talked him into switching parties and running for the GOP nomination for agriculture commissioner.” His book, "Courage and Consequence, My Life as a Conservative in the Fight," was published March 9. We wondered if Perry’s 1989 party shift and his 1990 challenge to Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower played out so simply. Perry didn’t comment, but Weeks, a long-time Perry friend who’s been a consultant in Perry’s statewide campaigns, said Perry was seriously considering retirement, perhaps to become a lobbyist, partly because his wife, Anita, was saddled with raising their young children at the time. Weeks said Rove was part of a group of Republicans who encouraged Perry to switch parties and make the statewide run. “He wasn’t the only one,” Weeks said. Published stories also single out Weeks and Rove. Perry considered working as a lobbyist or high-level Capitol aide rather than leaving Austin entirely, according to a February article in the Austin American-Statesman. Instead, Weeks and others encouraged him to run for ag commissioner, the newspaper said. Perry told the Statesman: “I'll give David the bulk of the credit. He came and sat down with me and said, 'You ought to run for statewide office.'” According to a 2003 Rove profile published in Texas Monthly magazine, Rove and Weeks “persuaded Perry, an obscure Democratic legislator from Haskell who had co-chaired Al Gore's 1988 Democratic presidential primary campaign in Texas, to switch parties for the election. West Texas was swinging Republican anyway, and Perry, who was discouraged by his failure to advance in the House leadership and thinking of becoming a lobbyist, had nothing to lose.” The rest is dramatic Republican history: Perry, whose advisers included Rove, upset Hightower and has now held statewide office for nearly 20 years. Rove went on to help Bush to the White House. Others were involved, though, in Perry making his initial leap. We rate Rove’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-01609	In the latest jobs numbers Wisconsin "ranked third in the Midwest."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/31/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-third-midwest-jobs-cre/	A new television ad from Gov. Scott Walker returns to the theme of job creation and paints an upbeat picture of how Wisconsin is faring. Working to blunt criticism from Democratic challenger Mary Burke that his administration has failed to deliver on his No. 1 campaign promise to add 250,000 private sector jobs, Walker compares Wisconsin with other Midwest states. In the ad, outlines of states appear on the screen as Walker speaks directly to the camera: "Well, the latest job numbers are in and Wisconsin created more private sector jobs than Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Ohio, and Illinois. That means we ranked third in the Midwest." With Burke repeatedly claiming Wisconsin is "dead last" in job creation in the Midwest, we thought it was time to look at both claims. As with the Burke claim, many factors are at work, including the time frame and the measure being used. About the numbers Walker doesn’t say it to the camera, but fine print on the screen says the ad’s claim is based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics (CES) for the period of July 2013 to July 2014. He’s talking about the most recent one-year period, not his entire term. Wisconsin added 36,100 jobs in that one-year time frame, which does place it third among the 10 Midwest states, behind Indiana and Michigan. Here is how the picture looks: States ranked by on growth in number of jobs, July 2013-14 Private-sector jobs added National rank on jobs added 1. Indiana 66,300 8th 2. Michigan 58,200 11th 3. Wisconsin 36,100 20th 4. Minnesota 33,600 21st 5. Ohio 29,900 24th 6. Illinois 28,700 25th 7. North Dakota 19,000 29th 8. Iowa 15,200 33rd 9. Nebraska 4,200 45th 10. South Dakota 3,000 48th In the comparison, Walker used preliminary July 2014 data, which will be adjusted in one month. A Bureau of Labor Statistics official said it was reasonable to compare that figure to the July 2013 figure, with the caveat that the July 2014 figure will change. Behind the numbers A subtle but important note: In his claim, Walker uses the raw number of jobs created as his measuring stick -- not the percentage increase, which is the measure preferred by economists. Using the percentage change allows for a better comparison, due to the varying size of states. That is, smaller states like South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa have fewer people and a smaller economic base to start from. But it’s notable that even on that measure, Wisconsin outperformed states with larger economies and populations such as Ohio and Illinois over the last year. And when the percentage growth is used, Wisconsin only slips a bit -- to fourth-highest among the 10. Another point to consider, also important, is Walker’s use of the monthly jobs data. Those monthly numbers are extrapolated from a survey of 3 percent of state businesses. As such, they are subject to considerable revisions and include a wide margin of error. Walker himself has called the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which is based on a census of 96 percent of employers, the "gold standard" for jobs. Not long after taking office, Walker’s spokesman issued an email statement in March 2011 saying the governor would use the quarterly data because of his "commitment to use verifiable, actual job counts, not just monthly job estimates." That said, in the new ad, Walker does signal he’s using the monthly estimates this time -- he refers to "the latest" numbers, which go through July 2014. By contrast, the more-accurate quarterly data lags behind by six months. The most recent quarterly data ends with the last quarter of 2013. Campaign spokeswoman Alleigh Marre told us that timeliness was one factor in the campaign’s use of the monthly numbers. And we think it is defensible to use it to provide insight into the latest trends. It is regularly used and reported by economists and news outlets. In our own Walk-O-Meter, as we track progress toward Walker’s 250,000 private-sector job pledge, we use the solid quarterly jobs figures from 2011, 2012 and 2013 to provide the best picture for the first three full years of Walker’s term. Then, to give a sense of the most recent pictures, we use the most recent monthly jobs numbers. Our most recent tally shows 147,187 jobs to go. We have rated the promise Stalled. Finally, Walker defined the "Midwest" as 10 states -- the same states Burke used in her claim. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ midwest regional office covers those 10 states, and typically cites only the 10. In some instances, the agency adds two more -- Missouri and Kansas. Wisconsin ranks fourth of 12 on raw number of jobs added in the year. Our rating Walker’s new TV ad says the latest jobs figures show Wisconsin is third in the Midwest on the number of jobs created. The number checks out, using the measuring stick and timeframe Walker chose. To be sure, the monthly numbers he uses are not as reliable as quarterly ones, which Walker himself has labeled the "gold standard." But by using raw numbers to measure the increase, instead of a percentage-based approach that levels the playing field, he gives Wisconsin -- and himself -- a bit of a boost. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True. ...... Deciphering jobs claims Voters will hear many more jobs claims before the Nov. 4 election. Here are five tips for separating fact from fiction -- and hype from hard evidence -- when it comes to candidates and the numbers they use. Check the timeframe: If the statement covers a short period, it can be a red flag for cherry-picking data to find a good result. A longer time frame may be being used to mask more recent changes. Check the data source: The quarterly jobs numbers are more accurate than the monthly figures, but also more out of date. Be more skeptical of recent announcement about the monthly numbers, because they are subject to revisions can be significant. Raw numbers or percentages?: If the claim is that State X added more jobs than State Y, the statement may have limited information value. Look for percentage growth figures that level the playing field among states of varying sizes. Check the map: When the claim is "best in the region," trust but verify. Are all relevant states included? Scrutinize the sector: Most claims focus on just the private sector, but sometimes partisans will add in public employees if it suits their purpose.

pomt-09415	"The Massachusetts Supreme Court...defined marriage as simply, quote, the establishment of intimacy ... I guess that would mean if you really had affection for your horse, I guess you could marry your horse."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/18/jd-hayworth/jd-hayworth-claims-massachusetts-ruling-opens-door/	J.D. Hayworth, the former congressman running against Sen. John McCain in the Arizona Republican primary, was known for making provocative points as a conservative radio talk show host. He's proving every bit as provocative on the campaign trail. In an interview on radio station WORL in Orlando on March 14, 2010, Hayworth was talking about same-sex marriage. He's very much against it. But it was his comments about the prospect of someone walking down the aisle in Massachusetts with a horse that landed Hayworth in the national political news cycle. Let's get the full quote straight from the horse's mouth: "You see, the Massachusetts Supreme Court, when it started this move toward same-sex marriage, actually defined marriage -- now get this -- it defined marriage as simply, quote, the establishment of intimacy," Hayworth said. "Now how dangerous is that? I mean, I don't mean to be absurd about it, but I guess I can make the point of absurdity with an absurd point -- I guess that would mean if you really had affection for your horse, I guess you could marry your horse. It's just the wrong way to go, and the only way to protect the institution of marriage is with that federal marriage amendment that I support." Whoa there. Really? Hayworth is talking about a landmark 2003 case in which the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled, 4-3, that gay couples have the right to marry under the state's Constitution. We took a long look at the 45-page decision in the case, Goodridge vs. the Department of Public Health. Since Hayworth suggested that he was quoting the phrase "the establishment of intimacy," we searched for that first. It's not there. The word "intimacy" appears five times in the 45-page decision (actually six times, but one is a duplicate), but never in the context of being the sole definition of marriage. Here they are: * One section talks about how the Supreme Court has affirmed that "the core concept of common human dignity protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution precludes government intrusion into the deeply personal realms of consensual adult expressions of intimacy and one's choice of an intimate partner." * "Marriage also bestows enormous private and social advantages on those who choose to marry. Civil marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a highly public celebration of the ideals of mutuality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family." * "Whether and whom to marry, how to express sexual intimacy, and whether and how to establish a family -- these are among the most basic of every individual's liberty and due process rights." * "Our laws of civil marriage do not privilege procreative heterosexual intercourse between married people above every other form of adult intimacy and every other means of creating a family." * "Similarly, the Supreme Court has called for increased due process protection when individual privacy and intimacy are threatened by unnecessary government imposition." We're not sure how Hayworth gets from any of these to the court defining marriage as simply the establishment of intimacy. Chief Justice Margaret H. Marshall of the state's Supreme Judicial Court began the ruling with these words: "Marriage is a vital social institution. The exclusive commitment of two individuals to each other nurtures love and mutual support; it brings stability to our society. For those who choose to marry, and for their children, marriage provides an abundance of legal, financial, and social benefits. In return it imposes weighty legal, financial, and social obligations. The question before us is whether, consistent with the Massachusetts Constitution, the Commonwealth may deny the protections, benefits, and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry. We conclude that it may not. "We are mindful that our decision marks a change in the history of our marriage law," Marshall wrote. "Many people hold deep-seated religious, moral, and ethical convictions that marriage should be limited to the union of one man and one woman, and that homosexual conduct is immoral. Many hold equally strong religious, moral, and ethical convictions that same-sex couples are entitled to be married, and that homosexual persons should be treated no differently than their heterosexual neighbors. Neither view answers the question before us. Our concern is with the Massachusetts Constitution as a charter of governance for every person properly within its reach." We italicized "person" to make a point. Justice John Greaney, who concurred, wrote in the ruling, "We construe civil marriage to mean the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others." Again the word "persons." Moreover, Greaney noted that the ruling was strictly about whether people of the same sex could marry and "it leaves intact the Legislature's broad discretion to regulate marriage." Take a look at Massachusetts laws regarding who can marry (which includes age and residency requirements and prohibitions on marrying relatives) and you'll see the word "persons" over and over. Seems pretty straightforward to us, but we checked with a few legal experts in Massachusetts to get their take. "The word 'establishment' doesn't occur in the opinion, and the six appearances of the word 'intimacy' aren't free-standing, so that the statement that the SJC 'defined' marriage 'simply' as 'the establishment of intimacy' is false," said Mark Tushnet a law professor at Harvard Law School. "That's not to say that one couldn't extend the underlying principles articulated in Goodridge to other forms of intimacy, including, I suppose, bestiality, but there's nothing in Goodridge itself saying that the principles extend that far. And of course one need not extend the principles if there's some reason not to do so, as there surely would be in the case of bestiality." Carissa Cunningham, director of public affairs for Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, which handled the Goodridge case, called Hayworth's comment "silly." "It's so far off base," Cunningham said. The ruling, she said, "didn't change anything there about the marriage law in Massachusetts," which very clearly spells out that marriage is only for people. We might have chalked this one up to a one-time misstatement, a bit of hyperbole on the long campaign trail, and simply rated it False. But then Hayworth went on The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC on March 15, 2010, and doubled down. Here's how that went: Maddow: "Where does the establishment of intimacy thing come from? Where in Massachusetts law or in the Supreme Court ruling does it say the establishment of intimacy?" Maddow said she had spent the afternoon looking for it, but couldn't find it anywhere. Hayworth: "As we went back and reviewed that document back when the argument was made, the high court in Massachusetts defined marriage in a rather amorphous fashion, simply as quote, the establishment of intimacy. Now I think we all agree there's much more to marriage than that." Maddow: "Sir, I'm sorry, it didn't." Hayworth: "Okay, you and I have a disagreement." Maddow then cited several uses of the word "intimacy" in the Supreme Court ruling. Maddow: "The establishment of intimacy as the definition of marriage, it's just not there, let alone the horse thing. What you said about the establishment of intimacy being the definition of marriage in Massachusetts, I don't think it's true, sir." Hayworth: "Well, that's fine. You and I can have a disagreement about that." Maddow: "Well, it either is true or it isn't, it’s empirical." Hayworth: "I appreciate the fact that we have a disagreement on that." We're with Maddow here. This isn't a matter of legal interpretation. The Massachusetts Supreme Court did not define marriage "simply as quote, the establishment of intimacy." And when Hayworth inserts the word "quote," the expectation is that he's directly quoting the phrase "establishment of intimacy" from the ruling. He's not. The ruling doesn't contain that phrase. Hayworth prefaced his statement by saying he was making an absurd point. We'll give him that. It's absurd, all right. It's also wrong. We give this one a, quote, Pants on Fire!	None	J.D.

pomt-15334	Cobb County businesses have already been awarded contracts worth $250 million on construction of a new Braves stadium.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/jul/14/tim-lee/cobb-official-says-braves-stadium-awards-250-milli/	The Atlanta Braves are to play baseball by 2017 in a new stadium located, to the chagrin of some, outside the heart of the Capital City and in Cobb County. Cobb County government plans to sell a maximum of $397 million in taxpayer-backed bonds for the stadium Of that money, $368 million goes to construction of the overall stadium project, which is forecast to cost $672 million. The rest is earmarked to cover financing costs and about a year’s worth of interest payments on the debt. Three Cobb County residents went to court to try to block the bonds sale, but the Georgia Supreme Court ruled against them on June 29. A day after the ruling, Cobb County Commission Chairman Tim Lee sent an email blast to constituents, saying "the high court’s unanimous decision is another step in the right direction" and "paves the way for progress as we prepare for Opening Day in 2017." Construction of the stadium is well under way and has already resulted in more than $250 million worth of contracts to Cobb County businesses, Lee said. It’s hardly a surprise that Lee’s pitching the upsides. What politician wouldn’t, or hasn’t on a project likely to be his legacy? But Is he right on the numbers? PolitiFact decided to check. We contacted Kellie Anne Brownlow, Lee’s deputy chief, asking as we do on all fact-checks, for evidence supporting the chairman’s statement. Brownlow said Lee and members of the county commission don’t deal directly with contracts on the stadium. They are leaving that to the Braves and American Builder 2017 of Kennesaw, a team of four companies that, combined, have built 330-plus sports venues and is in charge of building Cobb’s SunTrust Park. But county commissioners are provided regular updates, and Lee’s statement was pulled straight from details from a recent briefing, Brownlow said. She sent us to an archived video of a May 26 commission meeting in which County Manager David Hankerson announced that $375 million worth of contracts had been awarded, 68 percent to Cobb County firms. By our calculations, that’s $255 million to the home team. But details are fuel for the fact-checker just as beer and peanuts help keep the Braves faithful waving, chopping and cheering for nine innings. We had to know more. What companies have been awarded these contracts? Where are they located? What work are they under contract to perform? What kind of money is coming their way? Here’s the bottom line of what our research turned up: contracts awarded to Cobb County businesses currently total about $270 million, according to data we reviewed. The largest amount to one company has been $102.7 million to American Builder 2017. One of the smallest contracts, for $20,874, won’t be executed for quite some time. It’s for one of the finishing touches: window treatments for the stadium’s executive offices, VIP seating areas. So Lee’s statement is correct, but with caveats. The $270 million in contracts aren’t exclusively for construction of the 41,500-seat stadium. Chris Britton, project director for American Builders 2017, confirmed that some of the contracts cover work on the mixed-use portion of the project, which Lee and others say should make the overall ballpark site a 365-day-a-year draw. (Restaurants, entertainment venues and a boutique hotel are all in the plans.) If you look at just on the stadium (site prep costs included), the value of the contracts issued to Cobb County firms is $220.5 million. (We were provided a document showing contracts worth $226.8 million. We disqualified a $6.3 million landscape contract that we confirmed had not yet awarded.) We did Google searches to confirm that all of the firms receiving these contracts have locations in Cobb. But from their websites, it was apparent that not all are headquartered in Cobb, raising the question: How much of what these companies are paid is staying in Cobb or metro Atlanta? For example, three of the four companies partnering as American Builders 2017 are headquartered elsewhere and have other offices around the country: Brasfield & Gorrie is based in Birmingham, Ala; Barton Malow Co. in Southfield, Michigan; and Mortenson Construction, Minneapolis, Minn. (The fourth company in the joint venture American Builders 2017, New South Construction Co., is headquartered in downtown Atlanta.) A $3.5 million contract for shoring and earth-moving work was awarded to Schnabel Foundation Co. The company has its corporate offices is Sterling Va. and regional offices in Marietta and across the U.S. Salaries for on-site workers and supplies are contractors’ biggest expenses and put money into the local economy. But the profits they make from the job -- which are not disclosed -- go to the headquarters or parent company. Our ruling County Commission Chairman Tim Lee said construction of SunTrust Park, the future home of the Atlanta Braves, has already resulted in the award of more than $250 million worth of contracts to Cobb County firms. He based that on a project update the county commission received in May -- and the math from that showed $255 million in contracts. We looked at detailed reports supplied to us by the county and the projection management team. Those reports show the firms have been awarded $270 million worth of contracts for site prep, the stadium and the adjoining mixed use development. On just the stadium, the contracts are valued at $220.5 million. Lee’s right on the overarching point that the stadium project is generating contracts worth millions to businesses with offices in Cobb County. But there’s added perspective that’s needed. Some of these companies are headquartered in other states, a reality on a mammoth project and in a global economy. But to say they are Cobb County businesses is like saying the Wells Fargo down the street is local. You could argue it is and it isn’t. That can change the bottom line. We rated Lee’s statement Mostly True.	None	Tim Lee	None	None	None	2015-07-14T00:00:00	2015-06-30	['None']
pomt-10511	John McCain and George W. Bush want to spend "a trillion dollars in Iraq over the next 10 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/17/campaign-defend-america/bush-and-mccain-agree-on-troops-in-iraq/	An advertisement uses the refrain "McSame as Bush" to criticize Sen. John McCain for taking the same positions as President George W. Bush. It starts with Iraq and then goes on to taxes, energy and health care. On Iraq, the ad says, "A trillion dollars in Iraq over the next 10 years. McSame as Bush." We have a few issues with this statement, though it gets its larger point correct. The Congressional Budget Office, at the request of Congress, came up with estimates for how much it would cost to keep troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan for the next 10 years. The CBO estimated it would cost from about $480-billion to just over $1-trillion, depending on the number of troops. The analysis makes clear that troop levels in Iraq drive the dollar amount higher. The higher estimate assumes troop levels of at least 75,000 through 2013, with the number decreasing through 2017. But those are troop levels to which neither Bush nor McCain has publicly committed. McCain has said troops should stay as long as needed but that specific troop levels should be dictated by conditions on the ground and the advice of the military. Bush, meanwhile, has declined to speculate on future troop levels, saying it will be up to the next president and leaders of Iraq. Still, Bush and McCain seem to be on the same page on Iraq about not withdrawing troops rapidly. McCain has said troops could remain in Iraq for many years, comparing the situation to continuing U.S. presence in South Korea or Japan. When Bush endorsed McCain, he said, "The good news about our candidate is he'll be a new president, a man of character and courage, but he's not going to change when it comes to taking on the enemy." We find the "McSame" ad fudges the cost in Iraq by not taking into account that the $1-trillion CBO estimate includes future spending in Afghanistan as well. But the ad makes a larger point that Bush and McCain agree on their philosophy for handling the Iraq war and the withdrawal of troops. We find the statement to be Mostly True.

pomt-07568	Says new EPA water regulations would force the state to make drainage canals every bit as clean as pristine Florida river systems.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/30/free-market-florida/proposed-epa-water-quality-standards-draw-ire-thir/	Proposed rules to improve Florida water quality standards have spiraled into a political war of words pitting environmentalists and the federal Environmental Protection Agency against Florida's business interests and much of the state's political leadership. Most of the fight -- about something called numeric nutrient criteria -- probably makes little sense to you, if you heard about it at all. Here are the basics. Inhale ... Back in 1998, the EPA told all states that they had to develop limits on nutrient pollution in state waterways -- nutrients being pollutants like nitrogen and phosphorus that cause toxic algae blooms that can kill fish and cause respiratory problems and infections among swimmers, boaters and beachgoers. The states had until 2004 to come up with the limits. But 2004 came and went in Florida with no action. So environmentalists from groups like Earthjustice, Sierra Club, the Florida Wildlife Federation, the Conservancy of Southwest Florida, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and the St. Johns Riverkeeper sued the EPA. The state Department of Environmental Protection said it had been working on setting up specific nutrient limits since 2001 but had not yet finished because of the thousands of waterways in the state and the different ecological challenges they face. Anyway, the EPA settled the lawsuit with the environmentalists and said it would produce water quality rules for Florida, which it did (except for South Florida) in November 2010. Those new regulations, which set numeric limits on the nutrients allowed in all Florida and state inland waterways, take effect in March 2012. What the exact limits are is of little consequence in that you'd have to be a scientist to understand them. Suffice it to say, they're strict enough that business groups are vexed that it will cost billions of dollars to clean up because so many Florida waterways are considered "impaired" -- meaning the water isn't safe for humans or where certain aquatic life could no longer live. In an economy with 11.5 percent unemployment, the "billions" has people worried -- particularly municipalities, businesses and farmers who are producing the pollution. Enter a group calling itself Free Market Florida, which has begun a political campaign to stop the regulations from being implemented. The group's leader, Ryan Houck, was part of a business-backed group that successfully fought against a ballot initiative in 2010 known as Amendment 4 (the measure would have given voters final approval on major development proposals). Free Market Florida launched a two-minute, 30-second web video that details the threat of the new EPA criteria to Florida's economy. "Imagine that you own a restaurant, and the health department tells you that the floors on which you walk need to be as clean as the plates on which you serve food," Houck says in the ad, looking directly at the camera. "Then you open the newspaper and find out that someone's suing a fast food restaurant because their 99-cent cheeseburgers aren't as good as a $40 steak at a fancy restaurant. That's crazy, right?" The ad then cuts to Houck standing in front of a drainage canal. "Now what if I told you taxpayers, businesses, farmers and consumers had to spend billions of dollars to make drainage canals like this one every bit as clean as the water here (video cuts to Houck in front of a river) in the Wekiva River ... It may sound absurd, but it's about to happen right here in Florida." Houck goes on to call the regulations debilitating, unscientific and costly, and says that it is all part of a plan by environmentalists not to curb pollution, but to stop development. Of the many things worth fact-checking in the ad, one claim stood out to us -- Houck's suggestion that the EPA is requiring man-made drainage canals be every bit as clean as natural, flowing rivers. We asked the four stakeholders in this argument -- Houck, the environmentalists, the EPA and the state DEP -- if that's right. We got four very different answers. "We went to great lengths to make sure the ad was accurate. We're glad you're checking it." -- Ryan Houck, Free Market Florida. "That characterization is simply false." -- David Guest, lawyer for Earthjustice. "There are likely circumstances where the same criteria that applies to the Wekiva River would also apply to a nearby canal." -- Dee Ann Miller, DEP spokeswoman. "This high level of protection is likely not required for any drainage canal, therefore, the drainage canal pictured is not required to have water 'every bit as clean as the water in the Wekiva River.' " -- Davina Marraccini, EPA spokeswoman. The differing answers at first had us puzzled -- until we had an epiphany. The answers underscore just how complex these water regulations are. Understanding the regulations For starters, we need to understand just what the regulations are, and are not. The regulations affect lakes and inland rivers and streams. More generally, they affect the water we drink (categorized as Class I bodies of water) and water we use for recreation or that supports aquatic life (Class III). Class III waters would include drainage canals that link other flowing bodies of water. But the regulations wouldn't affect drainage ditches or retention ponds, necessarily. The EPA set different requirements for lakes and rivers and streams. Lakes in the state are measured based on the color and alkalinity. Criteria for rivers and streams are divided into five geographic regions in the state. Each geographic region has its own criteria. So while lakes across Florida would have the same pollution standards, rivers and streams would not. The different regions were created to account for natural phosphorus levels in some parts of the state relative to others. Now, it's critical to note -- as we already have once -- that none of the rules in place apply to the areas in South Florida (roughly south of Lake Okeechobee). Those standards will not be proposed until November 2011. The rules also do not apply to estuaries, coastal waters and wetlands. Another important point, especially for the sake of this fact check: South Florida is home to the predominant number of the state's canal systems, said Earthjustice's Guest. About 1,000 miles of canals exist as part of the "Central and Southern Florida Project," a congressionally authorized project to control flooding and supply water for municipal, industrial and agricultural uses, and for prevention of saltwater intrusion. Many but not all of those canals are in the designated South Florida region and thus exempted from the proposed standards. Comparing to the Wekiva Houck told PolitiFact Florida that the canal pictured in the video is not in South Florida, and is classified as a Class III water. If that's the case, the man-made canal would be regulated under the pending rules, and it would have to meet the same standards as natural rivers in the same geographic area. But this fact check isn't that simple. Free Market Florida chose to compare the canal to the Wekiva River, a 30-mile-long river system that starts in Central Florida and runs into the St. Johns River. The Wekiva River has been designated an Outstanding Florida Water by the state, which means it receives the "highest protection," according to state policy. "OFWs are afforded higher protection, above and beyond normal requirements of a Class III water (that is, waters suitable for fishing and swimming), to maintain outstanding water quality and prevent degradation," the EPA's Marraccini told us. "This high level of protection is likely not required for any drainage canal; therefore, the drainage canal pictured is not required to have water 'every bit as clean as the water in the Wekiva River.' " Houck argues that the levels of protection for Outstanding Florida Waters and the EPA numeric nutrient criteria counts measure different things, and therefore are immaterial. And Houck is correct that Outstanding Florida Waters are required to maintain the water quality standard that was in place in March 1, 1979 (Page 32 of these rules), not specific numeric nutrient criteria limits. Proposed rule changes There's another important and complex clarification to the pending EPA standards: The state is in the process of trying to change the rules so that many man-made canals might not have the same regulations as rivers. The state's Environmental Regulation Commission has proposed creating a subset of Class III waters that would include man-made canals. Those waters would have to meet different and lower standards than regular Class III waters. The state provides a good visual explanation of the changes they are considering on slides 21-25 of this presentation. "The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) rule does apply as the video states," said DEP spokeswoman Jennifer Diaz. "This situation exists because Florida’s current classification of rivers and streams does not distinguish between artificially created waters and natural free-flowing waters. About a year ago, the Environmental Regulation Commission (ERC) approved the creation of a new class of waters for artificially created and significantly altered surface waters. Although adopted by ERC, the new classification is subject to approval by EPA before it can become effective in Florida. Until this new classification is approved by EPA, no waters in Florida can be classified with a lower use expectation. Therefore, the nutrient criteria adopted by EPA that becomes effective in March 2012 will apply equally to man-made ditches/canals and natural streams." More caveats And yet, there are more complications. The EPA says that if the state can show -- based on a structured scientific assessment -- that a canal cannot meet its current designated use, the state could downgrade the use of the body of water and the numeric criteria counts would not apply. "Factors considered in determining whether to downgrade a classification include naturally occurring pollutants and the physical conditions of the water body, as well as whether the pollution controls required would result in substantial and widespread economic and social impact, among others," the EPA's Marraccini said. Houck says this can lead to more lawsuits. Lastly, we need to address the cost. While we're not fact-checking how much the remediation will cost, we think it's important to note there is wide disagreement on potential financial impact. The EPA says the cost to clean Florida's waters will be $135 million to $206 million a year. A private study pegged the costs astronomically higher -- anywhere from $1 billion to $8.4 billion annually. Our ruling We hope we didn't lose you in explaining these complicated requirements, and how they match up to the claim in Free Market Florida's ad. After weeks of studying this issue, we are more convinced than ever just how complicated the proposed rules to regulate Florida's water systems are. The bottom line is Free Market Florida contends that man-made drainage canals will have to meet the same standards as pristine Florida river systems like the Wekiva River in Central Florida. As the regulations stand now, it appears that drainage canals designated as Class III waters in Central Florida would have to meet the same numeric nutrient standards as the Wekiva River. But there are several caveats that could impact the validity of that claim. For one, rules haven't been implemented for South Florida (home to the many drainage canals). Two, all drainage canals wouldn't have to meet the water quality standards of the Wekiva, just the ones in the geographic area. Three, the state is proposing a change to the rules that could exempt many of the state's drainage canals. And four, the EPA also says it could exempt individual drainage canals based on scientific study. Houck said his group made sure the drainage canal they showed is in the same region as the Wekiva, which in his mind explains away the first two caveats. The third and fourth caveats are possible changes that are not a sure thing. Where does this all leave us? Houck and his group are largely right based on all the evidence we reviewed. We wish he would have explained a little more of the nuance in the video, but we also are realists. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-09661	"Ninety-eight percent of the American people will not see their taxes go up" due to the House health care bill.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/27/ed-schultz/schultz-says-health-care-bill-will-only-tax-top-2-/	Republicans have frequently criticized the Democrats' health care bills by saying that they will make Americans pay more. On Nov. 20, 2009, MSNBC host Ed Schultz fired back, arguing that "98 percent of the American people will not see their taxes go up because of this bill." On the show, Schultz didn't specify whether he was referring to the House or Senate health care reform bill. However, a spokeswoman contacted by PolitiFact said he was referring to the House bill, so we will judge him on that basis here. We looked at analyses of the House bill and found one big tax -- the so-called "millionaire's tax" -- and a few more modest ones that would hit individuals. Let's address the millionaire's tax first. Starting in 2011, the House bill would impose a 5.4 percent tax on individuals making more than $500,000 a year and on couples earning at least $1 million. This measure is expected to collect $460 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But the number of taxpayers hit by this tax would be fewer than 1 million people, or less than 1 percent of tax filers, according to Internal Revenue Service statistics. (Technical note: When calculating the percentages of Americans, the IRS uses a baseline of almost 143 million tax returns filed in 2007, rather than individual people. So we will do the same.) It should be noted that the number of people paying the "millionaire's tax" is likely to rise, since the tax thresholds are not going to be adjusted for inflation. This means that, barring widespread economic calamity, more people will be hit by the tax every year. Still, the exact amount of the increase is hard to determine, so if we stick to the published numbers, Schultz is correct. In fact, he's given himself a margin of error, saying it would be 2 percent when in fact it would be 1 percent of Americans. But there are a few other taxes in the bill that could hit individuals either directly or indirectly, and while the dollar amounts they collect are much smaller than what the "millionaire's tax" collects, the pool of people they would affect is much wider. The most notable of these taxes is a penalty assessed on people who decline to buy their own health insurance. According to the bill, people would have to pay a 2.5 percent tax on their income or the dollar amount of a basic coverage plan, whichever is lower. Some people, especially those who are young and in good health, will choose to forgo insurance and pay the tax instead, because doing so will save them money. In its analysis of the House bill, the CBO estimated that this provision would add $5 billion to $6 billion to the federal coffers annually between 2014 and 2019 -- about one-tenth the amount that the "millionaire's tax" kicks in during those years. But even though the dollar amounts involved are smaller, the number of individuals expected to pay the penalty is potentially much larger. The CBO provided the total amount of penalty revenues rather than an estimate of the number of people paying the penalty, but it's possible to reverse-engineer the number of penalty payers. Depending on the method used, the number of people paying the penalty -- assuming CBO's assumptions are right -- could range from 2.5 million to 10 million, according to our estimates and consultations with tax experts. One estimate pegs the number even higher. Working backward from the 23 million people that the CBO expects to be uninsured in 2019, the chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently estimated that most of the 18 million who are uninsured and who aren't illegal immigrants would be paying the penalty. Two other taxes in the bill bear mentioning. One is a 2.5 percent tax on most durable medical devices, which the Joint Committee on Taxation, a bipartisan arm of Congress, expects to generate $2 billion to $3 billion most years -- approximately one-twentieth of the amount collected by the "millionaire's tax." But while this is technically a tax on companies, it would almost certainly be passed along to consumers, and the number of people affected would be substantial. Because many people use medical devices in any given year, this tax would likely hit more than 2 percent of the population, even accounting for overlap with the other taxes included in the bill. The other tax worth noting is on employers who do not offer health insurance. This, like the medical device tax, is a direct tax on businesses, but much of the cost would probably be borne by employees (in lower wages) or consumers (in higher prices). The CBO expects this tax to generate between $15 billion and $25 billion a year. Experts disagree on whether it's fair to include these two taxes in the larger equation, because they hit taxpayers only indirectly, and because it's hard to quantify how many people will pay them. In the meantime, some would argue that the individual penalty isn't really a tax, because it's voluntary. For the purposes of our analysis, we think it's fair to include the individual penalty, because, like the "millionaire's tax," it will be administered through Americans' tax returns. But because we don't have good data on the device tax or the employer tax, we'll keep those out of our final equation. So, Schultz is right that less than 2 percent -- indeed, less than 1 percent -- of Americans would be subject to the millionaire's tax, at least at the beginning. But while making estimates is tricky, it's likely that many more people will choose to pay the individual penalty, most likely pushing the numbers above the 2 percent level Schultz cited. And if we had chosen to include the device tax, the percentages would climb higher still. So we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11846	"Texas Church shooter was Antifa and wanted to start (a) ‘communist revolution.’ "	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/06/yournewswirecom/fake-news-no-proof-antifa-communism-compelled-texa/	A fake news story about the killer in a mass shooting at a Texas church said the gunman was an anti-fascist looking to sow chaos in the hope of starting a civil war. The headline on a Nov. 5, 2017, story on ThirdEstateNewsGroup.com read, "Texas Church shooter was Antifa and wanted to start ‘communist revolution.’ " Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. The story appeared the same day 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley killed at least 26 people in First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. It said Kelley was "an Antifa member who vowed to start a civil war by ‘targeting white conservative churches’ and causing anarchy in the United States." The post also said he "was one of two shooters in the church, according to eyewitnesses, who also report Kelley carried an Antifa flag and told the churchgoers ‘this is a communist revolution’ before unloading on the congregation, reloading several times." None of those details have been confirmed by law enforcement agencies, or reported by reputable media outlets. Authorities said their initial investigation showed the attack was likely motivated by a family dispute, and not a broader movement. The story was an incomplete copy of a longer post on fake news website YourNewsWire.com, which attributed many of its assertions to Kelley’s alleged Facebook profile. "Devin Kelley’s Facebook page stated that he was an atheist and his interests included ‘Civil and social rights’ and ‘Civil rights’ as well as endorsements for local Texan Democratic political candidates. His page also featured photos of several high powered weapons," the post read. YourNewsWire.com claimed that they had Facebook images of Kelley and an AR-15-style rifle, although there was no indication it was the Ruger AR-556 rifle police have reported finding at the scene. We could not find a Facebook profile for Kelley, so we could not independently verify the content of his alleged profile. The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, among others, reported that the profile with those photos had been taken down shortly after the shooting. The top of the YourNewsWire.com story contained the two images, plus a third of an Antifa flag. Antifa United debunked the use of the flag image in a Facebook post. "Let's go ahead and lay this to rest right now. The far-right (badly) put together a collage of images/mock up of a FB profile and are claiming the Texas shooter uploaded a picture of his antifa flag. How do we know its fake?" the group posted on Nov. 5. "That's OUR picture. Pulled from our shop website when we had that flag design in stock. The person holding it in the picture is me. The admin of this page. In my office. You can only see a part of my torso but yeah…" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com For the record, the only official image of Kelley released by authorities was his drivers license photo. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The YourNewsWire.com post also contained an image that purported to show two individuals having a text conversation about the shooting, with one of them saying they had "talked to some people who were inside." There was no attribution for the conversation, which contained some of the bogus details YourNewsWire.com was reporting — including the Antifa flag, the number of shooters and a reference to Das Kapital, a Karl Marx book criticizing capitalism. We attempted to contact Baxter Dmitry, who is listed as the author on the post, to confirm the sources of these details, but did not get a reply. The idea that Kelley was an antifa member targeting conservatives was a popular talking point among the so-called alt-right following the shooting. Other conservative outlets focused on Kelley’s supposed atheism and Facebook "like" of CNN. The Texas Department of Public Safety confirmed on Nov. 6 that it appeared Kelley’s attack was related to a family dispute. "This was not racially motivated, it wasn’t over religious beliefs," agency spokesman Freeman Martin said in a news conference. "There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws." CNN reported that Kelley killed his wife’s grandmother, Lula White, in the attack. NBC reported he may have been targeting his mother-in-law. "The suspect’s mother-in-law attended this church," Freeman said. "We know that … she had received threatening texts from him." He declined to elaborate, saying the investigation was ongoing. Our ruling A fake news post said Kelley was Antifa and wanted to start a "communist revolution." The story originally came from YourNewsWire.com, a website we know to post articles full of bogus details. Law enforcement has not reported the sensational particulars in the site’s story. A spokesman attributed the massacre to a domestic dispute among Kelley and his family members, not connecting Kelley to Antifa or communism. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-01291	Nathan Deal saved the HOPE scholarship program.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/31/zell-miller/Ad-about-Deal-and-scholarship-Mostly-True/	Former Democratic Gov. Zell Miller has had at least a small role in this year’s two biggest elections: the race for U.S. senator and governor. First, Miller endorsed Democrat Michelle Nunn over Republican businessman David Perdue for Georgia’s open U.S. Senate seat. Then he came out for Republican Gov. Nathan Deal in his close race against state Sen. Jason Carter. In campaign ads currently airing in the Atlanta television market, Miller gives Deal credit for saving Georgia’s lottery-funded HOPE scholarship, arguably the most popular state program ever created. "HOPE was a big achievement for Georgia," Miller says in the ad. "But when it ran into trouble and headed for bankruptcy, Nathan Deal rose to the challenge. Now, thanks to Nathan, HOPE is available for the next generation." Those are strong words from Miller, considered the founder of HOPE. PolitiFact decided to take a closer look. First, a little background on the merit-based scholarship program that inspired a federal tax credit and persuaded more than a dozen states to start their own lotteries and scholarship programs. In 1991, newly elected Gov. Zell Miller proposed legislation calling for a constitutional amendment to create a state lottery. Voters approved the amendment a year later, funding three distinct programs: the HOPE scholarship; universal voluntary pre-kindergarten for 4-year-olds; and instructional technology. That third program was later abandoned. The first HOPE scholarship was awarded in 1993, and by 2010, more than $5.2 billion in scholarships and grants had been awarded to more than 2.9 million students attending Georgia colleges, universities and technical colleges. The popular program was simple: earn and keep a 3.0 grade-point average and receive free tuition to a public college. But Deal and lawmakers were presented with a dire forecast heading into the 2011 General Assembly session, Deal’s first as governor. If changes weren’t made to HOPE and pre-k by the fiscal year that started July 2012, all the lottery’s reserves would be depleted. Some of the needs of pre-k and HOPE also would not be met, lawmakers were told. Deal led the revamp effort. He included some Democratic ideas in the final bill. For instance, House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams pushed for, and won, retaining $13 million in the program to cover technical college students taking remedial classes. Her negotiations with Deal also kept grants for 5,000 students to continue at proprietary schools such as DeVry – and met some pushback from Democrats angry at her cooperation. But Abrams gave a rare impassioned speech during the House floor vote, noting the program remained a way to invest in Georgia students and included both political parties’ priorities. She stood next to Deal as he signed what would be the signature legislation of his first year as governor. The biggest change to emerge: students with a 3.0 grade-point average would no longer receive a full college scholarship. Those would be reserved for about 10 percent of students -- valedictorians, salutatorians and those with at least a 3.7 GPA and a combined 1200 on the math and reading sections of the SAT. These students, now known as Zell Miller scholars, also would be required to maintain a 3.3 GPA in college to keep the full scholarship. Other major changes eliminated the automatic increases in scholarship awards to match tuition increases and raised the GPA for technical school grants from 2.0 to 3.0. Renewed criticism of the changes came the following year, when almost 9,000 students lost the technical school grants because they couldn’t meet the higher academic standards. Thousands more did not enroll because they couldn’t afford to pay what HOPE no longer covered, according to the commissioner of the state’s technical college system. By 2013, lawmakers reverted to the 2.0 GPA for technical college students, who tend to be older and work full time while attending school. Carter, this year’s Democratic nominee for governor, was among those who didn’t agree with the changes that were made. Carter and Senate Democrats favored a $140,000 family income cap, a proposal GOP leaders dismissed as fiscally impractical. Carter has maintained his criticism of Deal on HOPE during this year’s campaign, saying the governor’s to blame for tens of thousands of students no longer receiving HOPE. Earlier this year, the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute issued a report showing that the post-2011 scholarship program, which some have dubbed "HOPE Lite," continues to pay less and less of the costs of attending college. At Georgia Tech, for example, a HOPE scholarship that once covered all tuition and mandatory fees, plus a book allowance, now covers 59 percent of tuition costs. At the University of Georgia, a scholarship pays 62 percent of tuition costs, the researchers found. The number of HOPE recipients dropped from about 250,000 in 2010-2011 to about 200,000 in 2013-2014, and scholarship and grant awards in that period were down about $215 million, from $747.6 million to $532.9 million, according to the Georgia Student Finance Commission’s website. We tried to get Miller’s take on those major changes but could not reach him. But when our colleague at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Janel Davis, spoke with him a week ago, he said Deal was true to his goal for HOPE. "He held to that original thinking of mine that it was for the best students, not the best students who might have low-income families, but just the best students period," Miller said. "I still think it serves a wonderful purpose, and that’s to give students an incentive to do well." Our ruling With bipartisan backing from the General Assembly, Deal made changes that eased financial pressures on the popular HOPE scholarship. But the program also changed significantly. The program is still making higher education more affordable for many students. But now, only about 10 percent of HOPE recipients receive scholarships that cover 100 percent of their tuition costs. You could make the argument that Miller makes here: Deal -- with a little help -- saved the HOPE scholarship. But Miller’s declaration needs a bit of context to be fully understood.

pomt-01633	Says Thom Tillis "gives tax breaks to yacht and jet owners."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/26/senate-majority-pac/ad-says-senate-candidate-thom-tillis-gave-tax-brea/	Supporters of Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., say giving tax breaks to yacht and jet owners is one way that her opponent has shown he is out-of-touch with the state’s average families. In the North Carolina race for U.S. Senate, much of the debate has focused on Republican candidate Thom Tillis’ actions as a state leader. In 2013, the North Carolina government received national attention for a wave of conservative legislation. The Republican-dominated General Assembly -- with Tillis as speaker of the House -- passed laws increasing voter ID requirements, lowering business regulations, upping restrictions on abortion providers, tightening education spending, trimming unemployment benefits and changing the tax code. In another fact-check, we found that the controversial tax code changes reduced taxes for everyone -- but much more for wealthier people than lower-income people. Supporters of Hagan, the incumbent, keep harping on this point about the tax code in particular: Tillis supports tax breaks for yacht and jet owners. You can hear that claim here, here and here. Most recently, we heard it in an ad from Senate Majority PAC, a liberal political action committee. "When it comes to education, Thom Tillis is gambling with our future," the ad’s narration says. "As speaker, he cut nearly $500 million from education, eliminating 9,000 teaching positions and overcrowding classrooms. Now he’s promising more lottery money for education? We’ve heard that broken promise before. Meanwhile, Tillis gives tax breaks for yacht and private jet owners." Some of the other ads said Tillis "protected" tax breaks for yacht and jet owners, but others -- including this one -- say he gave them the tax breaks. We decided to look into the claim a little more closely. N.C. tax code In 2013, under Tillis’ leadership, North Carolina lawmakers passed legislation to overhaul the tax code -- which hadn’t had comprehensive reform since the 1930s. The primary change was switching the income tax from a progressive rate to a flat rate. The law also eliminated tax holidays, sales tax exemptions and the State Earned Income Tax Credit, which is a refundable tax credit for low-income workers. So what did the law do for yacht and jet owners? Well, nothing, really. It preserved the tax breaks that were already in place. Since 1991, boats and aircraft -- a broader category than just yachts and jets -- have had a sales tax rate of 3 percent, with a $1,500 cap. This means that anyone who buys a boat or plane worth $50,000 or more pays exactly $1,500 in taxes. The rate had been 2 percent from 1969 to 1991, and the cap was $300 until 1989, according to a document prepared by the North Carolina General Assembly research division. While Tillis and other Republican state lawmakers did not create tax breaks for plane and boat owners, they left the prior tax breaks in place. According to the News and Observer in Raleigh, the law only cut 48 of the more than 300 tax breaks included in the tax code. Additionally, the legislature did not include the boat and airplane tax breaks in a bundle of loopholes that received additional scrutiny in a study committee. It’s also worth noting that Tillis, though he was speaker at the time and supported the bill, was not an author or primary sponsor of the tax code legislation. The cap on boat and aircraft sales taxes amounts to $10 million in lost annual revenue, according to the N.C. Budget and Tax Center, a liberal advocacy group. Our ruling A Senate Majority PAC ad said, "Thom Tillis gives tax breaks to yacht and jet owners." North Carolina lawmakers, under Tillis’ leadership, overhauled the state’s tax code in 2013. But they left in place a 23-year-old tax break for boats and aircraft. By using the word "give," the statement suggests Tillis created the tax breaks, which he didn’t. Because the ad turns inaction into action, we rate this claim False.	None	Senate Majority PAC	None	None	None	2014-08-26T14:35:19	2014-08-20	['None']
pomt-03931	The sequester "won’t consider whether we’re cutting some bloated program that has outlived its usefulness, or a vital service that Americans depend on every single day. It doesn’t make those distinctions."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-sequestration-cuts-will-be-indis/	Over the past few years, President Barack Obama and Congress have lurched from one fiscal crisis to another. The latest, known as sequestration, would impose across-the-board cuts on most types of federal spending. To pressure Congress to prevent sequestration by the March 1, 2013, deadline, Obama gave a speech on Feb. 19 surrounded by law enforcement officers. "Emergency responders like the ones who are here today -- their ability to help communities respond to and recover from disasters will be degraded," Obama said. "Border Patrol agents will see their hours reduced. FBI agents will be furloughed. Federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go." Dire warnings about budget cuts are a popular tactic in the nation's capital sometimes called the "Washington Monument strategy" because federal agencies will sometimes threaten to close popular things such as the monument to build opposition. Separately, we are fact-checking Obama's specific warnings. In this item, we're exploring his broader comment that a sequester "won’t consider whether we’re cutting some bloated program that has outlived its usefulness, or a vital service that Americans depend on every single day. It doesn’t make those distinctions." We checked with experts in federal budgeting law to see whether they thought Obama’s explanation was accurate. Ways in which the sequester doesn’t make distinctions in federal spending cuts When the White House and Republicans had a showdown over the debt ceiling in 2011, they set up the sequester as something of a poison pill -- budget cuts that would be so harmful they would force both sides to make a deal. Adapting a process first outlined in a 1985 law, they defined the rules this way: "Except as otherwise provided, the same percentage sequestration shall apply to all programs, projects, and activities within a budget account (with programs, projects, and activities as delineated in the appropriation Act or accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering that account, or for accounts not included in appropriation Acts, as delineated in the most recently submitted President’s Budget)." That means the cuts are pretty much across-the-board, which means the sequester "is indeed indiscriminate," said Ronald M. Levin, a law professor at Washington University School of Law. John F. Cooney, a Washington lawyer who led the legal team that implemented a federal sequester under President Ronald Reagan in 1986, concurs. In a column published in November 2012, he wrote that sequestration requires a "uniform percentage reduction on all covered programs — good and bad alike — without differentiation. … The President has no discretion in implementing the reductions. He must follow Congressional directives and may not, for example, shift required reductions from Treasury to Agriculture." Even the fact that some programs are exempted from the sequester supports Obama’s point. Certain programs are protected from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. The administration will also be able to shield military personnel from cuts. Meanwhile, Medicare cuts are limited to 2 percent -- well below the 7.9 percent cuts that most types of defense discretionary funding will tentatively face, and the 5.3 percent cuts in store for non-defense discretionary funding. This list of exemptions "is the result of tradition and legislative negotiations, rather than a defensible process of prioritizing cuts based on explicit criteria," said Roy T. Meyers, political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who specializes in budget matters. "So there has already been some prioritization, but whether it is sensible or not is a separate question." So Obama has some justification for saying the sequester doesn't see distinctions between effective and ineffective government programs. Ways in which the sequester does allow for some flexibility However, Obama’s statement is somewhat misleading because, within the specific programs targeted for cuts, federal managers have a fair amount of discretion about what to reduce. "Policymakers like to point out the most awful possible outcomes, but these aren’t necessarily how it will play out," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. Under sequestration, uniform cuts must be applied to any "program, project or activity" that isn’t otherwise exempted. The Department of Defense alone has more than 2,500 of these programs, projects and activities, and other agencies have thousands more, according to Cooley. The Office of Management and Budget has already outlined how it would apply the cuts to some 1,200 budget accounts. However, within a given program, officials don’t have to cut every line item equally. Within a given program, "the agencies will have great discretion in determining how to allocate the reductions, utilizing the three tools available: cutting public services, furloughing staff, and cutting government contracts," Cooley wrote. Because different agencies have different cost breakdowns, the pattern of reductions will vary from agency to agency. Some agencies may see widespread furloughs; others might cut back on contractors, or award fewer grants, or delay or cancel orders for supplies. In fact, Obama’s deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jeffrey Zients, wrote a memo on Jan. 14, 2013, offering "guiding principles" for federal managers to use as they make cuts. These principles include: • Using "any available flexibility to reduce operational risks and minimize impacts on the agency's core mission." • Safeguarding projects that, if cut, would "potentially have a significant deleterious effect on the agency's mission or otherwise raise life, safety, or health concerns." • Using tools such as hiring freezes, releasing temporary employees, not renewing contract hires, and authorizing early buyouts. Despite these powers of discretion over how to cut, the end result still bolsters Obama’s argument that the cuts won’t take into account the quality of a program. The kinds of cuts Zients urged are based on expediency, Meyers said, "not on whether a program is more effective or has a higher priority than other programs." Our ruling In explaining the sequester, Obama oversimplified by glossing over the tools federal managers can use their own discretion to make cuts -- tools that his own Office of Management and Budget is encouraging managers to use. However, Obama is right that the sequester does require uniform cuts to thousands of programs, with nothing to focus steeper cuts on ineffective or less important programs.

pomt-07989	Says that before health care reform, one of every three health care dollars spent -- more than $800 billion a year -- didn't go for health care.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/18/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-claims-chunk-health-care-dolla/	Republicans took control of the House of Representatives this month with the announced intention of dismantling the new health care law. They started by approving rules that would permit the legislation's repeal without any requirement to make up resulting losses in revenue. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Health Care Law Act would reduce federal budget deficits by $145 billion over 10 years. Repealing the legislation (which Republicans formally labeled "the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act") would increase federal deficits $230 billion over the next decade. Rep. Dennis Kucinich is among defenders of the health care law. One of its benefits "is to make sure that more of the health care premium dollar goes for, in fact, health care," the Cleveland Democrat said in an interview on CNN. "You have to keep in mind," he said, "that prior to the passage of the health care reform bill, one out of $3, of every health care dollar spent, went for corporate profits, stock options, executive salaries, advertising and marketing, the cost of paperwork -- that was over $800 billion a year -- didn't go for health care." That's a lot of expenses. PolitiFact Ohio thought it would check Kucinich’s statement. The congressman's staff said his primary source for the breakdown was a much-cited study by Drs. Steffie Woolhandler and David Himmelstein of Harvard Medical School. Published in 2003 in the New England Journal of Medicine, the peer-reviewed study analyzed administrative costs of the U.S. health system, and found that they consume 31 percent of health spending. Kucinich's estimate of the total tab comes from the the official estimate of total health care spending in the United States, the National Health Expenditure Accounts issued by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Their latest report, issued this month, said that health expenditures in 2009 reached $2.5 trillion. (The figure represented the slowest rate of increase in 50 years, which was attributed to people losing jobs and health insurance and deferring medical care.) We did the math. Thirty-one percent of that comes to $775 billion -- close to $800 billion, but not "over" it. But the 31 percent figure might be too low, and a higher percentage could push costs past $800 billion. Kucinich’s staff noted that the study by Woolhandler and Himmelstein looked at administrative costs for the year 1999. Costs since then, they said, reflect "immense growth in (health coverage) plans more complicated to administer." Going back to 1970, the number of physicians has increased by less than 200 percent while the number of administrators has increased by 3,000 percent, according to the federal government and an analysis by Himmelstein and Woolhandler. Woolhandler was lead researcher for the 2003 study of administrative costs. Since then, she told us, "I think it is likely costs have gone up just a little bit as a share" of total expenditures. "The reason they haven't gone up hugely as a share is that they were so high to begin with." So does that mean the annual cost could top $800 billion? Woolhandler told us she thinks Kucinich’s numbers are correct. But she, too, is offering an educated opinion, rather than a statement rooted in new numbers and up-to-date data. So where does that leave him on the Truth-O-Meter? What is clear is that Kucinich’s main point, that a significant amount of the money spent on health care doesn’t go toward actual care, is accurate. The percentage figure and total dollars figure he cites both are close, but high, as compared to the primary source of data his staff provided us. He may not have overstated the numbers, given what has happened in the health care industry, but current data isn’t available. That’s a point that needs clarification for full understanding. On that basis we rate his statement as Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2011-01-18T06:00:00	2010-12-31	['None']

pomt-14695	We have cut "our deficits by almost three-quarters."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/12/barack-obama/we-have-cut-our-deficits-three-fourths-obama-state/	A year ago, President Barack Obama said during his 2015 State of the Union address that the United States has seen "our deficits cut by two-thirds" during his tenure. We rated that claim Mostly True. During his 2016 State of the Union address, Obama raised the bar. After citing some of his administration’s economic accomplishments, he said, "We’ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters." Has the deficit-reduction expanded during the past year? We took a closer look. Let’s start with an important reminder: The deficit is not the same as the debt. A country’s deficit is the difference between what the government collects in revenues and spends in one year. The national debt, by contrast, is the accumulation of all annual deficits minus any annual surpluses. When we checked Obama’s assertion a year ago, he compared his first budget year in office -- 2009 -- to 2014, using the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product, or GDP. Economists consider this a valid way to measure the size of the deficit -- in fact, for most purposes, it’s the best way, since it factors in the economy’s change over time. Here’s the recent history of the deficit as a percentage of GDP. The years 2009 through 2014 come from historical data maintained by the Office of Management and Budget. The 2015 figure is the most recent estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, released in August 2015. Fiscal year Deficit as a percentage of GDP 2009 9.8 2010 8.7 2011 8.5 2012 6.8 2013 4.1 2014 2.8 2015 2.4 According to this data, the deficit as a percentage of GDP has fallen by 76 percent -- almost exactly what Obama said. If you use dollars rather than percentage of GDP, the decline is a bit smaller but still pretty close -- 70 percent. That said, experts have told us that while Obama's math may be correct, it's missing some important caveats. First, it's important to note that the deficit swelled in 2009 partly because of the massive stimulus program to jumpstart the cratering economy. This temporarily elevated level set the stage for the unusually precipitous decline. "This is not to say that that the large deficit was his fault, but if one used the 2008 deficit as a frame of reference, the comparison would be quite different," Alan Auerbach, University of California Berkeley professor of economics and law, told us a year ago. Also, some economists we’ve consulted pointed out that the 2009 fiscal year was Obama’s first year in office, and so not necessarily a good starting point since he had little control over the spending in that year. There's another issue. Princeton University economics professor Harvey Rosen told us the more important question is whether Obama has put the government on a path that will keep deficits stable. "And the answer is no," Rosen said, because entitlement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, have not had substantial reform. The long-term forecast for the deficit illustrates this point. Absent substantial reform, the Congressional Budget Office expects a few more years of short-term deficit decreases followed by bigger shortfalls in 10 and 20 years. The most recent projections show deficits as a percentage of GDP remaining lower than today’s level through 2018, then beginning an upward curve. Between 2019 and 2022, the deficit is set to rise from 2.8 percent of GDP to 3.7 percent of GDP. It is not projected to fall below 3.4 percent through 2025. We should also note that the picture on the debt is not as rosy as it is for the deficit. When Obama took office, the debt held by the public stood at $6.3 trillion. Since then, it has more than doubled to $13.6 trillion. Finally, presidents don’t move the economy on their own (the economy can be affected for good or ill by global trends and technological change) and must cooperate with Congress when steering fiscal policy. Our ruling Obama said we have cut "our deficits by almost three-quarters." The numbers check out if you start with fiscal year 2009, his first year in office. But it’s worth remembering that 2009 had a historically high deficit, and that projections show the deficit increasing again in just a couple years. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-15216	"Prior to 1962, everybody prayed before school started," and "the Bible was the principal textbook in all schools."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/10/rafael-cruz/rafael-cruz-father-ted-cruz-says-everybody-prayed-/	Rafael Cruz is more than just a proud parent to his son, Republican presidential candidate and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Rafael is seen as Ted’s political "super-surrogate," appearing at Tea Party and 9-12 meetings as well as various Republican clubs to speak on his son’s behalf. In a recent interview with the Austin American-Statesman, Cruz talked about more than just his son’s campaign. He lamented court decisions that closed a more God-centric era in public schools. "Prior to 1962, everybody prayed before school started. In 1962, the Supreme Court banned prayer," said Cruz, who is a nondenominational pastor. "In 1963, they banned the Bible from school. Prior to that, the Bible was the principal textbook in all schools." We were curious about whether Bible reading and prayer in public schools were as prevalent as Cruz claimed before the Supreme Court stepped in. PunditFact could not reach Cruz for comment, but from what we found it looks like Cruz senior was overstating the breadth of religion in schools. What superintendents said Were school-sponsored prayers and Bible readings really as widespread as Cruz says? Far from it. "The history of school prayer and Bible reading before the 1960s is complicated, but it is certainly not the case that there was a universal practice on school prayer that applied to all students," said Richard Layton, co-author of the 2014 book For the Civic Good: The Liberal Case for Teaching Religion in the Public Schools and an associate professor of religion at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Layton pointed us to a 1961 article from the Religious Education journal, which contained a survey from around 1960 that dealt with school prayer and Bible reading. The survey was mailed to 4,000 school district superintendents around the nation. About 55 percent responded. The survey includes many categories, but there was one clear takeaway: The country was divided on religious education, Bible reading and prayer in schools. Almost half of respondents said "homeroom devotional services" were not held in the school district. Of the superintendents who said their districts oversaw homeroom devotionals, only one-third said that all district schools had them, while 17 percent said that only some schools did. They were similarly divided on Bible readings. About 42 percent of superintendents said that schools in their system had them. The remaining 58 percent said readings did not happen in their district. Different schools incorporated religion and Bible discussion in different ways, but the Bible was not the "principal textbook," experts told us. While Bibles may have been passed out in certain schools with other textbooks, this was not always the case. Some schools read passages from the Bible over the speaker, and in others teachers read scripture in front of the class. Whatever their district’s practice, the majority of superintendents felt that their school district was dealing with religion in an "adequate way." What state laws said State laws from the early 20th century also show a divide on religion in schools. A 1926 report indicated that only seven states (in addition to the District of Columbia) required Bible reading in all public schools. Another seven states allowed the Bible to be read in public schools but did not require it. Numerous other states were silent on the issue. By 1946, a survey showed that the number of states permitting or requiring Bible reading had increased, according to the 1950 book Church and State in the United States. Thirteen states (and Washington, D.C.) required Bible reading, and 25 more allowed Bible reading. Generally, Bible reading and "homeroom devotional services" in public schools were far more prevalent in the southern and northeastern states than elsewhere in the country. Supreme Court’s sweeping change The Supreme Court decisions that Cruz mentioned had the biggest impact on schools that sponsored Bible readings or prayers. In the 1962 case Engel vs. Vitale, the court overturned a New York law requiring a nondenominational prayer at the beginning of the school day. Although students could opt not to participate, the court reasoned that the law violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which was aimed at preventing government interference with religion. A year later, the court ruled in Abington School District vs. Schempp that school-sponsored Bible readings were also unconstitutional, using similar reasoning as in Engel vs. Vitale. The Supreme Court decisions resulted in bans on government- and school-sponsored prayers and Bible readings in public schools. Private prayers and personal Bible reading were still allowed at school, so they were not entirely "banned." Subsequent cases in 1990 and 2000 have dealt with student religious groups meeting on school grounds after hours and student-led prayer before games. (The latter was ruled unconstitutional.) Our ruling Cruz said, "Prior to 1962, everybody prayed before school started," and "the Bible was the principal textbook in all schools." Surveys and state laws from the era show school prayer and Bible reading were not as universal as Cruz said. Survey results of superintendents from the time show the nation’s schools were split roughly down the middle when it came to either religious activity. State laws also varied widely, though 38 had laws that at least permitted it (13 required it). This means the Bible textbook was also not the "principal textbook" in "all" schools. Cruz exaggerated the scope of school prayer and Bible readings before the Supreme Court decisions. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-04830	Says Barack Obama "robbed Medicare (of) $716 billion to pay for ... Obamacare."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/15/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-said-barack-obama-first-history-rob-me/	Medicare is a hot topic in the presidential race since Mitt Romney picked U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan to be his running mate. Ryan, R-Wis., is the head of the Budget Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives and the architect of a plan to dramatically restructure Medicare. Ryan’s plan is for people who are under age 55 now. It would give them voucher-like credits to buy traditional fee-for-service Medicare or competing private insurance plans. (The credits are sometimes called "premium support.") Though House Republicans voted overwhelmingly for Ryan’s plan, polling shows public opinion is mixed, and Democrats have vigorously attacked the proposal as a voucher plan and worse. The Romney campaign, meanwhile, refutes those charges by saying President Barack Obama has targeted Medicare himself. Here’s how Romney put it in an interview with 60 Minutes shortly after selecting Ryan: "There's only one president that I know of in history that robbed Medicare, $716 billion to pay for a new risky program of his own that we call Obamacare." Here, we’re checking whether Obama "robbed" Medicare of $716 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare. $700 billion from Medicare? The claim that Obama cut $700 billion out of Medicare is relatively new. Not long ago, the oft-cited number was $500 billion. How did he manage to cut another $200 billion when no one was looking? First things first: Neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut a dollar amount from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. At the time the law was passed, those reductions amounted to $500 billion over the next 10 years. What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. Under the new law, the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future. The health care law tries to limit that growth, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would "cut" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context. Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. Also, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion. The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion. So it’s timing that’s making the cuts bigger, not changes to Medicare. Historic steal for ‘Obamacare’? Now, to address the word "robbed." We know the civility is at a low ebb these days, but we think it’s worth pointing out that the money was not robbed in any literal sense of the word. Congress passed the law through its normal process, and the proposal was debated out in the open during the many weeks that the final law was being negotiated. At the time the health care law was being finalized and passed, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending. That spending is primarily to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. But some new spending increases Medicare coverage for prescription drugs for seniors. Finally, Romney said Obama is the "only one president that I know of in history that robbed Medicare." In reality, several presidents have reduced Medicare spending. We reviewed this history in detail in a fact-check of Romney’s statement from December, "Only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors in this country . . . Barack Obama." We rated that False. Many presidents have sought to rein in Medicare spending. Here are a few highlights from that fact-check: • President Ronald Reagan cut Medicare by reducing payments to hospitals, and he cut benefits by raising deductibles. • President George H.W. Bush cut benefits by repealing a law that would have expanded coverage for drugs and catastrophic illness. • President Bill Clinton cut Medicare by changing payments to doctors and other providers, which could be considered to have an indirect effect on beneficiaries. Our ruling Romney said, "There's only one president that I know of in history that robbed Medicare, $716 billion to pay for a new risky program of his own that we call Obamacare." The only element of truth here is that the health care law seeks to reduce future Medicare spending, and the tally of those cost reductions over the next 10 years is $716 billion. The money wasn’t "robbed," however, and other presidents have made similar reductions to the Medicare program. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-12766	"You can almost pinpoint half of the gun violence deaths to two or three specific sections in the city. They are just areas of devastation, economically and otherwise."	true	/illinois/statements/2017/feb/23/richard-durbin/Durbin-right-about-geography-of-Chicago-violence/	Politicians and national media once again have turned their attention to Chicago’s violence. The city’s nearly 800 murders in 2016 prompted President Donald Trump to repeatedly liken parts of Chicago to sections of the Middle East. Trump also has said he will "send in the feds" to "fix the horrible carnage," but no signs of federal intervention have been seen so far. Trump’s focus on Chicago, combined with the recent murders of 2-year-old Lavontay White Jr., 11-year-old Takiya Holmes and 12-year-old Kanari Bowers, has only heightened interest in what is happening in Chicago. The subject came up as MSNBC’s Willie Geist interviewed U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., on Feb. 15. Geist asked Durbin why Chicago is so violent, especially in comparison to other major cities like New York, which saw a historically low murder rate in 2016. (The Chicago violence segment starts at 3:54) Durbin made the argument that Chicago, as a whole, doesn’t suffer from constant violence. He said the gun violence only occurs in a few areas. "You can almost pinpoint half of the gun violence deaths to two or three specific sections in the city," Durbin said. "They are just areas of devastation, economically and otherwise." Is Chicago’s violence actually that concentrated? Murder across neighborhoods We reached out to Durbin’s office to see where he found this data. His press secretary, John Normoyle, pointed to a Chicago Tribune article published on Feb. 1 titled, "Violence in Chicago still stubbornly high; Trump reacts again." The story cites Chicago Police Department Superintendent Eddie Johnson who, during a press conference, said half of Chicago’s homicides in January occurred in three police districts: Englewood on the South Side and the West Side districts of Harrison and Austin. We followed up with the Police Department’s News Affairs Office to verify that statement. The department’s director of communication, Frank Giancamilli, sent back a press release from Feb. 1 that says the Englewood, Austin and Harrison police districts approximately made up half of Chicago’s 51 murders in January. The distinction is important. Data from each police district crime map shows a total of 22 of the 51 January murders can be attributed to the Englewood, Austin and Harrison districts. It’s a significant chunk — 43 percent — but not exactly half. ‘It’s a tale of two cities’ Loyola University criminology professor Arthur Lurigio said violence in these areas is hardly news. Violence has been rampant in the Englewood, Austin and Harrison areas since the 1960s, Lurigio said. "Without even seeing the data, I would have picked those three districts," Lurigio said. "These communities haven’t changed, and I expect them to continue being this violent if they experience the same conditions." This brings us to the second part of Durbin’s statement: The areas in which gun violence is concentrated are plagued by other problems that feed the violence. "Homicide doesn’t occur in a vacuum," Lurigio said. "Violence is a public health problem, but people only view it in a criminal aspect. People in these areas are plagued by other social, economic and health problems. Things like housing foreclosures, high unemployment and school closures. So a lot of young men devalue their own life because they don’t see a future. There’s no compunction about pulling the trigger." There’s data backing up Durbin and Lurigio’s claims. According to U.S. Census data compiled by the Chicago Tribune, both Austin and Englewood have an unemployment rate of 21 percent compared to an 11.1 percent rate in Chicago overall. East Garfield Park and West Garfield Park both make up parts of the Harrison Police District and have unemployment rates of 15 and 25 percent, respectively. Likewise, those neighborhoods have considerably lower individual incomes and higher percentages of households in poverty than Chicago as a whole. "Chicago is like a tale of two cities," Lurigio said "It’s a city that’s been utterly neglected in some parts. Give the city money to repair infrastructure where its needs it most. Fix the primary school systems in these areas. Don’t call murder a crime problem when the answers lie in investing in these blighted areas." Our ruling In a recent interview with MSNBC, Durbin spoke about gun violence in Chicago. Durbin said of Chicago, "You can almost pinpoint half of the gun violence deaths to two or three specific sections in the city. They are just areas of devastation economically and otherwise." Durbin’s office cited a news article that used statistics from the Chicago Police Department. A press release from CPD News Affairs Office confirms this. It read: "Three districts (7, 11, 15) are responsible for approximately 50% of murders in January 2017." We confirmed these statistics by looking at data available on crime maps posted on the CPD Harrison, Englewood and Austin district websites. Durbin’s assessment of Chicago’s homicides is accurate. He did say you can "almost" attribute half of deaths to a few communities and 43 percent are in certain west and south side neighborhoods. A crime expert told us these trends have been consistent over the last five decades. Finally, we found data that shows there is a correlation between areas with high violence and economic hardship. For these reasons, we rate Durbin’s claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5484015b-2ce9-4e5a-baf3-bd3e12527b40	None	Richard Durbin	None	None	None	2017-02-23T14:30:16	2017-02-15	['None']
pomt-11168	"There’s more union jobs growing in Texas, which is a right-to-work state, than in Illinois, and factory workers make more money in Texas than they do in Illinois."	half-true	/illinois/statements/2018/may/24/bruce-rauner/rauner-says-texas-more-union-job-friendly-illinois/	At a recent forum on workforce participation, Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner claimed the state couldn’t give away, let alone sell, a shuttered auto plant in downstate Normal "because our regulations are so hostile to business and our taxes are so high." In fact, Rauner’s own administration last year lured a new tenant for the old Mitsubishi Motors factory, an electric car startup. That misrepresentation sparked a lot of controversy, but something else the governor said at the forum also caught our attention. He claimed laid-off Mitsubishi workers, all union members, told him they were moving to Texas. "There’s more union jobs growing in Texas, which is a right-to-work state, than in Illinois, and factory workers make more money in Texas than they do in Illinois. That’s where the opportunity is," Rauner said. Rauner has long attacked union power in Illinois as an impediment to the state’s economic vitality. Usually, however, he compares Illinois’ job growth to neighboring Indiana, which like Texas is also a so-called right-to-work state where union membership can’t be compelled. That got us wondering: Is Rauner right that the job picture is brighter for union members in Texas? And why is he now pointing to the Lone Star state, with an energy-rich economy that has little in common with Illinois, instead of Indiana next door? Apples to...grapefruits Rauner often complains that pro-union, anti-business policies of Illinois Democrats have worked to the advantage of other neighboring states, especially Indiana. "They’re kicking our tails," is a frequent refrain. But new data have rendered such comparisons problematic, making Texas a more appealing focus despite vast differences from Illinois in economy and population. In 2017, while Illinois saw a modest gain in its unionized workforce, Indiana lost more than 37,000 union jobs, according to data from Unionstats.com, a long-running tally of federally compiled employment numbers for union workers created by professors at Georgia State University and Trinity University. What’s more, other federal data show Illinois workers employed in the manufacturing sector — the closest approximation to Rauner’s reference to factory workers — make an average $9,200 more per year than their counterparts in Indiana. A Rauner spokeswoman did not respond to our questions about why the governor in his recent talk stressed comparisons with Texas and not Indiana or other neighboring right-to-work states. She did, however, point us to U.S. Census Bureau data showing that Texas in 2017 added more than 52,000 private-sector union jobs while Illinois lost over 9,000. The distinction between private-sector versus total union jobs, however, was not one made by Rauner during the event. As for pay, his spokeswoman noted that other federal data show manufacturing workers in Texas make, on average, $100-a-week more than their Illinois counterparts. In the strictest sense, then, Rauner’s assertions about Texas pan out. But labor experts cautioned against drawing conclusions about employment opportunity based solely on the number of union jobs gained or lost. Robert Bruno, director of the the labor education program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said it’s important to bear in mind the vast difference in scale between Illinois and Texas, which has more than twice the population and more than twice the overall workforce. Texas is adding more union jobs because it’s adding more jobs period and is much bigger than Illinois, not because it’s more union-friendly, Bruno said. "Some of (those jobs) happened to be union jobs and as a result, they're added to the roll," Bruno said. "They don't indicate that you're in a workforce where workers found it easy and doable to join a union." Indeed, less than 5 percent of the total Texas workforce is comprised of union members, a share no higher than it was a decade ago despite growth in the number of union jobs, according to Unionstats. In Illinois, the comparable figure was 15 percent, up slightly over the last decade. "Your chance of finding a union job is going to be much greater in a state that has twice the percentage of union employers, twice the percent of union members and one half the size of the labor force than if you jump into this enormous pool in Texas," Bruno said. Another key point the governor leaves out: what’s behind Texas’ surging union employment figures. Michael Hicks, an economics professor at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., said Texas’ gains in manufacturing employment are largely a byproduct of its booming energy sector, an artifact of geological luck that Illinois and most other states can’t match. And energy jobs also tend to pay more than other manufacturing jobs. "When you're a state like Texas that's growing manufacturing, industrial jobs — natural gas, pipelines, refineries — those jobs are likely to be unionized and they’re going to be expanding," said Hicks, who tracks job trends in the Midwest. Our ruling While making a point about Illinois’ business climate, Rauner said "there’s more union jobs growing in Texas, which is a right-to-work state, than in Illinois and factory workers make more money in Texas than they do in Illinois." His office sent us data indicating Texas grew more union jobs, and at a faster clip, than did Illinois. It also pointed to federal data showing manufacturing workers in Texas made $100 more per week on average than their Illinois counterparts. But such numbers belie the fact that Illinois couldn’t be Texas if it tried. The more populous state has grown its manufacturing — and therefore, its union — jobs thanks to a booming economy that’s received a major boost from its oil and gas industry, something Illinois thanks to its geography and geology simply doesn’t have. And despite a stalled economy in Illinois, union workers still make up a greater share of the workforce in Illinois than they do in Texas, which, according to labor expert Robert Bruno, is a more accurate indicator of employment opportunity for those seeking a union job. Rauner’s claims about union jobs growth and pay disparities in the manufacturing sector pencil out on paper. But his selective use of data leaves out important context and distorts trends far more nuanced than he describes. For that reason, we rate the governor’s assertions Half True.

pomt-13348	The U.S. Senate has "one manufacturer — that'd be me."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/04/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-right-he-only-manufacturer-us-senate/	When you hear the words "Russ Feingold," Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson wants you to think "career politician." A recurring theme of Johnson’s campaign against Feingold, the Democrat who Johnson unseated in 2010, is their differing backgrounds. As Johnson tells it, he rose from a dishwashing job to help start a manufacturing company, while Feingold has been a politician for 34 years, collecting his income from taxpayers. Such is the gist of a recent ad from Johnson’s campaign, one that — as in the 2010 campaign — features him at a whiteboard. "In 2010, there were 57 lawyers, zero manufacturers and way too many career politicians in the United States Senate," Johnson says in the ad. The tallies are shown on the whiteboard, though it does not offer a number to represent the career politicians. "Today, there are 54 lawyers, 1 manufacturer — that’d be me — and still way too many career politicians," he continues. "And now Senator Feingold wants to add another one — himself." We decided to check Johnson’s math. What’s in a job? Johnson’s camp said his numbers came from the official biographies of the 100 current U.S. Senators posted on Congress.gov. He said there were 54 lawyers in the Senate; a review of the biographies confirms 54 senators graduated from law school. While just 51 reported having careers in law in a Congressional Research Report from December 2015, he’s not far off. Only one biography — Johnson’s — includes the word "manufacturer." "Ron is the only senator who has built a career as a manufacturer," William Allison, a spokesman for the Johnson campaign said. "He helped to start Pacur — an Oshkosh plastics manufacturing company — and built it from the ground up." We have previously examined what Johnson’s involvement with Pacur entailed. He helped his brother-in-law grow the company and held various positions over a span of 30 years, including working on the shop floor, overseeing the company’s accounting and later running the company. When he won a Senate seat in 2010, he stepped down from his day-to-day duties but continues to retain a 5 percent stake in the company. Does that make him a manufacturer today? We think it is fair to use that term, since it was his primary occupation before arriving in Washington almost six years ago. Likewise, other senators continue to identify themselves as teachers, lawyers and doctors. But a few other senators also have manufacturing connections. U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, worked as sheet metal shearer and assembly line worker early in his career before going into farming. U.S. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, once worked for a medical device manufacturer — but on its legal team. Neither identify as manufacturers. Most notably, U.S. Sen. David Perdue, R-Georgia, has said he spent most of his career helping companies outsource manufacturing operations. He held high-level positions with Reebok, Sara Lee, Dollar General, Haggar Clothing and a North Carolina textile manufacturer before he was elected. Like Johnson, he touted his business background — and lack of political experience — while campaigning. Perdue’s Senate biography describes him as a "management consultant" and "company executive." But both he and Johnson spent the bulk of their pre-Senate careers in the manufacturing industry. The other side of the ballot Earlier this year, we rated Mostly True a Johnson claim that Feingold is a "career politician." In the 36 years since Feingold finished law school, he was in office for 28 and engaged in political or diplomatic work for five, meaning about 92 percent of his career has been spent in politics. Feingold himself makes no apologies for this and has said he is proud of his career in public service. He also takes every opportunity to paint his opponent as an out-of-touch millionaire who approved a $10 million payment to himself from Pacur when he left for the Senate. In the ad, Johnson argues there are too many "career politicians" in the Senate — an opinion that is not really checkable. Nevertheless, we can provide some perspective on the background of other senators. A review of the senators’ biographies (and official websites, when needed) turns up just three individuals who only worked in politics or public policy before holding office, excluding lawyers. Most had another profession, or several, before entering the public arena. There are multiple social workers, farmers, business owners and college professors, for example. But it has been shown by the Brookings Institution that an increasing number of so-called "career politicians" are serving in both the Senate and the Congress when the term is defined as someone whose previous jobs included at least one in politics or public policy. Our rating Johnson said he is the only manufacturer in Senate, among many lawyers. Based solely on the brief biographies posted online, his statement is accurate. But other sources suggest there were some details left out: He counted law school grads instead of those who reported careers in law and he overlooked a colleague whose business career centered around manufacturing. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate the claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c47c761c-3bcb-4062-9f0f-fdbbdc91f538	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2016-10-04T05:00:00	2016-09-06	['None']
pomt-04931	"Donna Shalala left me with 12 million doses" of smallpox vaccine and "I created enough" to vaccinate "every man, woman and child against smallpox in America."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/30/tommy-thompson/tommy-thompson-says-he-created-enough-smallpox-vac/	Defending himself against accusations he was a big spender in Washington, Tommy Thompson reminds audiences of the terrorist attacks in 2001 while he oversaw the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services budget. "No secretary has ever had to deal with that," Thompson, a Republican running for U.S. Senate, told a tea-party audience on June 4, 2012 when a man challenged him on the federal debt. Thompson spoke of the anthrax attacks that began shortly after 9/11 and the worries over biological warfare. "At the time I was secretary, I had a few problems," he said. "A few problems, like there was not enough smallpox vaccine (for) America. Donna Shalala left me with 12 million doses of vaccine, all 1955 doses. And I created enough. I created enough vaccine to vaccinate every man woman and child against smallpox in America." In this item we’ll examine whether the U.S. government ramped up the smallpox vaccine program as Thompson says -- and how much credit he deserves. When asked for backup, Thompson’s campaign assembled an extensive history of the episode, including news accounts. Their math: 209 million new vaccine doses through contracts Thompson pushed for, plus 340 million old doses Thompson acquired from frozen storage at a private company, Aventis Pasteur. The total would easily cover the population at the time, about 280 million. Thompson is correct about how much vaccine he inherited. We found that 10 million to 15 million doses were on hand -- a stockpile that officials learned could be safely diluted to create five times as many doses. And there is no doubt that events during Thompson’s time concluded with enough vaccine becoming available for all Americans. We heard that from Steven Adams, deputy director of the Strategic National Stockpile division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But Thompson’s claim went much further. He said, "I created enough vaccine to vaccinate every man woman and child against smallpox in America." What was his role? He can’t -- and doesn’t -- claim credit for the 10 million to 15 million doses the government already had on hand. But Thompson did indeed help make it possible for production of 209 million new doses. So that makes the Aventis Pasteur donation of long-stored vaccine crucial. Let’s look first at Thompson’s math on the Aventis vaccine. The announced amount was about 85 million doses. Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir said that number should be quadrupled to 340 million, citing a quote by an Aventis official who said he believed the doses could be diluted in the same fashion as the existing government stockpile. Subsequent studies confirmed that and more: the Aventis doses could be effective at a 1:10 dilution ratio. Nemoir said the government found the company, which had changed hands, so credit should go to Thompson. But when the company and Thompson announced the deal at a March 29, 2002, news conference, both made it very clear it was Aventis that approached the government shortly after the 9/11 attacks to alert officials to the stockpile in frozen storage. In fact, Aventis officials said they had years earlier alerted the federal government about the stockpile but officials had shown little interest, and the company was planning to dispose of it. So this part of the total seems to fall more into the category of a lucky break. But before we draw a conclusion, let’s hear from the key players of that era, including D.A. Henderson, who led the campaign eradicating smallpox in the 1970s, which eliminated the need for the vaccine. In the late 1990s, in part as an adviser to Shalala, Henderson was among those pushing for production of 40 million doses of smallpox vaccine to control an outbreak in the case of the intentional release of the virus. The move got support but moved slowly and did not come to fruition under either President Bill Clinton or President George W. Bush after his term began in January 2001. One of Thompson’s first moves after the attacks in 2001 was to personally call Henderson and get him aboard to head the government’s bioterror preparedness response. Soon after, Thompson stunned Henderson and those pushing for 40 million vaccine doses. Thompson wanted more, much more: enough to vaccinate every American. Henderson was skeptical of the need but quickly realized that such a massive stockpile could help meet a broader goal of allowing the U.S. to help contain bioterror outbreaks in other countries. The idea came from Thompson, who not only pushed it hard, but packaged it in a politically savvy way that inoculated the expensive effort from political attacks, Henderson said. "It was a master stroke to sell it that way, for ‘every man, woman and child in America,’" Henderson recalled. Thompson’s agency, in coordination with other departments, moved quickly to get support for and contract for private production of new vaccine. Cost estimates ranged from $1 billion to $2 billion. Two other top experts also praised Thompson. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said Thompson and Stewart Simonson, an assistant HHS secretary, took a pragmatic, hands-on approach. Thompson brought him on as a special adviser after 9/11. Anthony Fauci, the famed AIDS researcher who joined the bioterror effort, credits Thompson for spurring the dilution study on the existing stockpile, and says it’s "conceivable" that Aventis Pasteur was spurred to come forward in part by Thompson’s public push for more vaccine. The company portrays it in a different light, saying it took the initiative to "remind" the government it had the old vaccine in storage. Thompson, we think, does deserve a bit of credit for negotiating with the company to acquire the 40-year-old vaccine, which by most accounts was donated. Henderson, though, said the government paid for it. Our rating Thompson accurately recounted how much vaccine was on hand and was on target in saying that on his watch enough became available for "every man woman and child" in America. He didn’t technically "create" the stockpile, but he boldly shot for the moon on its size, seamlessly sold the idea to Congress and experts and then personally drove the public and private move to a successful conclusion in just a few years -- even if some of it carried the element of luck. We rate his claim True.	None	Tommy Thompson	None	None	None	2012-07-30T09:00:00	2012-06-04	['United_States']
pomt-12498	In Congress, "on the Democratic side of the room, you’ve got men and women of all different races; on the other side, you’ve got a bunch of white men in dark suits, all over 55 or so."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/28/mark-pocan/congress-democrats-have-women-and-minorities-repub/	Shortly after Donald Trump was elected president and again after his inauguration, it was reported that the 115th Congress, which was seated in January 2017, is the most racially diverse in history. So we wondered if U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan was correct when he painted a different picture in Metro Weekly, a Washington, D.C. publication that serves the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning) community. Asked in the April 7, 2017 article whether "underrepresented groups, either minorities or women or LGBTQ people," will get more politically active, Pocan said he hoped so. The Wisconsin Democrat also recited a quote he attributed to the late Ann Richards, a Democrat who was the governor of Texas before George W. Bush: "If you don’t have a seat at the table, you’re likely on the menu." And then he said: When you look at the floor of Congress, it’s especially telling. On the Democratic side of the room, you’ve got men and women of all different races. On the other side, you’ve got a bunch of white men in dark suits, all over 55 or so. It’s such a contrast. That’s not representative of the country. We really need to get people making sure that everyone has a voice. What we found is Pocan is largely on target, in that Democrats are more diverse, although there are more than older white men among Republicans. Gender diversity We’ll tackle Pocan’s claim in three parts. We base our analysis primarily on a March 2017 report on the current makeup of the House and Senate by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which provides policy and legal analysis for Congress. Taking into account vacancies and independents, it lists 289 Republicans and 239 Democrats among the 535 voting members of the two chambers. The first part of Pocan’s claim is about women. The report shows that Democrats, even though they are outnumbered by Republicans, have three times more women in the two chambers. Democratic women Republican women 78 26 That being said, the 78 Democratic women represent about one-third of all Democrats in Congress. That’s less representative of the population as a whole, which is roughly half female. But women make up only 9 percent of Republicans in Congress. Racial diversity The contrast is even greater for racial diversity. Democrats have nearly six times more minority members than the Republicans. Minority* Democrats Republicans African-American 48 3 Hispanic/Latino 30 13 Asian/Indian/Pacific Islander 16 0 Total 94 16 *Some members are counted in more than one category The 94 Democrats who are minorities comprise 39 percent of all Democrats in Congress. That’s as representative as the 38 percent of the U.S. population that is nonwhite Hispanic and other racial minorities. The 16 minority Republicans represent only 5.5 percent of all GOP members. White men over 55 The Congressional Research Service report does not provide a breakdown to check the third part of Pocan’s claim -- that Republicans in Congress are dominated by white men over age 55. But LegiStorm, a company that researches Congress, provides a close approximation. Its data shows that two-thirds of the Republican members of Congress (compared to about 40 percent of Democrats) are white males age 50 and over. Two parting notes from analyses done by the nonprofit Pew Research Center, which show women and minorities making gains in Congress as a whole: Gender: The share of women in Congress has reached an all-time high: Women now hold 104 seats, or 19 percent. Race: Congress remains disproportionately white when compared with the U.S. population, but is becoming more representative: Minorities account for 20 of 59 (34 percent) of the new members elected in November 2016. Our rating Pocan said: In Congress, "on the Democratic side of the room, you’ve got men and women of all different races; on the other side, you’ve got a bunch of white men in dark suits, all over 55 or so." Democrats have several times more women and several times more minorities than Republicans do in the House and Senate combined. And older white males are much more predominant among Republicans. At the same time, fully one-third of GOP members are not while males over 50. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-02321	"We have been teaching these (Common Core) standards in Florida schools since 2010."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/mar/28/janet-adkins/florida-has-been-teaching-common-core-2010-says-ja/	For months leading up to Florida’s state legislative session, parents and educators criticized the state’s school grading formula as being too complex. State Education Commissioner Pam Stewart recommended some changes to school grading in February. Her recommendations led to House Bill 7117, which makes multiple changes to school grades. The bill simplifies the calculation of grades for schools by eliminating extraneous categories and focusing on student performance, including graduation and eligibility for college credit. The bill also ensures that alternative schools focus on learning gains and allows districts to adopt their own assessments for certain subjects such as band or art. The bill would allow for a one-year transition to new grades, which means schools still get grades but would not be penalized for poor performance. Some educators have called for a longer transition period, and that debate was reflected in the House Education Appropriations Subcommittee’s March 24 meeting. The subcommittee approved the bill 11-2. During the hearing, a couple of legislators questioned why the transition would only be one year. Bill sponsor state Rep. Janet Adkins, R-Fernandina Beach, responded: "These standards have been taught in Florida schools since 2010, so the only thing that is changing is the assessment," Adkins said. Later in the hearing she continued: "Again, remember that these standards have been taught in our schools since 2010. If we had just started on these standards last year, then I might be able to agree with you. But the fact that we have been teaching these standards in Florida schools since 2010 tells me that our students should be prepared for this assessment." During the hearing, Andy Ford, president of the Florida Education Association, pushed back against Adkins’ comments and said that the state hadn’t yet fully implemented the standards. Has Florida been teaching Common Core standards since 2010? Phasing in Common Core Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states, including Florida. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in different states learn the same academic concepts. As states moved toward implementation, Common Core has become a focus of attacks by opponents. Back in June 2010, Florida adopted the standards but didn’t start requiring schools to phase in Common Core until 2011-12. During that first year, the standards were fully implemented only for kindergarten. Certain standards were implemented in other grades, including standards that related to understanding texts in all grades and literacy standards in History/Social Studies, Science, and technical subjects in grades 6-12. This year, Florida is fully implementing Common Core in grades K-2 while other students are learning a blend of the existing Next Generation Sunshine State Standards and Common Core standards. The Common Core standards will be fully implemented and assessed in 2014-15. We should note that the state Board of Education tweaked the benchmarks earlier this year and renamed them the Florida Standards. But they are substantially similar to the Common Core. School districts had the option to implement standards earlier than the state’s timeline, which means they could have started as early as 2010, said Tiffany Cowie, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Education. However, the department didn’t have data on how many districts implemented standards ahead of schedule. In response to Adkins’ comments at the hearing, the Florida Education Association distributed a letter to House members about the implementation timeline of Common Core. The letter states that the standards were approved by then Education Commissioner Eric Smith in June 2010 and the state Board of Education adopted standards in language arts and math in July 2010. An implementation plan wasn’t published by the state Department of Education until the spring of 2011. "Full implementation of the Florida standards from K-12 has not yet occurred," Ford wrote. We sent the state’s timeline to a spokesman for Adkins and asked if the representative had any evidence that Florida has been teaching the standards since 2010. In an email through a spokeswoman, Adkins admitted she was wrong about the year that implementation started and reiterated her support for a transition year for the schools. Our ruling While defending a bill that sets new rules about school grades, Adkins said, "We have been teaching these (Common Core) standards in Florida schools since 2010." The state adopted the standards in 2010 but didn’t start phasing them in until the 2011-12 school year. In the first year, Common Core was only fully implemented in kindergarten and partially implemented in other grades. Though the state Education Department said districts could have started teaching the standards as early as 2010, the state had no data to show that any did. We rate this claim Mostly False.

John McCain has been a member of the U.S. Congress since 1982, but as he runs for president, he's putting as much rhetorical distance between himself and his Capitol Hill colleagues as possible. While defending his support for a gas tax holiday in a June 18, 2008, interview, McCain tarred his fellow members of Congress as "rather wealthy" folks who are "out of touch" with the needs and fears of working people on fixed incomes. "You know, the approval rating of Congress is down to 13 percent," he said. "Maybe they ought to pay a little more attention to their constituents." On June 11, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll awarded Congress a 13 percent approval rating. And that's the same figure McCain offered. During roughly the same time period, Gallup, Fox News and AP/Ipsos all conducted polls which put the approval rating at 19, 19 and 23 percent respectively. All had margins of error of between 3 and 4 percentage points. When Democrats took slim control of Congress in early 2007, there was a brief honeymoon, but approval has steadily dropped, said Scott Keeter, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. Thanks in part to its relatively faceless quality, Congress makes a convenient whipping boy when the nation is dissatisfied, Keeter said. (The same Gallup poll that put Congress at 19 percent found that 30 percent of respondents approved of President George W. Bush.) And dissatisfied we are. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal approval rating of 13 percent was a record low for the poll, besting a 15 percent rating in April 1992. Though the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll is slightly out of step with others recently conducted, it's highly reputable and there's no way to prove the figure false, Keeter said. And anyway, he said, whether it's 13 percent or 23 percent, it's not good news for Congress. McCain may have chosen the poll figure that most dramatically made his point, but the numbers are as good as any and the overall picture he presented — that of a public overwhelmingly displeased with Congress — is right on. We rule his statement True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-24T00:00:00	2008-06-18	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-01613	After merging with Tim Hortons of Canada, Burger King is "not moving. … Our headquarters will remain in Miami" and "(we) will continue to pay all of our federal, state and local U.S. taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/29/burger-king/burger-king-says-its-not-moving-and-will-continue-/	When Burger King, the American fast-food icon, announced a deal to join forces with the Canadian coffee-and-donuts giant Tim Hortons, the reaction was swift. Burger King, it turned out, would become part of a Canadian parent company, potentially resulting in significant savings on what it pays in U.S. taxes -- a maneuver known as a corporate tax "inversion." Politicians, and ordinary Americans, cried foul. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, urged customers to bring their fast-food cravings to two companies that have long operated from Ohio -- Wendy’s and White Castle. "Burger King has always said ‘Have it Your Way,’ " Brown said in a statement. "Well, my way is to support two Ohio companies that haven’t abandoned their country or customers." Meanwhile, hundreds of commenters took to Facebook to protest the move. "If Burger King goes ahead with the ugly, greedy, anti-American tax-avoidance ploy of this inversion, I will NEVER AGAIN set foot inside any of your restaurants," said one. A reader asked us to check the accuracy of Burger King’s own Facebook message about the transaction. Here’s what the company posted: "We hear you. We’re not moving, we’re just growing and finding ways to serve you better. "As part of the announcement made today, both Burger King Corp. and Tim Hortons will continue to operate as independent brands. We’ll just be under common ownership. Our headquarters will remain in Miami where we were founded more than 60 years ago and business will continue as usual at our restaurants around the world. "The decision to create a new global QSR leader with Tim Hortons is not tax-driven – it’s about global growth for both brands. BKC will continue to pay all of our federal, state and local U.S. taxes. "We’re proud of the heritage of Burger King and will maintain our long-standing commitment to our employees, franchisees and the local communities we serve. "The WHOPPER isn’t going anywhere." We decided to check the company’s claim that after merging with Tim Hortons of Canada, Burger King is "not moving. … Our headquarters will remain in Miami" and "(we) will continue to pay all of our federal, state and local U.S. taxes." (Burger King's public-relations firm did not return an inquiry.) To start, we turned to Burger King’s corporate press release announcing the deal. In it, Alex Behring, Burger King’s executive chairman, explains that the deal involves "bringing together our two iconic companies under common ownership." Oakville, Ontario, will "remain global home of Tim Hortons," the release says, while Miami is "to remain global home of Burger King." That’s the justification for the Facebook post’s claim that Burger King is "not moving" and that its "headquarters will remain in Miami." But that leaves out a significant wrinkle. The release notes that both companies will, in turn, be owned by a newly created, and as-yet unnamed, parent company. "The new global company will be based in Canada, the largest market of the combined company," the release says. And that’s a detail that will likely have an impact on how much the company pays in U.S. taxes. Burger King is planning to manage its operations -- everything from the distribution of burger buns to its marketing strategy -- from Miami. But the new parent company's legal location, known as its "domicile," will be in Canada -- an important point for tax purposes. When it was just an American company, Burger King paid U.S. taxes on its entire worldwide income -- a policy that few of the United States’ industrialized rivals have. Under U.S. tax law, the pre-merger Burger King would have been taxed when it brought home (or "repatriated") its foreign profits. It would have gotten a credit for the foreign taxes it paid and faced a U.S. tax liability on the amount above that. The biggest tax effect for the post-merger Burger King is that it will pay U.S. taxes only on the profit it earns in the United States. (The company will continue to be taxed on those profits in the countries in which they’re earned.) A related impact: Burger King’s new corporate structure may make it easier for the company to shuffle its earnings around in order to minimize tax liability. For instance, a company in Burger King’s situation can have "the foreign part of the firm lend money to the U.S. part," Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said. "The interest paid by the U.S. part is deductible against its U.S. income and thus cuts its U.S. taxes owed. The interest is taxable to the foreign part of the firm, but presumably at a lower rate, thus saving taxes on net." Meanwhile, if the same merger had been made -- but the company instead chose to make its domicile in Miami -- the profits from Tim Hortons would have been subject to U.S. taxes once they were repatriated. Since Tim Hortons is of similar size to Burger King, this would not be a trivial amount. Given that they had a choice of locating the new parent company in either Canada or the United States, it’s easy to see why Burger King took the approach it did. "When they say ‘(we) will continue to pay all of our federal, state and local U.S. taxes,’ they are correct for the most part," said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the Tax Foundation. "Every penny they earn here will be taxed. The only tax that they would no longer legally be required to pay is the additional U.S. tax on income they earn overseas." It’s also worth noting that, unlike some maneuvers that were done almost exclusively to cut a company’s corporate tax bill, there’s a genuine business-strategic reason for the Burger King-Tim Hortons merger -- international expansion and an opening for Burger King into the breakfast market. And it’s not as if Burger King is moving its domicile to a Caribbean island with minuscule tax rates. The combination of national and provincial rate for corporate taxation in Ontario is 26.5 percent. Still, however logical the deal may be in business terms, the company’s Facebook post leaves a lot out of the picture. The Facebook post, while technically accurate, "is misleading," said Edward Kleinbard, a University of Southern California professor in law and business and a former chief of staff of Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation. "The U.S. operating company will pay U.S. tax, but the existence of a new foreign holding company opens up a range of future tax avoidance possibilities." Our ruling On its Facebook page, Burger King said that after merging with Tim Hortons of Canada, the company is "not moving. … Our headquarters will remain in Miami" and "(we) will continue to pay all of our federal, state and local U.S. taxes." The part about not moving is technically accurate, but it leaves out that the company’s domicile will move from the United States to Canada -- a shift with potentially significant impacts on its tax liability. As for the part about continuing to pay its taxes, we’d fully expect the company to pay what it owes under the law. But that ignores that the company should be able to legally avoid significant tax payments it would have made had the company not merged. There may be sound financial reasons for Burger King’s incorporation decision, but the tone and message of the Facebook post is distinctly at odds with reality. The claim is partially accurate, but it takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-09288	"Bill Young uses his campaign money for, among other things, a luxury car."	true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/26/charlie-justice/justice-says-young-spent-campaign-money-luxury-car/	An online video by the Charlie Justice for Congress campaign tries to link opponent Rep. Bill Young with jailed lobbyist Jack Abramoff. It is a case of guilt by association without proving any association. In a separate item, we've rated the suggestion of an Abramoff connection as Pants on Fire. But the video makes other claims about Young, a Pinellas County Republican, that have some truth to them, including one that Young used campaign money for "a luxury car." The video uses Abramoff's fedora as a metaphor for the alleged ties between the two men. A copy of the hat flips off Abramoff's head and lands on Young's. The screen says that Abramoff "used his money for, among other things, luxury cars." The hat lands on Young as the screen says, "Bill Young uses his campaign money for, among other things, a luxury car." Putting aside the sleight-of-hand implication of an Abramoff connection, it's worth exploring the simple question of whether Young did indeed use campaign money for a luxury car. The Justice campaign is referring to a 1990 revelation in the St. Petersburg Times that Young used campaign money to buy a Lincoln Continental for nearly $30,000. The Times article noted that he also billed the campaign for the new car's taxes and title, "a portable telephone and frequent fill-ups at the gas station." The article said the purchase did not violate federal laws, which give members wide discretion for spending campaign money. That, however, was 20 years ago. Justice used the present tense in the words on the screen, implying that Young is still paying for his car with campaign contributions. We wondered if that part was true. Indeed, though the model of car has changed -- it's a Lincoln Navigator now -- Young spokesman Harry Glenn told us that the campaign makes monthly payments to lease the vehicle. He said the expenses have never been questioned by the Federal Election Commission and that Young felt it was better to use campaign money for the vehicle than taxpayer dollars as other members of Congress do. According to an expenditure report filed with the Federal Election Commission, in 2009 Young paid $799 per month to Ford Motor Credit for the "campaign vehicle." Is it fair to call a Lincoln Navigator a luxury car? We'll start with the price. The Web site says they start at $54,950, so it's definitely on the high end. The Navigator is an SUV, but Justice's use of "car" seems to suggest a vehicle rather than to specify a sedan. Lincoln describes the Navigator as "the world's first luxury SUV." The "premium leather-trimmed" seats are available in hues of Camel, Charcoal Black or Stone and have heating and cooling built into the front seats. Sounds like luxury to us. So Justice is right. Young used campaign money to buy the Lincoln Continental in 1990, which was traded in many years ago. But he is still using campaign money today to lease a Lincoln Navigator. Both can reasonably be called luxury cars, so we find Justice's claim True.	None	Charlie Justice	None	None	None	2010-04-26T17:34:30	2010-04-14	['None']
pomt-04152	"You see 34 people (are) murdered every single day" by gunfire in America.	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/dec/27/cory-booker/cory-booker-says-34-americans-are-killed-guns-ever/	Beyond the recent mass shooting at a school in Connecticut, the fear of gun violence is felt nationwide as nearly three dozen Americans are killed by firearms every day, Newark Mayor Cory Booker said. The Democratic mayor offered that statistic on Sunday during a roundtable discussion on ABC’s "This Week with George Stephanopoulos." The guests were discussing the prospect of increased gun control in the wake of the school shooting that left 20 children and seven adults dead, including the shooter himself. Grover Norquist, an anti-tax activist and a member of the National Rifle Association’s board, argued that Democrats are "politicizing a tragedy," but Booker quickly cut him off. "One point is very important," the mayor said. "What happened in Connecticut was a grievous tragedy, but every single day in America, every single day, people in communities like mine go to bed fearing violence. You see 34 people (are) murdered every single day." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Booker slightly overstated the number of gun-related homicides that occur on a daily basis, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC tracks the causes of deaths for residents of the United States. The mayor’s claim about 34 murders per day refers to CDC figures showing the average number of Americans killed with guns every day between 2005 and 2009, according to a statement released by the mayor’s office in response to this fact-check. But the statement acknowledges that, with the CDC’s final numbers for 2010, the five-year rolling average drops slightly to roughly 33 gun-related homicides per day between 2006 and 2010. The 2010 figures represent the most recent final data available. "Whether we are losing 34 Americans a day, or 33 Americans a day, the point stands that this is an unacceptable and largely correctable epidemic, and the Mayor believes that we must immediately and intensely focus on common-sense, achievable measures that will save lives in Newark and in communities across the country," the statement reads. The number of gun-related murders per day drops even further when you only consider deaths recently recorded in individual years. In 2010, there were 11,078 gun-related homicides, or roughly 30 per day. According to preliminary figures for 2011, there were 11,101 homicides last year, which also is roughly 30 murders per day. Both figures represent a roughly 13 percent decrease since there were 12,791 gun-related murders in 2006, or about 35 homicides every day. That statistic represented the highest amount for any year in the last decade. In fact, the annual number of gun-related homicides dropped every year from 2007 to 2010. It’s also worth noting that homicides represent only part of all gun-related deaths. In 2010, for example, there were a total of 31,672 gun-related deaths, including 19,392 suicides and 11,078 homicides. The remaining deaths were classified as unintentional (606); undetermined (252); and legal intervention/war (344). Our ruling In a TV appearance, Booker claimed, "You see 34 people (are) murdered every single day" by gunfire in America. The mayor’s statistic isn’t far off. According to the most recent data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a five-year rolling average of final CDC figures puts the number of gun-related murders at about 33 per day. In terms of individual years, there were about 30 gun-related homicides on a daily basis in 2010 and 2011. That figure marks a reduction since the roughly 35 murders per day recorded in 2006, which was the highest amount for any year in the last decade. We rate the statement Mostly True.
