pomt-03213	Wisconsin’s criminal threshold for drunken-driving is "way out of line" with "states surrounding us," which "have the second offense as a felony."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/aug/25/alberta-darling/alberta-darling-says-wisconsins-neighbors-make-fel/	Whenever state officials debate tougher penalties for drunken driving, critics raise concerns about the high cost of additional jail time for offenders. State Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, the co-leader of the latest get-tough push, recently confronted that critique head-on while arguing to make third-offense drunken-driving a felony in Wisconsin. "We can’t just say, ‘It costs too much,’" Darling said in testimony before an Assembly committee Aug. 15, 2013. "What does that say to the victims and the victims’ families, that it costs too much to make a third do-over a felony? Why does it have to be a fourth offense as a felony?" Then she made a geographical appeal, twice saying during the hearing that Wisconsin is "way out of line" with some Midwestern neighbors. "The states surrounding us, Illinois, Iowa and Indiana, have the second offense as a felony," Darling said. "That tells me that that is a reasonable public policy, that other states that are like-minded, that are Midwesterners with similar values, feel that’s what is appropriate. To me that counts. We are way out of line, that you get three do-overs." It’s well known that Wisconsin is the only state in which first-offense drunken driving is not charged as a crime; it’s treated as a civil matter featuring stiff money forfeitures. In fact, the second is still a civil forfeiture if the new offense is more than 10 years after the first, though it’s a criminal misdemeanor if it’s within the decade. But we wondered if the gap between the Badger State and our close neighbors on felony OWI is as stark as Darling described. So we compared Wisconsin’s law to that in the three states Darling mentioned, plus border states Minnesota and Michigan. Darling did not explicitly mention them, but they meet her definition of "surrounding us" (especially compared to Indiana, which doesn’t touch Wisconsin). We’ll confine our review to incidents that involve no aggravating factors such as causing injury or having children in the car. Here’s what we found: Wisconsin: The fourth offense here is a felony that carries a prison term of six months to six years -- but only if a previous offense was within the last five years. Otherwise, that fourth offense is a criminal misdemeanor with a 60 day to 1 year term, state penalty information shows. The third offense is now a criminal misdemeanor. The bill that Darling and Rep. Jim Ott, R-Mequon, have introduced with 13 co-sponsors would change that third offense to a Class H felony with a minimum of 45 days of imprisonment. And the bill would make fourth offense OWI a felony regardless of the timing of prior convictions. Much stiffer sentences would apply if the fourth is within five years of a prior incident. Iowa: Drunken driving becomes a felony quicker than under current Wisconsin law, but upon the third offense, not the second as Darling said. The first and second offenses are both criminal misdemeanors -- an aggravated one in the case of second. Illinois: As in Iowa, it’s the third offense that is a felony. The first two offenses are criminal misdemeanors. Michigan: The same as Iowa and Illinois -- third offense is a felony in Michigan. Indiana: The second offense is a felony if it’s within 5 years of the prior conviction. If the time gap is wider, it gets charged as a misdemeanor -- and that holds true even if it’s a third or fourth offense or more. Minnesota: As in Wisconsin, drunken driving without any aggravating factors is not charged as a crime until the fourth offense. Minnesota sweeps in offenses from the prior 10 years, though, compared with Wisconsin’s five. In sum, four out of our five closest neighbors clearly make drunken driving a felony faster than does Wisconsin. Minnesota, by contrast, is much like Wisconsin on this score. So "out of line" clearly would apply. But "way" out of line? It’s a bit of a subjective phrase, but Darling defined it in a specific way -- that the others make drunken driving a felony on second offense. By that measure, Darling was wrong -- with one exception. Among the surrounding states, only in Indiana is OWI a felony at second offense, and only if the offense is within five years of the first episode. Bob Delaporte, a Darling aide, told us Darling misspoke in saying some of Wisconsin’s neighboring states make it a felony at second offense. Before we close, a disclaimer. This analysis was confined to a simple look at when a felony classification kicks in. We did not try to sort out here the many complexities involved in determining whether one state’s law is truly "tougher" or "weaker" when factors such as plea bargaining and sentencing variations are considered. Still, a felony conviction undeniably packs a special punch, in terms of the loss of rights and stigma. "A felony is such a career killer," said Donald Ramsell, an Illinois attorney and national expert on drunken driving penalties. Nationally, about half the states mirror Wisconsin’s current approach or are more lenient in terms of when -- or if -- a felony charge enters the picture, various state surveys show. Our rating Darling said Wisconsin’s drunken-driving penalties are "way out of line" with "states surrounding us," which "have the second offense as a felony." In contrast to Wisconsin, where fourth offense can be a felony, four out of five of the state’s closest neighbors make it a felony faster than Wisconsin. But only one does so at the second offense as Darling said. Three put the threshold at third offense, and another puts it at fourth, as in Wisconsin. There is a gap between Wisconsin and neighboring states, so there’s an element of truth here, but for the most part that gap is not as wide as Darling said. We rate her claim Mostly False.

pomt-14659	Says the Democratic Party created a debate schedule "to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates."	false	/florida/statements/2016/jan/20/debbie-wasserman-schultz/democratic-debates-maximize-exposure-debbie-wasser/	Responding to rampant criticism about the Democratic Party’s presidential debate schedule, Debbie Wasserman Schultz has boasted about viewership numbers. The critics include party leaders as well as Hillary Clinton’s primary rivals, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. Some Democrats say that the schedule of six debates including some on weekends limits voters’ exposure, giving Clinton an edge. But Wasserman Schultz says ratings show that voters have had plenty of TV face time with the Democratic candidates. "In fact, our first debate beat at least two of the Republican debates. And our last debate, compared to the Republican last debate, was just a little bit less than theirs," the Democratic National Committee chair told CNN’s Brian Stelter Jan. 17, hours before the debate over the Martin Luther King weekend in Charleston. After Stelter pressed her, Wasserman Schultz, a Broward County congresswoman, replied: "Brian, there's no number of debates that will satisfy everyone. So, I did my best to make sure, along with my staff and along with our debate partners, to come up with a schedule that we felt was going to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates." Clearly, we can't rate what people within the Democratic party intended. Our fact-check looks at what the outcome was. Did the Democrats "maximize the opportunity" for voters to see their candidates? We found there’s no fair reading of the Democratic debate schedule that supports this. Democratic and Republican debate schedules in 2016 The Democrats scheduled six primary debates; the Republicans scheduled 11 primary debates (plus one more in March that is unscheduled). So far, Democrats have held four debates with a cumulative viewership of about 42.5 million while Republicans have held six debates with a cumulative viewership of about 103.7 million, according to Nielsen ratings of same-day viewership. Democratic debates: Date Day of week Network Viewership Oct. 13, 2015 Tuesday CNN 15.8 million Nov. 14, 2015 Saturday CBS 8.5 million Dec. 19, 2015 Saturday ABC News 8 million Jan. 17, 2016 Sunday NBC News 10.2 million Feb. 11, 2016 Thursday PBS TBD March 9, 2016 Wednesday Univision TBD Republican debates: Date Day of week Network Viewership Aug. 6, 2015 Thursday Fox News 24 million Sept. 16, 2015 Wednesday CNN 23 million Oct. 28, 2015 Wednesday CNBC 14 million Nov. 10, 2015 Tuesday Fox Business Network 13.5 million Dec. 15, 2015 Tuesday CNN 18.2 million Jan. 14, 2016 Thursday Fox Business Network 11.1 million Jan. 28, 2016 Thursday Fox News TBD Feb. 6, 2016 Saturday ABC TBD Feb. 13, 2016 Saturday CBS TBD Feb. 25, 2016 Thursday CNN TBD March 10, 2016 Thursday CNN TBD Back in 2008, when Barack Obama won the nomination, the Democrats held about 25 primary debates while the Republicans held 21. Overall, it looks like the GOP is doing a significantly better job of reaching viewers. Wasserman Schultz response In defense of Wasserman Schultz’s statement, DNC spokesman Sean Bartlett raised several points: • There are more GOP candidates than Democratic candidates. At the outset of the 2016 race, there were 17 Republican candidates but only five Democratic candidates. • Only three Democratic debates in 2008 topped the Democrats’ lowest rated debate this cycle. • The first Democratic debate drew 15.8 million viewers, surpassing the viewership of three of the Republican debates this cycle. • All but one of the Democratic debates are on broadcast network TV, which makes it more likely for people without cable to tune into the debates. • The schedule of one debate a month for six months doesn’t pull the candidates away from town halls and other events with voters. Still, Wasserman Schultz has faced constant questions about the debate schedule, specifically whether it was intended to help Clinton or minimize viewership. "That’s ridiculous," she said on Jan. 11 in Broward County. "I don’t know how many times I have to say it." She said that the Sunday debate in Charleston -- the city where nine African-Americans were killed at a church in 2015 -- was a recommendation by the Congressional Black Caucus Institute and NBC to coincide with Martin Luther King weekend. Experts dispute Wasserman Schultz’s characterization We contacted five professors of political science and communications. None of them bought Wasserman Schultz’s statement. "By the time voting starts in Iowa, potential voters will have seen about 40 percent less of Democratic candidates on the debate stage than their Republican counterparts," University of Michigan’s Director of Debate Aaron Kall told PolitiFact. Kall cited several factors contributing to the larger Republican viewership: • The first Republican debate occurred in early August, before the start of the NFL and NCAA college football seasons. Viewer anticipation is usually highest for the first debate. The Democrats didn't host their first debate until over two months later. • Of the four Democratic debates so far, three were on weekends, including the Dec. 19 debate a week before Christmas and the same night as the New York Jets vs. Dallas Cowboys NFL game. The Jan. 17 debate was the day before the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day holiday. Kall cited two major factors beyond the Democrats’ control that have aided superior Republican ratings: a much larger GOP field and the phenomenon of Donald Trump, an entertainment star in his own right from his time on The Apprentice. John Schroeder at Northeastern University noted that the two highest Republican debates each drew between 23 million and 24 million, much higher than the Democratic debates. While a lot of the disparity is due to Trump, another factor is that all the Republican debates so far have been held on weekdays. "I think we can safely say that weekend time slots are not the key to maximizing the viewing audience," Schroeder said. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz says the party came up with a debate schedule "to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates." Wasserman Schultz’s best point is that the Democrats largely scheduled their debates with TV networks, which means viewers without cable can see them. But other than that, her statement is very disingenuous. There are six Democratic party debates compared with 11 scheduled for the Republicans, and half of the Democratic debates are on weekends -- including one the weekend before Christmas and another on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. If the Democrats had wanted to "maximize" opportunities for viewers, the party could have added more debates, scheduled them on weekdays and avoided holidays.

pomt-11517	In Parkland, Fla. "the mass murderer was immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/19/pamela-geller/no-proof-nikolas-cruz-was-motivated-islamic-or-lef/	A conservative website portrayed Nikolas Cruz, who admitted to fatally gunning down 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, as sharing views of certain Muslims and leftists. "The mass murderer was immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate," stated a story on the Geller Report website on Feb. 14, the day of the shooting at the Parkland, Fla., school. The author of the website, Pamela Geller, is an activist who co-founded Stop Islamization of America, also known as the American Freedom Defense Initiative, a far-right group. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Cruz was immersed in Islamic or left-wing hate. Most of Geller’s story has nothing to do with political views held by Cruz. It largely repeats an initial story by Fox News the day of the shooting and showed some of Cruz’s alleged Instagram posts, identified by other teenagers as his, which included images of guns and knives as well as an image of a bullseye target with bullet holes that included the phrase "Group Therapy." Geller included an image from what was believed to be Cruz’s Instagram account showing a Google search for the Arabic phrase "Allahu Akbar." The phrase, which means "God is greater," is used by Muslims on many occasions and in prayers but has also at times been uttered by people commiting attacks. Cruz’s Instagram account has since been shut down; however, multiple media reports stated that Cruz appeared to make fun of Islam when he wrote that "at least we now know what it means when a sand durka says ‘allahu Akbar.'" We sent Geller a summary of our findings and asked if she had evidence to support her claim. "He mocked the phrase, but then he turned to violence himself. This indicates that underneath his mockery, he had an affinity with those who scream this phrase while murdering people," she told PunditFact in an email. Geller said that Cruz’s interest in the phrase "Allahu Akbar" "doesn't mean he was an Islamic jihadi, but his mockery of it may have been an attempt to deflect attention from his aspirations, or maybe even to try to convince himself not to take the path he ultimately chose. Ultimately, we cannot know for sure what was in his mind, or what was left of it." Law enforcement are investigating motives and his social media posts. The portrait that has emerged of Cruz so far is not of a person motivated by political views, but one of a young man who was drawn to firearms and had a troubled past. Cruz had regularly gotten in trouble at school at least since middle school and had transferred out of Stoneman Douglas in 2017 and had since attended alternative schools. He had a history of mental illness, and police had been called to his home. Cruz’s mother died in November; his father died when he was a young child. Ocean Parodie, 17, told The Daily Beast that Cruz wore patriotic shirts that "seemed really extreme, like hating on" Islam and would also deride Muslims as "terrorists and bombers." In general teenagers who knew Cruz used words such as "off," "weird" and "crazy" to describe him to journalists. Some initial news reports stated that Cruz was affiliated with a white nationalist group in Florida, but law enforcement said they didn’t have information to support that connection. A white nationalist appeared to have spread misinformation to media outlets. We emailed spokespersons for Instagram, the FBI and the Broward Sheriff’s Office to ask some questions about Cruz’s Instagram account but not did get a reply. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel did not offer any involvement in Islamic or hate groups to explain why Cruz walked into the school with an assault weapon in a Feb. 18 interview with Local 10 ABC’s Michael Putney. When asked why Cruz shot up the school Israel said: "Because he is an evil killer." The Geller Report described Cruz as being "immersed in Islamic and leftwing hate." Law enforcement are investigating motives, but so far Cruz appeared to be a person who had mental illness and a fascination with guns. A mocking Instagram post attributed to him showed he Googled the phrase "Allahu Akbar" but that doesn’t prove that he was immersed in Islamic and left-wing hate. We found no evidence to support Geller’s claim. We rate this statement Pants on Fire. ' See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Pamela Geller	None	None	None	2018-02-19T14:42:57	2018-02-14	['Islam']

pomt-14805	Says Russ Feingold "wanted to get money out of politics. Now he's profiting from that same dark money."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/27/national-republican-senatorial-committee/campaign-finance-reformer-russ-feingold-profiting-/	A television ad attacking Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold, who is aiming to reclaim the U.S. Senate seat he held for 18 years, opens with images of rapidly rotting fruit. The National Republican Senatorial Committee spot aired in Milwaukee and Green Bay during the GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee on Nov. 10, 2015. It contends that Feingold’s time in Washington changed him for the worse. "His values decayed, his principles eroded and he lost touch with Wisconsin," the narrator says midway into the ad. "He wanted to get money out of politics. Now he’s profiting from that same dark money." Feingold has long championed campaign finance reforms, though he earned a Full Flop on our Flip-O-Meter for reversing his position on raising most of his campaign funds from Wisconsin residents. But is Feingold "profiting" from "dark money"? That is, money spent in election campaigns by groups that don’t have to disclose their donors? More darkness Dark money spending is rising, we found earlier this month in rating as True a claim by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. So far in the 2015-2016 election, $4.88 million in dark money expenditures, mostly by conservative groups, have been made. That’s more than 10 times what was spent at this point during the 2011-2012 cycle -- when a total of $308 million in dark money was spent. It remains to be seen how much dark money might be spent on either side as Feingold challenges Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in 2016, in a rematch of their 2010 contest. The ad In the TV ad, when the claim about Feingold and dark money is made, footnotes alluding to two news articles appear on the screen. The major one was a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story in June 2015 on spending by two groups Feingold formed in February 2011: Progressives United PAC, a liberal political action committee, and Progressives United Inc., a so-called 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization. The Journal Sentinel article reported that data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics showed the PAC had given a mere 5 percent of its income to federal candidates and political parties. Instead, nearly half of the $7.1 million that had been spent went to raising more money for itself. The article also said Feingold and nine of his former campaign and U.S. Senate staffers drew salaries or consulting fees from the PAC, and five of them also spent time on the payroll of Progressives United Inc., the nonprofit. PACs, however, are required to disclose their donors. So, our focus here is on the Progressives United Inc. nonprofit. It is a dark money group in that 501(c)(4) groups (a reference to the Internal Revenue Service code) are not required to disclose their donors. At the same time, nothing prevents nonprofits such as Progressives United Inc. from disclosing donors on their own. The money Federal tax filings show Progressives United Inc. paid Feingold as president of the group $10,000 in 2011, $30,000 in 2012 and $19,500 in 2013 -- a total of $59,500. But he is no longer "profiting" from the nonprofit in that he took a leave from Progressives United after being selected a special envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa in June 2013. He hasn’t received any payments since 2013. But Progressives United Inc. didn’t actually operate as a conventional dark-money group does -- at least while it was active. A Feingold campaign spokesman sent us links (using the "Way Back Machine" -- archive.org) so that we could access pages from the Progressive United Inc. website that have since been taken down. The donors were listed for 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. But Progressives United Inc. stopped operating at the end of 2014 and its website is dormant. That means the donor lists are no longer readily available -- at a time, with Feingold running for the Senate, when public interest in the lists might be high. A Feingold campaign spokesman told us the website is no longer active because Progressives United Inc. no longer is taking in income to pay for expenses such as web hosting. Our rating The National Republican Senatorial Committee said Feingold "wanted to get money out of politics. Now he's profiting from that same dark money." Feingold received $59,500 in salary from Progressives United Inc., a non-profit founded by Feingold that is not required to disclose its donors, but stopped receiving payments in 2013. While it was active, the group voluntarily listed its donors on its website. But those lists are no longer readily accessible, since the group’s website is no longer active. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.

pomt-11468	The 2018 Academy Awards show was the "lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-correct-about-record-low-ratings-2018/	President Donald Trump -- who has often invoked television ratings either as a sign of his own strength or of his rivals’ weakness -- appeared to take pleasure in the disappointing performance of the 2018 Oscars, which aired on ABC on March 4. Two days after the show aired, Trump tweeted, "Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is, we don’t have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding, of course)!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Was Trump right that 2018 marked a low point for the Oscars? Since the beginning of Nielsen TV audience ratings in 1974, yes. The 2018 show attracted 26.5 million viewers, down almost 20 percent from the 2017 show. (Both were hosted by ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.) Adweek noted that the 2018 Oscars "won’t end up as the year’s highest-rated entertainment telecast," since it has already been beaten out by the post-Super Bowl episode of the prime-time drama This Is Us. This is not a one-year downward blip, either. Oscars viewership in 2018 fell by 39 percent from its level just four years earlier, in 2014, when Ellen DeGeneres hosted for ABC. The previous low of 31.8 million viewers came in 2008, when Jon Stewart hosted not long after a lengthy writers' strike ended. Here’s a summary of viewership totals since 2008: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The all-time high for viewership came in 1998, when Billy Crystal hosted the ceremony and 55 million viewers watched. In 1998, the blockbuster Titanic won 11 Oscars, including Best Picture. Experts say the connection between high box office grosses and high viewership is more than coincidence. This year’s nominated films earned far less than Titanic, which had grossed north of $300 million by the time of the 1998 awards ceremony. The top earner among 2018’s best picture nominees was Dunkirk with $188 million, and only two other nominees this year made in excess of $60 million domestically. (All made additional money overseas.) Movie Domestic gross Dunkirk $188 million Get Out $176 million The Post $80 million The Shape of Water $57 million Darkest Hour $56 million Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri $52 million Lady Bird $48 million Phantom Thread $20 million Call Me by Your Name $17 million "Most of the movies up for Oscars in multiple categories are films that average moviegoers have not seen," said Eric Deggans, NPR’s television critic. "That's a function of our fragmented media landscape." Among the widely seen films that were shut out of high-profile Oscars nominations were Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Wonder Woman, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Beauty and the Beast and The Fate of the Furious. Still, Deggans added that movie grosses aren’t the only factor to blame for low viewership. In fact, The Shape of Water -- this year’s Best Picture winner -- was the highest grossing film to win Best Picture since 2013, when Argo won. Rather, the longer-term -- and more intractable -- problem for the Oscars is the fragmentation of the television audience. And this goes beyond the impact of digital streaming, which isn’t tabulated in the Nielsen ratings. "Every awards show on television has seen erosion, and many are notching record lows in viewership," Deggans said. "There are more things than ever competing for an audience's attention, and more alternatives for people who might not want to sit through something as conventional as an awards ceremony." Ratings for the most recent Grammys fell by almost one-quarter in just one year, while the Screen Actors Guild Awards fell by 30 percent and the Golden Globes fell by 5 percent. This year’s Super Bowl had the lowest audience since 2009. Our ruling Trump said the 2018 Academy Awards show was the "lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY."

pomt-03533	"Two weeks after signing a taxpayer protection pledge, (Charlie Crist) breaks it."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/may/30/republican-party-florida/state-republicans-say-it-took-charlie-crist-only-t/	The Republican Party of Florida is launching a pre-emptive strike against former golden boy Charlie Crist, who very well could run for governor in 2014 as a Democrat. In a new Web ad, the state GOP spoofs the History Channel with a segment called "This Day in CRIST-ory." The date: May 28, 2009. (The date should be May 27, but the state GOP flubbed that.) The setting: Tallahassee. The story: Then-Republican Gov. Crist is signing a $66.5 billion budget that includes a $1-a-pack cigarette tax and higher fees on drivers licenses and motor vehicle tags. The new taxes and fees, which are estimated to generate $2.2 billion, are needed to pass a balanced state budget -- and were supported by Republicans in the Legislature -- but also break Crist’s pledge not to raise taxes. "Two weeks after signing a taxpayer protection pledge, he (Crist) breaks it!" the Republican Party’s ad exclaims. Here at PolitiFact Florida, we didn’t need a history lesson to remember the basics of the 2009 budget. But we did wonder about the state GOP’s assertion that Crist had the gall to break a pledge just two weeks after he signed it. Crist, it turns out, did sign a taxpayer protection pledge two weeks before signing the budget into law. We found that through a press release from … the Republican Party of Florida. At the time, Crist had recently announced he was running for the U.S. Senate, and Republicans far and wide were rallying around his candidacy. (Well, except former House Speaker Marco Rubio. That’s for another day in CRIST-ory.) But the pledge Crist signed on May 14, 2009, was for federal candidates, not state ones. And it was specific to income taxes. Not taxes in general. Crist signed a pledge from the Americans for Tax Reform, a well-known anti-tax group led by Grover Norquist. In it, Crist promised to "oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses; and ... oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates." A tax pledge yes, but one that wouldn’t be broken with a tax on cigarettes or motor vehicle fees. That doesn’t get Crist out of hot water, however. Crist signed another taxpayer pledge from Americans for Tax Reform in June 2005. In that pledge, Crist promised to "oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes." "Pledges are important, but actions speak louder," Crist said in an email to supporters in December 2005. "Throughout my years of public service I have stood squarely against tax increases, and will continue to do so as governor." Crist’s 2009 budget signature does appear to violate his older pledge -- particularly in allowing the $1-a-pack cigarette tax to become law. "The cigarette tax is appropriate, and I really view it more as a health issue than I do as a tax issue," Crist said May 19, 2009. "(Ronald) Reagan said when you want to kill something you ought to tax it. Well, it wouldn't be bad if you killed smoking. There are about 2 million Floridians, maybe a few less, who smoke. And it's not good for you." (We looked for that Reagan quote, the closest we could find was," Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.") Republican Party of Florida spokesman Matt Moon admitted the mistake in the ad's phrasing. "While it's true we should have been more precise and not used the words 'two weeks,' ... he did sign a taxpayer protection pledge that he did break," Moon said. "And we're still going to call him out on it." Our ruling In a new Web ad, the state GOP portrayed Crist as a man who didn’t keep his word when it comes to raising taxes. The record there is pretty clear. Crist signed a pledge saying he would oppose efforts to increase taxes, yet signed a budget that included a $1-a-pack cigarette tax. However, the state Republican Party went unnecessarily far when it tried to say that it took Crist just two weeks to break that promise. The pledge he signed two weeks before approving the cigarette tax did not apply. We rate the Republicans’ claim Mostly False.

pomt-05813	Says he banned texting while driving in Austin.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/feb/21/mike-martinez/mike-martinez-says-he-banned-texting-while-driving/	Mike Martinez, an Austin City Council member seeking re-election in May, recently pointed supporters to his campaign website, which includes an issues page touching on ways he says he’s delivered for the Austin community. On the page, which we viewed Feb. 10, 2012, Martinez says he helped lead efforts to protect an East Austin spring, helped the city establish a "no-kill" policy at municipal animal shelters and helped launch a community gardens program. We’re not checking any of that for this article. But we paused at another Martinez point: "Banned texting while driving to improve safety for drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians." Martinez banned TWD in ATX? Austin’s texting-while-driving ban, which took effect Jan. 1, 2010, has yielded about $31,800 in fine revenue for the city’s general fund, according to Rebecca Stark, the city’s municipal court director. She told us that 93 drivers in 2010 and 158 drivers in 2011 pleaded no contest or guilty or were found guilty of violating the ban. In 2010, 121 cases of ban violations were filed, she said. That figure nearly doubled to 222 in 2011. In a telephone interview, Martinez, a former firefighter who won his first council term in 2006, told us that as a member of the city’s public safety task force, he brought up the idea of banning texting while driving, initially to derision. He said he asked the Austin Police Department to research texting as a local traffic hazard and after years of community conversations, the seven-member City Council approved the ordinance. Martinez told us that he did not ban texting by his lonesome: "Anything we do has to be ratified by the council. I did take a certain ownership and pride in this issue. I was the only council member to originally call for a ban on texting." According to Austin American-Statesman news articles, the ordinance barring texting while driving won unanimous council approval in October 2009. Violations are Class C misdemeanors subject to fines of up to $500. Some Statesman stories describe Martinez as the council’s lead proponent of the ban. In November 2008, the public safety task force voted to urge City Manager Marc Ott to develop a ban proposal. A Nov. 4, 2008, Statesman news article says "Martinez, who is leading the effort, said he has received dozens of calls in recent months from motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists asking for such a law. "It is something that needs to be done," the story quotes Martinez saying. "When you see accidents that have happened or you hear about near-misses, it is just a step we can take to ensure the safety of our citizens."" In August 2009, the council directed city staffers to draft the proposed ban as an ordinance. An Aug. 28, 2009, Statesman news article refers to Martinez as the lead proponent of the ban. According to minutes of the Oct. 22, 2009, council meeting during which members adopted the ban, Martinez made the "main motion" for its approval. The motion was seconded by Mayor Lee Leffingwell. Upshot: Martinez’s claim overshoots because, of course, he could not have imposed the ban by himself. The seven-person council acts on proposed ordinances. Still, Martinez was a leading advocate of the ban. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Mike Martinez	None	None	None	2012-02-21T06:00:00	2012-02-10	['Austin,_Texas']

pomt-11976	Some states hit hardest by opioid deaths "have more opioid prescriptions than residents."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/oct/02/eric-schneiderman/do-some-states-have-more-opioid-prescriptions-resi/	New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said prescribers in some states have been so lenient that they have given out more prescriptions than there are residents in those states. With 33,091 opioid-related deaths in 2015 across the country, the ease in getting prescriptions for the painkillers has become an issue attracting attention from state officials. "Some states hardest hit by the crisis have more opioid prescriptions than residents," Schneiderman said at a press conference. Twenty-three states have a higher rate of opioid overdose deaths than New York state. But is Schneiderman right that some of those states have more opioid prescriptions than residents? National numbers Eight states reported more opioid prescriptions than residents in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The states are Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, West Virginia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Louisiana. Alabama recorded the highest rate, with 125 opioid prescriptions for every 100 people in the state. Even so, Alabama had a lower rate of opioid-related deaths than most other states, according to Centers for Disease Control data analyzed by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research organization. Two other top prescribing states — West Virginia and Kentucky — had some of the highest rates of opioid related deaths. West Virginia had the highest rate in the country, with 36 opioid deaths for every 100,000 residents. The state reported 111 opioid prescriptions for every 100 residents. Kentucky, ranking sixth with 21 deaths for every 100,000 residents, had 102 prescriptions for every 100 residents in 2015. West Virginia’s rate decreased in 2016 to 96 prescriptions for every 100 people. Kentucky’s went down to 97 opioid prescriptions for every 100 people. Alabama remained highest with 121 prescriptions for every 100 people. New York state numbers New York state had 42 prescriptions for every 100 residents in 2016. There were no counties in New York with more opioid prescriptions than residents, according to the state Department of Health. Montgomery County had the highest rate in the state with 82 opioid prescriptions for every 100 residents in the county. The county had two opioid deaths for one of the lowest opioid-related death rates in the state. Our ruling Schneiderman said some states hit hardest by the opioid crisis "have more opioid prescriptions than residents." West Virginia and Kentucky — two states with the highest rates of opioid deaths in the country — reported more opioid prescriptions than their respective population, according to CDC data. Six other states had more prescriptions than residents, too. We rate his claim True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Eric Schneiderman	None	None	None	2017-10-02T04:00:00	2017-09-19	['None']

pomt-01139	"Surveys of teens in high school reveal that knowing a classmate who sells cannabis is 90 times more common than knowing a classmate who sells alcohol."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/dec/21/james-crowley/doctor-says-teens-much-likelier-know-classmate-sel/	A retired doctor recently included an eye-catching statistic in a commentary in The Providence Journal urging the legalization of marijuana in Rhode Island. "Surveys of teens in high school reveal that knowing a classmate who sells cannabis is 90 times more common than knowing a classmate who sells alcohol," wrote James P. Crowley, a past president of the Rhode Island Medical Society and professor emeritus of medicine at Brown University, in a piece published Dec. 6, 2014. Crowley cited the statistic to demonstrate that cannabis is the most commonly sold drug in schools. He warned that its prohibition introduces teens to an underground culture of increasingly more dangerous substances. Crowley supports legislation that would regulate, rather than prohibit cannabis. (In 2013, Rhode Island became the 15th state to decriminalize non-medical marijuana possession; anyone caught with up to one ounce is subject to a $150 fine instead of facing a misdemeanor criminal charge.) While we were doubtful about an underground culture of selling alcohol in schools, we wondered whether Crowley was right. We sent him an email asking him for his source. We also reached out to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to see what comparable statistics these federal agencies had. All responded they did not have data to verify the statement. When Crowley got back to us, he attributed the information to Jared Moffat, director of Regulate Rhode Island, a group that supports legalizing marijuana. Moffat, in turn, referred us to a survey of students, ages 12 to 17, published in 2012 by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University. The "National Survey of American Attitudes on Substance Abuse XVII: Teens," found that 44 percent of the 1,003 students surveyed reported they knew a student who sold drugs at their school. Among that 44 percent, 91 percent reported that they knew a student who sold marijuana on school grounds while about 1 percent, said they knew a student who sold alcohol. The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University did not pose the same question to students in previous surveys, and did not publish a 2013 survey. We reached out to Rhode Island KidsCount and to the state Department of Education to see what information they might have for Rhode Island students. KidsCount did not track that particular information. Elliot Krieger, spokesman for the state Department of Education, referred us to the "SurveyWorks" student survey of 2013-2014. Among the roughly 32,000 Rhode Island students who offered a response, 10.2 percent said someone had sold or given them an illegal drug on school property in the past year. Similarly, 9.5 percent reported that they had been under the influence of alcohol at school in the same timeframe. We also asked Robert Houghtaling, director of the East Greenwich Drug Program, for his take on Crowley’s claim that high school pot dealers far outnumbered students selling alcohol. "Kids usually don’t have to sell alcohol. It’s so easily accessible," Houghtaling said."They steal it from their parents, secure a fake ID, or arrange for someone to buy it for them. "In terms of using, alcohol is still the predominantly most-used drug," he said. "Alcohol is so prevalent people view it as a rite of passage." Our ruling James P. Crowley wrote that "Surveys of teens in high school reveal that knowing a classmate who sells cannabis is 90 times more common than knowing a classmate who sells alcohol." But he could only cite one survey, and we couldn’t find any others that asked the same question. One data point does not a trend make. In addition, his statement suggests that the findings of this survey reflect the results from all students polled. It doesn’t. It only looked at the subset of students who said they knew of someone who sold drugs in school. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-14183	"Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/25/rick-scott/gov-rick-scotts-claim-about-1-billion-tax-cuts-nee/	Despite lawmakers virtually ignoring his budget wish list during the 2016 legislative session, Gov. Rick Scott is boasting about fulfilling a campaign promise to cut taxes by $1 billion in his second term. Scott took credit for the fiscal feat both before and after signing the Legislature’s wide-ranging tax-cut package, HB 7099. "Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes," an April 13, 2016, press release from the governor’s office read. Scott had pledged to hit the billion-dollar mark in tax reductions during his successful 2014 re-election campaign, mostly by giving breaks to businesses and limiting property tax growth. In his March 15 press release announcing his intention to sign the Legislature’s budget, Scott said he’d kept his promise with $1.2 billion in tax cuts over the first two years of his second term. Scott has repeated this claim several times in one form or another. But have taxes really gone down by more than $1 billion in two years, like he says? It depends on how you look at what the Legislature has done, but the changes haven’t happened the way Scott wanted. Tallying the taxes When we asked Scott’s office to break down their budget math for us, they pointed to a chart in their March 15 press release, without further detail: We were able to verify the figures from Scott’s office based on changes passed by the Legislature the last two years. The Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research compiles an annual list of how much tax revenue will be affected by bills passed during that year’s legislative session (these can change as the fiscal picture becomes clearer). The House also analyzed HB 7099 to estimate how much the bill would change tax receipts. Cell phone & TV tax cut: In 2015, the Legislature passed a 1.73 percentage point reduction in the state’s communications services tax, a charge on consumer cell phone, cable and satellite bills. That amounted to a $21 annual reduction on a $100 monthly cell phone and cable bill. Scott had wanted to cut the tax by $120 million, something we’d rated a Promise Kept on our Scott-O-Meter. Property tax reduction: This one is tricky, because it’s more of a tax shift than a tax cut. Scott also is taking credit for a solution he didn’t want. During the 2016 session, the House and Senate agreed to increase per-pupil education spending for K-12 students, something Scott had wanted. Scott initially wanted the bump in education funding paid almost entirely through higher local property tax collections, not with general revenue. (Scott had previously proposed limiting property tax increases with a constitutional amendment, a campaign promise he has so far ignored.) Higher property values meant that collections would increase whether lawmakers raised the key millage rate for local property tax dollars for schools or kept it the same. Instead, the Legislature cut the local rate and paid for the $428 million difference they needed with general tax revenue. Legislators mostly referred to this as "tax relief," and not a tax cut. We’ve rated a similar statement Mostly True, because the change altered future collections, instead of cutting current collections. Property owners, however, are still shielded from a tax hike. Senate Appropriations Chairman Tom Lee, R-Brandon, told the Tampa Bay Times that if you include this revenue swap, Scott "technically" had reached $1 billion in tax cuts. But that’s dependent on Scott accepting a plan he opposed. The Legislature has to revisit education funding every year, too, so this will no doubt change. Back to school sales tax holiday: Scott counts these breaks from sales tax on school supplies as a cut. These aren’t permanent cuts, because the Legislature has to approve whether there will be sales tax holidays each year. His figures do jibe with state estimates. The totals are different, in part, because the 2015 holiday was 10 days long, while the 2016 holiday will only be three days long. The terms of exempt items also differs between the two years. Manufacturing machinery and equipment: Getting rid of this tax was another Scott promise, going back to his first term. The sales tax originally was cut back with a limited exemption in 2012, but the following year was suspended by legislators for three years. Starting in 2014, the tax would not apply through April 30, 2017. Scott pushed to make the suspension permanent and in 2016, the Legislature agreed. The Scott-O-Meter rated this a Promise Kept. College textbooks: Scott proposed making college textbooks exempt from sales tax, suggesting it would save the average student about $60 per year. The Legislature agreed to the exemption for the 2015-16 fiscal year, but it was not renewed in the 2016 session. Other tax cuts: Scott’s office did not include specific dollar figures for other tax breaks, fee changes and provisions that went down over the last two years. In 2015, the Legislature removed sales taxes on gun club membership fees, put a $60,000 cap on taxes for board repairs, and gave businesses tax credits for pollution cleanup and research, among other measures. For 2016, legislators gave veterans’ organizations an exemption on food and drink sales taxes, phased out an asphalt tax over three years for government projects, and tinkered with taxes on cruise ship alcohol and tobacco sales, pear cider, and aviation fuel, among other changes. That’s just a sample of the tax changes over the last two years that Scott’s office counted. The figures are in the ballpark and add up somewhere north of $1 billion. Whether he can take credit for the total is a tougher question. Experts have told us that counting on things like tax credits and sales tax holidays means consumers have to spend money first before enjoying any benefits. Many of these changes also are temporary or narrowly focused. And remember that local governments may have to raise taxes to account for a change in revenue. Meanwhile, the Legislature has balked at several tax changes Scott has wanted, including eliminating the state’s corporate income tax — a major Scott request in 2016 that would have cost the state $770 million annually — and phasing out the sales tax on commercial leases. Our ruling Scott said, "Over the past two years, Florida has cut more than $1 billion in taxes." The figures are pretty accurate compared to state estimates for tax changes during 2015 and 2016. But there’s some question whether you can really consider all of the measures tax cuts. While some of the alterations are permanent, many of them are temporary exemptions or target very specific beneficiaries. Scott also has to ignore some of his earlier proposals and count a plan for education funding that is the opposite of what he wanted to top the $1 billion mark. The statement is accurate but needs some clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-12472	Says Tammy Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about "overmedicated veterans," she made "deadly mistakes" and "three veterans died" at the Tomah VA hospital.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/05/americas-pac/super-pac-attack-blaming-tammy-baldwin-deaths-3-ve/	When seeking re-election in 2018, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin could be vulnerable to criticism of how she responded to an opioid painkiller scandal at the Tomah VA Medical Center in western Wisconsin. But an attack ad from Americas PAC that began airing April 27, 2017 claims Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about "overmedicated veterans" at Tomah and made "deadly mistakes" that left three veterans dead. The first-term Wisconsin Democrat has said her office made mistakes in handling a key inspection report about the Tomah VA and emails from a whistleblower. But that’s different than making mistakes that were deadly to three veterans. One death occurred years after the veteran ended his treatment at the Tomah VA and another had nothing to do with overmedication. As for the third veteran, Jason Simcakoski, Baldwin had requested investigations into the Tomah prescription practices before Simcakoski overdosed at the facility. And although Baldwin was slow to respond to emails from a whistleblower, those emails weren’t received until after Simakoski’s death. The ad Americas PAC is an Iowa-based super PAC that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for or against political candidates. It is largely funded by Republican Richard Uihlein, co-founder of Uline, a Wisconsin shipping and packaging supplies distributor. Another Uihlein-supported super PAC, also eyeing 2018, previously attacked Baldwin with a claim we rated Mostly False about funding U.S. military troops. As for the Americas PAC attack, we’re presenting the entire script of its radio ad to show how sound bites, spliced with narration, connect Baldwin to the the deaths. Newscast audio: New developments tonight in a Wisconsin VA hospital investigation. Senator Tammy Baldwin -- Newscast audio: -- and investigating claims of a cover-up involving one Senate Democrat. Narrator: A whistleblower went to Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin for help protecting disabled veterans. Newscast audio: Senator Tammy Baldwin learned of the allegations that the patients were being overmedicated. Narrator: And Tammy Baldwin was slow to take action. Talk show audio: -- critical of Senator Baldwin of having a delayed reaction to the March report. Narrator: When disabled veterans were counting on her, Tammy Baldwin blinked. Interviewer audio: Did your office drop the ball? Baldwin audio clip: Mistakes were made. Narrator: Deadly mistakes. Three disabled veterans died. Newscast audio: -- after the deaths of three patients at a VA hospital. Narrator: When facing security challenges from Russia, China and ISIS, will Tammy Baldwin make another mistake? Now let's look at the three deaths. Two of the deaths The Tomah VA and how politicians responded to problems there have been in the news since January 2015, when the California-based Center for Investigative Reporting exposed the overprescription of opioid drugs by the facility. The day after the Baldwin attack ad began airing, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that two Wisconsin radio stations had pulled the ad after lawyers for Baldwin’s campaign complained it was false. Tom Donelson of Americas PAC told the Journal Sentinel and us that the committee stands by the ad. But two of the three deaths clearly don’t support the attack on Baldwin: Jacob Ward had been heavily medicated at the Tomah VA and later became a drug addict. But his parents said his care at Tomah ended in 2007 and they transferred him to the Milwaukee VA in 2008 and that they didn’t blame the Tomah VA for his death. Ward, who was 27, overdosed on heroin and cocaine in a Milwaukee apartment on Sept. 4, 2013. That was six years after he stopped going to Tomah and a year before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin. Thomas Patrick Baer, 74, died Jan. 14, 2015 at a hospital in La Crosse, Wis., two days after he suffered two strokes at the Tomah VA while waiting for treatment there. His death was not connected to overmedication. That leaves Simcakoski, who suffered a fatal drug overdose in the psychiatric ward of the Tomah VA. He had been prescribed 15 drugs, including muscle relaxants, tranquilizers, antipsychotic medicines and an opioid painkiller. Let’s look at a timeline of his case and how it relates to Baldwin, based primarily on Gannett Wisconsin Media news reports. Jason Simcakoski Between April and June of 2014, Baldwin wrote letters to the Tomah VA director, a VA official in Washington and the VA inspector general in Washington. She asked each of them to investigate allegations that "a large percentage of veterans" at the Tomah VA were being treated for abuse of opioids and other drugs that had originally been prescribed by the facility -- and that continued to be prescribed to them. The allegations were made by a constituent who wanted to remain anonymous, according to the letters. That means Baldwin had taken those steps months before the Simcakoski’s death, which occurred on Aug. 30, 2014. Moreover, Ryan Honl, the whistleblower alluded to in the radio ad, didn’t make a complaint to Baldwin’s office until nearly a month later. Baldwin nevertheless has been criticized because she took no action between Aug. 29, 2014 -- the day before Simcakoski’s death, when her office received an inspection report documenting the overprescribing of opioids at Tomah -- and January 2015, when the Center for Investigative Reporting revealed the circumstances of his death and Baldwin called for an investigation. In between, Honl had repeatedly emailed Baldwin’s office asking that Baldwin call for an investigation and make the inspection report public. Baldwin later said she was disciplining her chief of staff and two other aides for failing to take appropriate action on complaints about Tomah. And she said her office made mistakes in handling the inspection report and the whistleblower’s pleas. Still, Baldwin didn’t receive the inspection report until the day before Simcakoski’s death and the whistleblower didn’t begin contacting her until after Simcakoski’s death. Our rating Americas PAC says Baldwin was told by a whistleblower about "overmedicated veterans," she made "deadly mistakes" and "three veterans died" at the Tomah VA hospital. Baldwin has acknowledged mistakes in the handling of an inspection report and a whistle blower’s emails about veterans being over prescribed opioid painkillers at Tomah. But none of those tie Baldwin to the deaths. One death had nothing to do with overmedication. One was an overdose, but it occurred in Milwaukee years after the veteran stopped being treated in Tomah and before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin. And the third death, though an overdose at the Tomah VA, also occurred before the whistleblower contacted Baldwin (and only one day after she received the inspection report). We rate the statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Related fact check: The attack on Baldwin is along the lines of one made against Democrat Russ Feingold, who ran unsuccessfully against Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in 2016. A super PAC claimed that when Feingold was in the Senate, he received a memo in 2009 that "outlined veteran harm" at the Tomah VA "and nothing was done." Our rating was False, as there was no evidence Feingold received the memo.	None	Americas PAC	None	None	None	2017-05-05T05:00:00	2017-04-27	['None']
pomt-13044	"Study after study have shown that sanctuary cities do not lead to an increase in crime because of the presence of people that are undocumented."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/28/javier-m-gonzales/santa-fe-mayor-defends-sanctuary-cities-says-studi/	Mayors across America are doubling down on their cities’ decisions to serve as a "sanctuary" for immigrants living in the country illegally, despite President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to cut federal funding. Javier Gonzales, mayor of Santa Fe, N.M., appeared on Fox News recently defending his city’s stance to not assist federal officials with immigration enforcement. Megyn Kelly, host of Fox News’ The Kelly File, asked Gonzales about criticism directed at cities like Santa Fe, claiming that "sanctuary cities" attract criminals. Gonzales said his city prioritizes going after people who commit violent crimes, regardless of their immigration status. There’s also evidence that sanctuary cities aren’t a magnet for crime, he said. "Study after study have shown that sanctuary cities do not lead to an increase in crime because of the presence of people that are undocumented," Gonzales said Nov. 16. Is that true? 'Sanctuary cities' Despite the name, a sanctuary city is not always a city, it can be a town, county or other jurisdiction. There isn’t a federal law defining sanctuary locations, but the term is generally applied to places that have policies or ordinances limiting their assistance to federal immigration authorities who seek to apprehend and deport immigrants in the country illegally. The modern-day sanctuary concept stems from the 1980s when churches opened their doors to shelter Central Americans who fled violence in their countries and lived illegally in the United States, fearing deportation. The New Sanctuary Movement rolled out in 2007 as places of worship across the country became a refuge for immigrants facing deportation. There are at least 50 congregations across the United States offering sanctuary. Churches, schools, hospitals and public demonstrations such as rallies and parades are considered by immigration officials as sensitive locations, where enforcement actions are generally avoided but can take place with approval from a supervisor or under "exigent circumstances." The exact number of jurisdictions deemed sanctuary cities fluctuates as places adopt or abandon policies. The specifics of the policies also vary from place to place. The mayor of New Orleans, for instance, says the term "sanctuary city" does not apply to his city, but some critics say it has practices that parallel policies in other places that openly embrace the title, the Times-Picayune reported. Lena Graber, a special projects attorney for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, estimated there are more than 500 counties and 38 cities with policies not to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Federal laws say state and local governments or officers may not prohibit the maintenance or exchange of individuals' immigration records with other local, state or federal entities, according to a 2009 Congressional Research Service report. However, if jurisdictions don't ask individuals about their immigration status, then they don't have the information that could potentially be kept and shared, the report said. Supporters of sanctuary cities say not questioning people about their immigration status builds trust between police and the community, encouraging residents to report crime. If an undocumented immigrant gets arrested for a non-immigration offense, they can still be charged, tried and convicted for that crime, Graber said. Opponents contend that sanctuary cities attract illegal immigration and undermine enforcement of the law. Any crime by someone in the country illegally is a crime that could have been avoided by having removed that person, said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks to reduce immigration levels. What studies show The Santa Fe mayor’s office sent over multiple studies that found immigrants are less prone to commit crime than people born in the United States. They also highlighted a report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant group, saying that held true for immigrants here legally and illegally. But there isn’t a lot of research specific to sanctuary cities and their impact on crime, experts said. Sanctuary ordinances have been around for more than 30 years, but only until recently have social scientists been able to study their effect on crime rates, said Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University. A 2009 study out of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law cites Austin, Texas, as an example where cooperation between immigrant communities and law enforcement led to an increase in crime reporting and lower crime levels. Other examples of decreases in crime due to immigrant-friendly policies are also cited in this 2012 study. Research also suggests that crime reporting -- especially in communities with a high proportion of immigrants -- is very likely negatively impacted when immigration enforcement practices are carried out by local officials, said Charis E. Kubrin, a criminology professor at University of California, Irvine. A 2014 study by collaborators at University of Chicago and New York University on whether the immigration enforcement program known as Secure Communities reduced crime showed there was no significant rise in crime in sanctuary cities during the program’s rollout, Cohen said. Under the program (which has been replaced), when someone was booked into a police station or jail, that person’s information was sent to the FBI and Department of Homeland Security, ultimately to figure out the person’s immigration record. More recently, researchers at the University of California at Riverside and Highline College found sanctuary policies do not affect crime rates either way. The study included analysis of violent crime, property crime and rape. "Sanctuary policies in terms of leading to crime do not appear to be a problem," the October 2016 study said. "In fact ... almost all research that assesses links between immigration and criminality find an inverse relationship." Trump campaigned against sanctuary policies by bringing up incidents of undocumented immigrants in these cities committing violent crimes, such as the alleged shooting by a Mexican national of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco. But we did not turn up evidence of sanctuary cities leading to an increase in crime. Qualitative information on sanctuary practices suggests they are beneficial to criminal law enforcement practices, said Phil Torrey, a lecturer on law with the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program and supervising attorney for the Harvard Immigration Project. A rise in crime in a sanctuary city could be caused by factors unrelated to that city’s undocumented population, Torrey said. For instance, a city’s rising population can account for increased overall criminal arrests, he said. Our ruling Gonzales said, "Study after study have shown that sanctuary cities do not lead to an increase in crime because of the presence of people that are undocumented." The data behind Gonzales’ point about sanctuary cities is not conclusive or as extensive as he described. However, a recent study by academic researchers found that sanctuary policies have no effect on crime rates. Other studies have found a reduction in crime as a result of cooperation between immigrant communities and law enforcement. Scholars also say immigrants, including those in the country illegally, are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population. Gonzales' statement overstates the breadth of research on this topic but is on the right track.

pomt-09747	Other Western countries have ended their "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policies.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/12/carl-levin/levin-claims-other-western-countries-have-lifted-t/	President Barack Obama has repeatedly said that he plans to repeal the military's "don't ask, don't tell" rule, which prevents openly gay and lesbian people from serving in the military. But so far, no go. Meet the Press host David Gregory asked Michigan Democrat Carl Levin, who chairs the Senate's Armed Services Committee, whether Obama would follow through on his promise. "I think he will and he can," Levin said on the program on Oct. 11, 2009. "I think it has to be done in the right way, which is to get a buy-in from the military, which I think is now possible. Other militaries in the West, the British and other Western armies, have ended this discriminatory policy. We can do it successfully." Before we dig into Levin's claim that other Western countries have already repealed similar policies, some background: On the campaign trail, Obama wrote an open letter to the LGBT — lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender — community, stating that, as president, he would "bring about real change for all LGBT Americans." Chief among his efforts would be a repeal of the military's rule, one that was put into place during the Clinton administration. That's easier said than done, however. Obama cannot simply undo "don't ask, don't tell" — it must be repealed by Congress. So, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in March 2009 that the administration was not actively pursuing a rule change, we gave Obama a Stalled on our Obameter for his promise to overturn the policy. The issue was back in the news Oct. 11 when Obama spoke at a gathering of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization. He told the group: "I'm working with the Pentagon, its leadership and the members of the House and Senate on ending this policy." Levin hopes the policy will change. To underscore his optimism, he pointed out that the United States wouldn't be the first country to repeal laws banning gays from the military. Australia ended its ban on homosexuals in the military in 1992, as did Canada. Levin is also right that Britain does not prohibit gays and lesbians from serving. Its ban was lifted in 2000, when the European Court of Human Rights settled a two-year legal battle involving four homosexual service members. All told, at least 25 Western countries have no ban on gays and lesbians in the military, according to the Palm Center, a public policy think tank associated with the University of California at Santa Barbara. As of June 2009, that list includes Germany, Austria, Spain, Finland and France. So, Levin is correct that other Western countries, including Britain, have ended policies that prevent gays and lesbians from serving openly. We give him a True.

pomt-08891	When Obama went to Pakistan in 1981, he could not have been traveling as a U.S. citizen.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/30/chain-email/e-mail-says-obama-had-have-been-traveling-another-/	In an effort to prove that Barack Obama is not eligible to be president, birthers have come up with some very creative arguments. A curious reader forwarded a chain e-mail that made an interesting claim. "Pakistan was on the U.S. State Department's 'no travel' list in 1981," read the e-mail. Therefore, "when Obama went to Pakistan in 1981 he was traveling either with a British passport or an Indonesian passport." The most effective chain e-mails, like the best lies, are built on an incorrect but seemingly plausible "fact" that they follow to what seems like a sound conclusion. In this case, the "fact" on which the entire argument rests is that Pakistan was on a "no travel" list in 1981. If that were true, Obama would either have had to use a different passport or enter the country illegally and request his passport not be stamped, as some Americans have done over the years to travel to Cuba. Obama has said he traveled to Pakistan in 1981. He was on summer vacation from college, and, after visiting his mother in Indonesia, he traveled to Pakistan with a college friend. However, according to the U.S. Department of State, the department in charge of issuing travel bans, Pakistan had a green light for adventurous U.S. citzens. "According to our Pakistan experts," said Ivna Giauque, a public affairs officer at the State Department, "there was no travel ban to Pakistan in 1981." Without the original premise that Pakistan had a travel ban, the rest of the argument deteriorates. The author of the e-mail may have been confusing a travel warning or travel advisory with a travel ban. The University of Illinois at Chicago Library has an archive of State Department documents, including one from Aug. 17, 1981, issuing a travel advisory for Pakistan. It is the oldest travel advisory document in the archive related to Pakistan. Even if Obama traveled after the advisory was issued instead of earlier in the summer, the State Department confirmed it wasn't illegal. Our good friends at Snopes and Factcheck.org found a travel article about visiting Pakistan published in the New York Times in June 1981, and it mentions nothing about such travel being illegal. An August 1981 letter to the editor in the New York Times by the U.S. Consul General in Lahore, Pakistan, encouraged people to come visit. We also found an ad in the New York Times from March which listed Karachi and Lahore as two destinations in their travel package. In 1981, travel to Pakistan was not illegal or prohibited. Somebody was just looking for an excuse to promote the birther conspiracy, so we rate it Pants On Fire.

pomt-11930	"A California health care CEO is promising to reduce our prescription drug costs."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2017/oct/13/ohioans-against-deceptive-rx-ballot-issue/ad-opposing-ohio-issue-2-wrongly-portrays-proponen/	A TV advertisement opposing Ohio’s Issue 2 ballot initiative to lower drug costs portrayed the initiative as a ploy by the health care industry to hike up costs. "Over the next few months, you’re going to hear a lot about the November ballot issue on prescription drugs," the May 23, 2017, video says. "A California health care CEO is promising to reduce our prescription drug costs. It sounds too good to be true, because it is." They went on to list a number of associations opposing the ballot initiative because they "believe it could increase drug costs for millions of Ohioans." If approved on Nov. 7, Issue 2 would require all drugs bought by the state -- whether for Medicaid or other state programs -- to match Veterans Affairs prices, which receive a 24 percent discount off market price in addition to sometimes undisclosed rebates. The idea is that it would lower the state’s health care costs. Whether or not the ballot initiative can achieve its goal -- or the opposite -- is contested, as we wrote about in another fact-check. For this check, we wanted to know if the person behind the initiative was indeed a health care CEO. His title is complicated, but the ad’s message is misleading. Notably, the video failed to mention that the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association representing drugmakers, was behind the opposition campaign. The ad attacks Michael Weinstein, the president and co-founder of the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the biggest AIDS-fighting organization in the world. And he’s behind both this ballot initiative and a similar one in California. "Both the New York Times and the LA Times have referred to Mr. Weinstein as the CEO of his organization — AHF — which is clearly a health care organization," Dale Butland, a spokesman for the opposition campaign, told us. "Indeed, the New York Times Magazine profile of Mr. Weinstein was titled 'The CEO of HIV.' " Christopher Glazek, the author of the New York Times Magazine story, said the title of the piece was intended as "arch." "It's a nonprofit, and his official title isn't CEO," Glazek said. The organization derives its revenues from a network of pharmacies and clinics that provide care to mostly government-insured patients. The excess income goes to provide free care to more than 773,000 H.I.V. patients worldwide. Weinstein’s annual report showed a salary of $400,000, which Glazek characterized as "low for directors of similarly sized nonprofits." Christine Mai-Duc, who co-wrote the Los Angeles Times article, said, "He is referred to as the ‘chief executive’ in a photo caption in our story, not in the story itself." However, she noted that a follow-up story referred to him as the foundation’s "top executive." The group that favors the initiative said the description of Glazek is just wrong, and it’s politically motivated. "I think calling him a health care CEO would be disingenuous if it were banal, but considering they are in the process of character assassination, then it is wrong that drug company CEOs are spending money from excessive profits to try to label him as one of them," said Dennis Willard, a spokesman for Ohio Taxpayers for Lower Drug Prices. The drug lobby PhRMA has so far outspent the AIDS Foundation roughly 5 to 1, according to the Columbus Dispatch. Our ruling An ad against Ohio’s Issue 2 ballot initiative said, "A California health care CEO is promising to reduce our prescription drug costs." Weinstein is the president and co-founder of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a nonprofit funding Issue 2, but the articles cited by the campaign referred to Weinstein as a CEO either in jest or in a photo caption. His organization deals with health care and he is indeed its top executive, but the ad makes it seem as though he represents the drug industry, which is actually true of the ad makers. It’s the national association for pharmaceutical companies that opposes the ballot measure. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-13813	Says no one from the Bush family attended the 2012 Republican National Convention and "there was no President Bush" at the 2008 convention.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/17/reince-priebus/priebus-wrongly-says-no-bush-attended-2012-rnc/	Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus is confident the Cleveland RNC will be a success, even without a Bush in attendance. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former presidents George W. and George H.W. Bush all declined to participate or attend the 2016 nominating convention. Meet the Press host Chuck Todd offered the decision of the Bush family to spurn the 2016 convention as evidence that this year’s event will be a little different. "You’re not showcasing the best parts of your party," Todd said to Priebus, adding "it is unusual not to have a Bush at the convention." Priebus responded: "It didn’t happen four years ago" at the 2012 RNC in Tampa. Priebus added after some back-and-forth that that "there was no President Bush" at the RNC in 2008. Claims about the pre-eminence of the Bush family in Republican politics have come up before. We previously rated True a claim that Republicans haven’t won an election without a Bush or Nixon since 1928. In this case we wondered if Priebus was right that the Bush family eschewed the RNC in some form in 2012 and 2008. He wasn’t. The 2012 convention It’s been nearly eight years since a Bush has held national elected office, but the family has maintained a role at the nominating convention. Since 1980, every Republican convention has seen a Bush speak — often as the vice presidential or presidential nominee. That includes the 2012 convention in Tampa, which saw the nomination of Mitt Romney. Jeb Bush addressed delegates at the convention, as this video confirms. He touted his love for his brother, criticized President Barack Obama’s record and discussed children and education. "If we want to continue to be the greatest nation on the planet, we must give our kids what we promised them — an equal opportunity," he said. "That starts in the classroom. It starts in our communities. It starts where you live and it starts with nominating Mitt Romney the next president of the United States." 2000, 2004 and 2008 Priebus also contended in his interview with Todd that there was no "President Bush" at the 2008 RNC in St. Paul, Minn. That’s not entirely correct, either. President George W. Bush addressed convention delegates live from the White House. Bush told convention delegates that he remained in Washington to oversee recovery efforts related to Hurricane Gustav. Bush, however, praised GOP nominee Arizona Sen. John McCain. "He is ready to lead this nation," Bush said. "From the day of his commissioning John McCain was a respected Naval officer who made decisions on which the lives of others depended." First Lady Laura Bush spoke live from the convention, which also included appearances by former President George H.W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush, video from the event shows. George W. Bush, the 2004 GOP nominee, of course spoke at the New York City 2004 convention as well, as did Laura Bush. Same for 2000 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992 and 1996 The list goes on. Former president George H.W. Bush spoke at the 1996 convention in San Diego, Calif., which eventually nominated former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole. George H.W. Bush spoke in Houston, Texas, for the 1992 convention, as part of his failed re-election campaign.The same goes for 1988, when he was named the Republican nominee for the first time. In 1984, George H. W. Bush was selected as the vice-presidential nominee (Ronald Reagan was nominated for president). The same thing happened in 1980, and Bush spoke on both occasions. The earliest convention we could find without a Bush speaking was in 1976, where Gerald Ford was selected as the Republican nominee. To recap, that’s at least 40 years and nine conventions where a Bush had a speaking role. And members of the Bush family definitely spoke at both the 2012 and 2008 conventions. Our ruling Priebus said it’s not a big deal a Bush isn’t attending the 2016 convention, because a Bush didn’t speak in 2012 and "there was no President Bush" at the 2008 convention. He’s wrong. Jeb Bush addressed delegates at the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa. In 2008, George W. Bush addressed delegates via a live video feed, but former President George H.W. Bush and former first ladies Laura and Barbara Bush all attended. A Bush has spoken at every RNC since at least 1980, we found.

pomt-00478	Says "43 of Joe’s legislative proposals have become law, including 21 since President Trump took office."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/13/joe-donnelly/facts-behind-joe-donnellys-senate-effectiveness/	Joe Donnelly, incumbent senator running for re-election in Indiana, touted his effective lawmaking during a seven-day campaign trip around the state. "43 of Joe’s legislative proposals have become law, including 21 since President Trump took office," an Aug. 8 press release from the Donnelly campaign read. The campaign has repeated this figure time and again, on the road and in campaign statements. It contradicts, however, what President Donald Trump said about Donnelly, whom he dubbed "Sleepin’ Joe" during a May 11 campaign rally for Republican challenger Mike Braun. "The Center for Effective Lawmaking named Joe Donnelly the least effective Democrat lawmaker in the United States Senate," Trump said. "He's never sponsored a bill that has become a law." So who’s right? In a way, both are correct. The Center for Effective Lawmaking, a nonpartisan research project run by two political science professors, assigns credit based on who is the sponsor of a bill, as recorded by the Library of Congress. Based on that definition, Donnelly has never sponsored a bill that became a law during his first term in the Senate. That doesn’t mean none of his legislative proposals in the Senate have become law. Craig Volden, who co-directs the center, noted that the criteria for advancing a legislative proposal could be broadened. A closer search of the Library of Congress database shows 28 bills that became law on which Donnelly was among the co-sponsors. He was an original co-sponsor, a higher bar, on five of these. Language from Donnelly’s bills, and from amendments he proposed, have also made their way into law, mostly through annual budget acts. In all, these add up to 43 total and 17 under Trump. For example, Donnelly introduced a bill in 2013 to improve suicide prevention efforts in the military. The bill didn’t get far on its own, but Donnelly got the proposal passed in the National Defense Authorization Act in 2014 as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. More recently, Donnelly helped author Right to Try, a bill aimed at getting drugs that had not been FDA-approved to terminally ill patients. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., was the sponsor of the bill, so Donnelly didn’t get that credit on Congress.gov — but Johnson gave it to him at a press conference. "My primary co-sponsor, Sen. Donnelly, was a stalwart," Johnson said. "This would not have happened without Joe Donnelly." Volden said that while valid measures of effectiveness, "there is no similar comprehensive measure of the other senators in this regard that would allow a systematic comparison and ranking of senators on these criteria." Experts told us being in the minority in a divided Congress makes it harder for Donnelly to have gotten much passed anyway. Donnelly took office in 2013, and Democrats held the majority until 2015. "As you can see, passing the version he sponsors would let him claim credit easily — incorporating it elsewhere would not," said Corrine McConnaughy, political science professor at George Washington University. "Partisans busy undermining each other absolutely may seek ways to prevent credit-claiming by the other party's members." That said, Donnelly has demonstrated willingness to cross the aisle. The Lugar Center's Bipartisan Index (named for former Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.) measures the frequency with which a member gets co-sponsors for their bills from the other party and the frequency with which they co-sponsor bills introduced by the other party. They ranked Donnelly fourth among senators and first among Democratic senators. Our ruling Donnelly’s campaign said, "43 of Joe’s legislative proposals have become law, including 21 since President Trump took office." None of those were the bills he sponsored on his own that became law. But in a gridlocked Congress, that’s not unusual for a senator in the minority. Instead, Donnelly co-sponsored bills, wrote amendments and crafted language that made its way into 43 laws during his single Senate term. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-05740	There are "a larger number of shark attacks in Florida than there are cases of voter fraud."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/02/aclu-florida/shark-attacks-are-more-common-voter-fraud-florida/	On March 1, 2012, Comedy Central’s Stephen Colbert moved in on Florida’s controversial new election law for a recurring segment, "People Who Are Destroying America." The target: a Panhandle teacher named Dawn Quarles, who turned in 76 voter registration forms from her students beyond the state’s new 48-hour deadline. She could face a $1,000 fine. One of the people Colbert interviewed for his sarcastic report is Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida. Florida officials claimed they needed to pass the law to prevent voter fraud, but these cases are actually pretty rare, he said. "There are probably a larger number of shark attacks in Florida than there are cases of voter fraud," he said. We couldn’t resist diving in: Are there more shark attacks than cases of voter fraud in Florida? We compiled this chart using data from the Florida Department of State, which monitors elections, and the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville, which has a renowned ichthyology department. (Ichthyology is the study of fish.) The shark attack figures include documented instances of sharks attacking human victims. The voter fraud cases indicate the number of cases deemed legally sufficient for an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. FLORIDA 2008 2009 2010 2011 Total Sharks attacks 28 19 14* 11 72 Voter fraud cases 16 9 10 14 49 *includes one fatal attack If we were considering 2011 alone, when voter fraud cases exceeded shark attacks, this could have been ruled False. But spreading our data out over four years shows shark attacks happen more frequently than voter fraud cases. Florida regularly leads the country in unprovoked shark attacks. In 2011, Florida’s 11 attacks comprised 38 percent of the nation’s total and 15 percent of the world’s attacks. Volusia County, home to the spring-break mecca of Daytona Beach, had the most attacks (six). While the shark attack figures are cut and dry (sorry!), the voter fraud numbers are not. There could be more cases than we know about, involving more people. The numbers may not represent total voter fraud cases, as those could be handled by local supervisors and state attorneys. Also, one "case" may represent multiple counts of voter fraud, perpetrated by multiple people, said agency spokesman Chris Cate. He points to a November 2011 case that resulted in the arrests of nine people from the North Florida town of Madison, including the supervisor of elections. On the other hand, the fraud list does not count only convictions. So some of these cases could be proven unfounded. The ACLU’s claim is true on its face, but we’re knocking it down a peg with consideration of a few things. One, the state’s count doesn’t represent a complete set of possible fraud being prosecuted in the state. Two, a "case" does not always include just one instance of fraud. Using the Madison case as an example, we know nine people were arrested in just one case. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-02971	"Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion."	false	/texas/statements/2013/oct/22/texas-right-life/davis-says-she-opposes-late-term-abortions-certain/	The day state Sen. Wendy Davis announced her run for governor, Texas Right to Life announced it would air a radio ad calling her an "abortion zealot." Audio that the anti-abortion group released Oct. 3, 2013, of its ad said, "Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion." That’s a clear-cut statement, which the group also had on its website. An Oct. 3, 2013, entry on the site said that Davis’s "views are so fanatical that she opposes any safeguards for the unborn at any stage of pregnancy, up to and including the final weeks before birth… (Davis) thoroughly aired her abortion views during her 11-hour filibuster in June in her failed attempt to block the new Pro-Life law from passing." A spokeswoman for the group, Melissa Conway, told us by phone that her group could not immediately provide backup information. Davis, a Fort Worth Democrat, was indelibly linked to abortion issues by her June 25, 2013, filibuster, which made headlines worldwide and briefly helped derail changes in law intended to restrict abortions. Campaign spokesman Bo Delp told us by email it’s incorrect to say Davis opposes any limits. "Like most Texans, Sen. Davis opposes late-term abortions except when the life or health of the mother is endangered, in cases of rape or incest or in the case of severe and irreversible fetal abnormalities," Delp said. Delp’s response fits with an Oct. 5, 2013, news story in the Austin American-Statesman saying that Davis, while addressing the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., Aug. 5, 2013, was asked, "Could you discuss what legal limits on abortion you do support?" She replied, "You know, the Supreme Court has made that decision. And it’s one of the protected liberties under our Constitution. And I respect the constitutional protections that are in place today." The Supreme Court’s 1973 landmark decision in Roe v Wade struck down a Texas law that banned all abortions except those performed to save the mother’s life. The justices ruled then that states can’t restrict or ban abortions in the first trimester (roughly three months or the first 12 weeks of the pregnancy). Their ruling said, though, that states can make laws governing abortions in the second trimester if the laws are "reasonably related" to the woman’s health. After the point at which fetuses attain "viability," meaning they can survive outside the womb, states can limit or ban abortions unless the woman’s life is in danger, the court held. So in her response in Washington, Davis signaled that she both accepts letting states limit abortions after the first trimester and limit or ban abortions after fetuses are viable, unless the mother’s life is at risk. Elected to the Senate in 2008, Davis voted in 2009 and 2011 against state legislation requiring women to get sonograms before having an abortion. The measure passed into law in 2011 requires doctors performing abortions to provide a sonogram 24 hours before the abortion and describe what the image shows, including the fetus' size, body features and internal organs. Her 2013 filibuster delayed, but didn’t prevent the Republican-majority Legislature from approving restrictions that will soon begin taking effect. Starting Oct. 29, 2013, the law bans abortions after the 20th week post-fertilization, except when the woman’s life is endangered or in cases of severe fetal abnormality; requires abortion doctors to gain admitting privileges in a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic; and beefs up regulations on the dispensing of abortion-inducing drugs. Starting Sept. 1, 2014, the law requires that all abortion clinics meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers. In its October news story, the Statesman quoted a Davis adviser as saying that Davis would not have picked a fight over the 20-week provision by itself. However, she indicated in the early part of her filibuster that she was opposed to that provision on medical grounds. "From our medical community, we’ve heard the concern that this interferes with the practice of medicine," Davis said, according to CounterPath Press’ transcript of the filibuster. "As important, we know that concerns have been raised that this ban interferes with a woman’s health care decision before she and her doctor may have important health information about her own health and the health of the pregnancy." Repeatedly during the filibuster, Davis said that a major reason she opposed the legislation was that in her view, its provisions were not intended to make women safer but to make sure fewer abortions were performed. "I think that the state of Texas has already established a fine standard of care," she said. Our ruling Texas Right to Life said, "Wendy Davis opposes any limits on abortion." Although Davis has spoken and voted against certain abortion limits, her campaign statement and her stated support for the Roe v. Wade decision indicate she opposes late-term abortions except in extreme circumstances. The group did not provide, and we did not find, evidence of Davis opposing "any limits on abortion." We rate this claim as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-08885	When Atlanta Police Chief George Turner was interim head of the department, overall crime fell 14 percent and violent crime dropped 22.7 percent.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/01/kasim-reed/atlanta-mayor-said-city-posted-big-crime-drops-whe/	George Turner won his post as Atlanta police chief after a whirlwind of accomplishment. By the time Mayor Kasim Reed announced Turner's nomination July 9, the veteran city cop had spent seven months as the department's interim leader. Under his command, officers were closing more cases, Reed said. Recruitment was up. Best of all, crime was down. Way down. Overall, it dropped 14 percent from the same period last year, according to a July 9 press release from the mayor's office announcing Turner's selection. Property crime sank 12.3 percent. And the reduction in violent crime was even more dramatic, according to the press release: 22.7 percent. That's why Reed decided he needed to keep Turner as head of the Atlanta Police Department, the release said. "The results we are seeing suggest we are moving in the right direction and I want to build on the progress we have made," the release quoted Reed as saying. The City Council approved Turner unanimously last Tuesday. A nearly 23 percent drop in violent crime? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a deeper look. Reducing crime was one of Reed's central campaign promises. He tapped Turner to help him fulfill it. Nationally, crime is at historic lows. Violent crime dropped across the country by 5.5 percent in 2009, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation figures. In Atlanta last year, it fell 14 percent. Police don't control broad crime-producing factors such as city demographics or the economy, but researchers have demonstrated that certain law enforcement strategies can cut crime. The mayor's press release gives the impression that the crime calculations are based upon a monthly report compiled by Atlanta police with data that they send to the FBI. The FBI uses the numbers to issue the agency's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), which give yearly and semiannual snapshots of crime nationwide. The press release cited the UCR figures from April, about two months before Reed nominated Turner as the Atlanta's new chief. A PolitiFact Georgia analysis shows the mayor's crime numbers don't add up. The city's own figures don't match the press release. One problem is that the press release understated the actual drop in overall crime and property crime, which were 16 percent and 17 percent, according to the UCR data. The bigger problem is that the city overstated the drop in violent crime -- murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults. It fell only 16 percent. That's about one-third less than the 22.7 percent the mayor took credit for. Violent crimes tend to worry people the most, so PolitiFact Georgia decided to do more checking. Police provided crime numbers to PolitiFact Georgia from their Command Operation Briefings to Revitalize Atlanta program. Commanders regularly use COBRA data to analyze crime trends. These numbers are slightly different from UCR figures because the FBI asks agencies to calculate crime in a very specific way. But if crime drops dramatically by one measure, the second should show a similar decrease. We reviewed the COBRA figures from Jan. 4, when Turner started as interim chief, through July 9, when Reed announced he wanted him to be the permanent head. They show overall and property crime were down by roughly the same amount as the release stated: 13 percent and 14 percent. But the news the COBRA figures held for violent crime was even worse than what the UCR indicated. That category dropped 11 percent. That's less than half what the mayor's office said. So why the major difference? The mayor's press release used a different set of figures: "rolling monthly averages," a spokeswoman said. It's a way of organizing data to smooth out unusual crime spikes or drops that can obscure an overall trend. For instance, to get December 2009's rolling monthly average, you'd average the UCR crime totals from January 2009 through December 2009. The mayor's office determined violent crime dropped 22.7 percent by comparing averages from April 2009 and April 2010. The problem is that April 2010 rolling monthly averages incorporate crime dynamics that were in play as far back as May 2009, well before Turner was interim chief. A spokeswoman for the mayor's office acknowledges they didn't use the proper figures and said they will in the future cite COBRA and UCR data when they discuss crime trends in public. The mayor's office also noted another problem: The 22.7 number was wrong. It should be a 16 percent decrease. After PolitiFact Georgia questioned City Hall about the numbers, they realized they entered the data incorrectly. Still, city spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs Dade said that this is a good-size decline. "We think those numbers really do represent a significant decrease in crime since January 2010," Dade said. Where does this leave us? The nearly 23 percent drop in violent crime was among Reed's key arguments for making Turner the city's new police chief. It appeared repeatedly in news accounts as evidence of his qualifications. If you zero in on the precise dates between Turner's appointment as interim chief and the announcement of his selection, violent crime dropped only 11 percent. Furthermore, the city acknowledged that the "rolling monthly average" method cited was not the most appropriate one to use when officials talk to the public about crime. Despite the city's mathematical errors, the fact remains that crime is down. But this doesn't erase the fact that the city got the violent crime statistic wrong. And it used the wrong type of data to begin with. We rate Reed's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Kasim Reed	None	None	None	2010-08-01T06:00:00	2010-07-09	['None']

pomt-07108	"When the union says I want to eliminate tenure, that’s not true."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/21/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-says-he-doesnt-want-eliminate-t/	In the ongoing war of words between Gov. Chris Christie and the New Jersey Education Association, the governor is accusing the teachers union of distorting his proposals for tenure. "So when the union says I want to eliminate tenure that’s not true," Christie said during a speech to students and professors at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. "Here’s what I want to do with tenure. Based on this evaluation system I want to say after three years where you are judged either effective or highly effective you get tenure and then for every year thereafter where you are rated effective or highly effective you keep tenure and keep all the job protections that go along with tenure. But if you have two years in a row of partially effective or one year of ineffective you lose your tenure rights." Once a teacher loses tenure, Christie said, he or she could earn it again with "three consecutive years of being rated effective or highly effective." For this Truth-O-Meter item, we're assessing Christie's claim that his proposal does not abolish tenure. We found it hinges on how the word is defined. We need to begin by pointing out the governor's contradiction on the issue. In his State of the State address in January, the governor said, "the time to eliminate teacher tenure is now." But now, Christie says he does not want to eliminate tenure -- he wants teachers evaluated annually to keep it. But can that still be called tenure? No, said the NJEA. Spokesman Steve Baker said Christie’s proposal "is not tenure" because that’s not how tenure is defined by state statute. But Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, which has been more supportive of Christie's proposal, had a more nuanced view. He called it "renewable tenure." A Christie spokesman declined to elaborate, but pointed us to a package of proposals that say they "fundamentally reform the state’s tenure system." The New Jersey statute that governs the requirements for tenure, 18A:28-5, states that after three consecutive years of employment with a school district, teachers "shall be under tenure during good behavior and efficiency and they shall not be dismissed or reduced in compensation except for inefficiency, incapacity, or conduct unbecoming such a teaching staff member or other just cause." So the law specifies that continued good behavior is necessary to keep tenure. Another statute states that when a school board reduces the number of teaching staff members, "dismissals … shall be made on the basis of seniority." We found that tenure means different things to different sources -- even dictionaries: Merriam-Webster: ". . . a status granted after a trial period to a teacher that gives protection from summary dismissal." Cambridge dictionary: " . . . the right to remain permanently in a job." Several other dictionaries say tenure is the holding of an office and a guarantee of permanent employment after a probationary period. The definition gets murkier when politics enter the fray. Christie pointedly defined tenure in his Harvard speech as "a job for life after three years and one day," a sarcastic line that suggests there is no process for dismissing teachers found to be incompetent. But Baker, the union spokesman, said, "Tenure is not a job for life. Never has been. Never intended to be ... Tenure is a fair dismissal process." PolitiFact New Jersey also contacted some professors for an independent take on whether Christie's plan can still be called tenure. The consensus was that Christie's plan dramatically changes the program, but that some aspects of tenure would remain in place. "Tenure is a status that one attains after a period of probation that grants someone the right to remain in that job given good performance and, of course, with due process," said Ada Beth Cutler, dean of the College of Education and Human Services at Montclair State University. "The tenure system as we know it now is going to be eliminated" if Christie’s proposals become law, she said. "But tenure isn’t going to be eliminated." Joseph DePierro, dean of Seton Hall’s College of Education and Human Services, called tenure "due process on steroids." He says the governor is "playing a funny game with tenure. It sort of eliminates it, but doesn’t quite eliminate it." Bruce Baker, an associate professor at the Rutgers Graduate School of Education and no relation to the NJEA’s Steve Baker, said tenure, as it exists, is "the assumption of ‘continuous contract’ given satisfactory performance of job duties." Whether or not Christie’s proposals change the definition of tenure, Bruce Baker wrote in an e-mail, "it certainly alters job security in significant ways, and does so with no counterbalancing proposal for significant increases in wages or other benefits." For Jeffrey Keefe, an associate professor at Rutgers University’s School of Management and Labor Relations and a research associate for the liberal Economic Policy Institute, the definition of tenure hinges on the "last in, first out" system, which would be eliminated under Christie's plan. "Once you take the seniority clause out, it falls out of my definition of tenure. It becomes pretty meaningless then," Keefe said. So to recap: There is no consensus. The dictionaries don’t agree. And Christie and the NJEA certainly aren’t on the same page. The only agreement is that Christie’s proposal eliminates tenure as it is now defined in New Jersey. Some said it's reasonable to call that a form of tenure, while others said the word doesn't apply any more. The governor said his plan doesn't eliminate tenure. But given that experts disagree about how to characterize his plan, we rate the governor’s statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-04512	Says Eric Cantor voted to assure Congress would be paid if the government shut down and against guaranteeing troops would be paid.	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2012/oct/04/wayne-powell/wayne-powell-says-eric-cantor-voted-protect-his-pa/	Wayne Powell, the Democratic challenger for the 7th Congressional District, portrayed incumbent Eric Cantor as serving his own interests during an Oct. 1 debate. Cantor, a Republican, is the majority leader of the House of Representatives. Powell held Cantor responsible for fueling a budget impasse with Democrats in April 2011 that came within a day of shutting down the government. Powell was emotional when his chance came to ask Cantor a prepared question. "This is for my son," he said. Powell’s son is an Army major who has served in Afghanistan. Then he turned to Cantor. "Last year when you and the president were in a budget standoff that threatened to shut down the federal government, you voted to continue paying members of Congress, including yourself, in the event of a shutdown," Powell told the majority leader. "At the same time, you voted against a bill which would have -- it would ensure -- that members of the armed services continue to get paid. "My question is this, Eric: How could you in good conscience vote to continue your own pay but, at the same vote to stop paying our servicemen and women that you voted to send into combat in Afghanistan?" We decided to check Powell’s facts, which Cantor said were wrong. Powell’s campaign backed the claim by pointing us to two procedural votes held during heated debates on spending. We’ll take a look at each. Military pay On April 7, 2011, President Barack Obama and Republican leaders were in tense budget negotiations one day before a government shutdown deadline. The GOP was demanding billions in spending cuts in return for passing an appropriations bill. Obama vowed to veto any legislation that contained what he said were harsh GOP demands for cuts in social programs and an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood. The Republican-led House sought to ease the pressure that day by proposing a one-week appropriations bill. The legislation would have funded the Department of Defense for a longer time -- through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Republicans called the measure a "troop funding bill." Democrats were not to be outdone. During floor debate, they said there was no guarantee Obama would sign the measure. Rep. Bill Owens, D-N.Y., offered an amendment that would ensure troops would continue to be paid if the government closed. Owens never explained how he expected to protect military pay by offering an amendment to a bill he said was likely to be vetoed. Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., denounced the motion as "purely a political gesture." Rogers said the GOP bill, which he sponsored, already provided "the essential funds for our men and women who are in harm’s way." Cantor voted against Owens’ motion, along with all but one Republican. But he was in the 247-181 majority, including 15 Democrats, who voted for the underlying bill. So did Cantor really vote against a bill that would have ensured troops get paid, as Powell said? No. Congressional pay On April 1, 2011, House Republicans passed a bill directing that its version of budget become law if the Senate did not act on it by April 6. This appeared to violate the U.S. Constitution, which says that both chambers must approve bills before they can become law. The measure included a provision that would deny pay to members of Congress and the president if a shutdown occurred. This was major public relations point because members of Congress get paid during a shutdown, while most other federal employees do not. Some Republicans pointed out that, under the constitution, congressional pay cannot be reduced in the middle of a term. To allay concerns, other Republicans suggested they could be paid retroactively when the shutdown ended, like the rest of the federal workforce. Democrats upped the stakes, seeking an amendment that would bar retro payments to Congress. Then they got a surprise. Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif., revealed an email he had received from Obama’s Department of Justice questioning the constitutionality of the Democrats’ motion. The amendment was defeated on a partisan 236-187 vote. Cantor and all but one Republican voted against it. Cantor then voted for the underlying bill, which included the problematic ban on paying Congress during a shutdown. It passed the House but died in the Senate. Both measures -- as dubious as they were -- were attempts to erase the pay protection for congress members in the event of a government shutdown. So to say Cantor was out to protect his paycheck is a big stretch. A final note The Democratic amendments at issue were "motions to recommit," a prerogative of the minority party since the 1st Congress. They are motions, often procedural, to send a bill back to a committee just before a floor vote on passage of the legislation is held. Both parties, when in the minority, have these motions to "make political statements and try to embarrass the majority for partisan advantage," according to David Wolfensberger, an expert on parliamentary rules and former Republican staffer on the House Rules Committee. Our ruling Powell said that Cantor, during the threat of a government shutdown last year, voted to ensure Congress would continue to be paid and against offering the same protection to members of the military. But Powell got it backwards. Cantor, during a period of high political gamesmanship, supported Republican legislation that, in the event of shutdown, would have continued military pay and withheld paychecks for Congress members. He simply opposed two procedural efforts by Democrats that would have given them some bragging rights. Powell’s charge was not off-the-cuff. It came during a portion of a debate when he got to ask Cantor a direct question. Powell, in comments leading up to his query, said he’d given plenty of thought to what he’d ask. That suggests he had time to check all the facts. Powell should take heat for ridiculously distorting Cantor’s votes. So we give his statement our lowest rating -- Pants on Fire.

pomt-14161	"Research even shows that sending more girls to school can boost an entire country’s GDP."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/apr/29/michelle-obama/michelle-obama-research-shows-educating-girls-can-/	Among the causes First Lady Michelle Obama has championed during her time in the White House is improving the lot of girls and women worldwide. About a year ago, Obama helped kick off Let Girls Learn, an interagency effort focused on educating adolescent girls. "Studies from the World Bank show that one extra year of secondary school can increase a girl's future income by 15 to 25 percent," Obama said in an interview with a U.S. Agency for International Development publication. "And we know that when girls are educated, they are less likely to contract HIV, more likely to delay childbearing and vaccinate their children, and have lower maternal and infant mortality rates. Research even shows that sending more girls to school can boost an entire country’s GDP." We’ve seen that claim about educating girls and a rising GDP before. Is it true? Largely, yes. Research does show that a higher percentage of girls in school correlates with a higher gross domestic product. But those findings are much more limited than many people understand. Behind all the research, there’s uncertainty about whether a stronger economy leads to more girls in school, or if more girls in school leads to a stronger economy. No single rule applies everywhere. A stronger economy, for instance, provides both the resources and incentives to educate more women, who go to school, earn more and boost the economy a little higher. But it doesn’t always work that way. In the Middle East and North Africa, more women might be educated but for social and religious reasons, they can’t work, or must work in jobs that don’t fully reward their level of education. And the biggest sticking point is that what’s been called the "girl effect" seems to be much stronger in middle-income countries. For poorer nations, the effect is more muted. A few key studies and cautions The White House press office backed up the First Lady’s claim by citing policy reports that declared that educating girls and young women would boost a country’s economy. One from the World Bank said "By effectively educating more women -- that is, providing more women with a high-quality education -- more will enter the labor market, and the economy will show the favorable results." Those reports didn’t actually give the underlying research, so we’ll cover the highlights. • A 2009 article in the journal Feminist Economics compared regions of the world and measured gender gaps in both education and employment. That’s worth noting because, while the two generally go hand-in-hand, they are separate. You can educate girls, but if companies won’t hire them, a lot of the economic benefit is lost. This study’s bottom line was that between 1960 and 2000, East Asia’s growth rate was .9 percent higher than the region of the Middle East-North Africa. The difference was due to the higher fraction of girls in school in East Asia. • A 2011 World Bank study took 14 countries and teased out what would happen if every girl finished whatever level of school she was in -- either primary or secondary. Not surprisingly, the economic impact depended hugely on a country’s starting point. India and China, for example, had very low rates of girls not completing school, while on the opposite end, places like Burundi and Senegal had dropout rates over 80 percent. So the study found that getting girls and young women to complete a given level of schooling added a "barely noticeable" amount in India and China, while in the other countries, researchers predicted a hefty rise. One important contribution of this research is it factored in the diminishing returns of educating more women. When more people hit the job market, it tends to drive wages down. There’s still a net gain, but in this study, earnings could be about 20 percent less than you might expect. Tuck that point away and keep it in mind for the next landmark analysis on our list. It provided advocacy groups with a talking point that has gone viral. • In a 1999 World Bank paper Gender inequality, income and growth: Are good times good for women?, economists David Dollar and Roberta Gatti worked with data on 100 nations. The finding that gained the most traction was that "in the countries with higher initial education, an increase of 1 percentage point in the share of adult women with secondary school education implies an increase in per capita income growth of 0.3 percentage points." That might seem like a simple equation, but it actually makes two points that are often overlooked. The economic growth took place only in middle-income countries that already had a higher rate of educating women. "For the poorer half of the observations, there is no relationship between female attainment and income," the authors wrote. The other generally ignored element is that the 1 percent increase in educated women applies to completing secondary education. Simply putting more girls in classrooms at any grade level wouldn’t necessarily deliver the same results. You have to get the girls all the way through high school. Specifics are important when measuring education gains Here’s where many organizations, including USAID, get into trouble. They say -- right now on their website -- that "if 10 percent more girls attend school, a country’s GDP increases by an average of 3 percent." That statement has three flaws. First, it treats all nations the same, whether they are low income or middle income. Second, it treats all education the same, whether it’s primary or secondary. Perhaps most troubling is it scales up the original equation by a factor of 10. Dollar, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told us that doing that "is a bit risky." "You would expect diminishing returns," he said. Which takes us back to that 2011 World Bank study we tucked away. It predicted wages would be about 20 percent lower than you would expect. Less money in women’s pockets means less economic activity, and less economic growth. Our ruling Michelle Obama said that research shows that sending girls to school can boost a country’s entire economy. That’s a fairly broad statement and broadly speaking, it’s accurate. Research from economists at the World Bank and elsewhere suggest that it’s possible that educating more girls produces a stronger economy. But researchers can’t say whether it’s the education of girls that leads to growth, or the growth that leads to more education of women. Plus, women can hit roadblocks in the job market even if they are educated. The research shows that, too. Obama’s statement is accurate but it needs additional information.

pomt-09370	"The average student will be spending $1,700 to $1,800 more during the life of their loan because of this surcharge."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/30/lindsey-graham/new-bill-doesnt-alter-interest-rate/	Oddly enough, student loans have become part of the health care debate. Tucked into the package of health care "fixes" passed by Congress is a provision that would eliminate government subsidies to private lenders and expand federal lending to students. Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, aren't keen on the development. He says the government is effectively taking over the student loan process and that students will actually end up paying more for their loans as a result. "The average student will be spending $1,700 to $1,800 more during the life of their loan because of this surcharge," Graham said on the March 24, 2010, episode of On the Record with Greta Van Susteren. "From the students' point of view, it's going to cost you $1,700 to $1,800 more to pay your student loan off, and all the money goes to the federal government." Graham's statement deserves a little background on how students have been getting loans to pay for their education. At some schools, students go directly to the U.S. Department of Education for their loan. But at others, students go through a private lender to get the same assistance. For nearly 45 years, the government has been paying private lending services to administer loans granted through the Federal Family Education Loan program. But the package of fixes, which President Barack Obama has signed, eliminates those payments and expands direct federal lending to students through the Department of Education. According to the House Education and Labor Committee, the effort will save $61 billion over 10 years, with a good chunk of that savings being used to expand current federal student lending programs, including Pell Grants. Approximately $9 billion will be used to offset some of the health care bill's cost. Graham's reasoning has to do with interest rates. In the same interview, he said that the Education Department borrows money for the loans from the Treasury Department at an interest rate of 2.6 percent. But students will then have to pay 6.4 percent in interest on those loans. In fact, Graham is slightly off here; the government borrows money at a rate of 2.8 percent while students pay interest at a rate of 6.8 percent on unsubsidized government loans. (Subsidized loans have a lower interest rate.) Furthermore, the interest rate the Education Department pays on money it borrows from the Treasury varies, and can be larger in the long run. But regardless, Graham's underlying point is this: As a result of the health care bill, the government will be making more of a profit off the interest students pay on student loans than it did before. We called and e-mailed Graham's office repeatedly for sourcing on his claim, but our inquiries were unanswered. Apparently Graham's numbers come from an amendment offered by Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander during the Senate's debate over a package of fixes. His amendment would have forced the chamber to send the bill back to committee and amend it to reduce interest rates on student loans by 1.5 percent, from 6.8 percent to 5.3 percent. That interest rate reduction would have saved students in Tennessee upwards of $1,700 to $1,800 in interest over 10 years, according to Alexander. But those numbers were specific to Tennessee, and Alexander was making the point that lowering the interest rate on student loans could save students money in the long run. But beyond those two points, we take issue with the fact that Graham leaves out the important detail that the new bill does not change the interest rate students pay on their loans, according to the education policy experts we spoke with. "This bill does not change interest rates in any way shape or form," said Jason Delisle, director of the Federal Education Budget Project for the Education Policy Program for the New America Foundation. "They are already in law and they're going to stay that way." So to say that students are somehow paying $1,700 or $1,800 more is wrong. Before Congress voted to eliminate subsidies for the Federal Family Education Loan, students paid 6.8 percent on their unsubsidized federal loans. Now that the bill is passed, students will still pay 6.8 percent interest on those loans. There is no "surcharge" in the bill, as Graham says. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07934	Says required state septic inspections would cost septic tank owners $100 to $150 every five years.	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/jan/27/dennis-jones/florida-septic-tank-inspections/	Members of the state Legislature who resoundingly voted in 2010 to require people to have their septic tanks inspected once every five years now say the new law -- sorry for the pun -- stinks. The idea, to help prevent sewage from leaking out of septic tanks and into the state groundwater system, isn't the problem, they say. It's the cost to septic tank owners that worries legislators. They agreed in November to push back the implementation of the bill from Jan. 1, 2011, until July 1, 2011, to delay any fiscal impact on septic tank owners. And now, the entire proposal appears to be -- okay, last pun -- circling the drain. A Senate committee debated reversing many of the requirements on Jan. 26, 2011, less than a year after the initial legislation passed. State Sen. Charlie Dean, R-Inverness, who voted for the inspection requirement but is now leading a fight to have it removed or replaced, said the law has been met with almost "unanimous disapproval," and that many septic tank owners are not in areas where they would affect water quality, anyway. Sen. Nancy Detert, R-Venice, another 'Yes' vote in 2010, said the requirement is unnecessary. If someone's septic tank breaks, they'll have it fixed, she said. "The previous incarnation of this legislation started out to protect the springs," Detert said. "It became a huge overreach and overrun." But Sen. Dennis Jones, R-Treasure Island, said he saw merits in the law (which he voted for, too, by the way). The inspection will help keep sewage from entering the state water system. It will keep homeowners' septic tanks in better shape. And it can serve a public good. On top of all that, Jones said, the cost is marginal. "I don't think it's that expensive to spend $100 to $150 every five years," he said. Does all this talk and concern really boil down to $30 a year? PolitiFact Florida decided to find out. Septic tanks largely unchecked The septic tank inspection requirement seemed to be controversial from the moment it was approved and signed into law on June 4, 2010, by then-Gov. Charlie Crist. According to the Department of Health, there are more than 2.6 million septic sewage systems in Florida serving about a third of the state's population. But less than 1 percent of the state's systems -- about 17,000 -- are being inspected and serviced by licensed maintenance professionals. In most cases, septic systems are only checked or serviced when they fail. And more than half of the state's septic systems are at least 30 years old. Leaky septic tanks have been identified by health and environmental officials as major sources of water pollution. So a group of legislators worked for several years to try to force inspections. The law that finally passed in 2010 attempted to mute concerns over cost. It requires inspections every five years (the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggests an inspection every three to five years), creates a grant program for low-income homeowners and allows certain homeowners to request a one-time, one-year inspection extension. "Pay a little bit now or all of us will pay a whole lot later," said former state Sen. Lee Constantine, R-Altamonte Springs, who was behind the 2010 law. But concerns over the cost to homeowners quickly escalated. The Legislature passed a measure to stall implementation of the law during a November special session, and then waited until Gov. Rick Scott took office to send the bill to the governor's office to prevent a possible veto from Crist. Scott allowed the delay to become law without his signature. "I applaud Governor Scott for allowing Senate Bill 2A to become law," Senate Majority Leader Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, who voted for the original 2010 law, said in a statement. "This decisive step postpones the implementation of septic tank inspection regulations, enabling lawmakers to analyze whether or not such a mandate is necessary and saving taxpayer dollars in the meantime." Interestingly, a state Senate analysis found that the inspection requirement would create hundreds "if not thousands" of private sector jobs because of a shortage of certified septic tank inspectors. The Department of Health estimated that annual septic tank inspections would grow from 17,000 a year to 500,000. The cost of an inspection All this leads to the main point of this fact check -- just how much would an inspection cost? Jones said the cost of the inspection is between $100 and $150, to be paid once every five years. But we found references to the inspection costing $500. And then other references to $200. In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Jones said he used information from the Department of Health for his estimate. But he believed the number might even be high. He said he spoke with people who believe that an influx of new private inspectors will naturally drive down costs because of increased competition. Michelle Dahnke, a health department spokeswoman, said private contractors would do the inspections. The department estimated an inspection would cost $150, she said, but that contractors ultimately would set the price and compete for business. We then asked two private-sector experts to talk about the cost of an inspection. Ellen Vause, president of Florida Septic Inc. in Hawthorne, said the cost of the inspection will depend on what the state actually requires and where the septic tank is located. Vause said that a standard inspection, which would include pumping out sewage from a septic tank system, costs $150 to $300 now in North Florida, and $200 to $350 in South Florida. The main difference, Vause said, is the cost to dispose of the sludge. But Vause said she would expect costs to drop if more inspections were required because contractors could do several inspections in the same neighborhood on the same day, saving on transportation and disposal costs. Bob Himschoot, a member of the Florida Onsite Wastewater Association and an owner of a septic tank contracting company in Fort Myers, pegged the cost slightly higher -- between $325 and $500. The cost includes the labor cost of a technician, who must be qualified to drive a commercial vacuum truck, equipment cost and the cost to dispose of the waste. The cost of the inspection is only one part of the problem, though. The worry is that the inspector finds something wrong. It's like going to the car mechanic for an oil change. You find out your brakes need fixing. Your wheels are out of alignment. Your tires are wearing thin. (And dollar signs dance through your head.) That's exactly the point of the 2010 law, of course, to identify problems to keep contaminants from seeping into the ground. The Department of Health, in draft rules, would require septic tank owners to repair tanks that are cracked and replace systems where sewage is flowing directly into the ground. Should your system need to replaced entirely -- systems generally last between 20 and 30 years -- that will cost $5,000 to $7,500 on average. "It's just another thing for the government to get mixed up with when they have no business sticking their nose in there," said Ralph Pohl, 77, who installed a septic tank 18 years ago at his home in Seacrest in the Panhandle and hasn't had it inspected once. Pohl reports no problems with his system. "I have no problem with someone coming and taking a look if there's any seepage or things like that," he said. "To force an inspector to come out and dig out a perfectly operating septic tank -- I don't see the point. If they're working, there's no problem. If they're not working, the homeowner is going to have to do something." There's another obvious, but critical point to consider when talking about the cost of a septic tank inspection. People using septic tanks don't pay for a central sewer system. People without septic tanks do. We did some math for three areas -- St. Petersburg in Pinellas County, Lakeland in Polk County, and the residents of Marion County -- and found that the typical sewer system customer will pay $375-$400 a year for sewer service in those three areas. Septic tank users would pay nothing. Over five years, that's $1,875-$2,000 in sewer charges versus nothing. "It's really a very inexpensive method compared to a central sewer system," Himschoot said. Our ruling In talking about making changes to a law requiring septic tank inspections once every five years, Sens. Dean and Detert didn't question the need to have properly functioning septic tanks but argued that the inspection itself was unnecessary for many people. Jones countered that the cost of the inspection alone isn't that great, especially when spread out over five years. Jones said an inspection would cost $100 to $150, citing a Department of Health estimate. Spread over five years, that's an investment of as little as $30 a year -- much less than homeowners with a central sewer system pay. But that's not telling the entire story. Experts we talked to said the price of an inspection could cost up to $500 and depends on a number of variables. On top of that, the inspection could result in finding problems that could require repairs at additional cost. That's obviously part of the intent of the bill, but it comes at a cost nevertheless. We think that's enough of difference to rate this claim Half True.	None	Dennis Jones	None	None	None	2011-01-27T17:13:52	2011-01-26	['None']
pomt-05469	Ron Oakley's "conservative leadership protected local taxpayers over government bureaucrats" as the Water Management District’s budget decreased by "58 percent in the four years he served on the board."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/apr/22/ron-oakley/ron-oakley-conservative-leadership-water-managemen/	Ron Oakley acknowledges that in election years, a lot of candidates talk like conservatives. But if you believe a recent mailer from his campaign, he is a proven conservative with a record of reining in government. Need proof? Oakley, a Republican candidate for Pasco County commission, offers his time on the governing board of the Southwest Florida Water Management District. His mailer makes a pair of specific claims about his experience with the agency’s budget. It helps to quote at length: "Ron Oakley was a consistent voice and vote for lower taxes. Applying the principles he learned while leading his family businesses, Oakley voted to cut the District’s millage rate by 43 percent — from .687 to .392 mils." The mailer continues: "Ron Oakley voted to reduce the Water Management District’s budget by 58 percent in the four years he served on the board. His conservative leadership protected local taxpayers over government bureaucrats." There’s no doubt the agency’s spending has plummeted. Here, we are checking whether Oakley’s leadership resulted in those cuts. Can he take credit for cuts ordered by state officials? Oakley, an east Pasco citrus grower, joined the 13-member water district board in June 2007. The first budget he voted on was for Fiscal Year 2008. As a baseline for his claims, he used the previous budget, FY 2007, that was in place when he took office. Informally known as Swiftmud, the agency covers portions of 16 counties and at the time had eight water basins with different tax rates. For example, folks in Trinity or Pinellas County paid a total tax rate of 0.822 that year, or 82 cents in taxes for every $1,000 of assessed value. The tax rate for owners in Bradenton or Sarasota was only 0.582. Oakley, 66, used his hometown Withlacoochee River basin, covering northeast Pasco and parts of five other counties to the north. (That’s also the district for his opponent, incumbent Commissioner Ted Schrader.) That basin’s total tax rate was 0.687 that year, about average for the eight basins. The first budget Oakley voted on included a 0.617 tax rate for property owners in the Withlacoochee basin. That reduction was ordered by property tax legislation signed by Gov. Charlie Crist in June 2007. The rate was left unchanged for the next two years. In fall 2010, the board adopted a rate of 0.608. Then the world changed. Gov. Rick Scott was elected November 2010. His initial budget proposal — released in February 2011 — called for a 25 percent cut to Swiftmud’s property taxes. Then lawmakers sharpened their knives and ordered a 36 percent cut for Swiftmud, the largest cut of Florida’s five water districts. Scott signed the legislation requiring that cut. To shrink the budget that much, board members eliminated the basin districts, and their tax rates — more on that later. They later set a property tax rate of 0.392. Bottom-line budget figures tell a similar story. When Oakley took office, Swiftmud’s budget was $383 million. Oakley and other board members adopted a slightly larger budget the next year, $395 million. Even with a tax rate cut, the budget grew from higher property values and increased state money. The next three budgets were: $376.5 million (FY 2009); $298.9 million (FY 2010); and $279.8 (FY 2011). Thank plunging property values and reduced state spending for those cuts. Then Scott took office, ordered more cuts, and the budget plummeted to $155 million. That figure is 59.4 percent smaller than Oakley’s baseline budget. Darn close to his 58 percent claim. Oakley’s last meeting was May 24, 2011. He said he should get credit for that year’s budget cuts because he cast votes on preliminary versions of the budget. As with many local governments, key budget decisions are made early in the year. Details get ironed out closer to final passage in the fall. The governing board eliminated the basins during that May meeting. The majority of the budget cut came from wiping out the basins, though there was $41 million in unspent basin money included in the spending plan. The district also lost nearly all of its state funding. Several board members lamented the move, saying the basins were a vital conduit to local citizens on water issues. But it was clear a larger power was at play. "I guess it’s sort of like an edict from Tallahassee," said board member Todd Pressman, the lone dissenting vote on the plan. Added board member Jeff Adams: "It’s not something that was suggested. It’s been mandated, and it’s been forced to us." Oakley said board members had options. They could have removed all the basins. They could have consolidated them into three larger districts. They could have sliced more money from the overall agency budget. "We chose the option we thought was best," he said. However they found the money, board members still had to meet the 36 percent reduction. "We’ve already committed to the tax reductions," Deputy Executive Director Kurt Fritsch said during a budget workshop later in the meeting. "We have met the governor’s promises. The governor promised a tax reduction. He’s getting it." During an interview last week, Oakley said the board was considering cuts before the governor and lawmakers made their proposals. That’s true. The board in January approved a staff report calling for a drop in the district’s base tax rate. The report also suggested looking for "further opportunities" to reduce the basin tax rates. "The Legislature was sending us a message they wanted us to cut more," he said. "I don’t know many people that want to fight the Legislature." Oakley’s claims of eye-popping cuts to Swiftmud’s tax rate and budget are largely correct. And we’ll give him partial credit for "voting on" the budget in 2011, even though he only voted on a preliminary version and not the final product. But the bottom line is most of those eye-popping cuts came as Oakley was leaving office, and they were specifically ordered by Scott and the Legislature. For most of Oakley’s four years at Swiftmud, the agency saw much more modest budget reductions, thanks largely to declining state money and falling property values. Oakley’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. In this case, Tallahassee politicians should get the lion’s share of the credit for the 2011 cuts. We rate Oakley’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-11681	"Trump vows to end winter heating assistance for elderly and disabled."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/03/democrats-rising/headline-misleads-about-trumps-budget-proposal-and/	President Donald Trump proposed eliminating a program to help millions of Americans heat or cool their homes, according to a viral story by a liberal website. "Trump vows to end winter heating assistance for elderly and disabled," stated the Nov. 26 headline by Democrats Rising, an anti-Trump website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that this story failed to tell the entire story: while Trump proposed getting rid of a heating assistance program several months ago, the federal government has continued to fund it. The Democrats Rising article, written as winter weather was setting in, misleads by stating that millions of households will be at risk of losing heat this winter. But that’s not what the facts show. Democrats Rising didn’t name the program, but it appears to be a reference to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a program started in 1981. The program provides federal dollars to help poor people pay their home energy bill, energy crises, weatherization and energy-related minor home repairs. On average, the annual heating/winter crisis assistance benefit per household was $371 in fiscal year 2015. In March, Trump’s budget blueprint called for cutting money for several programs that help low-income Americans including LIHEAP. The document said that LIHEAP "is a lower-impact program and is unable to demonstrate strong performance outcomes." The budget request for the Administration for Children and Families stated that utility companies and state and local governments provide significant heating and cooling assistance and that the majority of states prohibit utilities from discontinuing heat during the winter. Trump’s proposal faced pushback from senators, including many in cold weather states. A bipartisan group of a few dozen senators wrote a letter in September urging the federal government to release funds for LIHEAP as quickly as possible under the continuing resolution. U.S. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Jack Reed, D-R.I., led the bipartisan group to push for $3.39 billion, the same amount allocated in the previous fiscal year. On Sept. 8, Trump signed the continuing resolution to continue funding appropriations for a few months. That allowed the Department of Health and Human Services in October to release $3.03 billion for states, tribes and territories for the heating program for fiscal year 2018. That represents 90 percent of the funding available under the continuing appropriations act. We asked a spokeswoman for Health and Human Services when the remaining 10 percent will be provided. Trump’s proposed budget did not include funding for LIHEAP, Monique Richards said. Funding will be determined by the passage of appropriations legislation from Congress. In the past, the federal government has released 90 percent of the funding under a "seasonability exception," said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association. "Because LIHEAP spends so early in the fiscal year, if funding was delayed it would cause a hardship to low-income families," he said. A spokesman for Trump did not respond to our questions. Our ruling Democrats Rising said that "Trump vows to end winter heating assistance for elderly and disabled." There is a kernel of truth in that headline, because Trump’s budget blueprint in March proposed eliminating LIHEAP. But Democrats Rising omits the final outcome: amid pushback from a bipartisan group of senators, the heating assistance program continued. In October, the federal government released $3 billion for the program. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-01288	As a result of Obamacare, "California seniors face benefit cuts of over $1,700."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/31/american-crossroads/rove-pac-says-obamacare-cuts-1700-medicare-benefit/	Even though Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., wasn’t in office when Obamacare passed, a pro-Republican ad in California’s seventh congressional district is using the law to attack him. Bera is running against Republican Doug Ose for a second term, and it’s a tight race. Less than six months into his first term, Bera voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act, and American Crossroads, Karl Rove’s conservative political action committee, used this fact to appeal to California seniors in a recent ad. "Bera voted to keep Obamacare, which cut $716 billion from Medicare, slashing Medicare Advantage," the ad’s narrator says. "Now California seniors face benefit cuts of over $1,700." Many times, we’ve rated the claim that there are $716 billion in Medicare cuts as Half True. But we hadn’t heard claims about specific benefit cuts by state before, so we decided to check it out. We found that the claim that California seniors will see $1,700 in benefit cuts as a result of the Affordable Care Act is misleading. The statistic comes from a report that ignores critical context and evidence that the law has expanded Medicare’s benefits packages. Advantages We should first note that the statistic comes from an April 2014 report by the American Action Forum, and they have a stake in the election. The American Action Forum is an arm of the American Action Network, which is a conservative political nonprofit with financial ties to the Koch brothers. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the group shares office space with American Crossroads -- the group that produced the very ad we’re checking. Now to the claim. The ad makes it sound like all California seniors will face cuts to this degree. However, the report only addresses Medicare Advantage. About one-third of seniors use Medicare Advantage, which is a private coverage option. Medicare Advantage plans are required to provide at minimum the same array of benefits as traditional Medicare. Many Advantage plans offer extra benefits -- things like gym memberships, vision exams or generous cost-sharing -- that have contributed to escalating program costs. The creators of Medicare Advantage thought that letting seniors choose plans from private insurance providers would be more cost-effective than traditional Medicare. But Advantage has turned out to be more expensive. Medicare paid insurers about 114 percent more for Advantage plans than for traditional plans, as of 2009 before enactment of the federal health care law. The law attempted to close that gap in part by gradually reducing how much Medicare pays Advantage plan providers. It was estimated that its changes would slow down spending on Medicare by about $716 billion over 10 years, and Medicare Advantage cost-saving measures accounted for about one-third of that. (Though the Obama administration has reversed these cuts for the past two years -- facing pressure from insurance providers, Republicans and some Democrats, including Bera.) Critics argue that the cuts will force insurance providers to reduce the benefits they offer to Medicare Advantage enrollees. However, Medicare Advantage plans are still required to offer, at minimum, the same level of benefits as traditional plans. And Obamacare includes language protecting that set of guaranteed benefits from shrinking. In fact, the law expanded Medicare’s required benefits to include certain preventative services, annual visits, closing a gap in prescription coverage and more. Additionally, the law rewards Medicare Advantage providers with financial bonuses to encourage quality and cost-efficiency. Providers are required to use the bonuses to offer extra benefits, attracting more enrollees. Nearly all Medicare Advantage plan providers received these bonuses in 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. A matter of speculation It’s possible that Medicare Advantage providers could respond to their pay cut by reducing benefits, but the only benefits they could cut would be those extra benefits that go beyond Medicare plan requirements. "It's not automatic and won't affect every (Advantage) enrollee or any of the (traditional Medicare) enrollees," said Dylan Roby, an expert in health economics at the University of California Los Angeles Center for Health Policy Research. Insurance providers could also respond to lower payments by offering the same benefits while operating more efficiently. They could cut administrative costs, adjust cost-sharing plans, take in less profit or drop out of the market altogether. But, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Department of Health and Human Services and more, insurance providers’ response to the cuts has been less dramatic than was expected when Obama signed the legislation in 2010. In fact, Medicare Advantage enrollment is at an all-time high, and the percentage of plans with four or more stars in the program’s five-star rating system is increasing. "When Congress debated the payment reductions in 2010, forecasters and analysts also projected that reductions would drive insurers to raise premiums, cut extra benefits and even pull out of the Medicare Advantage market," Kaiser experts wrote in May. "Thus far, however, the response by insurers to the (Affordable Care Act) cuts has been more muted." Health and Human Services reported in fall 2013 that "The average number of plan choices will remain about the same in 2014 and access to supplemental benefits remains stable. Since passage of the Affordable Care Act, average MA premiums are down by 9.8 percent." Experts also told us that they haven’t seen evidence of reduced Medicare Advantage cuts. "The evidence is that plan participation has been stable, premiums have been stable or even a little bit lower, and there are no overall changes in the benefits provided," said Jack Hoadley, a research professor at Georgetown University and a member of the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. "In my view, the claims in this advertisement are misleading," Hoadley added. "Seniors have not faced benefit cuts in Medicare Advantage, even though the plans (and providers) have to manage with somewhat lower payments." So how did the American Action forum report come up with their estimated benefit cut figures? The American Action Forum report breaks down the reduction in Medicare payments to Advantage plan providers by state and county. It says, compared to pre-Obamacare, Medicare Advantage benefits in California are down $1,718 per beneficiary. We asked several experts to take a look at the report, and they told us that it is misleading because it assumes that Obamacare’s spending reductions directly results in reduced benefits. Yes, Obamacare reduces Medicare’s spending per Advantage beneficiary, but this does not necessarily mean fewer benefits for seniors with Advantage plans. Like we said before, there are multiple ways that an insurance provider can deal with the spending cuts other than slimming down its offerings. "To immediately treat it as a cut to benefits is an exaggeration," said Judith Feder, a professor of health policy at Georgetown University. Our ruling American Crossroads said that as a result of Obamacare, "California seniors face benefit cuts of over $1,700." First of all, this claim is misleading because it makes it seem like all seniors will face these cuts, when the statistic actually refers to Medicare Advantage enrollees -- only about one-third of seniors. The statistic comes from a report that assumes all reductions in Medicare Advantage spending results in fewer benefits for enrollees. While insurance providers feel the cuts, there are multiple ways for them to respond other than reducing benefits, such as trimming administrative costs. We heard from multiple experts and researchers who said Medicare Advantage benefits have remained stable. The ad also leaves out the fact that the federal health care law expanded Medicare’s minimum required benefits and established incentives for Advantage plans to provide extra benefits. It’s possible that some Medicare Advantage enrollees could see their benefits shrink, but this ad blows that possibility out of proportion and ignores important context. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02880	"They delayed my swearing-in here in Massachusetts for a couple weeks so they could ram (the health care law) through."	false	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/12/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-opponents-delayed-his-swearing-pa/	Former Massachusetts Republican U.S. Sen. Scott Brown took a stroll down memory lane Monday while talking about the health care law with Fox News’ Gretchen Carlson. Brown, who is now a Fox News contributor, claimed the architects of Obamacare delayed Brown’s swearing-in in 2010 to help "ram" the law through Congress. "They rammed it through before I got there, knowing I would be there in a week or two," Brown said on The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson. "They delayed my swearing-in here in Massachusetts for a couple weeks so they could ram it through and did not pass one amendment to make it better for the American people, and they should be held accountable." As Brown finished his point about his swearing-in, people watching could hear Carlson say, "I remember." But did she remember right? Brown was elected in a 2010 special election to finish the term of the late-Sen. Edward Kennedy. When Kennedy died on Aug. 25, 2009, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick appointed a Democrat, Paul Kirk, to hold his seat. State law requires a special election for federal seats to be held between 145 and 160 days of when the vacancy occurred -- or in the case of Kennedy’s seat somewhere between Jan. 17, 2010, and Feb. 1, 2010. Massachusetts’ election was Jan. 19, 2010, the first Tuesday in that window. Brown, who had campaigned on being the 41st vote against the health care legislation, defeated Democrat Martha Coakley by a vote of 52 percent to 47 percent. Brown’s victory did not mean he could just move to Capitol Hill and start casting votes the next day. Brown was sworn in Feb. 4, 2010, 16 days after his election. Was his swearing-in ceremony delayed? No. Cities and towns in Massachusetts have 15 days to send final results to the Massachusetts Secretary of State, including a 10-day window for counting absentee and overseas ballots. "It wasn’t delayed," said Brian McNiff, a spokesman for Secretary of State William Galvin. "This process had to be done." In fact, Brown was sworn in a week earlier than he had planned, according to media reports. After receiving criticism of his "three-week victory lap" from a newspaper columnist, he wrote state officials asking for his election results to be certified immediately. The results were certified by the governor’s council and sent to the U.S. Senate "as soon as the ink was dry," McNiff said. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill So if anything, Brown’s swearing-in actually came a week earlier than originally planned. But what about the Democrats in Washington? Did they scramble to pass health care reform before Brown took his seat? Again, no. Weeks before Brown’s election, the Senate had already passed its version of health care reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, on Dec. 24, 2009, on a 60-39 vote. (Kirk voted yes.) But the legislation needed to pass the House, and House Democratic leaders wanted to make changes that echoed their priorities. Problem was, any big changes to the Senate bill would send it back to the upper chamber for final approval, where the 39 Republicans and the newly elected Brown could now filibuster the bill. Top Democrats wondered what to do. One option widely reported before Brown’s election was to pass the health care law before Brown took his seat. But on Jan. 20, 2010, the day after Brown’s election, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nv., took that plan off the table. "We’re going to wait until the new senator arrives until we do anything more on health care," Reid said. In the end, the House passed the Senate bill on March 21, 2010. On that same day, the House passed a slew of their own measures in a separate bill, which the Senate passed March 25, 2010, through a filibuster-proof process known as reconciliation. One last point: Brown’s 16-day wait from election to swearing-in is in line with other recent Senate special elections. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker was elected after the death of Sen. Frank Lautenberg on Oct. 16, 2013, and sworn in 15 days later on Oct. 31, 2013. And Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey won the special election to replace John Kerry on June 25, 2013, and did not take the oath of office until July 16, 2013 -- 21 days later. Our ruling Brown said, "They delayed my swearing-in here in Massachusetts for a couple weeks so they could ram (the health care law) through." We never heard back from Brown, but the record is pretty clear on this. His swearing-in wasn’t delayed, and the Senate did not "ram" the health care law through in the time between his election and his taking the oath of office. We rate his claim False.

pomt-09753	Health care premiums for consumers have doubled since 2001.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/07/jay-rockefeller/rockefeller-says-health-insurance-premiums-have-do/	Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., recently wrote an opinion piece for the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call in which he said, "Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled." We address the first part of this statement in another item ; we'll take up the second half here. The 2009 Employer Health Benefits Survey, published by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust, is considered the definitive source for health benefits cost information, and its data stretch from 1999 to 2009. (Even though Rockefeller didn't explicitly say it, we'll assume he was talking about the period since 2001 when he made this assertion.) In 2001, average annual premiums for single people were $2,689, a number that rose to $4,824 by 2008 — a 79 percent increase. The amounts for family coverage rose over the same period from $7,061 to $13,375 — an 89 percent increase. So, in neither case did the cost of benefits actually double, although they are in the ballpark. However, if you read Rockefeller's language closely, he did say, "premiums for consumers have doubled" — and if you use the data for the employee-paid portion of health benefits by itself, he's right. For individuals, the employee cost rose from $355 to $779 and for families it rose from $1,787 to $3,515. The former jump is easily double, while the latter is just shy of double. Using this calculation, Rockefeller is right. We rate his assertion True.	None	Jay Rockefeller	None	None	None	2009-10-07T16:47:53	2009-09-21	['None']
pomt-14394	Says President Barack Obama has "been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/16/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-pins-too-much-blame-outflow-jobs-barack-o/	One of the biggest topics in the 2016 presidential election has been how to reverse the loss of American jobs to other countries. On NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz blamed President Barack Obama for the outflow of jobs. The topic came up after host Chuck Todd played a clip of Obama saying the Republicans are significantly to blame for the angry tone of politics today. Cruz responded, "You know, Chuck, Barack Obama's a world-class demagogue. That language there is designed to divide us. No, Mr. President, we're not angry at that. We're angry at politicians in Washington, including you, who ignore the men and women who elected you, who have been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years." The part of Cruz’s comment that caught our eye was that Obama has "been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years." We decided to take a look. (Cruz’s staff did not respond to inquiries.) We found that Cruz has a point that the United States has seen jobs go overseas during the seven years that Obama has been in office. However, this pattern was well under way before Obama became president -- and the trend has little to do with policy choices a president can make. We will start by noting that there are two related but distinct reasons why jobs may move overseas. One is when foreign companies become competitive enough to sell their products in the United States, displacing American producers. The other occurs when American companies move their own production to subcontractors overseas. We will also note that there is no single data source that provides specific numbers of jobs flowing overseas. We did find a couple of studies that touched on this subject; however, each has drawbacks. One source of data is the National Organizations Survey, a pilot study of U.S. businesses and nonprofits described in a paper by Clair Brown of the University of California-Berkeley, Timothy Sturgeon of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Connor Cole of the University of Michigan. The survey was conducted in 2010, meaning that it captured a snapshot in time, rather than a study of changes over time. The survey found that about 23 percent of full-time employees worked at organizations that do international outsourcing, meaning that they either had such duties as sales, research, transportation and customer service handled by a part of the company based in another country, or by contracting with an overseas company to handle those tasks. According to the study, about a third of full-time employees with large organizations worked for one doing international outsourcing; for smaller organizations, the rate was smaller, less than 10 percent. Sectors where international offshoring has been especially noticeable include electronics and motor vehicles. That said, "for the typical U.S. employee’s organization, the majority of costs continue to be in the United States," the authors concluded. The other study does show changes over time, though it’s worth noting that it was published by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning group that has taken a hard line against the flow of American jobs overseas. The Economic Policy Institute study found that between 2001 and 2013, a growing U.S. trade deficit with China "eliminated or displaced 3.2 million U.S. jobs," of which 2.4 million were in manufacturing. "These lost manufacturing jobs account for about two-thirds of all U.S. manufacturing jobs lost or displaced between December 2001 and December 2013," the paper concluded. Here’s a summary of their findings: Experts we contacted agreed that a significant shift has been going on. "The U.S. economy and many others have been going through wrenching changes for many decades, due to a combination of technological change, globalization, and loss of union power," said Sturgeon, a senior researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Industrial Performance Center. Sturgeon pointed to research by Margaret McMillan at Tufts University that looked at data between 1990 and 2005 and found that a key reason for these trends is "rapid increases in trade" between the United States and China. In a paper, McMillan and three co-authors found that Chinese employment growth has been largest in U.S. industries that have experienced employment declines, suggesting that Chinese workers are being substituted for U.S. workers. She also found that the share of workers performing "routine occupations" in the United States declined as the share increased in China, with these shifts correlated across industries." But while Cruz has a point that jobs have indeed been shifting overseas under Obama, the previous chart shows a distinct problem with Cruz’s contention: The way Cruz phrased it, it sounds like it started under Obama, and that simply isn’t the case. "Most of the advanced economies of the world have long moved into a new, postindustrial phase of development," wrote Dani Rodrik of Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government in a November 2015 paper. "These economies have been deindustrializing for decades, a trend that is particularly noticeable when one looks at the employment share of manufacturing. … In the United States, manufacturing industries’ share of total employment has steadily fallen since the 1950s, coming down from around a quarter of the workforce to less than a tenth today." (We looked at this question previously here.) Indeed, in February 2003, the cover of a special issue of BusinessWeek magazine asked, "Is Your Job Next? A new round of globalization is sending upscale jobs offshore. They include chip design, engineering, basic research -- even financial analysis. Can America lose these jobs and still prosper?" That was about six years before Obama took office. In fact, when PolitiFact asked McMillan whether this pattern predates Obama, she emailed back, "Hell yes," followed by 12 exclamation points. In her paper, McMillan wrote that employment declined modestly in the 1990s in such labor-intensive industries as textiles and became "precipitous" with the advent of the Internet in the late 1990s. She finds that both technological advancements and a growing role for an overseas labor force played a role. The ability to conduct work overseas "has led to fundamental reorganization of the global supply chain, with detrimental effects on domestic manufacturing workers and surging corporate profits," she wrote. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment between 1987 and 2015 -- starting 22 years before Obama took office -- can be seen in the following graph: So jobs have clearly been moving overseas for many years, even if the trend predated Obama and occurred for reasons other than his policies. Still, it’s worth making a few additional observations: • Manufacturing jobs have been increasing under Obama. While the rise in manufacturing jobs under Obama hasn’t come close to wiping out the declines of previous decades, the number has risen rather than fallen since 2010 -- the first sustained increase since at least the 1990s. There is at least anecdotal evidence of "onshoring" -- the return of jobs to the United States. For instance, 177 "foreign-trade zones" -- special manufacturing and assembly facilities located in the United States -- serve more than 3,000 companies, employ 390,000 workers and handled $835 billion in merchandise, almost two-thirds of it domestically sourced, according to the National Association of Foreign-Trade Zones. • Along with job losses, there have been job gains. Overall, productivity has been improving in the United States. "Specific industries and job categories have been hard hit, sometimes very much so," Sturgeon said. At the same time, many are benefiting, including "in ways they may not even notice, such as new types of work and jobs, greater product variety and lower prices." Sturgeon is among those who argue that Cruz’s answer is too simplistic. "The debate right now is playing to people’s fears and discontent in ways that are nearly devoid of fact or serious consideration of the trade-offs or remedies," he said. Where it comes to Obama’s role, he said, "this is a broad structural issue and not something Obama invented or could do much to change, or even do much to mitigate with an uncooperative Congress." Our ruling Cruz said that Obama has "been presiding over our jobs going overseas for seven years." While the pattern has been occurring under Obama, it is hardly new or unique to Obama.

pomt-07788	"Our children do not spend any time in school learning about our own U.S. Constitution."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/feb/21/dan-flynn/state-rep-dan-flynn-says-texas-students-spend-no-t/	In a recent column criticizing the Mansfield school district’s plans to introduce an Arabic program to its schools, state Rep. Dan Flynn, R-Canton, wondered why Arabic culture is a priority "at a time when our children do not spend any time in school learning our own U.S. Constitution." We wondered whether Texas students spend no time studying the Constitution, as Flynn says in the opinion piece published Feb. 14 on the North Texas Navigator news website. When we contacted the representative’s office, Flynn’s chief of staff, David Erinakes told us "there is no dedicated class on the U.S. Constitution as early as first grade, and (Flynn’s) implication is that he believes all Texas school children should have a class on the U.S. Constitution while they’re in school at least one time." Erinakes said that while the Constitution is written into the state’s curriculum standards for the public schools, "there isn’t very much time spent on it." Erinakes said Flynn based this conclusion on conversations with teachers who have recently visited the representative’s office. We turned next to the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for social studies, curriculum standards outlining what students must be taught in Texas classrooms. In an online post of the standards now in place — an update takes effect in 2011-12 — we spotted about 35 references to teaching students about the constitution. According to the standards, students are introduced to the U.S. Constitution in fifth grade when they must identify "the important ideas in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution" and "examine fundamental rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights." Seventh graders should be able to "explain the influence of the U.S. Constitution on the Texas Constitution." Eighth graders are supposed to study "the creation and ratification of the U.S. Constitution." History and government comes under the heading of social studies until high school, when specific courses in those subjects are offered. In a course in U.S. history since the Reconstruction, students are expected to "identify and analyze methods on expanding the right to participate in the Democratic process, including... amendments to the U.S. Constitution." A "significant focus" of the state’s mandatory high school U.S. government class is on "the U.S. Constitution, its underlying principles and ideas and the form of government it created." Next we looked at online versions of the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills tests annually administered to students from grades 3 to 11. Fifth- and eighth-graders must pass the reading and math tests, and 11th-grade students must pass all portions of test, which include social studies, to graduate. Searching for "constitution" in the social-studies portion of the 2009 test for eighth-graders, we found four references, including one question asking students to identify how the 13th Amendment changed the Constitution (B. Abolished slavery). We found five references to the Constitution in the tenth-grade test, including a question about what principle the Constitution’s establishment of the executive, legislative and judicial branches reflects. And in 11th grade? Two references to the U.S. Constitution. Debbie Ratcliffe, an education agency spokeswoman, told us that local educators determine how much time is spent on the Constitution, but she pointed out that each grade is required to observe Celebrate Freedom Week, which falls on the week of Constitution Day — Sept. 17. The standards going into effect in 2011-12 reflect the observance. According to the pending standards, third through eighth grade classes, for example, must include "appropriate instruction concerning the intent, meaning and importance of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution" during Celebrate Freedom Week, or during another full school week as determined by each school district’s board of trustees. Andy Welch, a spokesman for the Austin school district, told us that Austin teachers teach what the state standards require. Richie Escovedo, a Mansfield district spokesman, told us: "We definitely do teach the Constitution." He pointed us to the district’s curriculum specifying that students study the Constitution in fifth, seventh and 12th grade. Also, Escovedo noted, district third-graders study questions such as, "Why was a new Constitution needed after the American Revolution?" and "How does the Bill of Rights protect you, even as a child?" When we told Flynn that we couldn’t find evidence to support his claim, Erinakes responded: "You are correct that it is in the standards, but as to the time spent it seems to be minimal at best... Relative to the amount of time spent on other subjects, ‘our children do not spend any time at all learning about the U.S. Constitution.’" Flynn’s statement, though, was absolute. Lacking back-up information from his end or any other evidence that either schools are flouting the state’s curriculum standards or students aren’t being held to them, the statement more than fails.

pomt-11833	"CPS students are learning and growing faster than 96 percent of students in the United States."	mostly true	/illinois/statements/2017/nov/10/chicago-public-schools/cps-students-are-learning-and-growing-faster-96-pe/	A Nov. 2 press release from Chicago Public Schools touted significant test score gains made in the district over recent years that were included in a high-profile analysis. Students in CPS, according to research from an expert on education equality at Stanford University, improved at a faster rate on standardized test scores between third and eighth grade than their counterparts in most other U.S. school districts. The findings were clearly a plus for the often-maligned CPS, and the district wasted little time advertising them in a press release headlined, "CPS students are learning and growing faster than 96 percent of students in the United States." The glow of that phrasing suggests that CPS has not just turned a corner when it comes to educational achievement but is dancing circles around most other school districts in the nation. Reconciling that with the district’s problem-plagued reputation merits a closer look. Measuring up CPS’ fast-paced gains were assessed in a report prepared recently by Sean Reardon, a professor of education inequality at Stanford’s Center for Education Policy Analysis. By comparing Chicago Public Schools students’ scores on standardized tests to those of students nationally, Reardon found that the scores of CPS students in grades three through eight improved more from 2009-14 than did the average scores of all U.S. students during that time. Reardon used scores from a standardized test all Illinois students are required to take to measure that growth. But because other states rely on different tests to gauge the same thing, he averaged actual scores in math and English across the nation to benchmark proficiency. "We define grade level as the average of that grade in the country," Reardon said in a phone interview. "The proficiency levels that states set for their tests are defined by groups of experts that say, 'This is what we think a kid should know in this grade.’ " By Reardon’s metric, CPS third-graders taking the test in 2014 performed significantly better than did third-graders who sat for it in 2009. The same held true for the other grades covered by the analysis as well. This improvement factored out to about two-thirds of a grade level over the five-year period for CPS, compared to an average increase for the rest of the nation of just one-sixth of a grade level in performance within that timeframe. So far, so good. But Reardon’s report posed another key question: Improvement aside, how does CPS’ overall academic performance stack up against the rest of the country? Here, the picture was not as rosy. Third- through eighth-graders in the nation’s third-largest district still perform at roughly one half to one-and-a-half grade levels below the national average, which the report describes as a "significant concern." In short, CPS test scores started low, improved significantly, but remain subpar. There’s no reference to that gut check in the CPS press release highlighting Reardon’s work, though the release does provide a link to the full report for those so inclined to read it. Indeed, results from the state’s most recent round of standardized tests point to significant problems at CPS, where only 22 to 30 percent of third- through eighth-graders reached proficiency in core subjects, according to data from the Illinois State Board of Education. A CPS spokesman declined to address questions about the district’s characterization of Reardon’s report. Our ruling Chicago Public Schools stated that "CPS students are learning and growing faster than 96 percent of students in the United States." The claim appears to accurately represent the main conclusion of the Stanford University report from which it was drawn. At the same time, the CPS press release touting the study’s findings omits mention of other information contained in the report that provides more context. Test scores among CPS’ third- through eighth-graders are indeed growing faster on average than the average growth rate in 96 percent of districts nationwide, according to the Stanford study. But the report also found that students in the district, which remains beset by large achievement gaps between students of different racial and socioeconomic groups, still generally perform between one-half and one-and-a-half grade levels below the national average. CPS’ claim is accurate as far as it goes, but ignores the significant gap in achievement its students still must overcome. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-13006	Says U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi said, "Employers cutting hours is a good thing. It then gives that person time to pursue their dreams and passions."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/12/turning-point-usa/facebook-image-revives-made-claim-nancy-pelosi-pra/	Just days after winning another term as House Democratic leader, U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California was the target of a viral image that deliberately — and falsely — made it appear she said losing work shifts was a good thing for Americans. Conservative group Turning Point USA attacked Pelosi in a Dec. 8, 2016, Facebook post that showed her face next to a quote that read, "Employers cutting hours is a good thing. It then gives that person time to pursue their dreams and passions." No context is given for when or why Pelosi may have said that, and we can’t find any evidence she ever did. But the post was shared widely on social media nonetheless, including a popular thread on Reddit. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It appears that the image is a misquote from a Sept. 22, 2013, State of the Union interview Pelosi gave to Candy Crowley on CNN. Not only did Pelosi not use the words being attributed to her, but the entire context of the conversation is lost. Crowley was asking Pelosi whether she had any reservations about the federal insurance exchange that was about to open for customers for the first time. HealthCare.gov was slated to debut Oct. 1, 2013. Some people worried that employers would limit shifts for many hourly workers in order to meet the Affordable Care Act requirement that employees who worked more than 30 hours had to have insurance coverage. (For the record, there’s a bit of evidence that some companies did cut hours after the advent of Obamacare, but it’s difficult to pinpoint why.) Here’s the transcript of that portion of the interview, with video posted here: CROWLEY: "Let me ask you then about Obamacare, itself. Coming up for a big date on Obamacare, October 1, when people can begin to sign up through the marketplaces. Do you have any reservations at all? Are you worried at all? And I ask you this because you know union leaders, I mean, James Hoffa is one of those who wrote a letter to you and said Obamacare as it now stands would, quote, ‘destroy the foundation of the 40-hour work week.’ That's pretty tough from a loyal Democratic constituency." PELOSI: "Well, we're working on the issue that relates to all of these multiemployer plans, which unions are one and some are charities." CROWLEY: "Bargaining rights or otherwise risks. There's more than one employer involved in a contract." PELOSI: "More than one employer involved in a contract. And that has to be certainly clarified. There's just so much the president can do within the law. But there is some leeway to facilitate as we are in the Congress under the exchanges. So, I'm optimistic, because, we will find a path. But overwhelmingly for the American people, this is a liberation. This is life, healthy life, liberty, the freedom to pursue your happiness, which could be, follow your passion for good rather than follow your palate and be constrained by your policy. It's about wellness. It's about prevention, it's about a healthier America." So there was a discussion about employers potentially cutting hours, but at no time did Pelosi call that a good thing. What she did say was that the launch of HealthCare.gov was a good thing for Americans, because they would no longer have to stay in a certain job just to keep their insurance coverage. It’s a talking point Pelosi had used before, and was attacked over before. It also was misrepresented the same way in 2013. Pelosi spokeswoman Caroline Behringer confirmed that the House minority leader did not say the words attributed to her. "It is something we saw spread on the internet, but has no basis in reality," Behringer said. Our ruling A viral image quoted Pelosi as saying, "Employers cutting hours is a good thing. It then gives that person time to pursue their dreams and passions." This attack first came up in 2013, right before the federal insurance exchange opened. It looks to be a misquote based on a CNN interview, in which Pelosi was asked about employers potentially cutting workers’ hours to avoid having to buy them health insurance. Pelosi responded that Obamacare still "liberated" Americans, because workers had an option for affordable insurance beyond having to stay with an employer for the coverage. Those people would then be free to find a job they liked better and still be covered, she said. The image not only puts words in her mouth, it deliberately twists the meaning of what she really said.

pomt-05675	Says "over 1 million signatures" were submitted in attempt to recall Gov. Scott Walker.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/15/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democrats-say-more-1-million-signatures-were-submi/	The Democratic Party of Wisconsin declared on Jan. 17, 2012 that it had submitted to the state elections board more than 1 million signatures on petitions to recall Republican Gov. Scott Walker. That figure -- far exceeding the 540,208 signatures of "eligible electors" needed to force Walker into a recall election -- was proudly proclaimed by Democratic chairman Mike Tate in an online video. "I can announce that your grassroots movement, right now, is delivering to the Government Accountability Board over 1 million signatures collected to recall Scott Walker," he said. "This represents nearly double, or 185 percent, of the total required. It is simply breathtaking." The party said it had submitted more than 1 million signatures even after removing an undisclosed number that were duplicates, illegible or seemingly fake. It repeatedly cited the figure, including at a news conference, in a blog post and in statements. So did other groups such as United Wisconsin, which participated in the signature gathering, and the web site RecallScottWalker.com. So did commentators and reporters. But until the Government Accountability Board reviewed the petitions, there was no official account of just how many signatures had been submitted. The key question, of course, is whether there are 540,208 valid signatures. The board is continuing its review, although even Republicans expect there will be enough valid signatures for a Walker recall election to be held later in 2012. Nevertheless, many readers have asked us about the eye-popping 1 million claim, noting that it has become an awful catchy shorthand for success. On March 12, 2012, the Government Accountability Board announced that 931,042 signatures had been submitted to recall Walker. That’s a lot of signatures, but not 1 million. On the day the GAB announced its official figure, a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter asked state Democratic Party spokesman Graeme Zielinski in an email why there was a difference of nearly 69,000 between the number of signatures the party announced and the number counted by the elections board. Zielinski replied he didn’t know, then backtracked, calling the "over 1 million" claim an estimate. Said Zielinski: "Nobody knows how many signatures were submitted because of the sheer volume and the way the signatures were counted in the closing days. That's why we estimated our total." But the number was never presented as an estimate. What’s more, the party and United Wisconsin said they created their own database of the signatures before submitting them to the state board. (Tea party groups have released what they say is a searchable databases of recall petitions filed against four Republican state senators, and have said they would release one for the Walker. A Journal Sentinel review of a random sampling of 500 Walker recall signatures found that 15 percent of them could not be verified, indicating there still would be enough valid signatures to force an election.) We emailed Zielinski the day after the state board announced its figure, to see if he had anything more for us to consider. He said the party stands by its more than 1 million claim, but again called it an estimate. He also said the board’s count doesn't include "rehabilitated signature affidavits and may not have included thousands of signatures where Rebecca Kleefisch signatures were mixed with Scott Walker signatures." The board has counted 842,860 submitted signatures on petitions to recall Kleefisch, the GOP lieutenant governor, in what essentially is a joint effort to remove both Walker and Kleefisch from office. We asked Government Accountability Board spokesman Reid Magney about Zielinski’s comments. The board’s count of 931,042 is the "raw number" of signatures submitted by the Walker recall committee, Magney said. So, it would include "rehabilitated" signatures -- those that were put on a petition that contained a minor flaw and which the Democrats attempted to correct with an affidavit. Because no challenges were filed against any signatures, the GAB staff did not review the correcting affidavits. As for mixing petitions, Magney said that approximately 200 signatures on Kleefisch recall petitions were mistakenly included with petitions seeking to recall Walker, and they would have been counted in the raw number of Walker signatures, but those signatures would have been later struck by the staff. About 95 Walker recall signatures were mistakenly included with Kleefisch petitions, he said. Bottom line: Nothing Zielinski cited calls the board’s 931,042 count into question in any serious way. Conversely, he provided no evidence to show that more than 1 million signatures were submitted. Our rating The Democratic Party of Wisconsin claimed it submitted to the state elections board "over 1 million signatures" to recall Walker -- a claim that has been repeated and repeated. The board said just over 931,000 signatures were submitted. We rate the party’s statement False.	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2012-03-15T11:08:21	2012-01-17	['None']

pomt-14259	States with "the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/apr/11/myra-signer/myra-signer-says-state-highest-gun-ownership-rates/	Former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who was gravely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting near Tucson, recently visited Virginia’s Capitol to push for tougher gun laws. She and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, launched a coalition that will seek "common-sense solutions" to gun violence in the state. High on its list is convincing a resistant General Assembly to close loopholes in Virginia’s background check law for prospective gun buyers. About a dozen community leaders and law-enforcement experts met with Giffords and Kelly to help set strategies. Among them was Mira Signer, executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She said the availability of guns poses special risks to those with mental disorders. States "that have the highest gun ownership also have the highest suicide rates," she said. "The evidence is there. We know that." We wondered whether Signer’s statement is correct. Signer told us her claim is based in part on a report called "The Truth About Guns and Suicide," published in September 2015 by the Brady Center & Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonprofit advocating gun control. The report says, "Studies examining firearm ownership and suicide rates at the national, state and regional levels provide further evidence of the firearm-suicide connection. They show that suicide rates, both overall and by firearm, are higher in areas where gun ownership is more widespread." Footnotes in the report say the Brady Center’s statement is based on a series of studies by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center in Massachusetts - the last published in 2008. Researchers compared data that the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention kept from 2000 to 2002 on the number of suicides in each state and the percentage of households in each state where at least one firearm was held. "Among men, among women, and in every age group (including children), states with the higher rates of household gun ownership had higher rates of firearm suicides and overall suicides," the researchers wrote in an article published by The New England Journal of Medicine. Back then Why rely today on statistics that are more than decade old? Researchers say they’re still the best numbers available. Every year, the CDC conducts an extensive health-risk poll with more than 250,000 U.S. adults that ‘s called the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. It used to ask participants whether they had guns in their homes. With its huge sample, the results could be broken down to statistically reliable percentages of households with a gun in each state. The CDC, under congressional demands to stop researching gun issues, removed the question from the survey after 2004. Since then, no other poll has offered a reliable, detailed look at gun ownership rates in each state. The CDC surveys showed that the top three states for percentage of household gun ownership - Wyoming, Montana and Alaska - often ranked as the three states with the highest suicide rates. Roughly 60 percent of households held firearms in those states, much higher than the national median of 40 percent. Their suicide rates, according to other CDC data, hovered around 20 people per 100,000 - nearly double the national average of about 11 per 100,000. Conversely, the nine states with the lowest per-household gun ownership from 2001 to 2004 also had the nine lowest suicide rates. They were Hawaii, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, California, Illinois and Maryland. Overall, the statistics show a distinct correlation between gun ownership and suicide rates in states. There are, of course, anomalies. Nevada, for example, ranked 36th in the percentage of households with guns from 2001 to 2004 but had fourth-highest suicide rate. Virginia, if you’re wondering, ranked 32nd in the percentage of household with guns and 34th in suicide rate during that period. Today Signer’s statement was made in present tense, so there’s an issue of whether these old findings remain relevant. The ranking of states based on suicide rates barely has changed over the years, according CDC data for 2013 - the latest final statistics available. Wyoming, Alaska and Montana still had the highest rates. So that leaves the problem on quantifying household gun ownership in each state without updated, exhaustive surveys from the CDC. YouGov, an international market research firm, conducted an Internet poll in 2013 that asked 4,622 U.S. adults to participate in an online survey that asked whether they owned guns. YouGov broke the numbers down by state and got results that broadly resembled the CDC figures. Columbia University researchers used those figures in a 2013 paper on the gun culture in states and regions around the U.S. Bindu Kalesan, the lead researcher, told us in an email that the numbers for many states have a high margin of error. Many analysts, in exploring a variety of gun issues, still cite the CDC state figures. David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, told us the numbers still are relevant. "Gun ownership levels across states hardly change over time," he said. "For example, the best predictors of whether you will own a gun is whether you grew up with guns and whether your neighbors are gun owners or not." These indicators, Hemenway said, "don’t switch back and forth." Hemenway sent us four studies from other researchers that also connected the presence of guns to high suicide rates. "It all makes sense psychologically," he said, "since so many suicides are pretty spontaneous with little planning and people use whatever is handy. The urge passes and people who have survived even serious suicide attempts rarely go on to kill themselves. The case fatality rate for guns is 90 percent, while the case fatality rate for the two most common forms of suicide attempts - pills and cutting - is under 3 percent." Our ruling Signer said states that have "the highest gun ownership rates also have the highest suicide rates." Exhaustive data collected by the CDC at the start of the century supports her statement. The three states with the highest percentage of household gun ownership - Alaska, Wyoming and Montana - also had the three highest suicide rates. The correlation between the availability of guns and suicide rates, while not as exact across the nation, certainly existed in most other states. The nine states with the lowest household gun rates also had the lowest suicide rates. The ranking of states by their suicide rates barely has changed over the years. But the CDC has stopped surveying gun ownership in states, and nothing nearly as reliable has filled the void. A much smaller poll conducted in 2013 suggests the ranking of states by the percentage of homes with guns hasn’t changed much either. And there’s no shortage of researchers, past and present, who have concluded there is a strong link between the presence of guns and suicides. So we rate Signer’s statement True.

pomt-13588	Says the director of an anti-abortion group receiving a Texas grant to provide women’s health services "believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/aug/17/joaquin-castro/joaquin-castro-says-conservative-activist-believes/	After word surfaced that a conservative nonprofit won a $1.6 million state grant to deliver women’s health services, U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro questioned the decision while making a "sewer" claim about the group’s director. Castro, D-San Antonio, said in an August 2016 tweet: "The group's director believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system. Is it really most qualified for the grant?" Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which causes AIDS, is mainly spread through sexual contact or from sharing needles, syringes, rinse water or other equipment with someone who has the virus, according to a federal website focused on AIDS. Less commonly, per the site, the virus may be spread from mother to child during pregnancy, by being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle and, in rare cases, via blood transfusions and eating food pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person. We spotted no mention of the virus getting conveyed from anything in a sewer pipe. "HIV does not survive long outside the human body (such as on surfaces) and it cannot reproduce outside a human host," the site says. The virus also isn’t spread by air or water, the site says. Seeking Castro’s factual backup, we heard from his House spokeswoman, Erin Hatch, who emailed us web links to summer 2016 news stories--including an Austin American-Statesman story posted earlier the day of Castro’s tweet about Carol Everett, chief executive of the Round Rock-based Heidi Group, which once ran no-charge crisis pregnancy centers in Dallas advising women with unplanned pregnancies about giving birth. Everett, the story said, "recently came under scrutiny for suggesting during a fetal tissue disposal hearing that sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV, could be transmitted through the sewer system." Everett told the paper, though, that her highlighted comments had been misunderstood. Everett also told reporter Julie Chang that her remarks about HIV amounted to "a stupid mistake." Chang shared with us her notes from her interview with Everett, who said: "I very much regret what I said. I shouldn’t have even tried… because they misunderstood it. I didn’t talk about transmitting STDs that way. I was trying to talk about the fact that babies are ground up and put into these garbage disposals which goes into our sewers. I didn’t make that point very clearly." Existing regulations allow fetal remains, as with other medical tissue, to be ground and discharged into a sewer system, incinerated or disinfected followed by disposal in a landfill, or "an approved alternate treatment process, provided that the process renders the item as unrecognizable, followed by deposition in a sanitary landfill." Two instances For our part, we confirmed from a TV news report noted by Hatch and Chang’s recording of Everett’s comments before a state agency that she indeed made mention of HIV and sewers while advocating for state officials to adopt a rule requiring fetal remains to be buried or cremated rather than disposed other ways. The rule was proposed in June 2016 by the executive commissioner of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission on behalf of the Department of State Health Services; it wasn’t finalized as of Aug. 17, 2016. Chang’s recording of Everett’s comments at an Aug. 4, 2016 state hearing on the proposed rule show Everett expressed criticism of current disposal methods, further saying: "What does this really do to the public? There are other people to consider. "What if one of those sewer treatment programs breaks down one day? You know, the abortion industry doesn’t have time; they only see a woman one time; they do not do an AIDS test, they don’t do, they don’t know if she’s HIV-positive. They don’t know if she has a sexually transmitted disease. And what if one day, just one day, something horrible escaped into the sewer system?" (Laughter.) "It may sound funny but it’s something we could think about because I can tell you today, the public is thinking about it. "So I appreciate very much addressing this. I encourage you to uphold it. Let’s take care of those who cannot take care of themselves -- and I am talking about the women." Earlier, as pointed out by Hatch, Everett said in an interview with Austin’s Fox 7 aired July 7, 2016, that existing protocols for disposing fetal remains pose "several health concerns. What if the woman had HIV? What if she had a sexually transmitted disease? What if those germs went through and got into our water supply?" Everett said. When we reached Everett about Castro's claim, she said by phone she hadn’t explicitly said HIV is spread through sewer pipes--and doesn’t believe as much. "People with HIV and AIDS go to the bathroom every day," Everett said. At the state hearing, she said, she was trying to stress that fetal material gets into the sewer system. Everett called her comment to Austin’s Fox 7 about HIV/STD "germs" getting into "our" water supply "really far out. I shouldn’t have said that." Our ruling Castro said Everett "believes HIV can be spread through the sewer system." Everett didn’t explicitly say as much and told us she doesn’t believe it. However, on two occasions, she raised the "what-if" spectre of a woman somehow passing along the virus or an STD through fetal material flushed down a drain. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01784	"The fundraising numbers are in, and our grassroots support is unmatched!"	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/27/glenn-grothman/glenn-grothman-says-he-leads-grassroots-financial-/	When Republican moderate Tom Petri retires next year, his successor in Congress is likely to be a more conservative member of the party. Four Republicans are battling for the party’s nomination, and fundraising will help determine who emerges from the Aug. 12, 2014 primary in Wisconsin’s 6th Congressional District. The winner will take on Democrat Mark Harris. When state Sen. Glenn Grothman’s mid-year campaign fund balance trailed two of his Republican rivals for the seat, he put a positive spin on his showing. "The fundraising numbers are in, and our grassroots support is unmatched!" he wrote in a Facebook post on July 16, 2014. Grothman, of Campbellsport, says it is smaller donations from Wisconsin that define his stronger "grassroots" support when compared to better-funded rivals Joe Leibham, a state senator from Sheboygan, and Duey Stroebel, a state representative from Saukville. We wondered if Grothman really has an edge among regular Joes and Janes giving $1 to $199 at a time in contrast to the deep-pockets givers. So we did what we do -- crunched the numbers. We trained our calculator mainly on Leibham, who raised $302,940 so far in 2014, and Grothman, who’s taken in $147,638. That’s because Grothman clearly has more financial support from regular folks than Stroebel ($368,206), who’s mainly using his own money, and than Tom Denow of the Oshkosh area, whose scant fundraising did not require reporting. We found a virtual dead heat between Grothman and Leibham on some indicators of small-bore support -- but better news for Leibham on key bottom-line measures. To the numbers: Concentration of Wisconsin support: More than 99 percent of Grothman’s donors are from the Badger State, compared with Leibham at 98.1 percent. A broader way to look at it is donations, not just donors (some donors give multiple times). By that measure, Leibham and Grothman each got between 98 and 99 percent from Badger State residents. Concentration of small givers: Slightly more than 76 percent of Grothman’s individual donations were $100 or less. The comparable figure for Leibham: just over 75 percent. Again, basically even. On donations of under $200 -- the threshold at which the Federal Election Commission allows candidates not to itemize donors by name -- Grothman had a larger advantage: 79 percent to 74 percent. (Leibham discloses names and other information on all donations; Grothman, as is true for many candidates, discloses smaller donations only as a lump-sum number, as the FEC allows. He shared additional detail with us for this story. The candidates’ fundraising reports are on the FEC website.) Money total from small givers: Leibham ran ahead of Grothman on total funds from those giving $100 or less per donation, $46,000 to $41,000. Number of small and in-state donations: Leibham attracted almost 200 more sub-$101 contributions than Grothman, and about 300 more total donations from Wisconsinites. Big money donations: Leibham gets a slightly larger share of his contributions from people giving $1,000 or more. In short, the pair get basically the same, very large share of their support from in-state donors and from small donations, but Leibham does more volume. Grothman campaign spokesman Brandon VerVelde told us Grothman should get credit for winning straw polls at GOP events. Perhaps he should, but the candidate’s statement was about fundraising. Our rating Grothman boasted that, "The fundraising numbers are in, and our grassroots support is unmatched!" But the numbers show that Leibham matched or out-did Grothman on most measures. That reads as pretty matched to us. We rate Grothman’s claim False.	None	Glenn Grothman	None	None	None	2014-07-27T05:00:00	2014-07-15	['None']

pomt-07097	Says that Sherrod Brown "voted to cut Medicare by over $500 billion in order to fund government-run health care."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/23/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-claims-sen-sherrod-brown-voted-cut-500-billio/	When Sen. Sherrod Brown spoke at a Youngstown senior center against a Republican proposal to convert Medicare to a voucher system, the National Republican Senatorial Committee had a ready response. The NRSC revised and reissued a three-day-old news release that targeted virtually identical statements at Brown, of Ohio, and four other senators who all are Democrats up for re-election next year: Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jon Tester of Montana, Ben Cardin of Maryland and Bill Nelson of Florida. "Despite Sherrod Brown's transparent political strategy to mislead Ohio seniors and demagogue Medicare, this serves as another reminder he is the only candidate in Ohio who has voted to cut Medicare by over $500 billion in order to fund government-run health care," said NRSC spokesman Jahan Wilcox. Wilcox cited the New York Times, Washington Post and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office as supporting sources. PolitiFact has examined at least four previous claims that the health care reform bill -- formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and informally tagged as Obamacare -- would cut Medicare by $500 billion. The important point in each examination is that $500 billion -- the figure confirmed by the NRSC's citations -- are not taken out of the current Medicare budget and are not actual cuts. Nowhere in the bill are benefits actually eliminated, experts said. The $500 billion are reductions to future spending. The health care law attempts to slow the projected growth in Medicare spending by that amount over 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. Some of the changes in the health care law increase Medicare spending "to improve benefits and coverage, Tricia Neuman, director of the Medicare Policy Project at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation told PolitiFact. Other provisions reduce the growth in Medicare spending by helping the program operate more efficiently and fund coverage expansions to the uninsured. Other provisions are designed to improve the delivery of care and quality of care, she said. The projected $500 billion in savings will come from changes that include higher insurance premiums for wealthier seniors, reductions in payments for Medicare Advantage plans, a new panel to oversee reimbursement rates, and a slowing of increases in payment rates to hospitals and other service providers each year. (Neuman explains the changes in a video tutorial on the Kaiser Family Foundation's website.) The NRSC recycled another talking point when it further asserts that the changes in the health care law will "fund government-run health care." PolitiFact has repeatedly issued Truth-O-Meter ratings of False or Pants on Fire for claims that the law represents a government takeover of health care. The claim was selected as PolitiFact National's 2010 Lie of the Year. We found that critics of the law are correct that it significantly increases government regulation of health insurers. But it is, as noted previously, a system that relies on private companies: Employers continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies. More people will get private health coverage. The law sets up "exchanges" where private insurers will compete to provide coverage to people who don't have it. The government will not seize control of hospitals or nationalize doctors. The law does not include a government-run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers. The law gives tax credits to people who have difficulty affording insurance, so they can buy their coverage from private providers on the exchange. The NRSC’s claim cites a real figure -- $500 billion -- that is part of the health reform debate. But it incorrectly describes it as $500 billion in Medicare cuts, rather than as decreases in the rate of growth of future spending. And the NRSC piles on the incorrect talking point about "government-run health care." On the Truth-Meter, the NRSC’s claim rates as False.

pomt-13380	Says to Hillary Clinton, "You heard what I said about (the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal), and all of a sudden you were against it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-my-trans-pacific-partnership-oppositi/	Criticism of U.S. trade deals has been a key theme in Donald Trump's campaign, and during the Sept. 26, 2016, debate against Hillary Clinton, he focused on two. First, he criticized Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, for signing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump also accused Clinton of wanting to approve a newer proposal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the largest regional trade deal in history. NAFTA was bad, Trump said, "And now you want to approve (the) Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, 'I can't win that debate.' But you know that if you did win, you would approve that." Clinton said that "is just not accurate" and argued that she decided to oppose it once the terms of the deal were known. Trump said she had praised the deal "and then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it." "Well, Donald," Clinton responded, "I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts." We wondered about the timing. Did Clinton change her mind in response to Trump's criticism of the TPP? We found no evidence to support Trump's claim. Even before he was a candidate, Trump was on record as opposing the TPP. As early as April 2015, he predicted it would hurt U.S. businesses and put people out of work. The terms of the deal were finalized on Oct. 5, 2015. Clinton announced her opposition on Oct. 7, two days later. At the time, she was under pressure to oppose the pact, but that pressure wasn't from Trump. On Oct. 7, Trump was only one of 15 Republicans still seeking the GOP nomination. The first presidential primary was five months away, Trump's poll numbers among Republicans were around 23 percent. Many people thought his lead in the polls was largely based on name recognition. Most Republicans supported the deal, CNN reported in a story about Clinton's decision to oppose the TPP. Trump is listed as a notable exception. However, the topic didn't even come up during the first two GOP debates. More urgently, if Clinton was under any immediate pressure to oppose the TPP it was from her two top opponents in the Democratic primary — Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley. Like many Democrats, particularly those with strong union ties, both men opposed the TPP. Sanders called it "disastrous." O'Malley accused Clinton of switching on the eve of the first Democratic debate. At the time, Sanders was starting to gain momentum. His support in the polls had gone from 12 percent at the end of June to 25 percent in a Clinton-Sanders matchup, and support for Clinton had slipped nearly 20 points. There was also pressure from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Her biggest concern, as she explained in a July 7, 2016 video, was that the TPP gave multinational companies special power "to challenge a country's laws they just don't like," including laws on pollution, safety, health and food. We emailed a half dozen people in the Trump campaign seeking evidence that Trump's opposition caused Clinton to change her mind. We didn't hear back. Our ruling Trump told Clinton, "You heard what I said about (the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal), and all of a sudden you were against it." There's no evidence for cause and effect here, and the Trump campaign hasn't provided any. Clinton says her opposition is based solely on the terms of the proposed pact and her announcement to oppose it came two days after the TPP was finalized. Even if political considerations drove her decision, most of the pressure on Clinton was within her own party, particularly from Bernie Sanders, as she saw her support among Democrats slipping. Based on the available evidence, we rate Trump's claim as False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/eef8af26-f463-4b75-ad92-d01bd602af43	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-27T17:14:54	2016-09-26	['Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-09155	Says an estimate that Texas will face an $18 billion budget gap is “a number that somebody just reached up in the air and grabbed."	false	/texas/statements/2010/jun/09/rick-perry/perry-says-18-billion-budget-gap-estimate-plucked-/	Seven months before the Texas Legislature convenes to begin work on the state's next two-year budget, Gov. Rick Perry was asked his assessment of the state budget gap likely to confront lawmakers. "How big do you estimate that the state's budget shortfall will be?" reporter Martin Bartlett of Austin's KVUE-TV asked in an interview posted online June 4. "... We've heard that estimate, $18 billion. That is a big number." Perry replied: "It is a big number. And I think it's a number that somebody just reached up in the air and grabbed." Perry, noting he's been around state government for a spell, went on: "May of 2011 is when we are really going to get down to the lick log, and to be trying to estimate what the Texas economy is going to be, particularly in this economic climate that we're in, I think is an effort in futility and not very wise by those who are trying to do those estimates." We wondered what the heck a lick log is -- oh, and whether Perry was on the mark when he characterized the $18 billion estimate as free-floating, so to speak. For starters, we're presuming that "budget gap" refers to the expected gulf during 2012-13 between state spending demands and revenue the state can count on to meet them. As for lick log, the Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang says a lick log is a “salt lick for cattle.” The phrase “down to the lick log” means to get “down to business.” So, Perry’s perspective appears to be that the financial picture won't be clear until May 2011, about when negotiators for the House and Senate are likely to draw up the final budget that ends up being sent to the governor. When we contacted Perry's office about his "up in the air" statement, spokeswoman Allison Castle pointed out that state Comptroller Susan Combs has not yet released a 2012-13 revenue estimate and also agencies have not made appropriation requests. Some budgetary background: Every odd-numbered year, lawmakers start drafting the budget with instructions from the state comptroller on how much revenue the state expects to earn during the next two years; that forecast determines how much the state has to spend. Unlike the federal government's, the budget has to balance, with the state spending no more than it takes in. When Perry was asked about the $18 billion figure on KVUE, Bartlett did not mention a source for the number. The Austin American-Statesman's budget reporter, Kate Alexander, nudged us to review the May 11 meeting of the House Appropriations Committee, whose members will get first crack at writing the budget. At the meeting, according to a video recording posted online by the Texas House, committee Chairman Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, quizzed Wayne Pulver, assistant director of the Legislative Budget Board, about the reasons that the state is facing a budget gap. Pitts introduced Pulver by noting the board does forecasting and is keeping the committee informed about "what we might be looking at as far as the shortfall." Established in 1949, the board is charged with many budgetary responsibilities, including preparation of a draft of the budget bill for legislators each session; its analysts produce the numbers that inform legislative spending decisions. At the hearing, Pulver signed off on Pitts' conclusion that lawmakers will start with a budget gap because of funds that will no longer be available from sizable sources that helped balance the 2010-11 budget: $6.4 billion in federal stimulus money and $5.6 billion in one-time state funds. Those figures jibe with an analysis the budget board produced in March for the committee and was laid out by John O'Brien, the board's executive director. O'Brien pegged the budget gap at $11 billion, but cautioned that his figure assumed no growth in state spending or revenue. At the May hearing, Pulver detailed factors expected to increase the shortfall, including that revenue could fail to meet projections and that spending may increase to accommodate growth in demand for programs like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Pitts then asked: "So that could add up to between $15 and $18 billion?" Pulver called that number "reasonable." At a May 25 meeting of the House Ways and Means committee, Chairman Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, got into more nitty-gritty. Citing a staff analysis, Oliveira said the expected gap could be reduced thanks to $1.2 billion in cuts to the current budget ordered by state leaders. Also, he said, the state could reap more than $3 billion in additional revenue transferred from the state's public education endowment and in federal Medicaid aid. But Oliveira also said the state could be facing new costs, such as: * $2.5 billion for Medicaid, primarily because of increased enrollment linked both to the economic downturn * $3.4 billion for public and higher education, primarily because of projected enrollment increases * $200 million for prisons, including increased health care costs A final factor in Oliveira’s analysis: revenue collections that he said could leave the state $3 billion to $6 billion short of projections. When all is said and done, Oliveira's budget gap estimate ends up at about $18 billion. J.J. Garza, Oliveira's chief of staff, later told us that he prepared Oliveira's analysis in consultation with the staff of Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, the Legislative Budget Board, and government and private-sector economists. Straus has also cited the budget gap, writing in a June 1 opinion piece in the Austin American-Statesman that "recent estimates project the state budget shortfall could be as much as $18 billion." Tracy Young, a spokeswoman for Straus, told us the speaker was referring to the same figures discussed by Pitts and Pulver. She described the source of the numbers as a combination of information from the LBB, state comptroller's office and the speaker's policy staff. As for the legitimacy of the $18 billion figure, we found a common cautionary caveat. There is still a lot of time for the number to change, especially if the economy takes a dramatic turn -- in either direction. In prepared remarks for the May 25 committee meeting, Oliveira said "the numbers can move by hundreds of millions over the next few months." He continued: "If the recovery is stronger, then (tax) collections would improve, our Medicaid burden would probably shrink ... and the revenue estimate for next session would be higher," which would shrink the gap. Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told the San Antonio Express-News in April that the budget gap couldn't yet be defined "because you don't know -- when you say shortfall, you imply some sort of mandatory spending level and some sort of predetermined revenue level, neither of which we have. There's no shortfall if you don't spend it. And we don't know yet what our revenue projections are." Despite that, Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association -- which represents several hundred largely Texas-based businesses and legal and accounting firms -- said that making budget projections is a "healthy part of the process; we do need to constantly be looking forward." Craymer said that without projections, for example, state leaders might not have decided to call for the recent cuts to the state's current budget. So how does Perry's statement shake out? It's downright flighty. Projections may be uncertain, but that doesn't mean they're pulled from the air, as Perry told KVUE. The $18 billion budget gap figure has been cited by state leaders using the best information they now have available. And an official at the budget board, whose staffers are longstanding experts on number-crunching, called that figure "reasonable" before Perry piped up. We rate Perry's statement as False.

pomt-08849	Says Bill White "profiteered in the aftermath of Hurricane Rita."	false	/texas/statements/2010/aug/09/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-bill-white-profiteered-hurricane-r/	A headline on one of GOP Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign websites underscores Perry’s criticism of Democratic nominee Bill White’s business dealings. White, the headline on liberalbill.org says, "profiteered in the aftermath of Hurricane Rita." That's a powerful charge -- worthy fodder for the Truth-O-Meter. First, let’s check "profiteer," which means someone "who makes excessive profits, especially by taking advantage of a shortage of supply to charge exorbitant prices," according to Webster’s New World College Dictionary. The verb simply means to be a profiteer. Robert Prentice, a professor at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, told us the word applies to someone who overcharges in instances of short supply or who simply seeks excess profits. In a nutshell, Perry’s campaign says White profiteered after the hurricane hit the Gulf Coast near the Texas-Louisiana line in September 2005 because, it says, he had financial connections — before and while he was mayor — with a company that got an emergency contract to provide six electrical generators to a Houston-area water authority for three months. In a June 10, 2010, press conference, White, who was mayor of Houston from 2004 through 2009, countered that he had no financial interest in the company -- BTEC Turbines -- at the time of the storm and hadn’t acted improperly when he encouraged the company to pitch in for the Coastal Water Authority, which supplies water to Houston, Baytown and Deer Park and dozens of industrial customers. (Its board of directors has seven members -- four appointed by the mayor of Houston and three by the governor.) The total amount paid by the authority to BTEC: about $1.9 million. The Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursed the authority for nearly all the money spent on the generator contract, which was needed after the storm knocked out power to a pump station that sends water from the Trinity River to a reservoir near Baytown. White spoke on the issue a day after personal income tax returns he released showed that he later made hundreds of thousands of dollars from investing in the Houston company. Don Moore, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California-Berkeley, said that for White's post-hurricane investment in BTEC to be interpreted as profiteering, White would have had to know two things in fall 2005: that he would join the investment in BTEC "in the near future" and that the firm's contract with the authority would "increase the sweetness" of that deal. Katy Bacon, spokeswoman for White's campaign, said he did not have advance knowledge of the investment opportunity. We scoured documents cited by Perry’s campaign, minutes from Coastal Water Authority board meetings and a packet of documents provided by Vinson & Elkins, the authority’s outside lawyers, for indications that either BTEC or White acted as profiteers from the emergency contract. What we found: Two members of the authority’s board of directors, Darryl King and Rick Cloutier, questioned the contract costs at the board’s October 2005 meeting. According to board minutes, Cloutier said the generators could be purchased for the same cost as renting them. The authority has since made a plan to buy back-up generators. On Aug. 4, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Mayor White later encouraged the authority to settle up with BTEC after the authority disputed some charges that it thought were too high. A final payment was arranged about eight months before White invested in BTEC. The authority ended up paying BTEC about $264,000 of more than $424,000 in disputed charges, according to the AP story. Cloutier, now a senior vice president with engineering and construction firm CDM in Houston, told us that after Rita hit, the board was pleased that the authority could get the equipment because "it was awful hard to come across generators at that time." He said the dispute between the authority and BTEC dealt with another aspect of the contract, the purchase and storage of diesel fuel that the authority didn't use because power was restored a few days after the storm. "It didn’t make sense to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for fuel and maintenance folks that we didn’t need," Cloutier said. So, why didn’t the authority end its BTEC deal as soon as power was restored? Cloutier said the board didn’t think that was an option. "We were being held to the terms of the contract," he said. Clark Lord of Vinson & Elkins, an outside lawyer for the authority, declined to discuss generator costs. But John Agnes, a salesman for Mustang CAT, which sells generators in the Houston area, told us the $252,000 monthly generator rental charge in the authority’s BTEC contract is roughly equivalent to what his company would charge for providing such generators in a period of high demand. The rest of the authority’s costs, about $1.2 million, were associated with installation, supporting equipment, personnel and fuel. (In October 2005, the authority’s board backed a resolution approving the agreement with BTEC and said the costs were not to exceed $2 million.) Next, we explored White’s connections to BTEC both before and after the hurricane came ashore in September 2005. Perry’s campaign notes correctly that before becoming mayor, White served on BTEC’s board by virtue of his job as president and CEO of the Wedge Group, a private Houston investment company with interests in oil service companies, commercial real estate and hotels. The Wedge Group bought a 70 percent stake in BTEC in December 2001, according to a December 2001 Houston Business Journal report. After his election in 2003, White resigned from Wedge and the BTEC board. Wedge later severed its ties to BTEC; Richard Blohm, general counsel for the Wedge Group, told us that "it has been a few years since we had any ownership interest at all." How did White regain an interest in BTEC? In December 2006, White invested in BTEC through the Sterling Group, one of two private equity firms that bought a majority stake in the Houston company that year. Bacon told us that the Sterling Group contacted White to get his opinion about the company and White said he thought so highly of it that he would put his own money into it. The firm later took White up on that and invited him to invest, Bacon said. The AP reported Aug. 4 that White owns about 1 percent of BTEC. Through July 20, 2010, Bacon said, White had put $552,000 in cash and $324,480 in loans into the BTEC investment and received $1.25 million in cash back -- a gain of about $375,000. Perry’s "profiteer" case against White features two other financial connections -- a deferred-compensation account that was set up before White left Wedge in 2003 and payments White received from Wedge in 2005. Let’s look at the deferred-compensation account first. According to White’s personal tax returns from the years he was mayor, White received payments from the account each year from 2005 (about $82,000) through 2009 (about $84,000). Bacon told us the deferred-compensation account, held by a brokerage firm, was funded with income White earned while still at Wedge that was then invested in publicly traded stocks and mutual funds, not in BTEC or Wedge. She said the payments White received were not influenced by Wedge’s performance after 2003. What about the more than $3 million White reported receiving from Wedge in 2005? In a financial summary White released to reporters this year, that money is described as "contractual payments" based on gains from investments that White had managed for the company prior to 2004. Bacon told us none of the investments was related to BTEC. We checked back in with the Perry campaign about the profiteering charge. Spokesman Mark Miner said the history of White’s financial involvement with Wedge, BTEC and the 2005 authority contract proves White profiteered from Hurricane Rita. We disagree. Questions have certainly been raised about whether the authority paid too much for its deal with BTEC, but even if it did, that would serve as evidence that BTEC reaped excessive profits from the hurricane contract, not White. Whether White improperly intervened on behalf of BTEC to settle the contract matter is another issue, which isn't the statement we're reviewing. Upshot: White had a prior relationship with BTEC when he played a role in the company’s getting post-hurricane work and he later made what turned out to be a profitable investment in the company. Those decisions might open White to conflict-of-interest criticisms. However, Perry’s characterization of White as a profiteer doesn't bear out. We rate Perry's claim False.

pomt-01296	The "stand your ground" law caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.	false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/30/senate-majority-pac/radio-ad-dem-pac-blames-trayvon-martin-death-flori/	The shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Florida, which sparked a national discussion about "stand your ground" laws, has become ammunition in the North Carolina U.S. Senate race. The Senate Majority PAC, which aims to elect Democrats, ran a radio ad urging higher turnout among black voters. The ad attacks Thom Tillis, the Republican speaker of the North Carolina House, challenging Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. The ad makes a series of claims about Tillis including this one: "Tillis even led the effort to pass the type of ‘stand your ground’ laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin." PolitiFact has fact-checked numerous claims related to the Trayvon Martin case. Did Florida’s "stand your ground" law cause his death? The radio ad was captured by the conservative blogger SisterToldjah and sparked considerable media attention. It prompted a conservative group to counterattack with a radio ad accusing the Democrats of "race baiting." While we are focused on the claim about whether Florida’s "stand your ground" law killed Trayvon, other media reports dissected Tillis’ role in the North Carolina law, which Tillis voted in favor of. Trayvon Martin and "stand your ground" law The fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin of Miami Gardens on Feb. 26, 2012, and the acquittal of George Zimmerman the following year ignited political debate over race, gun rights and Florida’s "stand your ground" law. The law, which was approved overwhelmingly by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005, allows people to use deadly force when they believe their life is at risk. The law, promoted by the National Rifle Association, now exists in about two dozen states. Trayvon, a black 17-year-old, was returning from a convenience store and walking through a gated neighborhood where he was staying with his father. Zimmerman, a white-Hispanic neighborhood watchman, called a non-emergency police number to report Trayvon as "suspicious." A violent struggle followed and Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon. Zimmerman waived his right to a "stand your ground" hearing before trial, and did not cite it in his defense during the trial. But the law was cited in jury instructions: "If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony." In July 2013, the jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder. After the verdict, Dan Gelber, a former federal prosecutor and state legislator from Miami Beach who was a critic of the law in 2005, wrote on his blog that jurors would have received different instructions under the old law, which said: "The defendant cannot justify the use of force likely to cause death or great bodily harm unless he used every reasonable means within his power and consistent with his own safety to avoid the danger before resorting to that force The fact that the defendant was wrongfully attacked cannot justify his use of force likely to cause death or great bodily harm if by retreating he could have avoided the need to use that force." (Gelber is now an adviser to Charlie Crist’s Democratic campaign for governor in Florida.) It’s difficult to quantify what extent "stand your ground" law played in the jury’s decision. One juror told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the jury discussed the "stand your ground" law. "It became very confusing. We had stuff thrown at us. We had the second-degree murder charge, the manslaughter charge, then we had self-defense, ‘stand your ground,’ and I think there was one other one." The juror, who was unnamed, said the murder or manslaughter charge did not apply "because of the heat of the moment and the ‘stand your ground.’ " But while the "stand your ground" law could have played a role for the jury, the law itself didn’t pull the trigger in the shooting. It’s impossible to fully evaluate Zimmerman’s thinking when he shot Trayvon, but one factor could have been that Zimmerman was a wannabe cop -- he had been rejected for a job with the Prince William County, Va., police department. Racial profiling could have played a role; Trayvon was a black male teenager wearing a hoodie. And then we will mention the obvious: Zimmerman had a gun. Zimmerman said in a TV interview in 2012 he had never heard of "stand your ground" until after the shooting, though during the trial the prosecution presented evidence that Zimmerman took a criminal-litigation course in which the instructor said he covered the "stand your ground" law. Zimmerman received an "A" in the course in 2010. The Senate Majority PAC’s back-up for the ad cites an article in Mother Jones shortly after the acquittal, which points to Zimmerman taking that course: "In reality, ‘stand your ground’ played a major role, from Martin's death to Zimmerman's acquittal. ... An armed Zimmerman knew about ‘stand your ground’ years ago." A spokesman for the PAC, Ty Matsdorf, didn’t respond to PolitiFact’s questions other than sending us the ad backup. He gave a statement to the New York Times defending the ad in general terms. But two defense attorneys we interviewed argued that the "stand your ground" law itself didn’t play a provable role. "I don’t recall any evidence that he made a conscious decision to rely on the law before acting," said Kendall Coffey, a former U.S. Attorney in Miami now in private practice. " ‘Stand your ground’ may have led to the acquittal of George Zimmerman; that’s a more accurate statement. It’s led to other acquittals, too." "The law didn’t cause his death," said David Weinstein, a former state and federal prosecutor and now a Miami defense attorney. "The bullet that got fired by George Zimmerman’s gun is what caused Trayvon Martin’s death." After the Trayvon case, efforts to get rid of Florida’s "stand your ground" law went nowhere in the Republican-led Legislature. In fact, in 2014 the Legislature added that it applies to warning shots. The law has remained a hot topic nationwide, including in Florida’s race between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Crist. During the Oct. 15 debate at Broward College, Scott said he would not change the law, while Crist said it is "fundamentally flawed" and needs to be fixed. Our ruling A Senate Majority PAC radio ad said, "Tillis even led the effort to pass the type of ‘stand your ground’ laws that caused the shooting death of Trayvon Martin." The part we focused on is whether Florida’s "stand your ground" law killed Trayvon. There are plenty of factors that could have contributed to George Zimmerman shooting Trayvon including racial profiling and his desire to be a law enforcement officer (not to mention the obvious: his access to a gun). And the "stand your ground" law could have influenced the jury’s decision to acquit Zimmerman of murder. However, it is an overstatement to suggest that the law is to blame for Trayvon’s death. We rate this claim False.	None	Senate Majority PAC	None	None	None	2014-10-30T16:04:52	2014-10-28	['None']

pomt-11946	"There have been more than 270 mass shootings in the United States in the last year alone. That’s where four or more are killed."	false	/california/statements/2017/oct/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-false-claim-mass-shootings/	Citing the Las Vegas shooting that killed 59 people and injured hundreds, Hillary Clinton urged the nation to do more to prevent gun violence during a speech at the University of California at Davis on Monday. The Democrat and former presidential candidate rejected the idea that a debate over gun safety should wait until well after a mass shooting takes place. "What better time than now?" Clinton said, speaking on her current book tour’s only scheduled stop in California. Clinton went on to make a claim about the number of mass shootings that have taken place this year — and misstated how they are defined. "There have been more than 270 mass shootings in the United States this year alone. That’s where four or more are killed. Two hundred and seventy. We cannot accept this as normal. We cannot become desensitized." Hillary Clinton made her claim about mass shootings during a speech Oct. 9, 2017 at UC Davis. PolitiFact California took a deep look at how mass shootings are defined here, and found there’s wide disagreement on the matter. Democrats and gun control advocates use the very broad criteria that a mass shooting includes four or more people killed — or injured — in one event. It was developed by the Gun Violence Archive, a group that logs shootings across the country by crowdsourcing media reports. Under its definition, which does not require that anyone is necessarily killed, there have been more than 270 mass shootings so far this year. But there have been far fewer of these crimes where, as Clinton termed it, "four or more people are killed." More restrictive criteria A database compiled by Mother Jones, a liberal magazine, shows there have been only three mass shootings so far this year that meet the four-or-more measurement expressed by Clinton at the speech. The magazine itself shows seven mass shootings so far this year because it uses three or more deaths as its criteria. It excludes more conventional crimes such as armed robberies and gang violence in its count, focusing instead on "the distinct phenomenon of mass shootings." The Gun Violence Archive, meanwhile, which includes gang shootings and home invasion robberies as mass shootings, had tallied 19 shootings in which four or more people were killed. In the past, the federal government has used the more restrictive criteria of four or more killed to define a mass shooting. We found there’s no widely accepted definition that doesn’t create its own share of questions. A spokesman for Clinton pointed to the Gun Violence Archive’s definition for mass shootings, but did not immediately provide an explanation for Clinton’s misstatement of that definition. Our ruling Hillary Clinton in her UC Davis speech said there have been more than 270 mass shootings in the United States so far this year. She defined the events as "where four or more are killed." Our research has shown that a broad definition of mass shootings requires four or more people to be killed or injured. There have been more than 270 of those horrific crimes so far this year. But Clinton left out the key words "or injured," dramatically changing the criteria for these shootings. There have been a much smaller number of mass shootings that meet this stricter criteria of "four or more people killed," nowhere near the 270 she claimed. We rate Clinton’s claim False.

pomt-09092	"In fact, oil spills from tankers are far more common than the very rare leaks from rigs or pipelines."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/24/eric-johnson/candidate-oil-spills-tankers-more-common-very-rare/	As the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico continues to threaten the coastline, Savannah's Eric Johnson, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, remains steadfast in his support for offshore drilling. He dedicated a blog post to his position on his campaign Web page. "Predictably, liberal activists call the Gulf disaster a warning of things to come if we expand drilling, but this incident is an unfortunate exception to the rule. The last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America happened over 40 years ago in 1969. In fact, oil spills from tankers are far more common than the very rare leaks from rigs or pipelines." An earlier PolitiFact item ruled that Johnson's claim that the last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America took place in 1969 was False. This one deals with whether oil spills from tankers are far more common than "very rare leaks" from rigs or pipelines. We looked at a 2009 report produced by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, that catalogs oil spills. Indeed, the number of spills from tankers in U.S. waters is nearly two-and-a-half times higher than those of offshore oil pipelines and oil platforms combined. Tankers also dump more than three times more oil. Two scientists who study the ocean and environment also confirmed that tankers are responsible for more spills. Here's how the numbers from the American Petroleum Institute break down: U.S. offshore pipelines, 1969 to 2007: 506 spills, 182,355 barrels p24 U.S. platforms, 1969 to 2007: 1,035 spills, 277,033 barrels p24 Oil tankers in U.S. waters: 3,774 spills, 1962 through 2007; 1,596,638 barrels p31 U.S. Coast Guard figures on spills differ from API data but back up the overall point that tanker spills are far worse polluters than offshore oil pipelines or platforms. But are leaks from rigs or pipelines "very rare"? The petroleum industry's own figures indicate the U.S. has averaged more than 13 pipeline spills and 27 platform spills a year. They're certainly less common than tanker spills, as Johnson stated. But platform and pipeline spills still take place roughly 40 times annually. That's a little more than three times per month. That's not rare at all. That's chronic. We rule this claim Half True.	None	Eric Johnson	None	None	None	2010-06-24T06:00:00	2010-06-07	['None']
pomt-14801	While the smoking rate nationally has fallen, more than 18 percent of Georgians still light up.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/nov/30/atlanta-mayor-kasim-reeds-office/Statement-on-smoking-rates-needs-slightly-more-con/	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and more than two dozen health professionals launched a statewide campaign last week to help Georgia smokers kick the habit. The "Nobody Quits Like Georgia" campaign emphasized connecting smokers with the counseling and other support they need to quit successfully. "Atlanta and state-level health care leaders are taking action because while the national smoking rate has fallen, more than 18 percent of adults in Georgia are still smoking," Reed’s office said in a press release on Nov. 17. The health hazards of cigarette smoking have been publicly recognized at least since the mid1960s, so could almost one in five Georgia adults still be lighting up? PolitiFact decided to check. First, a little background. Health advocates have been pushing to reduce the national smoking rate among adults 18 and over to 12 percent by 2020. About 20.6 percent of American adults were smoking in 2009, but the percentage has dropped every year since. In 2013, 19 percent of adults, nationally, and 18.8 percent in Georgia, were smoking, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The CDC says smoking leads to disease and disability and harms nearly every organ of the body. More than 16 million Americans are estimated to be living with a smoking-related disease. These include cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung disease, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), according to the CDC. The financial toll of smoking is tremendous -- more than $300 billion a year in the United States alone. This includes about $170 billion in direct medical care for adults and more than $156 billion in lost productivity due to premature death and exposure to secondhand smoke, the federal agency estimates. So what about the city’s statement about the habit in Georgia? We started our fact-check by contacting Reed press secretary Jenna Garland. She told us the American Lung Association, lead sponsor of the campaign, provided the statistic that appeared in the press release. Searches of CDC statistics last week also verified that 18.8 percent of Georgia adults were identified as smokers in 2013, Garland said. "At the time of our press conference and release, this data was absolutely correct. And it is still the primary data presented by the CDC," she said. Garland is right -- for 2013. The picture is peachier for Georgia, however, based on newer data for 2014. That was available in a press release put out by the Georgia Department of Public Health on the same day that Reed’s office issued its statement. In 2014, Georgia’s adult smoking rate had fallen to 17.4 percent, down 1.4 percentage points from 2013 as measured on the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System.(BRFSS). Particularly significant, the rate of smoking fell to 16.4 percent in young adults, ages 18 to 24, state officials said. National data from BRFSS for 2014 has not made public. We examined data gathered in the last 10 years on smoking rates in Georgia and the nation. You’ll see that smoking rates have been heading downward both in the state and nation throughout most, but not all of the decade. This is based on data collected by states through the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and submitted by the CDC. Percentage of Adults 18 and over who smoke Year Georgia U.S. 2005 22.1 20.8 2006 19.9 20.5 2007 19.4 20 2008 19.5 19.7 2009 17.7 18.3 2010 17.6 17.9 2011 21.2 21.2 2012 20.4 19.6 2013 18.8 19 2014 17.4 Not available Source: Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) reports and Georgia Department of Public Health. --------------------- CDC spokeswoman Brittany Behm said that although the prevalence of smoking in Georgia has steadily declined in the past several years, the progress has not been as robust as it could have been. She said that’s largely because "interventions we know work have not been fully implemented." She said these include higher tobacco product prices, comprehensive smoke-free laws, hard-hitting mass media campaigns, and full and sustained funding for comprehensive tobacco control programs. "Statistically, Georgia ranks 24th among the states and DC—almost exactly at the median," Behm said. Jean O’Connor, director of chronic disease prevention for the Georgia Department of Public Health, said state officials believe they’ve made serious headway, particularly with the tobacco-free schools program that’s now in 105 of the state’s 181 school districts. Enabling 1.3 million students to spend their school day free from exposure to tobacco appears to be showing up in the numbers, O’Connor said. With the smoking rate falling to 16.4 percent in the 18-24 age group, "that tells us kids are aging up and not using tobacco products," she said. "If you can get to 25 without using, odds of being addicted are very very low." That’s reinforced in Georgia’s University System, one of the first in the nation to be smoke-free at its college and universities, O’Connor said. Our ruling A press release from Mayor Kasim Reed’s Office said: "Atlanta and state-level health care leaders are taking action because while the national smoking rate has fallen, more than 18 percent of adults in Georgia are still smoking." The first part of the statement is misleading. Smoking rates have generally been falling nationally and in Georgia. The state’s rate was lower than the national rate in 2013. Reed’s office is correct that, in 2013, 18.8 percent of Georgia adults over 18 were smoking. But newer figures paint a peachier picture for the state. It doesn’t change the mayor’s overarching point that the state still has a way to go. We rate Reed’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-03837	"In the period from 2007 to 2011, the Office of Health Insurance Commissioner reported an 18 percent decline in the state’s total medical spending."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/mar/16/joshua-miller/rhode-island-sen-joshua-miller-says-states-total-m/	In a March 1 news release, Sen. Joshua Miller, D-Cranston, announced a "landmark bill" representing the "next phase of health-care reform legislation in Rhode Island." Miller, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services, said his bill builds on previous legislative work, including the creation of the Office of Health Insurance Commissioner in 2004, electronic records and payment reforms. "These efforts have begun to show significant progress in cost containment," Miller said in a news release. "In the period from 2007 to 2011, the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner reported an 18 percent decline in the state’s total medical spending and an increase by insurers of 8 percent in medical claims dollars spent on primary care, up from 5.4 percent in 2007." Given all you hear about the rising cost of health care, PolitiFact Rhode Island was curious about the claim that Rhode Island’s total medical spending fell by 18 percent in that time frame. When we asked Miller to back up his claim, he cited a September 2012 report from the state health insurance commissioner’s office regarding attempts to bolster spending on primary care in Rhode Island. "Between 2007 and 2011, total primary care spending grew by 23 percent (for an annual growth rate of 5.3 percent), while overall medical spending fell by 17.6 percent (-4.7 percent annually)," the report said. The report noted that the figures reflected the money spent by insurers, not by patients. And it attributed the overall decline in medical spending to three factors: "The dampening effect of the recession and slow economic recovery on spending." "The popularity among employers and members of leaner, cheaper benefit packages that shift more costs to the member." "The shift to self-insurance." In an interview, Health Commissioner Christopher F. Koller said, "Senator Miller is factually accurate in that the numbers are from the report, and the total medical spending reported by insurers during that period is true." But then Koller mentioned two key facts: total medical spending is down in large part because it reflects health insurer spending for fewer people. The most recent figures show per-person costs are actually rising. "It’s during a period of economic decline, so more people are uninsured," Koller said. "Also, during that time, we saw an increase in the number of companies that self-insure." And the figures don’t reflect those covered by employers who self-insure, such as Brown University, he said. Between 2007 and 2011, commercial health-insurance enrollment in Rhode Island plunged by 53,509 people or by 8.7 percent -- going from 613,124 to 559,615, according to Koller’s office. And when measured per-member per-month, medical spending rose by 6.8 percent between 2009 and 2011, according to another report by his office. Koller said that 6.8 increase is "relatively low" when compared with the increases seen in other states in that time frame. So, he said, that bolsters Miller’s larger point that Rhode Island is doing a good job of controlling health-care cost increases. Our ruling Sen. Joshua Miller said, "In the period from 2007 to 2011, the Office of Health Insurance Commissioner reported an 18 percent decline in the state’s total medical spending." In touting Rhode Island’s progress in "cost containment," Miller’s accurate but limited citation of a report gives the impression that overall medical costs are falling in Rhode Island. But his news release left out some important context: that spending by insurers has fallen mainly because it reflected spending on fewer people. In fact, in recent years, per-person costs have increased. That full context is required to provide a true picture of how Rhode Island is doing in controlling health-care costs. So we rule Miller’s claim Half True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-04425	"The tax burden on Virginia families was lower under Tim Kaine than under George Allen."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/oct/15/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-says-tax-burden-families-was-lower-/	The debate never strays too far from taxes in this fall’s U.S. Senate race between Republican George Allen and Democrat Tim Kaine. Allen recently aired a TV commercial accusing Kaine of being a big taxer. The ad highlighted Kaine’s unsuccessful proposals for $4 billion in tax increases when he was governor from 2006 to 2010 and his comment in a Sept. 20 debate that he would be "open" to imposing a minimum federal income tax on all Americans. Kaine responded to the ad. "The facts are that the tax burden on Virginia families was lower under Tim Kaine than under George Allen," his campaign said in a Sept. 25 news release. We wondered if the tax burden on families really was lower under Kaine than under Allen, who was governor from 1994 to 1998. Kaine’s campaign told us they got the numbers from the pro-business Tax Foundation. The organization estimates what residents of each state pay in taxes -- not to just their own state and local governments, but also to others, through hotel, gas and other levies. Take, for example, Northern Virginia residents who work in the Washington. The computations would include state and local taxes the commuters are paying Virginia as well as estimates of sales, restaurant and other levies they pay in Washington. According to the Tax Foundation, Virginians paid state and local taxes averaging 6.9 percent of their income during Allen’s governorship as compared to 6.7 percent during Kaine’s administration. We were uncertain what to make of these numbers because neither Kaine nor Allen could control tax rates outside of Virginia when they were governors. So we turned to data that is confined to computing the state levies Virginians pay, as a proportion of their income, to Virginia. We found two sources: Congressional Quarterly’s annual State Fact Finder; which makes the calculation based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis; and the Tax Policy Center, whose website allows visitors to build their own tables based on data from the Census Bureau. The annual data from both groups computes total state tax revenues as a percentage of the total income of Virginians. Congressional Quarterly’s figures show that during Allen’s governorship, yearly state tax revenues averaged 5.6 percent of all the income earned by Virginians; over Kaine’s term, the average was 5.3 percent. The Tax Policy Center’s figures show that the average was an identical 5.3 percent during Allen and Kaine’s terms. It should be noted that the center did not have data for the final budget year of Kaine’s term, which began July 1, 2009. We found an interesting trend in the data from both organizations. The tax burden was stable during the years Allen was in office; ranging from 5.5 percent to 5.6 percent according to the Congressional Quarterly, and 5.2 percent to 5.4 percent according to the Tax Policy Center. In contrast, the burden was volatile under Kaine, falling from 5.9 percent during his first year in office to 4.6 percent his final year, according to Congressional Quarterly. According to the Tax Policy Center, the burden dropped from 5.6 percent Kaine’s first year to 4.8 percent his third year -- the latest data available. Economists said the decline, experienced by many states, was caused by the national recession that set in half way through Kaine’s term. "Tax collections shrink faster than income," explained said Scott Drenkard, an economist with the Tax Foundation. Norton Francis, senior research associate with the Tax Policy Center, said Virginia’s tax revenues declined by 10 percent, as corporate income dropped, real estate sales sagged and consumers reined in spending. Virginia did not enact major tax cuts during the final years of Kaine’s term. That leaves the recession as best explanation why the tax burden fell, according to Drenkard. John Knapp, a senior economist and professor emeritus at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, said the per capita tax burden is a poor way to measure a governor’s performance. "Many of the events during a term that affect the denominator (income) are beyond the control of a governor," he said. "This also applies to the numerator (taxes) since a lot of factors affect tax collections in addition to explicit changes in tax rates and tax bases. For example, if the economy deteriorates in response to national and international events, income and sales tax collections will reflect the soft economy." The figures don’t reflect another important consideration: Allen unsuccessfully sought to cut taxes by $2.1 billion when he was governor, while Kaine unsuccessfully proposed $4 billion in tax increases. Finally, we should note that under Allen and Kaine, Virginia was among the 10 states with the lowest tax per capita tax burdens. Our ruling Kaine’s campaign said the "tax burden on Virginia families was lower under Tim Kaine than under George Allen." Raw numbers generally back Kaine, but paint a superficial picture. Kaine did not offer large-scale tax cuts during his term; to the contrary, he unsuccessfully proposed increasing taxes by $4 billion. The smaller burden was caused by shrinking tax revenues coming into the state because of the recession. Kaine’s statement tries to turn the state’s lost revenue -- caused by no effort of his own -- into an accomplishment. The claim is based on kernels of data that, when put into context, give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02198	"The President wants the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.’s International Criminal Court."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/24/chain-email/chain-email-says-barack-obama-wants-us-joint-inter/	A reader recently sent us an email that had a meandering -- but strongly critical -- message of opposition to President Barack Obama. The email, which can be read in its entirety here, urges veterans and their families to vote in the 2014 midterm elections in order to send Obama a message. Here are excerpts: "The President, the Commander in Chief, has made the Rules of Engagement (ROE) so difficult, that our troops are often killed before they can even get permission to fight. Nothing has been done to stop our troops from being murdered by the Afghanis they are training, either. "Now, the President wants the US to sign on to the UNs International Criminal Court (ICC), which would allow the UN's ICC to arrest and try US troops for War Crimes, without the legal protections guaranteed under US Law, and from which there is no appeal. The President, with his Democratic control of the Senate, has nearly all the power. If the Non-Establishment Republicans, and Conservatives, can take back the Senate in 2014, our troops can once again be protected from unnecessary danger. Please consider this, and send it on to your mailing lists." We will be checking a few claims from this email, but in this report, we’ll look at the claim that "the President wants the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.’s International Criminal Court." First, some background on the International Criminal Court and its relationship to the United States. The ICC is a permanent, independent court headquartered in the Hague that investigates and brings to justice individuals who commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, according to the Congressional Research Service. Cases may be referred to the ICC either by a member state, the court’s own prosecutor, or the U.N. Security Council. The court only investigates or prosecutes serious crimes by individuals (not organizations or governments), and then, only when national judicial systems are unwilling or unable to handle them. The court’s founding document, known as the Rome Statute, entered into force on July 1, 2002. So far, 122 nations have become members of the court. But while the United States signed the Rome Statute under President Bill Clinton in 2000, it has not moved on to ratification -- the step that would make membership official. This position is intentional. Under President George W. Bush, the United States actually went so far as to "un-sign" the Rome Statute. The reasons included concerns that the court could exercise jurisdiction over U.S. citizens or military officials, as well as a perceived lack of checks and balances on court pursuits. More recently, United States opposition has softened -- within limits. In 2008, the United States decided not to veto a Security Council resolution to refer a case from the Darfur region of Sudan. Then, when Obama took office, it began attending sessions as an "observer" nation in 2009. In January 2010, a Justice Department review found that "informational" support for "particular investigations or prosecutions" would be legal under laws passed under Bush. In theory, the Obama administration could choose to seek Senate ratification. But even if it did, experts say, the administration’s ability to win the 67 votes in the Senate is almost nonexistent, given the extent of lingering concern about U.S. membership in the court. "President Obama has made no indication that he ‘wants the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.’s International Criminal Court,’" said Steven Groves, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Since everyone knows such a transmittal would be dead on arrival, the likelihood that the president would do so before the end of his term is negligible, if not zero." Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor who specializes in international law, agrees, calling the email’s claim "completely wrong." "Although the U.S. is no longer actively opposed to the court's existence and operation, as was the Bush administration, the Obama administration has no intention of submitting the ICC statute to the Senate," Ratner said. In other words, the email is wrong to claim that Obama, "with his Democratic control of the Senate, has nearly all the power." All Obama could theoretically do is ask for Senate support. Even if the Democrats had 67 votes -- which they don’t -- ratification for this particular agreement would be an uphill battle. We should add that the email has some other misleading elements about the court, such as when it says the court can "arrest and try U.S. troops for War Crimes, without the legal protections guaranteed under U.S. Law, and from which there is no appeal." While the ICC can issue "arrest warrants," it cannot enforce them. The ICC "cannot ‘arrest’ anyone -- it has no police power whatsoever," said Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service Anthony Clark Arend. Instead, it has to rely on its member states to do so, and "a state would not want to cooperate with the ICC if it sought arrest based on trumped-up charges," Ratner said. Ratner added that, contrary to the email’s claim about weak legal protections, the ICC procedures are "generally on par with U.S. law, with small exceptions such as trial by judges rather than a jury, and looser rules for admission of evidence." Our ruling The chain email says Obama "wants the U.S. to sign on to the U.N.’s International Criminal Court." While the Obama administration has been more willing to engage with the court than the Bush administration, which was strongly opposed to cooperating, Obama has made no sign that he wants to become a full-blown member of the court. Even if he did, doing so would require 67 votes in the Senate, making it essentially a nonstarter. We rate the claim False.

pomt-01540	Children who witness domestic violence are "twice as likely to commit it themselves."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/16/amy-klobuchar/klobuchar-children-who-witness-domestic-violence-a/	The release of a video showing NFL running back Ray Rice striking his now-wife in an Atlantic City, N.J., casino elevator revived conversations about domestic violence on the Sunday shows. On the Sept. 14, 2014, edition of CNN’s State of the Union, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., shared an anecdote from her time as a prosecutor to illustrate the ills of domestic violence. "We had a poster outside the door so everyone would see it when they came in. It was a picture of a woman beaten up with a Band-Aid over her nose, holding a little baby boy," Klobuchar said. "And the words read, ‘Beat your wife, and it’s your son that goes to jail.’ " "Kids … that have seen it happen," Klobuchar said, are "twice as likely to commit it themselves." Klobuchar concluded that because the NFL puts "out their players as role models," they have "to set a different culture." We were interested in checking Klobuchar’s claim that kids who witness domestic violence are "twice as likely to commit it themselves." 90's kids We want to be clear upfront that witnessing domestic violence means witnessing it in a child’s household -- not watching the TMZ.com Rice video. That said, the "twice as likely" talking point is fairly popular among advocates against domestic abuse, and suffice to say has been around for a while. The domestic violence literature we’ve seen often cited that claim with a 1990 book called "Physical Violence in American Families: Risk Factors and Adaptations to Violence in 8,145 Families." This book compiled the results of the landmark National Family Violence Surveys of 1975 and 1985, which constituted 60-minute face-to-face interviews and 30-minute phone interviews, respectively, with thousands of American families. Based on those interviews, the book’s authors illustrated how a variety of factors influenced the incidence of domestic violence. Most of the book is about gender differences and roles in domestic violence, but the section on the effects on children crunches the surveys’ numbers on whether abusers said they witnessed abuse as children. That produced the "twice as likely" estimate. The experts we talked to told us there hasn’t been any study as definitive or comprehensive since, although other studies have taken stabs at the issue of intergenerational transmission of domestic violence. "We’ve known for such a long time that the biggest risk factor for being abusive against wives and children is witnessing domestic violence at home or being abused," said Jacquelyn Campbell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing who studies domestic violence. So "people haven’t repeated the research for a while," Campbell said, and "a lot of stuff is old and mostly cross-sectional." What the existing literature says Campbell pointed us to a 2010 study about intimate partner violence -- a subset of domestic violence -- which found that children who witnessed any intimate partner violence were 2.6 times as likely to perpetrate it themselves. Children who witnessed any violence were 1.6 times as likely, according to the study, to become abusers as adults. Klobuchar’s claim, then, has grounds in literature both old and new. There are literally dozens of studies on this issue, though, and different studies tell different stories. A 2000 meta-analysis of 39 different studies on this issue found a "small-to-medium" correlation between witnessing and perpetrating. The studies in that survey, while a couple decades old, ranged from showing a causal relationship between witnessing and perpetrating to showing no relationship at all. That corroborates Klobuchar’s larger point that parents’ domestic violence has negative outcomes for their children, but that’s not the same as these kids being "twice as likely to commit it themselves." Difficulties with measurements Putting numbers on domestic violence is particularly hard, and perhaps even inappropriate, said Ruth Glenn, executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. "I wouldn’t say twice as likely," said Glenn. "So I would say that it is an additional risk factor. I get nervous when we start to assign data, because there’s not enough data to support it. Domestic violence happens in families, and each of those families are individual units." In other words, there’s enough out there to suggest that children who witness domestic violence are more likely to perpetrate it, but saying something as precise as "twice as likely" is difficult. Domestic violence is "hard to measure for various and sundry reasons," said Glenn, from the lack of "good data" on who’s charged and convicted of domestic violence to confidentiality issues with its victims. And even when researchers can get affirmative data, there are methodological concerns. The studies about children who witness domestic violence often surveyed clinical populations -- meaning those with family issues, so a non-representative sample -- and ask respondents to self-report and to retroactively report. Extricating domestic violence from other family issues -- like mental health and substance abuse -- is also difficult, according to the studies Campbell referred us to. Our ruling Klobuchar, arguing that the NFL has a responsibility to hold its "role models" accountable to a "different culture," said that kids who witness domestic violence in their households are "twice as likely to commit it themselves." There are legitimate, peer-reviewed studies that bear Klobuchar’s claim out. But overall, even though there’s a consensus that witnessing domestic violence puts kids at a greater risk for perpetrating it themselves, the precise figures differ.

pomt-01437	On support for the auto bailouts.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/06/terri-lynn-land/michigan-republican-senate-candidate-now-says-she-/	The federal government bailout of the auto industry was a contentious and frequent debate topic in the 2012 presidential election. But in the 2014 midterms, the issue has largely gone away — except in Michigan, the heart of the American automobile industry, where there’s a heated race for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat. Rep. Gary Peters, D-Mich., has repeatedly trumpeted to voters his support of the 2009 bailout plan for General Motors and Chrysler. Late last month, the Peters campaign claimed to catch their opponent, former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land, flip-flopping on her bailout position. "Yesterday, Land tried to rewrite history and claim she supports the auto rescue, but that’s a tough feat when news reports have chronicled her opposition," Peters spokeswoman Haley Morris said in a press release. The flip in question? On Sept. 25, responding to Peters’ comment on the campaign trail that Land opposed the bailout, Land spokeswoman Heather Swift said, "Once again Gary Peters has it wrong: Terri would have supported the auto rescue." Who is right? We decided to review the evidence. First, a quick refresher on the auto bailout: In 2008 during the economic crisis, President George W. Bush announced plans to bail out the auto industry. General Motors and Chrysler Group received $13.4 million in short-term relief in the final days of the Bush administration to keep them afloat until President Barack Obama’s new team could develop a long-term plan. The Ford Motor Company declined government assistance. In 2009, Obama said if Chrysler and GM wanted more federal money, they had to go through bankruptcy. They quickly agreed. GM received $30 million to restructure the company while Chrysler was sold to Italy’s Fiat. In all, the two companies received about $80 billion in loans, according to a 2010 Treasury report. Today, both companies are relatively healthy and touted as success stories, especially compared to where they were in 2008. We didn’t find many comments from Land about the bailout in 2009. The only statement we came across was from February 2009, when Land, then secretary of state, was exploring a gubernatorial bid. "We will have to work with (GM and Chrysler) and see how we can get them back to sustainability," Land said, according to the Grand Rapid Press. She didn’t say how nor whether she supported government financing to do so. Her campaign did not provide any other comments she made at the time. At the Republican National Convention in 2012, Land spoke with the Washington Times, a conservative news outlet, and was asked whether Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney could compete in Michigan despite the fact he "came out hard against the GM bailout" or whether that statement turned out to be a positive for him in Motor City. A video of the conversation was provided to PolitiFact by the Peters campaign. Here’s how Land responded: I’m with (Romney) on that. Because, actually Bill Ford — we live with the autos. Michigan is a very unique state. No state has one industry that’s so prominent and that’s global. It’s not a Michigan industry, it’s global. And what basically happened is Bill Ford went and got a loan. I mean, he did it that way. And so people know that that could have been done. GM has become, they call it General Government basically, it’s become this huge operation with really nobody that has the commitment like Bill Ford has with his family and his legacy of making sure that company is successful. And that’s what it’s kind of become. They call it Government Motors. That’s what they call it. That’s the reality of it. I think that was the position to have and, you know, Ford is doing great. Fast forward to this year: After a candidate forum in May, Land shirked multiple questions about whether she supported the bailout. A local Fox reporter, though, tracked her down and asked her how she would have voted if she was in Congress, and she said, "If I had been there as a U.S. senator, I would have worked to negotiate a deal that looked more like what Ford Company did." Land repeated that idea on a Detroit radio station the next day, saying, "I would have worked with the other senators to come up with a plan that would protect the taxpayers, make sure that jobs were kept here in Michigan, and did a plan more along the lines what Ford did." There’s several takeaways from this all that underscore a distinct change in position on Land's part. First, she says "I’m with (Romney) on that." "That," according to the question, is Romney’s position to come out "hard against the GM bailout." His actual position was a little more nuanced than that (though Land didn’t disagree with the questioner’s characterization). Romney in 2008 penned an op-ed for the New York Times about the state of the auto industry controversially titled (by the Times, not him) "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt." He called for a managed bankruptcy of the auto companies and called for the federal government to "provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk," and he continued to argue those positions during the 2012 campaign. While GM and Chrysler did go through bankruptcies, they came out of it because of taxpayer financing. Romney’s plan would have required massive amounts of private capital that would have been tough to find during a financial crisis. Swift, the spokeswoman for Land’s campaign, said Land "did not call GM ‘Government Motors,’ she was describing the situation and telling the panel what she heard from others call it." The most literal of readings would find that accurate, but she didn’t dispute it and went on to describe the company negatively as "this huge operation with really nobody that has the commitment like Bill Ford has." This year, she said she would have supported a plan that would "protect the taxpayers" and "more along the lines what Ford did." Both the Romney plan and the Ford model are vastly different than what ultimately made its way through Congress. Ford's plan didn't even require government intervention. Swift also said the "comment (Land) made in 2012 was referring to the process" of deciding which course of action would be best, and was not opposing the bailout; rather, "she favored a different approach in the beginning." We asked for clarification by what Swift meant by "process" but didn’t hear back. It’s a confusing assertion to make since the remark came three years after the bailout took place. The process of deciding the plan of action was already complete, so we don’t understand why she would have been talking about the process. Our ruling Did Land change positions on a rescue package for the auto industry? If there’s any evidence Land supported the bailout until recently, we didn’t find it, and Land’s campaign didn’t provide it. On the campaign trail so far, she has mostly avoided a direct answer to the question. Her campaign recently said she supported it. In 2012, she said she supported Romney’s plan, which would have required private financing — not government money — to get the auto companies out of bankruptcy, and held up Ford, which rejected any government money, as a model. Her comments, read in full, are critical of how things played out. Earlier this year, she said she would have pushed for something "more along the lines what Ford did," which is even further from the auto bailout than what Romney supported. But on Sept. 25, her campaign said she "would have supported the auto rescue." That’s a distinct change of position, so we rate it Full Flop.

pomt-06195	In 1993, Newt Gingrich "first advocated for the individual mandate in health care. And as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating" for it.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/11/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-newt-gingrich-backed-individ/	During a Republican presidential debate on Dec. 10, 2011, in Des Moines, Iowa, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., took aim at one of her rivals, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, for his past support for an individual mandate for health insurance -- the government requirement for individuals to buy health insurance. It’s a central provision at issue in the legal challenges to President Barack Obama’s health care law. In 1993, Bachmann said, Gingrich "first advocated for the individual mandate in health care. And as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating for the individual mandate in health care." Readers asked us to check the claim, so we did. Gingrich appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on Oct. 3, 1993, at a time when the Clinton administration was trying to pass a health-care overhaul. On the May 15, 2011, edition of Meet the Press, host David Gregory replayed a clip from Gingrich’s 1993 appearance that addressed the individual mandate. "I am for people, individuals -- exactly like automobile insurance -- individuals having health insurance and being required to have health insurance. And I am prepared to vote for a voucher system which will give individuals, on a sliding scale, a government subsidy so we insure that everyone as individuals have health insurance." That seems pretty clear, but we wanted to locate further context to make sure. We couldn’t locate the full transcript, but we did find a partial transcript excerpted in a Washington Times report: Q: Do you support compulsory national health care? A: Not at all. ... (The president's plan) is a monstrosity. I mean, after all the nice speeches, after all the nice testimony, the fact is, when you read the president's plan, it has got to be the most destructively big-government plan ever proposed. … That's how he gets the money -- by coercing change in order to pay for his plan. Without coercion, this plan collapses, and with coercion, it, frankly, is a remarkable bill to be offered to an American nation. Q: Are you for compulsory automobile insurance? A: I would like to see us go much closer to (Texas Republican Sen.) Phil Gramm's model. I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that. I'd much rather do it through an individual voucher, much like an earned-income tax credit, rather than do it through an employer mandate that will kill jobs. But that's not the issue here. You can pass a requirement, and you can find a way to give what is actually less than 8 percent of the American people health insurance without having to go to the total overhaul of American health care, turning it all into a giant bureaucratic mess with a centralized board in Washington appointed by politicians. The full context makes Gingrich seem somewhat more flexible about the details, but ultimately he did say, "I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that." What about the claim that Gingrich was advocating for the individual mandate as recently as May 2011 -- a point well after virtually all mainstream Republicans had come out against such a requirement? Here, too, the venue was Meet the Press, the May 15, 2011 edition. After Gregory played the 1993 clip, here’s the conversation: Gregory: "What you advocate there is precisely what President Obama did with his health care legislation, is it not?" Ginrgich: "No, it's not precisely what he did. In, in the first place, Obama basically is trying to replace the entire insurance system, creating state exchanges, building a Washington - based model, creating a federal system. I believe all of us -- and this is going to be a big debate -- I believe all of us have a responsibility to help pay for health care . I think the idea that..." Gregory: "You agree with Mitt Romney on this point." Gingrich: "Well, I agree that all of us have a responsibility to pay -- help pay for health care . And, and I think that there are ways to do it that make most libertarians relatively happy. I've said consistently we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond...." Gregory: "Mm-hmm." Gingrich: "...or in some way you indicate you’ll be held accountable." Gregory: "But that is the individual mandate, is it not?" Gingrich: "It's a variation on it." Gregory: "OK." Gingrich: "But it's a system …" Gregory: "And so you won't use that issue against Mitt Romney." Gingrich: "No. But it's a system which allows people to have a range of choices which are designed by the economy. But I think setting the precedent -- you know, there are an amazing number of people who think that they ought to be given health care. And, and so a large number of the uninsured earn $75,000 or more a year, don't buy any health insurance because they want to buy a second house or a better car or go on vacation. And then you and I and everybody else ends up picking up for them. I don't think having a free rider system in health is any more appropriate than having a free rider system in any other part of our society." This exchange became so controversial in Republican circles that Gingrich felt the need to personally walk back his comment the following day. "I am completely opposed to the Obamacare mandate on individuals," he said in a video. "I fought it for two and half years at the Center for Health Transformation. You can see all the things we did to stop it at HealthTransformation.net. I am for the repeal of Obamacare and I am against any effort to impose a federal mandate on anyone because it is fundamentally wrong and I believe unconstitutional." We understand Gingrich’s desire to restate his opposition to the individual mandate, given how deeply opposed Republican voters are to the idea. But was what Gingrich said in the 2011 Meet the Press interview really "advocating for the individual mandate in health care," as Bachmann said in the Des Moines debate? Not quite. Gingrich calls it a "variation" on the individual mandate -- the idea that people take responsibility for their health care, either by purchasing health insurance or by posting a bond to pay for any health care they may eventually need. It’s not the first time Gingrich advocated a choice between a mandate and a bond. For instance, in a June 25, 2007, column titled, "Covering the uninsured -- do we want markets or mandates?" Gingrich wrote, "In order to make coverage more accessible, Congress must do more, including passing legislation to … require anyone who earns more than $50,000 a year to purchase health insurance or post a bond." Working out the details of a bond system -- such as how much would need to be set aside and how -- poses challenges. But it’s conceivable that the legal challenges to Obama’s health care law, which are based on the notion that the government cannot compel Americans to buy a commercial product, might be less likely to succeed if the law had offered the bond option. "A bond alternative was part of the Heritage Foundation's plan and was actually originally in Romney's proposal in Massachusetts but was taken out by legislature late in game," said Michael Tanner, a health policy specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute. "It is a modest improvement over a straight mandate since it doesn't require you to buy a specific product, but libertarians like me still found it objectionable." Still, in our view, the fact that Gingrich supported the bond idea in the 2011 Meet the Press interview muddies the waters enough to weaken the argument Bachmann made -- that "as recently as May of this year, he was still advocating for the individual mandate in health care." Our ruling In the 1993 interview, Gingrich advocated for individuals "being required to have health insurance," though he expressed flexibility on the details. That makes the first half of Bachmann’s claim correct. In the 2011 interview, Gingrich said "we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond." It’s an exaggeration to say that this equates to advocating for an individual mandate, since he posed it as one of two acceptable options. On balance, we rate Bachmann’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-02248	Obamacare is "costing 2 million jobs."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/13/laura-ingraham/ingraham-obamacare-costing-2-million-jobs/	The Sunday morning TV pundits revived some passionate talking points about the health care law following this week’s resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Look to the partisan bickering between Democratic strategist James Carville and conservative radio host Laura Ingraham on ABC’s This Week to see what we mean. Carville said Sebelius’ departure doesn’t change the fact that the law is working. "You know what? Y’all said it was gonna collapse. You said no one would sign up. You said it was going to cost part-time jobs -- " "It’s costing 2 million jobs," Ingraham jumped in, attributing the figure to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Carville kept talking: "You said the risk corridors were going to go broke. None of that has happened. Get over it. It’s working. It’s gonna work." PunditFact checks out Carville’s point on risk corridors here. In this fact-check, we focused on Ingraham’s point about a CBO report that analyzed the health care law’s long-term effect on employment. Fact-checkers have heard Obamacare critics misrepresent the report many, many times. When the CBO released this report in February, House Speaker John Boehner and Fox News host Gretchen Carlson jumped out in front with some poor interpretations of this paragraph from CBO: "The reduction in CBO's projections of hours worked represents a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024," the nonpartisan research service wrote. At first blush, that may seem to match what Ingraham said about the law "costing 2 million jobs." But the losses CBO projected aren’t exactly full-time jobs, and they aren’t driven by employers laying off employees. Essentially, some workers are expected to voluntarily dial back their hours. Or as the CBO put it: "The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers choose to supply, rather than from a net drop in businesses’ demand for labor." It’s an important distinction. CBO estimated that millions of Americans will probably decide they don’t need to work as much because the law makes health insurance more available by offering subsidies for some to obtain insurance and expanding Medicaid eligibility in some states. CBO found the tax penalties imposed on employers that do not provide insurance to their workers and new taxes on labor income would have a smaller effect on the labor market than the Medicaid expansion and exchange subsidies. Just as important, CBO’s 2 million "full-time-equivalent workers" figure is not a dressed-up word for 2 million full-time jobs. CBO did not break down how many full-time jobs would be reduced under the law versus employees simply working fewer hours, dropping a separate part-time job, or leaving the workforce. "Because some people will reduce the amount of hours they work rather than stopping work altogether, the number who will choose to leave employment because of the ACA in 2024 is likely to be substantially less than 2.5 million," the report states. "At the same time, more than 2.5 million people are likely to reduce the amount of labor they choose to supply to some degree because of the ACA, even though many of them will not leave the labor force entirely." None of this is to say the health care law is not affecting the job market. Analysts expect the country’s labor force participation rate to fall over the coming decade, and some people may not like the idea that people would work fewer hours because they can obtain government-subsidized insurance. "Bigger implicit and explicit tax distortions are reducing productive economic activity," Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley, told us in February. Lastly, researchers said the law’s biggest effects on employment would happen after 2016, when more provisions have taken effect, so the estimate is not a present-day reflection as Ingraham makes it sound. CBO researchers also note total employment and compensation will increase over the next decade, but "that increase will be smaller than it would have been in the absence of the ACA." Our ruling We are fact-checkers, not fortune-tellers. We’ll steer clear of declaring the health care law a success or failure. For one, it’s simply too soon to tell. It is possible to say, however, whether pundits are accurately summarizing projections from nonpartisan government analysts about the law. And when Ingraham cited CBO for her claim that the law "is costing 2 million jobs," she glazed over a swath of important details. Ingraham’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. (Update April 15: Ingraham responded to our ruling on her April 14, radio show, saying: "The economy is affected when fewer people work. This is a real effect on the real American economy. So you can argue about how you interpret the number of jobs lost. You can say that's a good thing. ... Democrats love when people aren't working. ...That does not change the underlying fact that jobs will be lost because of Obamacare. PolitiFact and the Democrats think it's a good idea to add to those terrible (jobs) numbers with more people not working. And you're going to fact-check me? Fact-check this. Fact-check yourself. You are so untethered to reality and the real world for most people. Go finger paint in your free time.")	None	Laura Ingraham	None	None	None	2014-04-13T14:38:10	2014-04-13	['None']
pomt-15264	"The law says ... when a police officer stops you, do whatever he says and then deal with it later."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/30/harry-houck/former-nypd-detective-sandra-blands-traffic-stop-l/	Dashboard camera footage of the traffic stop of Sandra Bland spurred contentious, if not always accurate, cable news debate about a person’s rights when dealing with law enforcement. Bland, a 28-year-old woman from Chicago, was found dead in her jail cell three days after Texas state trooper Brian Encinia stopped her for failing to signal when changing lanes (she was ultimately charged with resisting arrest). Questions still surround her death, which officials called a suicide. But the video gives Americans a clearer look at the explosive start of the arrest that put her behind bars to begin with. The director of the Texas Department of Public Safety criticized Encinia’s actions, saying that the trooper violated arrest procedure. But some people are also questioning Bland’s behavior, including her refusal to put out her cigarette at Encinia’s request. Don Lemon led a CNN Tonight panel on July 21 about the ordeal with legal analyst Sunny Hostin, liberal pundit Marc Lamont Hill and retired New York Police Department detective Harry Houck. Most of the panel agreed with Hostin’s advice for dealing with law enforcement: Essentially, make the encounter as short as possible by obeying orders and dealing with legal issues or mistreatment later. Lemon then asked Houck to clarify the legal rights that people actually have during a police stop — and that’s where the discussion got murky. Lemon asked if all the attention on this encounter and others around the country "is giving people a false sense of rights that they have, that they really don’t have?" Yes, Houck responded. "People actually think, that I've talked to, saying that, no, if a police officer stopped me for something, I don't think he's stopping me for a right reason, but I don't have to cooperate with the officer. But that is wrong," he said. Houck continued: "The law says, just like you said, Don, that when a police officer stops you, do whatever he says and then deal with it later." Read literally, Houck’s statement seems to give law enforcement a lot of leeway during stops. Are civilians really required to obey their each and every order? The video Before we dive into the legal issues underlying Bland’s arrest, let’s review what the video shows. Encinia pulls Bland over for a failure to signal as she changed lanes. Encinia retrieves Bland’s driver’s license and insurance and heads back to his car. After four and a half minutes, Encinia returns to issue a ticket to Bland. At the window, he asks her if she’s okay. "I’m waiting on you, this is your job," she says. "You seem very irritated," he tells her. "I really am," Bland replies, explaining why she’s unhappy that she was pulled over. Encinia asks if she’s done speaking, then asks her to put out her cigarette. Bland refuses, saying that she’s free to smoke a cigarette in her own car. Encinia then directs her out of the car, calling it a "lawful order." When she doesn’t move, he opens the door and forcibly removes her, pointing a Taser in her direction and threatening to "light her up." After Bland exits the car, Encinia issues a number of orders, including for her to put her phone down, to "come over here," to "stand right here," and to "turn around." The confrontation becomes physical shortly afterwards, before Encinia puts Bland in the back of his squad car. The panelists were divided on the issue of whether Bland escalated the situation by claiming rights she did not have when she refused Encinia’s order to put out her cigarette. Experts we consulted said Bland had the right to act the way she did, but Encinia may have, too. Here’s why. Pleading the Fifth (and the Fourth) Does the law really say you have to do whatever a police officer says during a traffic stop? Literally, no. The Constitution affords a few fundamental rights to everyone stopped or arrested by law enforcement in the United States. The right to refuse a search of one’s person, car or home is guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, and the right to remain silent is protected by the Fifth. No matter how much information Encinia wanted to get out of Bland, she was not legally obliged to provide it. "You definitely don’t have to answer questions," said Robert Weisberg, a Stanford University law professor who specializes in criminal justice and procedure. So Houck’s statement doesn’t hold up under constitutional scrutiny. When reached for comment, Houck said his comments were being taken too literally, adding he only meant that civilians were obligated to comply with orders "within reason." "Anybody with common sense knows what I said," he said. Houck told PunditFact that he had been focusing primarily on the legality of Encinia’s order for Bland to exit her car, a point he brings up early on in the panel discussion but doesn’t stress throughout. In the interview, he brought up Pennsylvania vs. Mimms, a Supreme Court case from 1977 in which two implicated law enforcement officers were found not to have violated the Fourth Amendment when directing a man to exit his car upon stopping him for a traffic violation. He argued that the precedent established in Mimms applies to Bland’s arrest as well. Reasonable suspicion Houck does have a point that officers have a considerable amount of authority over a person during a traffic stop. In Mimms, after directing a man out of his car, officers noticed a bulge under the man’s jacket. The bulge turned out to be a loaded gun, and the man was then arrested. The court ruled that exiting one’s car for the duration of a stop did not violate a person's Fourth Amendment rights. So Encinia, using Mimms as jurisprudence, had the right to direct Bland out of her car, even if he had no reason to suspect that she was armed or dangerous. Some have argued, however, that because the "legal stop" was finished by the time Encinia directed Bland out the car, he did not have the right to continue the interaction. But the broader point that Houck misses in his explanation is that much of an officer’s authority to search or use force or a person is permissible only if they have reason to suspect that the person is armed or dangerous, or has committed a crime. What exactly constitutes "reasonable suspicion" is still up for for debate. Weisberg emphasized how gray this area of law still is. A non-answer, for example, can often be interpreted by law enforcement as "furtive behavior," thus authorizing many options an officer might not have otherwise had, including searching, moving, or using force on a subject, Weisberg said. Making these judgment calls is where officers have the most leeway, said Jason Williamson, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who recently wrote a Bland-inspired article for Time entitled "What to Do if You Get Pulled Over by a Cop." "It’s certainly true that cops are given discretion and the benefit of the doubt," Williamson said. In order for Encinia to argue that he was suspicious of Bland, he would have to point to her refusal to put out her cigarette as an indication of violent intentions, said Jody David Armour, a University of Southern California law professor. "That is a judgment of intent," he said, "and a judgment of character." Our ruling Houck claimed that "the law says … that when a police officer stops you, do whatever he says" during a stop. Reasonable suspicion justifies an officer’s increased authority during a stop or an arrest, though the definition of "reasonable" is often unclear. Applied generally, however, the claim is incorrect. Even though it might be advisable to defer to law enforcement in many cases, the Constitution protects one’s right to remain silent and to not consent to a search. Without suspicion that the subject is armed or has committed a crime, an officer must respect these rights. That's what the law says. We rate Houck's claim False. Correction: This item was updated on July 31 to correct the sequence of events in describing Pennsylvania vs. Mimms. In that case, the Supreme Court found that the act of ordering a person out of a car for the duration of a stop, even in the absence of reasonable suspicion, is constitutional.

pomt-09433	The Obama administration "spent more money on the Cash for Clunkers program than the space program."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/12/marco-rubio/rubio-criticizes-space-budget/	NASA's budget has been a hot topic among Florida politicians since the Obama administration's recent announcement that it plans to kill the NASA Constellation program, which sought to put astronauts back on the moon. Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio jumped on the bandwagon and spoke against Obama's plan during a meeting of the Brevard County Republican Club in February, according to an article in Florida Today on Feb. 8, 2010: The article said that Rubio "criticized the Obama administration for discontinuing manned space flight in favor of more innovative technological advances, ignoring that Obama also proposed an increase in NASA's budget over the next several years." Rubio was quoted saying, "They spent more money on the Cash for Clunkers program than the space program." That article and another one in Politico that used the same quote, had some context before Rubio's quote about the proposed cuts in the Constellation program. The Florida Today article mentioned Obama's plan to discontinue manned space flight. Politico quoted Rubio's primary opponent, Gov. Charlie Crist, stating: "Unless we continue the Constellation Program that allows America to be a leader in space innovation and provides jobs for many Floridians on the Space Coast, this discussion will leave many of the same problems unresolved." Both articles also noted that overall, Obama proposed an increase in NASA funding. When we asked Rubio's campaign about the quote, spokesman Alberto Martinez told us that Rubio was referring to the Constellation program -- not NASA's overall budget. "Marco has used that line several times, and what he is specifically referring to is President Obama's decision to scrap the Constellation Program," Martinez wrote to us in an e-mail. Before we wade into the question of whether Rubio's context was clear, here's how the numbers compare: * Cash for Clunkers was a $3 billion program, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. * NASA's overall budget this year is $18.7 billion, proposed to rise to $19 billion next year. * NASA's Exploration program, which includes the Constellation initiative, was about $3.8 billion this year. The cost would be $2.5 billion to phase out the Constellation program over two years and then it would drop to zero. So Rubio would be right if the comparison is Constellation ($3 billion for Cash for Clunkers versus $2.5 billion to phase the Constellation effort), but he'd be wrong if it's the NASA space program overall (the $3 billion for Clunkers versus roughly $19 billion for NASA). Now, to the question of Rubio's context. Martinez told us he was referring specifically to Constellation. "The point Marco was making is that this president has shown he is willing to spend more money in programs like 'Cash for Clunkers' than he is willing to spend on pursuing the next phase of a planned manned-space flight program. Marco made his remarks before an audience on the Space Coast which is informed about this issue. They know the only manned space flight program was the Constellation Program." That made us wonder what the audience thought, so we called two Republicans who attended the meeting and asked them what they believed he was referring to. But neither specifically recalled the statement. So to recap: Rubio would be correct if indeed he was suggesting that the U.S. spent more on Cash for Clunkers -- $3 billion -- than the Obama administration would spend on Constellation. But by referring to it as the "space program," his comment was so vague that it sounds more like he's referring to the entire NASA budget. And the Florida Today article helps to back that up by noting that he ignored the fact that Obama was proposing an increase in NASA's overall spending. The Rubio campaign says his context was clear to the audience, but we think his wording most likely is interpreted to mean the entire NASA budget. So we find the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10254	(McCain) says "we can't have ... timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/27/joe-biden/mccain-has-often-opposed-timelines-but-not-always/	In his Aug. 27, 2008, speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Sen. Joe Biden characterized Sen. John McCain's position on timelines for withdrawal from Iraq as an unequivocal "no." Here's the full context of Biden's claim: "Should we trust John McCain's judgment when he says — when he says we can't have ... timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq, that we must stay indefinitely?" Biden said. "Or should we listen to Barack Obama, who says shift the responsibility to the Iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home? Now, after six long years, the administration and the Iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home. John McCain was wrong, and Barack Obama was right." But does McCain really say "there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq"? It is true that on many occasions McCain has vociferously opposed the idea of setting a timetable — or a timeline (we believe the words are interchangeable) — for withdrawal from Iraq. During the Republican primary contest, McCain harshly criticized Mitt Romney's use of the term "timetable," saying it was "the buzzword for withdrawal." For days he carried around a note card with Romney's words to remind primary voters of Romney's endorsement of a timetable. However, it is also true that more recently McCain has adjusted his rhetoric. In a July speech, McCain said: "I'm confident we will be able to reduce our forces in Iraq next year and our forces will be out of regular combat operations and dramatically reduced in number during the term of the next president of the United States." And on other more recent occasions, when criticizing timelines, he has been careful to characterize them first. Here's McCain on Aug. 18: "The hard-won gains of our troops hang in the balance. The lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the Middle East could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines." Note the insertion of the word "arbitrary." On other occasions McCain has criticized "artificial" timelines. But that does not mean he is opposed to any timelines at all. Rather, that language implies that if a timeline were not "arbitrary" or "artificial," McCain could support it. Indeed, here's McCain in a CNN interview on July 25, when asked about Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's endorsement of a timetable: "He said it's a pretty good timetable based on conditions on the ground," McCain said. "I think it's a pretty good timetable, as we should — or horizons for withdrawal — but they have to be based on conditions on the ground." That wasn't the clearest statement in the world. So ABC's George Stephanopoulos pressed McCain on the issue on This Week two days later: STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Obama was in London this morning, and he was responding to your comments from yesterday when you said that 16 months might be a pretty good timetable in Iraq. He said, 'We're pleased to see that there's been some convergence around proposals we've been making for a year-and-a-half.' MCCAIN: That's really good. Look, it's not a timetable, as I said. I was asked, how does that sound? Anything sounds good to me, but… STEPHANOPOULOS: But you never used the word before. MCCAIN: … you know, the point is… STEPHANOPOULOS: You made a point of never using… MCCAIN: … I never… STEPHANOPOULOS: … the word before. MCCAIN: Look, I have always said, and I said then, it's the conditions on the ground. If Senator Obama had had his way, we'd have been out last March, and we'd been out in defeat and chaos, and probably had to come back again because of Iranian influence... STEPHANOPOULOS: But it does seem… MCCAIN: But it is a — it is not a date. I want to make it very clear to you, it is not a date. It's conditions on the ground. STEPHANOPOULOS: So, you shouldn't have used the word timetable. MCCAIN: Pardon me? STEPHANOPOULOS: You shouldn't have used the word timetable. MCCAIN: I didn't use the word timetable. That I did — if I did… STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, it's a pretty good timetable. MCCAIN: Oh, well, look. Anything is a good timetable that is dictated by conditions on the ground. Anything is good. But the timetable is dictated, not by an artificial date, but by the conditions on the ground, the conditions of security. McCain clearly was not comfortable embracing the idea of a timetable for withdrawal. But nor was he comfortable opposing it in all cases. His answers in both the CNN and ABC interviews suggest that he could be okay with a timetable if it were dependent on conditions on the ground. Biden did not acknowledge the gray area in McCain's approach to a timeline, instead implying that McCain was unequivocally opposed to any timeline at all. Since McCain has spoken out repeatedly against timelines — but indicated he was open to them on other occasions — we find Biden's claim to be Half True.

pomt-09821	"Scientists project that the Arctic will be ice-free in the summer of 2013."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/02/john-kerry/kerry-claims-arctic-will-be-ice-free-2013/	Sen. John Kerry says climate change is happening faster than we think. In an Aug. 31, 2009, op-ed in the Huffington Post, the Massachusetts Democrat wrote that the threat of climate change "is not an abstract concern for the future." "It is already upon us and its effects are being felt worldwide, right now," he wrote. "Scientists project that the Arctic will be ice-free in the summer of 2013. Not in 2050, but four years from now. Make no mistake: catastrophic climate change represents a threat to human security, global stability, and — yes — even to American national security." We don't debate that the effects of climate change are already being felt. However, Kerry's claim that the Arctic will be ice-free in as little as five years is ominous and worth putting to the Truth-O-Meter. Arctic ice has long been considered a canary in a coal mine for climate scientists; they watch it closely because significant melts indicate an acceleration of climate change effects. In fact, temperatures actually rise faster in icy regions because of something known as ice albedo feedback loop. Ice is more reflective than land or water. When ice melts, the reflectivity of the Earth's surface decreases as well, and more solar radiation is absorbed by the land and the oceans. So, as ice melts, more and more heat from the sun is absorbed, accelerating the warming process. Melting has recently become a more serious problem, and 2007 was a particularly bad year for the Arctic. Then, about 552 billion tons of ice melted from Greenland's ice sheet during the summer — about 15 percent more than the summer average. The summer of 2009 didn't look much better. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, the average rate of melt in July of this year is nearly identical to that of July 2007, in part due to unusual weather patterns and an underlying trend toward higher temperatures. But does this mean ice will be completely gone in the next few years? We talked to Julienne Stroeve, a researcher for the NSIDC, for some perspective. Climate scientists "agree that we'll lose summer ice cover," she said. "As to the exact date, it varies between groups." The summer ice cover is what's left of the sea ice after the annual seasonal melting. It refreezes when temperatures drop. Indeed, predictions are all over the map. Kerry got his data from Wieslaw Maslowski, a researcher from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., who as early as 2007 predicted the Arctic would be ice-free by the summer of 2013. Similar projections have been trumpeted by a handful of other scientists, including Warwick Vincent, director of the Center for Northern Studies at Laval University in Quebec and NASA climate scientist Jay Zwally. (A Kerry spokeswoman directed us to this 2007 article about Maslowski's work.) Meanwhile, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group relying on the consensus of hundreds of climate scientists, estimated in 2007 that summer ice would largely be gone in the latter part of the 21st century; and Stroeve said NSIDC supports a prediction of 2030. NASA climate researcher Gavin Schmidt wrote in an e-mail to us that Maslowski's prediction isn't necessarily a communitywide opinion. "A fair statement would be that some scientists have predicted summer ice free Arctic Ocean as soon as 2013, but others expect it to happen a little slower — say 2040-2060," Schmidt wrote. Differences occur when research focuses on the area of the Arctic — based on aerial satellite photographs — or on thickness and volume of the ice as well as area, according to Maslowski. In both cases, scientists have seen melting, Maslowski said. However, when estimates are based on the latter method, as Maslowski and his team of researchers have done, melting seems to be happening much faster. "There is no crystal ball, there is no final prediction, just estimates," Maslowski said. "All we are trying to show is that we better start thinking [ice-free summers] could start earlier than 2100 or 2030. We should be prepared for the worst-case scenario." Kerry's claim also leaves out an important nuance; as Stroeve said, most climate scientists agree that summer ice is likely to disappear at some point, but that the oceans will still freeze in the winter for a very long time. However, Kerry's op-ed could make it sound as if the Arctic will devoid of ice all year long. As always with the climate change debate, we've found that there's a wide range of informed opinion on the issue of Arctic melting. In a general sense, Kerry is correct that Arctic ice is melting at a quickening rate. However, he has based his prediction on the earliest and most extreme estimate, when a much wider range of estimates are available and most project the turning point will occur decades from now. And he makes it seem as if the Arctic will be totally ice-free within a few short years when in fact that would only be true for the summer. As a result, we rate Kerry's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13600	"Because there's no local option to allow communities to ban, limit or restrict the location of pot shops, if Amendment 2 passes you can expect the seedy elements of the pot industry to move in right next door to your neighborhood, your church, your business and even your child's school."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/aug/16/vote-no-2/medical-marijuana-amendment-doesnt-restrict-dispen/	Local governments will be powerless to prevent medical marijuana dispensaries from sprouting up anywhere and everywhere should Amendment 2 pass this fall, opponents of the measure say. A pamphlet from Vote No On 2 mailed to voters in July warns that the constitutional amendment prevents any kinds of restrictions on the locations of marijuana-related businesses. The amendment would allow doctors to recommend medical marijuana for certain health conditions and patients to pick up the drug from dispensaries that sell it. "Because there's no local option to allow communities to ban, limit or restrict the location of pot shops, if Amendment 2 passes you can expect the seedy elements of the pot industry to move in right next door to your neighborhood, your church, your business and even your child's school," the pamphlet cautions. Vote No On 2 is a campaign run by the Drug Free Florida Committee, an anti-drug group started in 2014 by longtime GOP fundraiser Mel Sembler and his wife, Betty, with financial backing from casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. We wanted to know whether Amendment 2 prevented communities from their own bans on so-called "pot shops." The short answer is that the amendment does not have any provisions for local legislation — but that’s only because the state would eventually be deciding whether local jurisdictions could do that. Amendment 2 redux First, let’s recall that Amendment 2 hit the ballot first in 2014, but just missed the 60 percent of the vote needed to pass. The current version for the November 2016 ballot has the same name, but United for Care, the group behind the measure, has altered the language for November 2016 to clear up confusion about the prior proposal. The amendment now requires parental consent and doctor certification for minors and more clearly defines the medical conditions it covers: cancer, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, glaucoma, post-traumatic stress disorder, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis "or other debilitating medical conditions of the same kind or class as or comparable to those enumerated," with a doctor’s recommendation. That means that if a doctor recommends medical marijuana for a patient with one of these conditions, the patient (or a certified caregiver) will get a state-issued ID card. That card allows them to buy marijuana at a state-regulated dispensary. There are some things to keep in mind about the whole process. Doctors are only recommending cannabis, because it’s illegal under federal law to prescribe a Schedule I drug — meaning it’s considered highly addictive and has no known medical benefits. Doctors would risk losing their ability to practice medicine if they prescribe marijuana. Pharmacies also can’t legally distribute cannabis, making dispensaries necessary. Dispensary suspense The state has estimated there could be almost 2,000 medical marijuana dispensaries in Florida should Amendment 2 pass, though there may be far fewer than that in reality. The proposed amendment requires the Legislature and the health department to figure out all the details of implementing medical marijuana should the measure pass — including the number of dispensaries and where they’re allowed to be. Vote No on 2 spokeswoman Christina Johnson pointed out to us that Amendment 2 does not include any language about a local option, and therefore doesn’t guarantee the state will allow them. The group believes that if a community passes an ordinance, the issue will have to be settled in court due to the amendment’s wording, and a right to access will trump local law. But the amendment also doesn’t prevent the state from letting local jurisdictions create their own rules. While no one knows exactly what will happen, chances are good that there will be some leeway for local rules. Kate Bell, legislative counsel for the Marijuana Policy Project, said it wouldn’t be appropriate for an amendment to try to codify regulations into the state’s constitution. Instead, regulations would have to spell out specifics, such as setbacks from schools and how dispensaries must follow local zoning laws. If the state doesn’t make distinct rules about dispensaries, local zoning rules would likely apply. The examples from other laws vary, as all 25 medical marijuana states (plus the District of Columbia) differ in their regulations. In New York, a rule says dispensaries can’t be within 1,000 feet of a "school, church, synagogue or other place of worship." In Washington, D.C., a dense urban area, dispensaries and cultivation centers where marijuana is grown may be no closer than 300 feet of a "preschool, primary or secondary school, or recreation center." Ordinances could be shaped into de facto bans, but there is some precedent for local governments being prevented from prohibiting dispensaries entirely. Maryland regulations say a licensed dispensary "shall conform to all local zoning and planning requirements," but the state’s attorney general has said in an opinion that those rules can’t outright ban dispensaries. Arizona law says "cities, towns and counties may enact reasonable zoning regulations that limit the use of land for registered nonprofit medical marijuana dispensaries to specified areas," but court rulings have said those laws can’t make opening a dispensary practically impossible. Pennsylvania’s law, passed earlier this year, prevented local ordinances from completely banning dispensaries. Andrew Livingston, a policy analyst for national law firm Vicente Sederberg, which represents marijuana businesses, said Florida is fairly unique in trying to pass a constitutional amendment with the expectation of marijuana storefronts. Nevada and Colorado passed constitutional amendments, and both allow local dispensary bans. He said almost all states that used voter-approved initiatives — like California, Oregon and Alaska — made the decision before the idea of dispensaries became popular. Those states focused on allowing patients or caregiver to grow their own plants, not buy them through state-approved dispensaries. "There were no reasons to ban marijuana businesses because marijuana businesses were never mentioned in these earliest laws," Livingston said. There is no provision in the Florida amendment for patients to grow their own plants. As for Florida, we don’t have to wait to see whether towns or counties will create their own laws shunning medical marijuana. It’s already happening, in part because of a 2014 law allowing low-THC cannabis products for patients with muscle spasms, cancer, epilepsy and terminal illnesses. More than two dozen cities have regulated or completely banned medical marijuana sales. Boca Raton, for example, has a moratorium on medical marijuana dispensaries, cultivation, processing or distribution until city zoning rules are ironed out. Pasco County has banned any type of marijuana business. And while cannabis is still illegal in Plant City, the city commission passed an ordinance on Aug. 8 in anticipation of Amendment 2 winning at the polls. If federal law one day changes, medical marijuana dispensaries would be allowed, but they still have to be at least 500 feet from schools, churches, daycares, drug treatment centers, public parks and residential areas. Any dispensaries also would be confined to an area smaller than four acres in the city, next to a hospital and a fried chicken restaurant. Our ruling Vote No On 2 said, "Because there's no local option to allow communities to ban, limit or restrict the location of pot shops, if Amendment 2 passes you can expect the seedy elements of the pot industry to move in right next door to your neighborhood, your church, your business and even your child's school." While the statement is technically accurate about the amendment’s wording, it’s highly doubtful there will be a dispensary on every corner. If it passes, the state will be in charge of writing regulations, including whether and how local jurisdictions will be able to create their own zoning laws or ordinances. It’s impossible to say with certainty what Florida’s regulations on dispensaries would look like should the amendment pass, as regulations in other medical marijuana states vary. But local bans or restrictive laws on dispensaries are common in medical marijuana states. Fears about the precise locations of pot shops and local control are premature.

pomt-04484	Says under U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez’s watch the nation’s unemployment rate and debt doubled and the federal budget deficit quadrupled.	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/07/joseph-kyrillos/joe-kyrillos-pins-blame-robert-menendez-rising-nat/	Republican Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos started his pitch for the votes of New Jersey residents in November by tying national economic woes to his Democratic rival. In his opening remarks in a debate with Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez that aired on NJTV Thursday night, Kyrillos said the "American dream is in peril" and "we need to make a change." "Now if you think things are just fine, that things are okay here in New Jersey and across the land, well then you’ll choose my opponent again. But if you think that unemployment doubling — doubling — under his watch, the deficits quadrupling, our national debt doubling is unacceptable, then you’re going to make a change and you’ll choose me," said Kyrillos, a state senator from Monmouth County. Kyrillos, for the most part, accurately reflected the economic trends since Menendez took office as a U.S. Senator in January 2006. But Kyrillos runs into trouble because as one expert said it’s "beyond ridiculous" to pin those increases on one senator. Here’s how the three numbers -- unemployment, debt and deficit -- break down. The unemployment rate stood at 4.7 percent in January 2006, according to federal labor data. It climbed to a peak of 10 percent in October of 2009, but when Kyrillos made his statement the latest numbers showed the jobless rate was 8.1 percent. That’s less than double the 2006 rate. The unemployment rate dropped in September to 7.8 percent, according to data released Friday morning. As for the growth in the national debt and deficit, since 2006 the former nearly doubled and the latter quadrupled. The gross national debt includes money the government borrowed from outside investors and foreign countries, as well as money loaned from one governmental pocket, like the Social Security Trust fund to another, like the general fund. The gross debt was about $16.16 trillion on Thursday, up from $8.17 trillion on Jan. 18, 2006, the day Menendez was sworn into the U.S. Senate. That’s according to data from the U.S. Treasury Department. According to the Office of Management and Budget, the budget for fiscal year 2006 had a nearly $250 billion deficit, which is the difference between incoming revenue and outgoing expenses in a year. In 2009, the deficit hit a peak of about $1.4 trillion. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expects the fiscal year 2012 budget deficit to be about $1.1 trillion, more than quadruple the deficit in 2006. But how much, if at all, is Menendez responsible for those increases? "Placing responsibility for national economic developments on an individual Senator is beyond ridiculous," Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, said in an e-mail. We have addressed similar issues in previous fact-checks, noting that governors, presidents and legislators aren’t the sole catalyst behind broad economic trends. In his campaign kickoff speech in February, Kyrillos blamed Menendez for increased deficits during his tenure in the Senate. We noted in that fact-check that Menendez voted for some measures -- like the stimulus program -- that fueled more spending in 2009. But federal budget experts cited the recession as a major factor behind increased deficits, so Kyrillos’ statement was rated Half True. The same problems apply to Kyrillos’ statement in the debate. The numbers are mostly on target, but the recession played a critical role in driving up government costs and driving down employment. Menendez's campaign manager Mike Soliman called Kyrillos' statement "hypocritical" because of his support for policies, like the tax cuts passed by President George W. Bush, that contributed to the debt. Kyrillos’ campaign manager, Chapin Fay, stuck with the same refrain, saying in a statement, "Fact is, we are worse off since Bob Menendez took office." Our ruling Kyrillos said that under Menendez’s watch the nation’s unemployment rate and debt doubled and the federal budget deficit quadrupled. While Kyrillos’s arithmetic is mostly accurate in the time since Menendez joined the Senate, it’s wrong to assign full responsibility for national economic trends on one legislator. For that reason, we rate this claim Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Joseph Kyrillos	None	None	None	2012-10-07T07:30:00	2012-10-04	['United_States']
pomt-01031	"Documents released from the Soviet Union" show "the Soviet Union started treating" President Ronald Reagan more seriously after Reagan fired the air traffic controllers.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/28/scott-walker/scott-walker-records-show-soviets-treated-ronald-r/	As momentum builds for a possible 2016 presidential run, Gov. Scott Walker has spent more time speaking on foreign policy. One of his talking points: Leadership trumps experience when it comes to managing affairs overseas. Look at Ronald Reagan. That was Walker’s response Jan. 21, 2015 when he was asked on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" about the importance of foreign policy experience. First, the governor criticized the secretary of state record of Hillary Clinton, the leading potential Democratic candidate for 2016. Then he turned to Reagan, one of his political heroes, and one of the Republican president’s early acts in office -- the mass firing of most of the nation’s air traffic controllers. In August 1981, after contract talks between the federal government and the union for the controllers stalled, nearly 13,000 controllers walked off the job. Just seven months into his first term, Reagan called the strike illegal and demanded they return to work. When more than 11,000 didn't, Reagan fired them in what was an unprecedented action. In his MSNBC interview, Walker asserted that the move was one of the most important foreign policy decisions "made in our lifetime," showing allies and adversaries around the world "that we were serious." Then he added this: "Years later, documents released from the Soviet Union showed that that exactly was the case. The Soviet Union started treating (Reagan) more seriously once he did something like that. Ideas have to have consequences. And I think (President Barack Obama) has failed mainly because he's made threats and hasn't followed through on them." So, Walker goes beyond stating an opinion about the foreign policy implications of Reagan’s move. He states as fact that there are Soviet documents showing the Soviets treated the Reagan more seriously because he fired American air traffic controllers. That’s a bold claim. Walker's evidence When we asked for evidence to back the claim, both the governor's office and Walker's campaign cited statements from a variety of people. Each essentially said the firings showed Reagan meant what he said, and that he was to be taken seriously. Some examples: Reagan special assistant Peggy Noonan wrote in her White House memoir that George Shultz, who became Reagan's secretary state a year after the firings, had called the firings the most important foreign policy decision Reagan ever made. Joseph McCartin, the author of a book on the strike, wrote that when House Speaker Tip O’Neill, a Democrat, visited Moscow not long after the strike, "he learned that the Soviet leaders had been deeply impressed by Reagan’s actions." And Reagan biographer Edmund Morris wrote: "Former Soviet apparatchiks will tell you that it was not his famous 'evil empire' speech in 1983 that convinced them he meant strategic business, so much as photographs of the leader of the air traffic controllers union being taken to jail in 1981." Those are perceptions of Americans, however. Walker's claim was the Soviets treated Reagan more seriously after he fired the controllers, and that Soviet documents prove it. But he did not provide us anything referencing Soviet documents. And apparently there are no such documents that have been made public. Experts Five experts told us they had never heard of such documents. Several were incredulous at the notion. McCartin, a Georgetown University labor history expert who wrote the book about the strike that Walker cited, said: "I am not aware of any such documents. If they did exist, I would love to see them." Svetlana Savranskaya, director of Russia programs at the National Security Archive at George Washington University, told us she "had to listen to the Walker interview twice, so ridiculous is the statement about the air traffic controllers. There is absolutely no evidence of this. I would love to see the released Soviet documents on this subject that he has apparently seen." James Graham Wilson, a historian at the U.S. State Department, also told us he was not aware of any Soviet documents showing Moscow’s internal response to the controller firings. He speculated that there could be such records, given how some Soviet experts characterized the firings. Wilson and other authors have noted the perspective of Richard Pipes, professor emeritus of Russian studies at Harvard University. Pipes said the firings showed the Soviets that Reagan was "a man who, when aroused, will go to the limit to back up his principles." But even as the firings gained the attention of the Soviets, there were other U.S.-Soviet matters during 1981 that were also important. With his first budget, Reagan added $26 billion in defense spending, accelerating the placement of new tanks and warplanes, and he embarked on a modernization of the nation’s nuclear weapons. Reagan also wrote to Soviet leaders imploring them to alleviate Cold War tensions and negotiate arms reductions. In any case, the lack of Soviet records described by Walker is clear. Reagan's own ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jack Matlock, told us: "It's utter nonsense. There is no evidence of that whatever." Matlock questioned whether Soviet leaders even paid much attention to the firings, saying: "At that point, their big question was whether (Reagan) was going to attack them." Our rating Touching on foreign policy issues, Walker said: "Documents released from the Soviet Union" show "the Soviet Union started treating" Ronald Reagan more seriously after Reagan fired the air traffic controllers. There is a view, echoed by Walker, that the firings caught the Soviets’ attention. But Walker cited no Soviet documents showing that the firings made the Soviets treat Reagan more seriously. And experts, several of whom felt Walker’s claim is outrageous, told us they are not aware that any such documents exist. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-00468	"Hospitals are closing in rural America because they don't have access to high-speed internet."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/15/marsha-blackburn/blackburn-broadband-lack-closed-rural-hospitals-it/	At a gathering of the Tennessee Farm Bureau in Franklin, Tenn., Republican Senate nominee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, talked about things she would aim to reduce, such as EPA regulations, and things she would aim to build up, such as broadband internet. Blackburn said fast internet was important for education, and health care. "Hospitals are closing in rural America because they don't have access to high-speed internet," she said Aug. 8. We decided to see if lack of broadband was as pivotal to rural hospitals as Blackburn said. Key takeaways Nationwide, 87 rural hospitals have closed or stopped providing in-patient care since 2010. The leading reasons these hospitals close include: 1. They serve older, poorer, and sicker communities where higher percentages of patients are covered through public insurance programs; 2. They have too few patients to support the size of the facility; 3. Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements often don’t cover their costs. Access to high-speed internet would help, but researchers were unable to identify a hospital that closed due to lack of access. Why hospitals close The Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill tracks rural hospital closures. The center’s director and senior researcher told the Senate Finance Committee in May that the causes are complicated, but they did see some patterns. "Most closures and abandoned rural hospitals are in the South – 60 percent – where poverty rates are higher and people are generally less healthy and less likely to have health insurance, private or public," they said. They said in 2016, the average urban hospital had double the profit margin of the typical rural facility, about 5 percent compared to a bit over 2 percent. A profit margin that slender put hospitals at risk. Their testimony made no mention of high-speed internet. Shep Center research associate Kristie Thompson told us that "we have not identified broadband or any other single cause for the rural hospital closures." It’s not that broadband access wouldn’t help. It would. "Without it, a hospital can’t perform to its potential," said Maggie Elehwany, vice president for policy at the National Rural Health Association. "High-speed internet is definitely a factor in keeping a hospital in good condition. But you can’t say that the lack of it forced a hospital to close." The trade group NTCA-Rural Broadband Association estimated that telemedicine through better broadband could boost the bottom line of the average rural hospital in Tennessee by about $150,000 a year. That is a relatively modest amount. We looked at the eight rural hospitals that have closed in Tennessee since 2010. No press release or news article mentioned the lack of high-speed internet as a driving factor. More common was a declining demand or advances in treatment that left the centers unable to compete. And some reports mentioned federal Medicaid and Medicare payments. Elehwany told us a major issue is a slide in government reimbursements. She said after a wave of rural hospitals shut their doors in the 1980s and 1990s, Congress designated these facilities as critical access hospitals, or other types of rural facilities, and paid them more generously under Medicare. Some states used that designation to boost Medicaid payments as well. "Now, there’s been an erosion of payments to rural hospitals," Elehwany said. "Sequestration was particularly damaging." In an article in the Journal of Health Affairs, public health researchers at the University of Colorado reported that the Affordable Care Act appeared to play a role in rural hospital closure rates. States that expanded Medicaid saw the number of hospitals closing decrease drop steadily after 2014, while states that didn’t saw their closures first decline, and then rise. Overall, researchers said that Medicaid expansion was good for the hospitals’ bottom line. Tennessee did not expand Medicaid. Shep Center researchers said it is an open question whether Medicaid expansion alone lies behind these trends, but they noted that the disproportionate share of closures in the South overlaps with the states that were least likely to expand Medicaid. Abbi Sigler, spokeswoman for the Blackburn campaign told us that lack of access limits hospitals' ability to provide care. " If we don’t improve high speed internet access to rural hospital providers, they will continue to close at alarming rates," Sigler said. She gave no example of a hospital that closed because it didn't have high-speed internet. Our ruling Blackburn said that rural hospitals are closing because they don’t have access to high-speed internet. We could find no research to back that up. The country’s leading center for tracking rural hospital closures said it did not know of a case where lack of broadband caused a hospital to close. A broadband trade group estimated that better internet would help the typical rural hospital in Tennessee by about $150,000 a year. Researchers say that other factors play a much larger role, including a patient base that tends to need more care and has less ability to pay for it. We rate this claim False.

pomt-08925	Shirley Sherrod "was forced to resign before anybody on Fox said a word about this."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/26/stephen-hayes/stephen-hayes-defends-fox-handling-sherrod-story/	Washington and the nation were captivated a week ago by the controversy over Shirley Sherrod, a once-obscure U.S. Agriculture Department official who became a villain, and then a victim, over the course of 24 hours. Because the story began and ended so quickly, we were unable to fact-check it at the time, but here's a recap of what happened. Andrew Breitbart, a conservative provocateur, started things off July 19, 2010, when he posted a video on one of his websites, BigGovernment.com, that seemed to show Sherrod, who is black, telling an NAACP audience that she had discriminated against a white farmer. After conservative bloggers raised an outcry about Sherrod's apparent revelation, the NAACP moved to condemn Sherrod, and senior Agriculture Department officials quickly pressured Sherrod to resign. But within hours, it came out that the video had been selectively edited, and the uncut version made clear that Sherrod had actually been telling the story about the white farmer to explain how she had overcome her own prejudices. She ended up helping save the family's farm, and the farmer and his wife took to the airwaves to defend Sherrod. The Agriculture Department then reversed itself, with Secretary Tom Vilsack making a heartfelt apology and asking Sherrod to return to the department. Sherrod also received a personal call from President Barack Obama. This whirlwind of charges and counter-charges prompted a round of soul-searching by most of those involved in the episode, including those in government, advocacy groups, the blogosphere and the media. One question that quickly emerged was how culpable Fox News was. In the past, Fox news commentators have often beaten the drum on stories critical of Democrats, liberals and the Obama Administration, so to some who were sympathetic to Sherrod, Fox seemed like a plausible villain. They took as evidence a July 20, 2010, CNN interview with Sherrod, in which she explained how, while driving through Georgia, she was forced out by Cheryl Cook, the deputy undersecretary. When Cook called her cell phone, Sherrod recalled telling Cook, "'Cheryl, I've got a three-and-a-half-hour ride to get into Athens.' She called me a second time, (saying,) 'Where are you now?' I said, 'I'm just going through Atlanta.' She called me again and I said, 'I'm at least 45 minutes to an hour from Athens. She said, 'Well, Shirley, they want you to pull over to the side of the road and do it (formally resign), because you're going to be on Glenn Beck tonight.'" Beck, of course, is an outspoken conservative commentator with popular talk show on Fox. The question of Fox's role came up during the July 25, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week. Host Jake Tapper cited a commentary by Josh Marshall of the liberal website Talking Points Memo. "Breitbart got a piece of video he knew nothing about and published it with a central claim that he either made up or made no attempt to verify," Tapper quoted Marshall as writing. "To use terminology of infectious disease, Fox was the primary vector of this story. And to the best of my knowledge, there's been not only no disciplining of anyone in the newsroom, but as far as I can see, no retraction, apology, or even discussion of their primary role in an obvious smear. This is a journalistic felony, really, the worst kind of thing that journalists can ever do, a reality only compounded by the fact that they refuse to admit not only culpability but even that they did anything wrong." For a reaction, Tapper turned to Stephen Hayes, a senior writer with the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, who was a member of the show's roundtable that week. "Stephen, do you think that ... liberals are unfairly using this to try to discredit conservative journalists?" Hayes responded, "Yes, of course, they are. Look, the timeline doesn't work. I mean ... Howard Kurtz, at CNN and the Washington Post wrote that the timeline simply doesn't work. She actually resigned before or was forced to retire before anybody on Fox said a word about this." We thought it would be worthwhile to check the transcripts and see whether it's correct that Sherrod "actually resigned before or was forced to retire before anybody on Fox said a word about this." The earliest on-air comment we could find came the toward the end of the 8 p.m. hour, during an airing of The O'Reilly Factor, a talk show hosted by pugnaciously conservative host Bill O'Reilly. O'Reilly told viewers that "speaking at an NAACP event in March, Department of Agriculture official Shirley Sherrod was caught on tape saying something very disturbing. Seems a white farmer in Georgia had requested government assistance from Ms. Sherrod." He then showed a clip of Sherrod saying, "I was struggling with the fact that so many black people had lost their farmland. And here I was faced with having to help a white person save their land. So I didn't give him the full force of what I could do." When the clip ended, O'Reilly said, "Wow. Well, that is simply unacceptable. And Ms. Sherrod must resign immediately. The federal government cannot have skin color deciding any assistance. We are requesting an explanation from the agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, and will keep you posted. By the way, the full transcript of Ms. Sherrod's remarks is posted on BigGovernment.com." While it's safe to assume that O'Reilly was unaware of Sherrod's ouster at the time he aired those comments -- why would he call for her ouster if it had already happened? -- his producers apparently found out as the segment was underway, because as O'Reilly was speaking, Fox aired an on-screen notice that said, "Sec. Vilsack has accepted Sherrod's resignation." A few minutes later, during the 9 p.m. hour of Fox, O'Reilly's fellow conservative host, Sean Hannity, began his show with an alert that Sherrod had resigned. So, based on the Fox transcripts as well as Sherrod's own account in the CNN interview, Hayes appears to be correct that Sherrod "was forced to resign before anybody on Fox said a word about this." Indeed, Howard Kurtz, the Washington Post's media critic, reported that "after a news meeting Monday afternoon (July 19), an e-mail directive was sent to the news staff in which Fox Senior Vice President Michael Clemente said, 'Let's take our time and get the facts straight on this story. Can we get confirmation and comments from Sherrod before going on-air. Let's make sure we do this right.'" But we think it's worth mentioning two additional points. First, it's clear from O'Reilly's on-air comment that at least one Fox commentator was preparing to make hay over the Sherrod controversy before she resigned -- it's just that the Agriculture Department beat Fox to the punch by ousting her first. If officials above Sherrod had spent more time reviewing her case instead of forcing her to the side of the road, O'Reilly at least, and possibly other Fox hosts, were ready to take up the call for her to be ousted. Second, Fox's television network may not have discussed Sherrod before she was ousted, but there's evidence that two of its web affiliates did mention the story. Media Matters for America -- a liberal group that tracks alleged media bias and regularly spars with both Fox and Breitbart -- located a FoxNews.com story posted around noon on July 19 that began, "Days after the NAACP clashed with Tea Party members over allegations of racism, a video has surfaced showing an Agriculture Department official regaling an NAACP audience with a story about how she withheld help to a white farmer facing bankruptcy." Media Matters wrote that FoxNews.com credited BigGovernment.com with posting the video, and added that "FoxNews.com is seeking a response from both the NAACP and the USDA." While Media Matters said that the article is no longer available on FoxNews.com, it provided a screenshot. Not long after that post went up at FoxNews.com, Media Matters said, Fox Nation -- an online community for news and commentary that's affiliated with Fox News -- posted the link to the Sherrod clip on BigGovernment.com under the headline, "Caught on Tape: Obama Official Discriminates Against White Farmer." All told, it seems clear to us that the USDA ousted Sherrod in order to forestall the possibility that commentators on Fox's cable channel would start calling for her resignation, not because Fox commentators had actually begun to do so. Still, two Fox web affiliates mentioned the controversy before Sherrod's ouster, and the fact that O'Reilly called for her resignation without knowing that she was already out of a job suggests that Fox was already beginning to pounce. On balance, these two caveats persuade us to drop Hayes' otherwise accurate statement that Shirley Sherrod "was forced to resign before anybody on Fox said a word about this" by a notch to Mostly True.

pomt-13550	Says Ron Johnson "voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/26/russ-feingold/feingold-johnson-voted-five-times-tax-breaks-help-/	In the race for the U.S. Senate, a new TV ad from challenger Russ Feingold claims that U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the Republican incumbent, "voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas." When it comes to attacks on Republican officeholders, this claim is not new. In 2014, PolitiFact National wrote: "Democrats and their advocates have washed, rinsed and are now repeating one of their favorite talking points from 2012: that ‘(Insert Republican Here) supports tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas.’ " The piece called the description "so simplistic as to be misleading," adding there is no specific tax break for sending jobs to other countries. OK, 2012 … 2014 … 2016 … we’re sensing a trend here. Let’s take a look at how Feingold’s claim fares on the Truth-O-Meter. Bring Jobs Home Act The Feingold campaign cited five votes by Johnson, two of which were on what was termed the Bring Jobs Home Act, which would have given companies credit for bringing jobs to the United States and denied existing deductions associated with moving a business outside the country. Those two votes were specifically addressed in a 2014 factcheck involving a claim against U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. The claim in the 2014 piece was that McConnell voted "three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas." Feingold’s campaign emphasized that the claim in their ad was that Johnson voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship jobs overseas, not that corporate tax breaks by themselves are responsible for sending jobs outside the U.S. "Like that PolitiFact notes, McConnell voted against denying deductions for costs associated with outsourcing," Feingold spokesman Michael Tyler said in an email to PolitiFact. "That helps a company attempting to ship its jobs elsewhere." But the earlier item noted: "The tax breaks that the law would have stopped are actually standard business expense deductions. Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax-deductible -- including relocation. But this isn’t a special provision just for businesses that move outside of the United States. A business would get the same deductions for money spent moving from New York to California." Tax experts said there is very little money associated with these standard deductions and "getting rid of deductions for business expenses associated with outsourcing would not be nearly enough to affect a company’s decision to engage in foreign activity." The legislation was proposed in 2012 and 2014 and Johnson voted "no" on procedural measures in each case, functionally voting to block the legislation from moving forward. The measures failed on procedural votes. The legislation itself was "almost entirely symbolic," PolitiFact reported. Three votes on budget amendments Now let’s turn to the other three votes, taken in March 2015 and cited by the Feingold campaign, this time on amendments to Congress’ concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 2016. Two were proposed by Democrats and a third was proposed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent who ran as a Democrat in the 2016 presidential race. The amendments were opposed by Republicans, with the two Independents voting with the Democrats. -- Amendment 817 statement of purpose: "To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to provide tax benefits to patriot employers that invest in American jobs and provide fair pay and benefits to workers and to eliminate tax benefits for corporations that ship jobs overseas." -- Amendment 523 statement of purpose: "To prevent United States companies from getting tax benefits for moving jobs overseas, to end offshore tax loopholes including inversions, and to provide incentives for United States companies to relocate overseas jobs to the United States." -- Amendment 323 statement of purpose: "To create millions of middle class jobs by investing in our nation's infrastructure paid for by raising revenue through closing loopholes in the corporate and international tax system." USA TODAY reported that amendment 323 targets "tax loopholes" that "let corporations and wealthy Americans shift jobs and profits overseas." But experts we spoke with said these votes had no practical effect. Congress’ concurrent budget resolution does not have the force of law and it would not be the place to change the tax code, said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "To me those are just sort of messaging -- they were all very much of a partisan vote," Ellis said. He added: "You can argue, well, he voted against whatever the message that the member, the Senator, was trying to get across, but I wouldn't necessarily say that was voting for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas because if he had voted for it, it wouldn’t have had any effect and voting against it didn’t have any effect." In addition, he said, tax reform would have to originate in the House, and it would be dealt with by the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means -- not on the floor of the Senate in a budget resolution. In an email, Johnson’s campaign said the senator’s position is that "we should scrap the tax code, rather than favor any single deduction." Our rating Feingold’s campaign ad said Johnson "voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas." By voting against the Bring Jobs Home Act, Feingold is correct that Johnson voted against denying deductions associated with moving a business out of the country. But, as the 2014 PolitiFact notes, the law was mostly symbolic and these aren’t deductions specifically for moving jobs elsewhere, which is how the statement could easily be interpreted. The amendments to the budget resolution on which he voted had no practical effect, experts told us. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8071a5a8-716d-4d13-89f3-26a897cd494b	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2016-08-26T05:00:00	2016-06-14	['Wisconsin']
pomt-12169	"A witness will testify against Hillary Clinton."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/03/blog-posting/internet-post-misleads-saying-witness-will-testify/	A story online that says a witness will speak out against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of a larger investigation into her actions is a muddled mix of real developments misleadingly retold. "Breaking: A witness will testify against Hillary Clinton," read the headline on a July 30, 2017, post on CoffeeBreakForYou.com. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fabricated as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The post said that Clinton would be "held accountable for the many wrongdoings she has been charged with," although it never specifies what those charges may be. It said President Donald Trump had tasked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate Clinton’s ties to Russia. That’s where the "key witness" comes in. "Glenn Simpson has been friends with the Clinton family for many years," the post read. "Not coincidentally, he is also a co-founder of the firm Fusion GPS that disseminated the widely debunked fake news dossier containing over-the-top stories about Donald Trump going to Russian hotels." The CoffeeBreakForYou.com article said the Senate Judiciary Committee had subpoenaed Simpson. The post asked readers whether they thought Simpson "will share crucial information about how Hillary attempted to frame Donald Trump." The story appears to have originated as a July 30 post on Conservative101.com. The byline on the post was Christopher Reynolds. We attempted to reach Conservative101.com through the website’s contact form (the only method of contact available) but didn’t get a response. The story isn't fake in the sense that it makes up all its content, but it does spin things to the point of being misleading or incorrect. The most notable issues are whether Clinton is really being investigated, and for what reasons the Senate Judiciary Committee wants to talk to Simpson. Trump has publicly criticized Sessions for failing to investigate Clinton for deleting emails from her private server and for allegedly getting information from Ukraine during her presidential campaign. The Justice Department has not publicly acknowledged an investigation into Clinton, although the Senate Judiciary Committee has demanded the agency disclose if it’s investigating the Ukrainian allegations. The Justice Department has until Aug. 3 to respond. House Republicans have requested FBI documents into the campaign investigation and have asked for a special counsel for a Clinton probe. The Senate committee has been looking into the extent of Russian influence on the 2016 election. Simpson is a real person. He is a former journalist who is a founding partner of opposition research firm Fusion GPS. Simpson was initially being subpoenaed for a hearing, but not explicitly to expose Clinton. The committee wanted to compel him to discuss details of his company’s Trump dossier, which became public in January 2017. Simpson wanted to protect the Democratic-leaning client who hired Fusion GPS to create the Trump dossier, according to the Daily Beast. Simpson had originally intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination, but struck a deal in which he would provide a transcribed interview. The Senate Judiciary Committee agreed and withdrew its subpoena. We couldn’t find any proof that Simpson was "friends with the Clinton family," although the New York Post reported that Fusion GPS was "actually an opposition-research group for Democrats, and the founders, who are more political activists than journalists, have a pro-Hillary Clinton, anti-Trump agenda." But trying to protect the identity of a Clinton ally who paid for opposition research against Trump is not the same as testifying against Clinton. In addition to the Trump opposition report, Fusion GPS also had reportedly worked to ease sanctions against Russia, through ties with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya. She’s the same lawyer Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had met in a controversial and previously undisclosed 2016 meeting. Our ruling Bloggers said, "A witness will testify against Hillary Clinton." The post used details from several real news events in a way that would lead readers to draw some unproven conclusions. The article said that a founding partner in an opposition research firm was being called to testify against Clinton. Simpson was being asked to discuss details about a dossier filled with unsavory (and largely unsubstantiated) details about Trump as part of an investigation into Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election.

pomt-09013	The U.S. "only ranks 25th worldwide on defense spending as a percentage of GDP."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/09/sarah-palin/palin-says-us-ranks-25th-defense-spending-ranking/	In a June 30, 2010, Facebook post, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin posted excerpts from a speech she gave in Norfolk, Va., primarily on national security. At one point, she said, "Did you know the U.S. actually only ranks 25th worldwide on defense spending as a percentage of GDP?" We didn't, so we decided to check up on her statistic. We quickly tracked down the chart from which we suspect she pulled her factoid. (Her staff didn't return our e-mail query.) It's a credible source -- the CIA World Factbook -- and, as Palin said, the U.S. does rank 25th in the world, spending an estimated 4.06 percent of GDP on defense in 2005. Case closed? Not really. The list includes all countries, regardless of size, so some tiny countries outrank the United States on the CIA list. There's Eritrea at number 9 (with an economy about 1/1000th of the size of the U.S. economy); Burundi at number 11 (with an economy that's even less than 1/1000th the size of the U.S. economy); and Maldives at 13th (with an economy roughly the same size as Burundi's). Given this competition, several other states on the CIA's list seem like veritable economic powerhouses, such as Mauritania at 14th, Swaziland at 19th and Brunei at 22nd. Many of the states on the CIA list are modest-sized but live in a high-tension neighborhood -- the Middle East. They include the top seven, which are, in descending order, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, Israel and Yemen. A bit lower on the list are Syria, Kuwait, Turkey and Bahrain. All told, only four nations on the CIA list could be described as either industrialized democracies or major world players. They are Israel (6th), Turkey (16th), China (23rd) and Greece (24th). Is there a better yardstick? We think there is -- using rankings of members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD is a group of 31 nations that are generally large, industrialized democracies. This list makes the comparison closer to one of peers. To make this comparison, we looked at a comprehensive table of defense spending compared to GDP that was published by the World Bank. First, two caveats: The figures are more recent than the ones used to create the CIA list, so they don't compare exactly. And we should note that varying definitions and a tendency toward secrecy make international military comparisons tricky. That said, compared to its 30 fellow members of the OECD, the U.S. trailed only one other member nation, Israel (at 8 percent of GDP, compared to 4.3 percent for the U.S.). In fact, the U.S. rate is double the rate of many of its peers. We also looked at China and Russia -- two nuclear powers that do not belong to the OECD -- and both of them also trail the U.S. in this measurement. Todd Harrison, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said other factors set the U.S. apart. "In absolute dollars, we spend almost as much as all other countries combined," Harrison said. "So saying we are 25th is a bit misleading and a selective use of facts." We agree. Although she's technically correct, the numbers are wildly skewed by tiny, non-industrialized countries. We find her claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01407	"In Massachusetts, Scott Brown pushed for a law to force women considering abortion -- force them -- to look at color photographs of developing fetuses."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/oct/10/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-scott-brown-wanted-women-look-/	As the 2014 New Hampshire Senate race veers toward a conclusion, the state’s next senator needs the support of women voters. Incumbent Jeanne Shaheen underscored that point when she targeted Republican challenger Scott Brown’s record supporting women’s reproductive rights during his tenure as a state senator from Massachusetts. Her aim was to undercut Brown’s assertion that he is a pro-choice politician. An ad with a female narrator released on Oct. 7 said, "In Massachusetts, Scott Brown pushed for a law to force women considering abortion -- force them -- to look at color photographs of developing fetuses." The ad, titled "Force," drew a swift response from Brown. He held a press conference the same day the ad was released, calling it a lie and adding that it was "not only insensitive, it is also deeply offensive." "I have always been a pro-choice, independent Republican and have a strong record of supporting women’s health care," Brown said in Derry, N.H., with his wife Gail by his side. Brown demanded that Shaheen pull the ad, and the next day he launched his own ad calling Shaheen’s commercial a "smear campaign." More than ever in this hotly contested Senate race, this seemed like a job for PolitiFact. For support, the ad, and Shaheen’s campaign, pointed to Massachusetts Senate Bill 979, "An Act Relative to a Woman’s Right to Know," filed in 2005. While the bill co-sponsored by Brown and Republican Michael R. Knapik eventually failed, it would have given any woman seeking an abortion information and mandated 24 hours to consider the consequences of that decision. (Exceptions would only be given in the case of a medical emergency.) "The purpose of the Woman's Right to Know Act is to ensure that every woman considering an abortion receives complete information on the procedure, the risks, the status of her unborn child, and her alternatives, and sufficient reflection time, thereby reducing the possibility of serious, lasting, or life threatening consequences of a medical, emotional and psychological nature," the bill states. Similar laws have been proposed and enacted in other states following a 1992 Supreme Court decision allowing the state of Pennsylvania under its "Abortion Control Act" to require a woman seeking an abortion to give her informed consent prior to the procedure, receive a host of information about abortion and adoption, and wait 24 hours before having an abortion. The introduction to the Massachusetts bill cites that Supreme Court decision, saying the state "has an important interest in ensuring that women seeking abortions are provided a fully informed choice and a sufficient period of time to reflect on the information provided, ‘to reduce the risk that a woman may elect an abortion, only to discover later, with devastating psychological consequences, that her decision was not fully informed.’ Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 882 (1992)." So how about those photographs of fetuses that women would be "forced" to look at? Like similar laws proposed and passed elsewhere, the proposed Massachusetts law would have required doctors or their representatives to provide women with lots of information at least 24 hours before an abortion was scheduled, including the names of adoption agencies and contact information for public and private agencies that offer financial and medical support to women throughout a pregnancy and after childbirth. It also required women to receive descriptions of the "anatomical and physiological characteristics of the unborn child at two week gestational increments from fertilization to full term, including color photographs." If photos were unavailable "realistic drawings" were considered acceptable. The bill made clear that photos of fetuses must be provided to women seeking abortions, but didn’t stop there. It also called for descriptions of the different methods of abortion and "the physical, psychological and emotional risks or medical complications commonly associated with each method; a description of the physical, psychological and emotional risks or medical complications of pregnancy and delivery; a description of the support obligations of the father of a child born alive." Before performing an abortion, the doctor or a representative would have to ask the woman if she had "seen" the information and "provide the woman with an opportunity to contact abortion alternative agencies at this time should she so desire." In addition, a woman’s signature was required before the abortion was performed to give her consent and "indicate that she has been offered the information described in this section." Brown says the bill was intended to give adoption a chance and "did not force women to do anything. I would never force women to do anything." He’s got a point. Nowhere in the bill is the word "force" used. Still, the language of the bill certainly ensures women would be given the information, asks them if they had "seen it," and provided at least 24 hours to review it before having an abortion. Our ruling Shaheen’s ad says that "in Massachusetts, Scott Brown pushed for a law to force women considering abortion -- force them -- to look at color photographs of developing fetuses." The measure backed by Brown nine years ago made sure that women were provided photos of developing fetuses, along with a lot more information. It certainly forced doctors and their representatives to provide this information to women seeking abortions -- except in cases of emergency -- and it ensured women received the information both through verbal questions and a signed consent form.

pomt-06883	Says Republican state Sen. Alberta Darling offered "unqualified support" for a plan to end Medicare	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/29/we-are-wisconsin/we-are-wisconsin-says-state-senator-alberta-darlin/	State Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, handed her recall opponent a big opening when she was asked about U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s hotly debated Medicare plan and heaped praise on him. Or did she? At a June 10, 2011, fundraiser in Milwaukee, Darling told an audience during questions and answers that Ryan is "doing the exact right thing to try to reform" Medicare. Her comments are available to anyone, thanks to a new reality in partisan politics: Once-private talks are now routinely captured on video by bloggers, political parties or interested groups. In this case, one of the two videos of Darling’s remarks was done for We Are Wisconsin, the labor coalition backing Democrats in the Senate recalls. The Progressive WI channel on YouTube posted a long version on June 11, 2011, and We Are Wisconsin put up a shorter but better-quality video on June 13, 2011. The Journal Sentinel wrote about it on June 14, 2011, in an All Politics blog post headlined, "Darling backs Ryan’s Medicare plan." A few weeks passed, but then things really got interesting. The National Journal reported Darling told one of its reporters in June that she had taken no position on Ryan’s plan at the fundraiser. "I didn’t say I supported his Medicare effort," the publication quoted Darling as saying. Around the same time, state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, Darling’s opponent in the August recall election, put up a TV spot saying Darling "supports ending Medicare" -- a reference to the recorded comments. Then on July 14, 2011, after a protest at her office, Andrew Davis, Darling’s campaign manager, told Fox Point-Bayside Patch: "Senator Darling has no opinion on the matter." The reaction was swift. The next day We Are Wisconsin blasted Darling and Ryan in a July 15 news release, saying she was dishonestly denying her "unqualified," "unequivocal," "unwavering," "ironclad" support for a "radical plan that ends Medicare" or proposes "gutting" it or would "scrap" it. Strong words. Does the video tell the tale of "unqualified support"? We’ll look at a claim in two parts: (1) that Darling offered unqualified support for Ryan’s plan and (2) that Ryan’s plan would "end" Medicare. There is no dispute about the authenticity of the video. As these things go, the question-and-answer exchange is actually clear. Darling’s camp says her answer was unscripted, but she was fully aware the exchange was being recorded. Her remarks are not an aside; she eagerly took the microphone and spoke for more than a minute. The question from an unidentified male was direct: "What do you think of Representative Ryan’s Medicare changes?" Here’s the full exchange: "You know, I was asked at the beginning of the week what I think about Rep. Ryan’s Medicare reforms, and they were trying to tie me to Ryan and thought that would be a negative for me. "I said, ‘I’m standing with Ryan anytime, anywhere. He’s a leader.’ And I said ‘You guys are lying about what he’s doing with Medicare ... 55 and older Medicare stays; 55 and younger, there are new reforms so that health care actions can be available when people get to be seniors." She finished: "So, I think Paul Ryan is doing the exact right thing to try to reform Medicaid because Medicaid is going to go broke. But they’re lying. People 55 and older will keep Medicare. 55 and younger will have a reform of Medicare to have options so that health care can continue. "Totally, go Paul Ryan!" Darling said to applause. "They are trying to label that as a negative. I said, " ‘Are you kidding, he’s absolutely a hero.’ " We requested an interview with Darling; she declined. Davis provided written answers to our questions. In her response to us, Darling did not take a position on Ryan’s plan, instead reiterating she can’t vote on Medicare changes, and she admires Ryan’s leadership on the issue. "I did not and do not endorse Congressman Ryan’s plan," her response said. "I do not want to see Medicare end, I want to see it continue to provide for our seniors. But if we do not do anything about it, it’s not going to be there for future generations." The intent of her answer at the event, Darling’s statement said, was to "combat the lies" about Ryan’s plan. Davis said Darling’s "exact right thing" remark was only in reference to Ryan’s taking on the issue, not the specifics of his plan. Kelly Steele, spokesman for We Are Wisconsin, countered that Darling discusses details of the plan and shows her cards by saying Ryan’s attempt at Medicare reform is the "exact right thing." The group says Darling is now reacting to residents’ concerns about cuts to Medicare. "Her attempt to walk this back is laughable," Steele said. "I have not seen a more unequivocal embrace of Paul Ryan’s plan than that piece of video." Let’s go back to the tape -- and the We Are Wisconsin claim -- and examine the two pieces of this. For her part, Darling’s campaign contends she only embraced Ryan and Ryan’s drive to reform Medicare -- not the specifics. But she discusses and defends key aspects of it, and -- in response to a question about what she thought about the plan -- offers that he is doing the "exact right thing." If Darling wanted to express neutrality, she could have prefaced her comments or framed them as such. She could have embraced Ryan and still made clear she was taking no position on his plan. Instead she offers not even a hint of concern or caution about Ryan’s plan and invites the conclusion that she backs it wholeheartedly with comments such as "totally, go" and "standing with Ryan anytime, anywhere." Most importantly, the question wasn’t Ryan’s courage or his place in history -- it was what she thought of his plan. The question, perhaps designed for this purpose, was specific. We think many listeners would judge her remarks in that narrow context and take her enthusiastic back-slapping comments as at least a general endorsement of his plan. But Darling didn’t come right out and say she endorses his plan. And this was an apparently unscripted response at a GOP fundraiser where you might expect Darling to lead cheers for Ryan. We could find no other, more formal statements by Darling on the plan. Looking at the whole context, though, we think it’s generally true Darling offered unqualified support. Now the back end of the claim. The problem for We Are Wisconsin is that it says Ryan’s plan would "end" or "scrap" Medicare. The group qualifies the language at times, but the overwhelming impression left is that Ryan’s plan would mean the end of Medicare -- and that this is what Darling supported. PolitiFact has repeatedly ruled False the notion that Ryan’s plan would end the program. It would change dramatically, yes, but it would still exist. So where does that leave this two-part statement on the Truth-O-Meter? On balance, we rate the statement from the group Half True.

pomt-10887	"Both China and Japan have surpassed us, with Japanese cars now getting an average of 45 miles to the gallon."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/jun/21/barack-obama/technically-correct-but-uses-unrealistic-numbers/	In a speech to the Detroit Economic Club on May 7, 2007, Obama said the U.S. needs to make more fuel-efficient cars. "While our fuel standards haven't moved from 27.5 miles per gallon in two decades, both China and Japan have surpassed us, with Japanese cars now getting an average of 45 miles to the gallon." Obama's claim about Japanese cars getting more than 45 mpg involves the fuzzy science of measuring fuel economy, complicated by differing standards in each nation. Obama's campaign says his number comes from a 2004 study by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change that calculated Japanese cars would get 46 mpg if Japan followed the same test methods as the U.S. (Obama accurately says the U.S. mandate has been 27.5 for 20 years.) Obama's claim is technically correct. But the Pew numbers exaggerate the differences between the countries because those estimates do not reflect real-world conditions, according to Lee Schipper, director of research at the World Resources Institute's Center for Transport and Environment. He says the Japanese fleet actually averages about 23 mpg on the road today, but is improving. The U.S. number is only slightly lower, about 21, but has been stagnant. The real-world numbers are closer because, despite more fuel-efficient cars in Japan, heavy traffic congestion erases much of the efficiency. Schipper said Obama "is correct that Japan's fuel efficiency is higher and improving more rapidly, but his number is inaccurate. The number he used doesn't really represent a realistic on-road achievement." Yet Schipper said he doesn't fault Obama for the confusion. "Everybody makes this mistake. What matters is what cars really get on the road, how long it takes to change the entire fleet and how much people drive."

pomt-10352	The U.S. government spends less on energy innovation "than the pet food industry invests in its own products."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/11/barack-obama/this-dog-wont-hunt/	Sen. Barack Obama says the United States has its priorities about energy research all wrong: Case in point, the government spends less on energy research than the pet food industry does on its own research and development. That's the claim Democratic nominee Obama makes in his "Plan to Make America a Global Energy Leader," to explain why he wants to increase the amount the government spends on energy innovation. "At present, the federal government spends over $3 billion per year on all energy innovation efforts," the Obama plan states. "While this may seem like a significant sum, it is much less than what we spent in the late 1970s when adjusted for inflation, and is less than the pet food industry invests in its own products." A June 2008 Harvard study confirms that the part about the 1970s is true. In inflation-adjusted dollars, the government was spending more than $6 billion a year on energy research and development in the late 1970s, which is more than double what it's spending this year. But that second claim? The pet food one? The Obama campaign declined to explain what the Illinois senator meant, exactly, by "invests in its own products." Instead, it referred Politifact to an August 2007 article by University of California (Berkeley) Professor Daniel M. Kammen, which makes precisely the same point Obama did: "The federal government spends less on energy research and development than the U.S. pet food industry spends on its products in the United States," Kammen wrote. The article, on global warming, contains no footnotes to support the pet food assertion, doesn't expand upon it beyond that one sentence, and Kammen did not respond to several requests for comment. That forces us to take the Obama statement as any voter would: at face value. In his article, Kammen refers to pet food industry spending, which it could be argued, refers to everything the industry spends on its products, from raw materials to packaging to advertising. But Obama uses the word "invests" – and given the parallel construction of his argument – it reads to us like a comparison between federal government energy research and pet food industry research, (i.e. the development of new products.) For its part, the Pet Food Institute, the trade association for the industry, says that it doesn't keep such figures, leaving us to wonder where Kammen got them. But a 2006 study by consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, which examined the 1,000 companies across all industries that spend the most on research and development, found that on average those companies spent 3.8 percent of their gross sales on R&D.; Given that the pet food industry as a whole grosses about $15 billion a year in sales, it's inconceivable that the industry spends more on new product research than the $3-billion the government spends on energy R&D.; That would be 20 percent of gross sales. As a result, we find Obama's claim to be False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-07-11T00:00:00	2008-07-11	['United_States']

pomt-04104	"200 consumer laws were destroyed" in 2011 when Gov. Scott Walker signed Act 92.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/14/vince-megna/vince-megna-says-gov-scott-walker-destroyed-200-co/	Vince Megna, the Milwaukee attorney known as "King of the Lemon Laws," is mincing no words as he runs a partisan-style race attempting to unseat Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Patience Roggensack. In a profanity-laced, theatrical series of YouTube videos and on his campaign website, the man who built a national reputation taking on auto companies and other big corporations goes after Gov. Scott Walker and other Republicans. Megna is running in the spring 2013 race as a liberal Democrat even though the contest is officially nonpartisan. He considers Roggensack a Republican, a claim we won’t deal with here. One of Megna’s big talking points is the measure by GOP lawmakers in 2011 -- in what became Act 92-- that limited attorney fees in the kind of cases that are Megna’s bread and butter. "Governor Scott Walker signed into law the most destructive anti-consumer protection bill in Wisconsin history," Megna’s website says. "With one swipe of the pen, 200 consumer laws were destroyed and more than 40 years of case law development was rendered moot." We’re not going to compare the measure with every consumer bill since statehood. But we will test whether "200 consumer laws were destroyed" by it. A bit of background first. Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, who is now the Assembly speaker, shepherded through the 2011 bill after a car dealer in his district fought a lawsuit by a man who said the dealership did about $5,000 of unauthorized work on his new truck. Megna was an attorney for the truck owner. A Racine County judge ruled in the dealer’s favor. But the state Court of Appeals ruled the truck owner didn’t have to pay if he didn’t authorize the work.It sent the case back to the lower court. Three days before subsequent trial at the lower court, the two sides settled, with the dealer paying $12,500 for damages and interest, $151,250 in legal fees and $5,284 in costs. The Vos-backed bill said judges should presume that reasonable attorneys fees do not exceed three times the amount of compensatory damages. But judges can lift the cap under certain circumstances. Over the objections of Democrats and consumer advocates, the law took effect in December 2011, so it’s slightly more than a year old. When we asked Megna how the measure "destroyed 200 consumer laws," he backed off a bit, saying he did not mean it in a literal sense. Indeed, in 2011, he told reporters the effect would be to "virtually repeal" the statutes. He repeated that to PolitiFact Wisconsin, saying that Walker’s action amounts towiping out the statutes because lawyers will be wary of representing tenants, discrimination victims and buyers of defective cars given the possible fee limits. "Those are effectively wiped out because you can’t find attorneys who will represent you," he said. Let’s take a look under the hood. The law clearly can affect lawyer’s fees in many matters brought under so-called "fee-shifting" cases -- matters in which laws give consumers the right to recover attorney’s fees from the other side if they prevail. As many as 280 statutory and administrative causes of action could fall under the three-times-damages cap, according to an October 2012 analysis in the Wisconsin Lawyer, a publication of the State Bar of Wisconsin. The Bar opposed the legislation, saying it would also hurt businesses’ legal defense against frivolous claims brought by someone who has actually violated the law. Many of those 200-plus statutes are related to consumer protection; some are not. But did the legislation "destroy" them? We contacted consumer lawyers and those who defend businesses and found general agreement that the law will spawn changes, some potentially significant -- and in the eyes of lawyers for consumers, harmful to their cause because they believe getting a lawyer will be more difficult. But none went so far as to say consumer laws that allow legal action had been destroyed or eliminated. Attorney David Dudley represented many low-income clients from an office in Madison and relied exclusively on attorney-fee-shift provisions for its operation. He closed the office after the law took effect, blaming the legislation for the move. He now works for the federal government. DeVonna Joy, a southeast-Wisconsin consumer lawyer, told us she now turns down more potential clients. Proving even small claims cases can cost a lot, the cap is "absurdly low" in many cases, and defense lawyers are dragging out more cases to pressure plaintiffs to settle, she said. Joy acknowledged that other lawyers might be picking up some of the clients she’s rejected, but she said many already have been turned down multiple times when she hears from them. Brian Schuk, a Delavan attorney who represents tenants and sometimes landlords, says he now refuses many smaller cases even when there is an obvious violation of the law. So now, more of those people don’t end up suing, or try to take on landlords without representation, he said. At the University of Wisconsin-Madison, two professors active in public-interest law, Sarah Orr and Mitch, said it was too early to judge the ultimate impact, but both said fewer cases would be brought on behalf of consumers and tenants in matters such as fraud, debt collection and consumer-law violations. Note: Mitch officially has no last name. But not all lawyers are trimming their caseloads -- including Megna himself. Megna told us that his own practice is mainly intact because he handles some big-ticket cases that allow him to continue to handle smaller cases. We also spoke with lawyers who often find themselves defending clients against consumer claims. Tristan Pettit, a Milwaukee lawyer who frequently represents residential landlords and businesses, said he has not seen much effect one way or another. Lisa Lawless, another Milwaukee lawyer, said the law’s impact is still an open question, but predicted that lawyers representing consumers would be more "reasonable" about settling cases faster. She praised the law, and said the fee cap was fair, but added that it could be an issue for lawyers taking on small damage claims. Both say they have not noticed a drop-off in cases. Finally, it’s worth noting again that the new law presumes a cap at three times damages, but a judge can go higher. Megna acknowledged that it’s too early to say whether judges will allow fees above the suggested cap. Many cases in front of judges now were filed before the law went into effect and thus not covered by the limits. But many lawyers who handle cases affected by the law predict the cap will become the standard -- in part because busy judges can’t take the time to sort out what is reasonable on fees. Our rating Megna described the impact of Act 92 in stark and dramatic terms saying that "200 consumer laws were destroyed" when Walker signed it. It seems clear that the changes tilt the playing field against consumers in some significant ways, but the laws remain on the books and litigation will continue at some level -- perhaps reduced, but it’s premature to say. Megna’s claim misleadingly suggests Walker and Republican legislators wiped hundreds of statutes off the books. We rate his claim False.

pomt-10654	"Average families are spending roughly $2,000 more a year on energy costs. ... It's like a $2,000 energy tax in just the last seven years, more than three times what the typical American family received from the Bush tax cuts."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/02/hillary-clinton/her-comparison-is-too-selective/	Even staunch Democrats probably recall the guilty pleasure of spending their extra cash from the Bush tax cuts. And just about every American has felt the pinch at the gas pump lately. So which had a bigger impact on your wallet? Are you flush from the Bush tax cuts, or did rising energy prices wipe out the fleeting boon? Sen. Hillary Clinton thinks rising energy prices wiped out your family's tax savings — three times over. Whether she's right or wrong depends on several factors. "It depends on how much you drive, and how much you earn," said Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Institute. (He bikes to work.) Let's start with Clinton's energy number. PolitiFact doesn't know where she got it, since Clinton's camp did not respond to inquiries. But here's what we found. From 2001 to 2006, "average annual energy and gasoline costs have increased by over $2,300," according to "The Middle-Class Squeeze," a September 2006 congressional committee report prepared for Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Henry Waxman, both California Democrats. The report included the gasoline in your car, oil to heat your home, and fuel for electricity. It also included some tough-to-measure "pass-through" costs, such as higher retail prices because of higher shipping costs. Going by this report, Clinton's energy number seems reasonable. Now, for the tax cuts. In 2001, the White House said, "Under the President's tax relief plan, the typical American family of four will be able to keep at least $1,600 more of their own money." That's not how it necessarily worked out, said Burman. A median-income family held on to $744 in 2006 as a result of the tax cuts, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis. Well, it happens that $2,300 is three times more than $744. But PolitiFact finds Clinton's comparison too selective. It appears she's comparing a single year of tax savings (2006) to an escalation in energy prices that took several years. What happens if you add up each year's tax savings, and then add up each year's change in energy costs? After all, oil and gas prices actually dropped in late 2001 and into 2002. The answer is, we don't know. To do that kind of a calculation, over so many years, one would have to account for changing tax laws, inflation, income changes, energy use, driving patterns, what people bought, even the weather. In short, it's not a number that is tracked by the Energy Information Administration or the Tax Policy Center. Maybe the Clinton campaign did all of that, but if so they're not sharing it with us. We're left with somewhat accurate numbers from Clinton (judging by one report) that tell only part of the story of energy costs vs. tax savings. At our generous best, we can only give her a Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-01-02T00:00:00	2007-11-19	['United_States', 'George_W._Bush']

pomt-07151	"China owns about 29 percent of (the U.S.) debt.''	false	/florida/statements/2011/jun/14/allen-west/rep-allen-west-says-china-holds-29-percent-us-debt/	China's economic muscle and the U.S. debt are common worries in Congress these days. Republican Congressman Allen West, who represents parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties, weighed in during an interview about China on Fox News June 2. Anchor Jenna Lee asked: "How would you deal with China, especially with our economic ties right now? I mean, what's the way forward?" West replied: "Well, I think that that is one of the key things that we need to be talking about, when we look at the debt that we have and China owns about 29 percent of that debt." West linked to the interview on his website. Is West's figure right -- does China own about 29 percent of the U.S. debt? We asked spokeswoman Angela Sachitano for an explanation. She sent us back a link to a March 25, 2011, report from the Congressional Research Service titled "Foreign Holdings of Federal Debt." Note the word "foreign." Table 2 shows the top 10 "foreign holders" of federal debt, and Mainland China is at the top, with about $1.16 trillion or 26.1 percent (Japan is No. 2). This means China holds about 26 percent of "foreign investment in U.S. privately held federal debt," the report states. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Georgia weighed in on a similar claim by Herman Cain, a Republican presidential candidate, who spoke about China's share of the U.S. debt at a tea party event in Iowa on April 16. We rated Cain's claim False. "If we don't begin to grow with the potential that we have in this country, we will have another national security crisis, and that national security crisis is that China will be as big as we are," Cain said. "They'll start to develop a military as big and as good as ours, and they've got a billion more people and they're holding 26 percent of our debt. And you think we're going to be able to sing Kumbaya with them?" After examining a U.S. Treasury Department report of foreign holders of treasury securities as of March, PolitiFact concluded: "According to the report, as of February of this year, China held $1.15 trillion worth of U.S. Treasury securities. Together, all foreign holders came to $4.47 trillion. So China's share of that comes to about 26 percent. China, incidentally, tops the list of foreign holders of U.S. debt, followed by Japan and then, with a much smaller share, countries such as the United Kingdom and Brazil. "But that's just the foreign holders of Treasury securities. More than two-thirds of the debt is held by U.S. residents and institutions. When you look at everyone who holds U.S. Treasury securities, China's share drops to 8.1 percent ($1.15 trillion out of $14 trillion)." (For the West fact-check, we contacted the U.S. Treasury to ask whether that report had been updated since March and were told that it was the most recent data available.) PolitiFact National continued: "Of course, there are lots of ways to slice debt statistics. For example, instead of gross federal debt (the figure cited above), some people prefer to use a figure for 'debt held by the public.' That's the gross federal debt minus the share of the debt held by the U.S. government itself. That was $9.4 trillion at the end of 2010. Which would put the portion held by China at about 12.3 percent. There are also Chinese holdings of debt outside of Treasuries, said Derek Scissors of the conservative Heritage Foundation. But that doesn't get Cain anywhere near his 26 percent figure. "Even stretching, you can't get past 15.6 percent of our debt as held by China and I would not use that number," Scissors said. The number cited by Cain is "misleadingly large," Scissors said. "He's not talking about our debt, he's talking about the foreign share of our debt. If you are going to use that number, you really have to explain it." We told Sachitano that West's figure was close to China's share of the foreign-held U.S. debt. She replied by e-mail: "No misrepresentation." She also referred us to slides on West's website, which he uses at town-hall meetings. On his slide show, however, West's pie charts correctly show China's share of the U.S. debt held by foreigners, a distinction he didn't make on Fox News. The 29 percent figure that West mentioned on Fox is even higher than what Cain had cited, and we've already labeled that too high. The number West used is also wrong. Although on TV he left out only a couple words, those words matter because they make a big difference here.

pomt-12887	Say George Soros's money "went straight into the (Women’s March) protesters’ pockets."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/25/blog-posting/pants-fire-george-soros-money-womens-march-protest/	According to several blog posts, the women’s marches around the country did not reflect grassroots concern over the policies of President Donald Trump. Rather, they were the work of the liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros. The Constitution.com blog posted that "the liberal media and Democrat pundits are mischaracterizing the past weekend’s march as grassroots. Listening to them, people would believe that the participants were sincere, spontaneous and concerned citizens. While some were genuine, most were paid minions." The post went on to say, "George Soros funded over 50 organizations partnering and participating in the March for Women’s Rights. Part of that funding went straight into the protesters pockets. They weren’t there for rights. They were there for riches." In this fact-check, we focus on whether Soros money went into the pockets of protesters. There is no evidence that's true. We used the Constitution.com website’s contact form to ask where they got their information and did not hear back. However, the blog cited an opinion piece by Asra Nomani that appeared on the Women in the World section of the New York Times website. Nomani’s article voiced her displeasure with the anti-Trump focus of the march. As a self-identified liberal feminist and Trump supporter, she said she did not feel welcome. Nomani went through the list of 403 groups listed as partners of the march and found that "Soros has funded, or has close relationships with, at least 56 of the march’s ‘partners,’ including ‘key partners’ Planned Parenthood, which opposes Trump’s anti-abortion policy, and the National Resource Defense Council, which opposes Trump’s environmental policies." Nomani told us that she has now counted 65 organizations with some sort of tie, not necessarily financial, to Soros and his philanthropic organization, the Open Society Foundation. We looked at Nomani’s spreadsheet of march partners annotated with any ties to the Open Society Foundation. It is unclear exactly how many groups currently receive foundation support. Some got money for projects several years ago. For others, the connection is indirect, such as participating in programs that Soros’ Open Society Foundation also supports. No matter the number of organizations or the amount of money they may have received, Nomani never claimed that Soros’ Open Society was paying individual protestors. In an interview with PolitiFact, Nomani rejected the claims of other bloggers. "I definitely do not conclude that most of the people marching were paid to do so," Nomani said. "I believe that most of the people were motivated by sincere political and ideological beliefs. I do believe that most of the participants in the march had genuine concerns. It is not factual that they were paid to march." But what about the role Soros money paid in making the marches happen at all? Nomani said, "The march organizers have not yet revealed their funding sources, so it is unclear who directly funded the march." For its part, the Open Society Foundation sent us a statement saying there is "no truth" to reports that either Soros or the foundation funded the protests. "We have long supported a wide range of organizations, including those that support women and minorities who have historically been denied equal rights," the statement said. "Many of them are concerned about what policy changes may lie ahead. We are proud of their work. We of course support the right of all Americans to peaceably assemble and petition their government -- a vital, and constitutionally safeguarded, pillar of a functioning democracy." Our ruling Bloggers said many participants in the women’s marches were motivated by money from Soros and his Open Society Foundation. The person whose work lies behind that rejects that claim and said she believes "most of the people were motivated by sincere political and ideological beliefs." She never claimed protesters were paid to attend. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-15277	"With the exception of baby formula, the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date, and state laws vary widely."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/27/john-oliver/john-oliver-hits-regulatory-gap-food-last-week-ton/	Ever wonder about the accuracy of your milk carton’s expiration date? Or exactly how late is too late to eat that apple? So did comedian John Oliver. He used the July 19 episode of his HBO show Last Week Tonight to discuss the issue of food waste, zooming in on little-known regulatory gaps that he argued cause mass confusion over the meaning and purpose of date labels on food. "With the exception of baby formula," Oliver said, "the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date, and state laws vary widely." And of the 50 states, he went on, nine don’t require any labels at all. The confusing issue has been well documented over several decades, though we doubt it’s ever been the target of an 18-minute monologue in a late-night comedy show. We wanted to see if Oliver had it right. Chaotic laws, confusing labels Oliver was right in saying, with the exception of infant formula, the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date. Experts say it would be almost impossible to set up an effective umbrella regulation for labeling foods with expiration dates. The diversity of climates and crops in the United States means it’s hard to judge the pace at which different foods deteriorate in different places. A piece of fruit left out in the hot, humid fields of Georgia might spoil faster than the same piece of fruit left out in the cool, dry mountains of Colorado. In the absence of an overarching federal statute, a jumble of laws at the state level dictate which foods require date labels. The comedian’s research team got the bulk of its data from a 2013 report compiled by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental think tank, and the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic. The study found that most states have laws that require date labels on some foods. Oliver cites the report’s finding that nine states don’t require any date labels, including New York, Idaho and Alabama. Of those nine, seven states don’t have regulations that govern the labels that manufacturers voluntarily place on products. These inconsistencies can make it hard to do business across state lines, said Emily Broad Leib, the study’s lead author and director of the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic. Laws in Montana and Pennsylvania require milk to be sold 12 and 17 days after pasteurization, respectively, but don’t allow the milk to be donated if it goes unsold in that time. "Without federal guidance," Leib said, "some state laws require that (unspoiled) food be thrown away." The Montana law prompted some out-of-state dairy farmers to argue that the law unfairly protects in-state producers. Label it what you want The regulatory gap also leads to confusion about what food labels actually mean. As a news clip in Oliver’s segment illustrates, one might see the same product labeled "sell by" or "use by," or it may have no label at all. Most retailers and manufacturers use a labeling system referred to as "open dating." Though it might sound like a relationship status, "open dating" simply means that a calendar date is displayed on a product instead of a code that only makes sense to the producer. Perhaps surprisingly, the dates on these labels aren’t regulated. This means it’s entirely up to the manufacturer to decide what date to print on the labels in all 50 states. (The strictest federal regulation of this kind applies to poultry, but it allows the use of a packing date instead of a sell-by date.) The purpose of manufacturers’ date labels isn’t to ensure safety, but quality, according to the USDA. Oliver suggests that because manufacturers are free to determine their own best-by dates, they may have a financial incentive to falsify them. But one expert said he wasn’t convinced manufacturers try to help out their bottom lines by making it seem like food perishes faster than reality. Quality standards almost always consider safety, said Keith Schneider, a food microbiologist at the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Keeping a customer happy means also keeping them safe. "These dates are usually based on lab tests and historical precedents," he said. Most of all, he said, manufacturers want to build brand loyalty by consistently guaranteeing fresh, safe food, so they are often overly conservative with sell-by and use-by dates. Leib said it would be difficult to prove a producer manipulates its dates to boost profits, "but it would be perfectly easy to falsify that information." Still, manufacturers have an interest in ensuring quality, and many times smaller companies don’t have the money to test their products and apply accurate sell-by dates. "Sometimes," she said, "dates are just made up." Our rating Oliver said, "With the exception of baby formula, the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date, and state laws vary widely." While Oliver’s underlying argument for more regulation can be debated, he’s right to say that the federal government doesn’t require expiration dates on food, and state laws filling in that gap are inconsistent. We rate his statement True. A previous version of this story misstated the name of the Natural Resources Defense Council.	None	John Oliver	None	None	None	2015-07-27T17:34:38	2015-07-19	['None']

pomt-05407	"We didn’t go out asking people" to join the "stand your ground" task force.	false	/florida/statements/2012/may/03/jennifer-carroll/jennifer-carroll-apply-stand-your-ground-task-forc/	Lawmakers and lawyers clamored to join the task force set up by Gov. Rick Scott to examine Florida’s justifiable homicide laws after Trayvon Martin’s shooting death. The clamoring turned to confusion when Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, whom Scott designated co-chair, explained how the panel’s members were chosen. "What we did was go to the individuals that seek our approval to be on the task force. We didn’t go out asking people," she said at an April 19 news conference. "They came to us with an interest in this review, and those are the people of the pool that we went and looked at, who would be best to serve on this task force given the diversity of the state." Reporters asked Carroll about Sen. Chris Smith, a South Florida Democrat and prominent "stand your ground" critic who publicly asked to be on the panel. "He did not apply," Carroll said. "We went with the application, people that sent in information who were interested in serving on this task force." Carroll’s comments immediately surprised some lawmakers. As we heard doubts about an application process, we started digging up more information about how the committee came together. Was Carroll accurate that no one recruited people to the task force? In March, Scott said the task force would be led by Carroll and the Rev. R.B. Holmes of Tallahassee and comprised of appointees from Attorney General Pam Bondi, House Speaker Dean Cannon, Senate President Mike Haridopolos, Senate President-designate Don Gaetz and House Speaker-designate Will Weatherford. Sen. Gary Siplin, D-Orlando, who was chosen to sit on the 19-member task force, said he knew nothing about an application. He simply told Haridopolos he was interested. The same goes for Smith. (Read Smith’s letter to Haridopolos.) "When the governor announced his task force, he stated who he’d get recommendations from," said Smith, who started his own task force to look into the law. "I called those people and expressed my desire to serve. And I’ve expressed publicly in many news outlets my desire to serve. So I was surprised that there was an application process that I did not know about." Here’s what we know about the process. In short, some members were chosen because they asked to be, like Carroll said. But we found several cases where task force members said explicitly that they were recruited, some by Carroll’s own chief of staff. Haridopolos, the Senate president, recommended Scott choose one senator from a list of seven senators that included four Democrats -- Larcenia Bullard of Miami, Arthenia Joyner of Tampa, Siplin and Smith -- and three Republicans -- David Simmons of Altamonte Springs, Andy Gardiner of Orlando and Greg Evers of Crestview, according to a March 28 letter. Siplin and Simmons made the cut. Cannon also made a recommendation. Unlike Haridopolos, he went outside of his chamber. Public records show the House speaker recommended Orlando attorney Derek Bruce, who filled out a standard questionnaire for gubernatorial appointees. "The speaker reached out to Mr. Bruce and recommended him to the governor because he thought he would be a good fit for the task force," said House spokesman Ryan Duffy. There’s no evidence in House records that Bruce lobbied Cannon to be on the task force. Speaker-designate Weatherford also had some picks: Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, who sponsored the 2005 "stand your ground" law, and Rep. Jason Brodeur, a Republican from Sanford, where Martin was shot. When Baxley heard Scott’s instructions, he told us that he called Weatherford and asked him to submit his name for the task force. Brodeur didn’t ask to be on the task force. But he readily agreed to it when Weatherford called, he said. Bondi nominated two law enforcement leaders, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings and Florida State Police Chief David Perry, to the task force a week later. She approached them, spokeswoman Jennifer Meale said. No application. Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told us she received an out-of-the-blue call about joining the committee from Carroll’s chief of staff, John Konkus. "He said that they would like me to be on it," she said. "I asked some questions about who else was on there, what was the time frame." She accepted his offer the next morning. "I consider it a real duty," she said. So does Gretchen Lorenzo, a crime prevention coordinator for the Fort Myers police department. She said Konkus called the department, requesting that she be placed on the task force. "I was appointed," she said. "It was a great opportunity for our city." Task force member Maria Newman, 64, who stopped volunteering with her neighborhood crime watch unit two years ago, tells a similar story. She said a friend on the Melbourne Police Department asked her if she wanted to be on the task force. "I look at it as I’m taking a journey," Newman said. "Hopefully my little voice will go a long ways." Miami community organizer Edna Canino deflected when asked about whether she was recruited onto the task force or volunteered herself, saying "I don’t think that’s important at this time." So we know several members of the task force were essentially recruited by Carroll, Cannon or Bondi. It puts a hole in Carroll’s claim that the selections were entirely based on people who "came to us with an interest in the review." We did find one person to support that claim: Tampa criminal defense attorney Joe Caimano, who emailed Cannon about serving. In an email, he wrote that his experience litigating "stand your ground" cases would be valuable. He ended up on the task force, though we’re not sure who made the decision since Cannon only recommended Derek Bruce. We made a public records request for all correspondence -- including any "applications" -- between those interested in the task force and the governor’s office on April 19, shortly after the news conference ended. It remained unfulfilled as of May 2, although the governor's office said it would get back to us shortly. A spokeswoman for Scott clarified Carroll’s comments on April 25, a week after the request, saying, "There was no formal application process." Spokeswoman Jackie Schutz added: "Sen. Smith never made his interest in serving on the task force known to our office." Konkus also called us on May 2 to explain there were no cold calls, but that some people had been recommended without their knowledge. "Several people had their names put forward from other voices across the state," he said. Our ruling Carroll said "we didn’t go out asking people" to join the task force charged with examining Florida’s "stand your ground" law. "They came to us," she said. This was accurate for several members, including Baxley, Siplin and Caimano (there could be more, but we can’t know that without Scott’s office fulfilling our records request). But we found several instances of the panel’s organizers inviting people to join, including a state attorney and crime prevention coordinator personally recruited by Carroll’s top aide. That's not how Carroll put it at the news conference, when she spoke of an application process. We rate Carroll’s claim False.

pomt-06886	Says Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel "supports allowing the United States to default on its obligations."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/28/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-accuses-josh-mandel-endorsin/	Josh Mandel, who was elected Ohio treasurer last November, has not officially announced he is running for the U.S. Senate next year. But that has not kept the Republican from raising money like a candidate or from collecting endorsements such as that of the Senate Conservatives Fund. The fund is a political action committee headed by U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, founder of the Senate’s Tea Party Caucus. The group said it was "launching an all out SCF surge" to raise money for Mandel, who "strongly supports all of the SCF policy goals." That drew the attention of the Ohio Democratic Party, which looked at those goals and issued a statement saying that Mandel "supports allowing the United States to default on its obligations." The statement said the "extreme stand" puts him in disagreement with Ohio Republicans like Sen. Rob Portman and U.S. House Speaker John Boehner. PolitiFact Ohio asked for evidence. Democratic Party spokesman Justin Barasky directed us specifically to a video posted by Ohio Dems and to the endorsement statement of the Senate Conservatives Fund. Barasky said they show Mandel opposes raising the debt limit, "and by definition (in taking that position) you are endorsing default." The 1 minute 43 second video asserts in its first 20 seconds that Mandel supports allowing the U.S. to go into default, citing an email from the Senate Conservatives Fund as the source. The remainder quotes a variety of sources, including Portman and Boehner, on the dangers of default, and quotes President Ronald Reagan from 1985 on the need to raise the federal debt ceiling. We then looked at the SCF statement. In it, DeMint wrote: "Sherrod Brown supports raising the debt limit. Mandel opposes it." We next called Mandel's spokesman on political matters, Anthony Conchel, to ask about Mandel's position on default. "I'm not going to respond to that," he said, instead providing a quote from Mandel that he said "mirrors his public comments" on the matter: "I am a proud supporter of the 'Cut, Cap and Balance' plan that includes a balanced budget amendment and that passed the House with a bi-partisan vote. If families and small businesses have to tighten their belts and balance their budgets, then government should do the same." Finally, we looked at statements of DeMint, a pivotal figure in the discussion. Shortly before announcing the SCF endorsement of Mandel, DeMint joined nine other Republican senators pledging their opposition to increasing the national debt limit unless Congress cuts spending, enforces spending caps and passes a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. He said he would not support any candidate who would not sign such a pledge. Asked in interviews if that did not make default likely, DeMint said on ABC: "We'll never default. If it's the last penny we have, we'll pay our bills." On NBC, he said, "It certainly will be disruptive if we continue on the track we're going right now," but he dismissed talk of default as "panic" stirred to force a deal: "We are not going to default. We've got enough tax revenue to pay our bills." Where does that leave us? The Ohio Democrats argue that failing to raise the debt limit will inevitably lead to default. And they say the SCF’s opposition to raising the debt ceiling, opposition the SCF says Mandel shares, amounts to an endorsement of default. But there’s some problems with that line of thinking. Opposition to raising the federal debt ceiling is not the same as actively endorsing the idea of the United States defaulting on its obligations. Protest votes opposing previous debt ceiling increases were common from both parties. But that doesn’t mean they were advocating default. No where in a list of policy goals the SCF has posted on its website is there any mention of support for default. And DeMint argues it won’t happen, describing talk of default as "panic" stirred to force a debt ceiling deal. Again, correct or incorrect, DeMint is not advocating default. DeMint himself has said he would support legislation to increase the debt ceiling if it followed provisions in his Cut-Cap-Balance Pledge; substantially cut current spending, cap future spending and require the passage of a strong Balanced Budget Amendment before raising the debt limit. Mandel has endorsed that plan. However unlikely it is that those provisions would gain passage in Congress, it’s far from endorsing default. But perhaps most importly, while declaring Mandel endorses default, the Ohio Democrats don’t rely on Mandel’s words at all. Their cited source was information DeMint and the SCF stated about Mandel. We find the Ohio Democratic Party’s claim isn’t just inaccurate, it’s also ridiculous. On the Truth-O-Meter there’s just one ruling for that kind of statement: Pants on Fire.

pomt-15307	"Texas’ high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2002, to second highest in the country in 2013."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/jul/20/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-shot-no-2-no-27-high-school-/	It hasn’t been long since we checked a Rick Perry claim about the schools in his home state. In June, we found Mostly True the former governor’s declaration that Texas has the second-highest high school graduation rate in the country and the highest graduation rate for African Americans and Hispanics. That was close to entirely right. Then after that, the second-time Republican presidential aspirant caught our interest when he said in a July 2, 2015, speech in Washington, D.C.: "Texas’ high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2002, to second highest in the country in 2013." As we wrote before, Perry was off by a notch in that Texas in 2012-13 tied for third with Wisconsin for its 88 percent graduation rate, according to a February 2015 federal chart. And did Texas rocket past two dozen states from about a decade before? Hold that thought: To arrive at his claim, Perry did the statistical equivalent of mixing apples and artichokes. That is, the measurement he cited for the No. 27 ranking was not the same measurement used to arrive at Texas’ No. 3 ranking. The more recent ranking reflected each state’s four-year "adjusted cohort graduation rate," based on the "number of students who graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who form the adjusted cohort for the graduating class," according to the National Center for Education Statistics, which is part of the U.S. Department of Education. The center says the size of each potential graduating class was adjusted starting the first year of high school by adding students who subsequently transferred in and subtracting students who transferred out, moved to another country or who died as reported by each state. Put another way, if Perry had stuck with the indicator that landed Texas around 27th nationally in 2001-02, he would have ensured accuracy by saying Texas was tied with four states for 22nd in 2011-12, the latest year of available data. A factor in Perry doing otherwise, we speculate, is the metric landing Texas at No. 3 wasn’t universally applied until a few years ago. 2001-02 Our search for 2002 data started with an email to Perry campaign aides asking about the basis of his comparison; we fielded no reply. When we asked the Texas Education Agency about the state’s 2002 graduation rate, spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson advised by email that the agency did not circulate state-by-state rankings at that time because accurate comparisons were believed to be hard to nail. In 2003, though, the Texas Legislature directed the department to "compute dropout rates and graduation rates consistent with federal standards and definitions," Culbertson said. Nationally, she said, a mandated graduation rate standard was put in place in 2008 in accord with the No Child Left Behind Act (which was approved by Congress in 2001). "It took some time for many states to develop the data collection and processing systems to calculate a rate based on four years of individual student-level data," Culbertson wrote. So, Texas in 2012-13 ranked near the top nationally in its graduation rate by a measure that wasn’t in place in 2002. Responding to our request for data covering earlier years, Culbertson noted that in 2002-03, the year after the one singled out by Perry, Texas ranked 29th nationally, tied with Indiana, for its 75.5 percent "averaged freshman graduation rate." New Jersey led the nation with an 87 percent rate. Those rates were calculated, according to the NCES, by dividing the number of high school students who graduated with a regular high school diploma that year by the average of three enrollments: Grade 8 enrollment five years earlier, Grade 9 enrollment four years earlier and Grade 10 enrollment three years earlier Our search of the center’s website led us to an October 2005 report showing averaged freshman graduation rates in 2001-02, Perry’s cited year. Texas then landed 28th among the states, we found, with a 73.5 percent rate. New Jersey led nationally with an 85.8 percent rate. The report’s introduction touched on how this measurement differs from those that track each student individually, stating that while the averaged freshman graduation rate is not as accurate, it "can be computed with currently available data." 2011-12 In 2011-12, the latest year of available data, Texas ranked 22nd nationally in its averaged freshman graduation rate, according to a center chart. The 82 percent rate tied the rates for California, Colorado, Illinois and Kentucky. Vermont and Nebraska tied for first with 93 percent rates. So by this gauge, Texas went from 28th nationally in 2002 to tied for 22nd in 2012. Misleading? We wondered if it mattered that Perry echoed rankings rooted in different calculations. To our inquiries, experts told us his statement was misleading. Grover Whitehurst, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, emailed: "Perry should have used the same measure to compare graduation rates across the years in question rather than one measure for the beginning year and another measure for the ending year. His statement is misleading." Whitehurst agreed the yardstick placing Texas third in 2012-13 wasn’t available in 2002. "It is quite possible to switch measures when discussing different points on the trend line, as the governor did, because of confusion rather than intentional cherry picking of the numbers that make the progress in Texas look best," he wrote. The NCES, he said, publishes "dueling statistics on graduation and completion rates in such a way that a casual reader can easily make the mistake of comparing incommensurate measures." By phone, Walt Haney, a retired Boston College professor, called Perry’s dual-method comparison "potentially extremely misleading. It’s based on different metrics." Haney said it would have been more meaningful to air the state’s rank in 2002 and 2012 by the been-around-longer "averaged freshman graduation rate" indicator. Likewise, Rob Warren, a University of Minnesota sociologist, said Perry tapped incompatible metrics. "On the only metric for which you have measurements over time, there has been little change," Warren said by email. "I infer that not much has changed." Broadly, Warren said by phone, he also doubts the averaged freshman graduation rate indicator delivers accurate state-to-state comparisons. He said that’s because each state has leeway to define what goes into the rate calculations. Of note, he said, is whether a state as a whole holds back a lot of ninth-grade students. If so, the related graduation rate calculation will distort actual results--to the detriment of the state’s standing. Perry’s claim misleads, Warren said, because the 2013 and 2002 percentages don’t measure the same thing. "So you may be higher on one, lower on the other, that doesn’t tell you which one is right. They have similar names, purport to measure similar things, but they’re not the same thing," he said. Our ruling Perry said: "Texas’ high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2002, to 2nd highest in the country in 2013." Texas graduation rates improved while Perry was governor. But this comparison evidently jammed together results reached by different calculations--a statistical no-no leaving the misimpression that Texas galloped past many states on Perry’s watch. It looks to us like Texas actually moved from about 27th nationally in 2002 to tied for 22nd in 2012, according to a measure that compares graduates each year to tallies of students earlier enrolled in lower grades. By a newer gauge tied to tracking individual students, Texas in 2013 tied for third (not No. 2). We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-14689	"As governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/13/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-governor-he-helped-reduce-youth-hero/	Addiction is a deeply personal issue for Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, whose daughter Noelle suffered from addiction and a string of related criminal charges while he was serving as governor of Florida. In a Medium post on Jan. 5, 2016, Bush offered a glimpse into "the heartbreak of drug abuse" that his family had experienced, along with policy proposals to better address addiction. In the column, Bush discussed his record on drug policy during his gubernatorial tenure. "As governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent," Bush wrote. Bush took office in January 1999 and left in January 2007. We took a closer look into that statistic. (A few days later, Bush turned Noelle's story into a television ad.) The Bush campaign pointed us to the 2006 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey conducted by the Florida Department of Children and Families. (Although several surveys of drug use are released on an annual basis, experts told us that this is the only survey that would speak to the specific numerical claim Bush made.) For heroin use, the survey offers two measurements -- heroin use at any time of one’s life, and heroin use during the past 30 days. For the first category -- use of heroin in one’s lifetime -- 2.2 percent of respondents between the ages of 11 and 18 had used it in 2000, compared to 1.1 percent in 2006. That’s a 50 percent decrease. And for the second category -- heroin use in the past 30 days -- 0.8 percent reported using it in 2000, compared to 0.4 percent in 2006. That’s also down by 50 percent. So numerically, Bush has a point. Still, experts said it’s worth taking those numbers with a grain of salt. Testing the numbers One concern is that the percentage of youth using heroin is small, meaning the differences from year to year are small -- and this makes them potentially unreliable. Indeed, the report itself cautions, "Heroin use in a school population is extremely rare. Nationally, no lifetime prevalence rate for heroin has exceeded 2.4 percent in the 8th, 10th or 12th grades in the past decade. … Given the extremely low prevalence rates associated with heroin use by Florida students, analyses that attempt to precisely specify or quantify changes over time are subject to error." In addition, for both measurements, the biggest drop came between 2000 and 2001, with minimal changes between 2002 and 2006. That seemed curious to Lloyd Johnston, a senior research scientist at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and principal investigator of the Monitoring the Future study, which tracks drug use in the United States. "While that is possible, I don't think it very plausible," Johnston said. "Rates almost always change more gradually." One possible explanation for that pattern, he said, is that the 2000 survey collected its data in December and January, whereas the 2001 to 2005 surveys conducted their data in April and May of those years. A further curiosity, Johnston said, is that one would not expect a one-year decline that steep for lifetime heroin use. From year to year, the pool of respondents is mostly the same. In the first year, the survey includes youth who are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 years of age. The following year, the 18-year-olds drop out and a new group of 11-year-olds joins, but all the other groups are included again. With such modest changes from year to year in the makeup of the age groups, one would not expect a large change in heroin use over a lifetime from one year to the next, Johnston said. "That makes the lifetime improvement in 2001 highly implausible," Johnston said, adding that a sizable change in the 30-day-rates would be more plausible. What was Bush’s role? There’s also a separate issue: Did Bush’s policies help engineer this decline? That’s hard to say, though drug-policy experts in Florida do praise Bush for his work on the issue. James Hall, a drug abuse epidemiologist at Nova Southeastern University, said that Bush gave the issue high priority, including the creation of a drug policy office out of his own office to coordinate law enforcement, treatment, education and prevention. The office -- which was later eliminated by Gov. Rick Scott -- made a "very significant contribution" to drug policy in the state, Hall said. In addition, Bush championed community-based anti-drug coalitions that helped consolidate prevention efforts, Hall said. And his wife Columba was also active in drug- and alcohol-abuse issues, he added. Still, such efforts likely had a "marginal influence" on heroin-use rates, Hall said. Often, broader issues such as demographic and social trends have a bigger impact. Indeed, it’s worth noting that heroin use among youth was declining nationally during roughly the same period. Johnston’s own study found that heroin use among youth was declining nationally between 1999 and 2007, the full extent of Bush's term in office. "For the three grades we study (eighth, 10th, and 12th), the combined prevalence of heroin use during the prior 12 months declined from 1.3 percent in 1999 to 0.8 percent in 2007," he said. That’s a drop of about 40 percent -- not far from what the Florida-only survey found. Our ruling Bush said that "as governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent." The only statistics that directly address his statement offer numeric support. However, the report in question cautions against drawing broad conclusions for such low-frequency events as youth heroin addiction, and experts thought it curious that the drop essentially happened in the first year, with little change after that. Experts praise Bush for his drug policies, but it’s important to note that broader demographic and social factors -- reflected in falling youth heroin use nationally during that period -- likely made a difference as well.

pomt-08523	Says Roy Blunt "secretly inserts language to benefit tobacco giant Philip Morris" into a national security bill while "Blunt's girlfriend and son are lobbyists for the cigarette company, and just days earlier, 26 Philip Morris executives wrote checks to Blunt totaling $23,000."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/05/commonsense-ten/commonsense-ten-ad-accuses-roy-blunt-secretly-inse/	An independent group called Commonsense Ten has begun airing attack ads in several key Senate races including Missouri, where they have come after Rep. Roy Blunt with a potent cocktail, accusing Blunt of trying to push through pro-tobacco legislation while dating a Philip Morris lobbyist and cashing campaign checks from Philip Morris executives. Commonsense Ten, led by several Democratic strategists, sets the stage with a time/date stamp at the beginning of the ad: U.S. Capitol, Washington D.C., Nov. 13, 2002. And then the conspiratorial-sounding voice-over: "A critical national security bill is up for a vote. Just hours before, Roy Blunt secretly inserts language to benefit tobacco giant Philip Morris. Blunt's girlfriend and son are lobbyists for the cigarette company, and just days earlier, 26 Philip Morris executives wrote checks to Blunt totaling $23,000." Republican Blunt's Democratic opponent Robin Carnahan included a similar allegation in one of her ads, stating, "Congressman Roy Blunt. He got caught trying to insert a secret deal for tobacco giant Philip Morris into a bill just days after company executives gave him $30,000." The Commonsense Ten version scores an attack-ad trifecta. Big tobacco. Girlfriend and son lobbying for said big tobacco. And pay-to-play. But is it accurate? Let's start with the stuff in the ad that's not contested, or at least is well-documented. Back in November 2002, Blunt was dating Abigail Perlman, who was at that time a lobbyist for Philip Morris (and whom Blunt would later marry). Blunt's son, Andrew, was a lobbyist for Philip Morris in Missouri (not a federal lobbyist). And records show that Blunt got the donations cited in the ad from Philip Morris executives. Now, to the contested part, whether Blunt secretly inserted language in a national security bill to benefit tobacco giant Philip Morris. It's an allegation that originated with a June 11, 2003 story in the Washington Post. The Washington Post cited several unnamed sources who alleged Blunt -- just named the new majority whip -- "surprised his fellow top Republicans by trying to quietly insert a provision benefiting Philip Morris USA into the 475-page bill creating a Department of Homeland Security." The story went on, "Once alerted to the provision, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert's chief of staff, Scott Palmer, quickly had it pulled out, said a senior GOP leader who requested anonymity. Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Tex., also opposed what Blunt (Mo.) was trying to do, the member said, and 'worked against it' when he learned of it." According to the Post, "the provision would have made it harder to sell tobacco products over the Internet and would have cracked down on the sale of contraband cigarettes, two practices that cut into Philip Morris's profits." Groups like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids opposed the Blunt provision at the time, arguing it had less to do with national security, which Blunt's office said was its intention, and more to do with protecting American cigarette companies. Among other things, they argued that while cracking down on cigarette smugglers, it also would have prevented U.S. tobacco companies from being sued by foreign governments which charged them with intentionally supporting international cigarette smuggling to avoid duties and taxes. The Post story quoted a "senior Republican lawmaker who requested anonymity" saying "some GOP members worried at the time that it would be 'embarrassing' to the party and its new whip if details of the effort were made public." According to the story, "Another Republican said Blunt's effort angered some leaders because there was 'so little support for' a pro-tobacco provision likely to generate controversy." Then, as now, Blunt defended the provision as good policy and a bona fide homeland security issue. Blunt spokesman Rich Chrismer told us in an e-mail, "The provision Roy Blunt and members of the House leadership supported would have cracked down on the illegal sale of contraband cigarettes to fund terrorist activities. Bipartisan legislation, originally sponsored by Democratic Senator Herb Kohl and Congressman Anthony Weiner, passed overwhelmingly in both bodies and is now the law of the land." Chrismer cited news accounts that documented the growing concern among federal law enforcement officials that smugglers were using millions of dollars acquired from illegal cigarette sales and funneling the cash to organizations such as al Qaeda and Hezbollah. Chrismer also forwarded a letter former Majority Leader Dick Armey wrote to Blunt on July 21, 2004: "I have been reading a lot about the anti-terrorism provision that you and others wanted to include in the homeland security bill in November 2002, and I wanted to correct the record on a few circumstances surrounding that effort." Armey wrote that he "not only agreed with the provision, but understood the Senate would be supportive." "I recall that the Speaker's office was concerned that the Judiciary Committee had not yet thoroughly reviewed the provision by means of committee hearings and markup," Armey wrote. "He did not want a jurisdictional fight on his hands, and it is his job to manage those issues. But, since then, the Judiciary Committee has held hearings and approved a freestanding bill to crack down on illegal sales of cigarettes and eliminate a source of funding for terrorist groups. "The effort you and I supported has great momentum now," Armey stated, "and I am tired of reading stories that only tell half the truth." But the provision proposed by Blunt was not identical to the later Kohl/Weiner bill referenced by Blunt spokesman Chrismer, which ultimately passed. The Kohl/Weiner legislation was similar, in that it sought to address Internet cigarette sales and other contraband trafficking of tobacco products. But there was nothing in that bill about blocking foreign governments from bringing lawsuits against U.S. tobacco companies in U.S. courts for their involvement in tobacco tax evasion or related contraband trafficking. That's the part of Blunt's provision that groups like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids opposed. In fact, the Campaign strongly supported the later, bipartisan legislation. According to a 2003 press release from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, "The problem of contraband and Internet sales of tobacco products is a serious one that Congress should address. But the approach advocated by Philip Morris and Rep. Blunt is narrowly written to protect only Philip Morris’ commercial interests and not the broader public health or state government interests involved." Allegations of "secretly inserting" provisions into bills are often a matter of interpretation. In this case, hours before a final vote on the Homeland Security Bill, Blunt proposed a provision that had not been vetted in a committee meeting or in legislative markup sessions. It may have been added in a way that meant there was little notice and little discussion, but that doesn't necessarily add up to "secretly." Blunt may argue the provision was a legitimate homeland security concern and that a similar version later received bipartisan support. But the Blunt provision was opposed by some anti-tobacco groups, who viewed it as special interest legislation to benefit big tobacco. And we note that those groups did not oppose the later legislation. When you date (and later marry) a Philip Morris lobbyist, when you have a son who works as a tobacco lobbyist, when you accept hefty sums of campaign money from tobacco executives, and then you add an 11th hour provision that some view as pro-big tobacco, you leave yourself open to the kind of criticism raised in the ad. "Secretly" may be overstating how Blunt acted, but the ad's other points are backed up, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-00439	On conservative mega-donor Richard Uihlein.	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/23/leah-vukmir/flip-flop-leah-vukmir-accused-donor-trying-buy-us-/	In the space of nine days, Leah Vukmir went from condemning Richard Uihlein’s campaign cash to essentially soliciting it. Seem like a flip-flop? Unwrap the Flip-O-Meter, which we use to rate a person’s consistency on an issue — in this case, Vukmir’s position toward Uihlein, the conservative mega-donor. Who is Uihlein? Uihlein, an Illinois resident, is a founder of Uline Corp., a shipping and packaging supply company based in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., near the Illinois border. If anyone could almost single-handedly make political newcomer Kevin Nicholson into a viable candidate for the U.S. Senate, it was Uihlein. All of our fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Nicholson ultimately lost to Vukmir, a longtime state lawmaker, in the Aug. 14, 2018 Republican primary for the right to take on the incumbent, Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin, in the fall. But he took the fight to Vukmir -- in no small part because of spending by Uihlein. Groups supported by Uihlein spent nearly $11 million in support of Nicholson and against his rival, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported several days before the primary. For example, the Uihlein-backed group Solutions for Wisconsin made a $911,000 television buy in the final days. What Vukmir said about him Now, to what Vukmir has said about Uihlein — the contrasting statements having been pointed out in an Associated Press news article. Aug. 6, 2018: "Try to buy" Eight days before the primary, Vukmir was salty toward Uihlein. "I think it leaves a bad taste in the mouth of a lot of people that a particular out-of-state donor is spending as much money as he is to, in essence, almost try to buy a Senate seat, and that’s not what Wisconsin politics is about," Vukmir told Green Bay conservative radio talk show John Muir, in a clear reference to Uihlein. That Vukmir remark echoed criticism from Democrats, who 10 months earlier were complaining that Uihlein was trying to buy the seat for Nicholson. Aug. 15, 2018: "Reaching out" The day after her primary win, however, Vukmir was conciliatory. "We are already reaching out to Dick Uihlein and I hope that he will want to continue with his commitment," Vukmir said to conservative Milwaukee radio talk show host Mark Belling. "Let’s face it, he wants to defeat Tammy Baldwin. And so I will look forward to having that conversation with him," Vukmir added, noting she would be attending a unity dinner two days later co-hosted by Uihlein. Our rating The Flip-O-Meter has three ratings: No Flip – No significant change in position. Half Flip – A partial change in position. Full Flop – A complete change in position. In this case, Vukmir went from condemning Uihlein’s campaign contributions to essentially soliciting them. It may be understandable, given Uihlein’s resources, that Vukmir would decide to seek his support. But it’s also a Full Flop.

pomt-01064	"If you ask how many times did Ronald Reagan attend a fundraiser when he ran for re-election in 1984, the answer is eight times. If you say how many times did Barack Obama attend a fundraiser in 2012, the answer is 228 times."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/jan/20/lawrence-lessig/lawrence-lessig-compares-number-fundraisers-betwee/	Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig has recently been making a frigid, 150-mile walk through New Hampshire to promote campaign finance reform. Lessig, the founder of the crowdfunded Mayday PAC -- known as the super-PAC to end all super-PACs -- kicked off the 10-day march in the tiny Northern New Hampshire town of Dixville Notch, known for its midnight ballot box voting during the "first in the nation" primary. His walk will take him and dozens others to the state capitol in Concord by Jan. 21. In a visit to the Concord Monitor before starting the walk, Lessig offered a striking comparison showing how the role of money in politics has changed over the years. To Lessig, fundraising has become a primary focus for today’s politicians, at the expense of governing. "If you ask how many times did Ronald Reagan attend a fundraiser when he ran for re-election in 1984, the answer is eight times. If you say how many times did Barack Obama attend a fundraiser in 2012, the answer is 228 times," Lessig told the Monitor. He continued, "And you think, how does a man, as a person, run the nation when he's attending 228 fundraisers? And the answer is not very well. It's pretty terrible for your ability to do your job. It's pretty terrible for your ability to be responsive to the American people, because -- let me tell you -- the American people are not attending 228 fundraisers. Those people are different." It’s no secret that truckloads of dollars are raised and spent in presidential elections, but PolitiFact New Hampshire wondered whether Lessig’s specific comparison between Reagan and Obama was accurate. Lessig isn’t the first to make the comparison between Reagan and Obama on fundraising; similar statistics have surfaced in various media reports. These comparisons track back to a distinction in campaign financing that we’ll recap here. The story begins in 1972, the year of President Richard Nixon’s re-election campaign. (Yes, the one that led to the Watergate scandal.) That year, the Nixon re-election campaign collected millions of dollars in illegal campaign contributions. After Nixon’s resignation, Congress passed (and Nixon’s successor as president, Gerald Ford, signed into law) changes to the Federal Election Campaign Act. Once enacted, presidential candidates were able to receive a partial federal match for money they raised for the primary, up to $5 million. And for the general election, candidates could secure full federal funding -- up to $20 million -- as long as they raised no private money for the general election and stuck to expenditure limits. That system prevailed for the better part of three decades. However, in recent presidential campaign cycles, the system began to break down due to a combination of court decisions and changes in how presidential campaigns prefer to operate. An arms-race style competition between the parties has left any candidate who accepts the restrictions tied to federal funding at a severe disadvantage, since candidates can easily raise more private money than the federal allotment, without the strings attached. Obama is one of those politicians. He was the first president since Nixon to be elected with only private money. And to give some perspective on the amount of money we’re talking about, more than $2 billion was raised and spent in the last presidential election between Obama and Mitt Romney. When we contacted Lessig to see where he was getting his data comparing Obama to Reagan, he pointed to a presentation by Fred Wertheimer, a lawyer and founder of Democracy 21, a group that advocates curbing the influence of big money in American politics. In his presentation -- made at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School in October, 2012 -- Wertheimer said the system for public financing of presidential elections, which emerged in the wake of the Watergate scandal, is broken. Reagan used the public financing system for his campaign in 1984 and did not have a primary opponent, eliminating his need to raise money during the primary and general election. Reagan "ran for re-election without holding a single campaign fundraiser," reported Washington Post national political editor Dan Eggen in a 2012 article, "Post-Watergate campaign finance limits undercut by changes." "If he attended fundraisers, they must have been for the party or for other GOP candidates," concurred Viveca Novak, the editorial and communications director at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money raised by politicians running for federal offices. Lessig later pointed to an article in the Baltimore Sun by Brendan Doherty -- a political science professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of the book, The Rise of the President’s Permanent Campaign. Doherty counted 220 fundraisers for the Obama Victory Fund, compared to just three fundraisers "headlined" by Ronald Reagan during his third and fourth years in office, leading up to his re-election. Doherty doesn’t break down the fundraisers year by year, and instead uses a campaign cycle, which usually spans two calendar years. His numbers match those cited by USA Today, which reported on Aug. 12, 2012, that Obama had attended his 200th fundraiser since filing for re-election in the spring of 2011. Obama attended five fundraisers in one day in Chicago, including one at which guests paid $40,000 per ticket, according to the newspaper. Doherty counted the fundraisers by using the public papers of the presidents of the United States, presidential libraries and Lexis-Nexis searches of Associated Press articles. "My numbers are a bit different from the trend you cite, but (the) shift from Reagan to Obama in terms of time spent fundraising has been dramatic," Doherty told the Monitor. All told, Reagan received about $40 million in public financing during his campaign -- while Obama raised more than $715 million in private funds. With the demise of the public financing system and looser rules on raising and spending money, said Novak of the Center for Responsive Politics, "fundraising is unfortunately a bigger part of the process than ever before," Novak said. Our ruling Lessig said Reagan attended eight fundraisers in 1984, while Obama attended 228 in the 2012 cycle. We couldn’t replicate his exact numbers, but they jibe with reports by experts and the logic of how the public- and private-financing systems work. There’s certainly little doubt about Lessig’s larger point -- that there’s been a sea change in spending on presidential elections during the past 30 years. On balance, we rate Lessig’s claim Mostly True.	None	Lawrence Lessig	None	None	None	2015-01-20T17:30:09	2015-01-05	['Ronald_Reagan', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-06252	"At a minimum, 40 percent of those who view child pornography end up molesting children as a result."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/nov/30/mike-dewine/mike-dewine-cites-link-between-viewing-child-porno/	There is no category of crimes more revolting to most people than sexual crimes committed against children. In the wake of the Penn State scandal, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine rolled out a new "Crimes Against Children" initiative on Nov. 18 targeting Internet predators who trade child pornography or actually molest or attempt to molest children. Flanked by police chiefs and prosecutors, DeWine announced that he was dedicating a new 15-person unit to focus on stopping crimes against children. The unit would be part of the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation, which is run by his office. Attempting to demonstrate the prevalence of the crimes in today’s society, DeWine focused on the link between viewers of child pornography and the actual molestation of children. "At a minimum, 40 percent of those who view child pornography end up molesting children as a result," DeWine said. "At least 40 percent, some estimates as high as 80 percent." PolitiFact Ohio was struck by the relatively high percentage cited by DeWine and the cause and effect he said exists between viewing child porn and committing physical acts of sexual contact against children. Could four in 10 people who viewed child porn really be committing sexual acts against children? We turned first to DeWine’s office for some supporting evidence, who quickly e-mailed us a pair of studies said to back up his claim. The first study, entitled "A Profile of Pedophilia: Definition, Characteristics of Offenders, Recidivism, Treatment Outcomes, and Forensic Issues, is from doctors at the Mayo Clinic. It states that 30 to 80 percent of arrested individuals who viewed child pornography and 76 percent of individuals who were arrested for Internet child pornography had molested a child, according to studies and case reports. The study quotes from a November 2004 article from the American Prosecutors Research Institute called "From Fantasy to Reality: The Link Between Viewing Child Pornography and Molesting Children" written by Candice Kim. It also apparently references a 2000 study of sex offender inmates in a Federal Bureau of Prisons program. Kim’s report cites a U.S. Postal Inspection Service finding that 80 percent of purchasers of child pornography are active abusers and nearly 40 percent of the child pornographers investigated over several years have sexually molested children. A footnote indicates the statement is taken from the 2002 testimony Ernie Allen, director of The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, when he appeared before a congressional committee. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service made 1,807 child porn arrests from January 1997 to March 2004 which netted 620 "confirmed child molesters," the article states. That is a child molestor rate of 34.3 percent, according to the statistic provided by U.S. Postal Inspection Service Agent Ray Smith during a 2004 interview with Kim. Other statistics found in the report include a Pennsylvania-based law enforcement task force reporting that 51 percent of individuals arrested for pornography-related offense were also determined to be actively molesting children or to have molested in the past. In Dallas, a similar task force put that figure at 31 percent. The original source of those statements was again Allen’s 2002 congressional testimony. The other study cited by DeWine’s office is a 2005 study funded by a congressional grant to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. In that study of 1,713 people arrested nationwide for child pornography in a one-year period from July 2000 to July 2001, 40 percent were "dual offenders" who sexually victimized children and possessed child pornography with both crimes discovered in the same investigation. So what are all these studies saying? They are saying there is a link between those arrested by various state and federal law enforcement agencies for child porn possession and acts of molestation of children by this same group of people. What the do not say, though, is that the link exists for the entire group of people that views child porn and whether those people molest children. As the 2005 National Center for Missing & Exploited Children report puts it "we do not know if these child porn possessors were representative of all Internet-related child porn possessors." Furthermore, that report states that there is no known evidence supporting cause and effect -- that simply possessing child pornography encourages or causes child victimization. There has been no study of this issue. "Knowing a considerable number of dual offenders were discovered during investigations of Internet-related, child-sexual victimization and child porn possession cases does not explain how possessing child pornography is related to child victimization or whether it encourages or causes such victimization," states the report. "We do not have data to determine this." Later, the report states as to whether the child porn viewing is done before the molesting "we had no information about the sequencing of crimes committed by dual offenders." Meanwhile, a 2000 study done by psychologists working with prisoners in the Federal Bureau of Prisons sex offender treatment program found that 76 percent of inmates charged with child pornography crimes admitted to having committed contact sex crimes. That study was followed up in 2009 by a similar study which found that 85 percent of 155 convicted sex offenders had committed at least one "hands on sexual offense." However, a paper prepared by one of the primary authors of both studies, Andres Hernandez, stresses not to apply the statistics of those convicted of child porn possession to the larger "unknown" population of child porn users. "The number of individuals who are apprehended by law enforcement for committing child porn offenses represents a small proportion of the population of individuals collecting, trading and producing child pornography worldwide," Hernandez writes. "Some individuals have misused the results (of the two studies) to fuel the argument that the majority of child porn offenders are indeed contact sexual offenders and, therefore, dangerous predators. This is simply not supported by the scientific evidence." Said Hernandez’s paper: "Some individuals in law enforcement are tempted to rely on a biased interpretation of our study...to prove that the majority of child porn offenders are child molestors." Hernandez’s paper also notes something not reported in this 2009 study — that a 42-person sample of the prisoners were asked questions about when they began possessing child porn compared to when they began committing contact sexual crimes. "The vast majority of our subjects indicated they committed hands-on abuse prior to seeking child pornography via the Internet," he writes. "The results indicated that in 41 of 42 cases examined hands-on sexual crimes preceded child porn offenses." So where are we left as we bid this abhorrent subject goodbye? At a news conference promoting a crackdown on sexual crimes against children, DeWine made statements stating that "at a minimum 40 percent of those who view child pornography end up molesting children as a result." Molestation crimes are horrific. And while DeWine’s statement is overly broad, it does contain an element of truth: that people who commit acts of child molestation also often view child pornography. His statements are based on studies which are all of those arrested for child porn offenses and range from a 31 percent child molester rate up to 85 percent, depending on the study. However, several of the authors of those studies caution that the numbers should not be generalized to the bigger universe of all people who have viewed child porn -- those who have been arrested and those who have not. And that’s exactly what DeWine did. And researchers caution that there is no evidence that the molesting of children by those possessing child porn takes place as a result of viewing the child porn, a claim made by DeWine. Quite to the contrary, study of this cause-effect relationship we found suggests that nearly all offenders committed acts of molestation prior to looking at child porn. Those are critical facts that would give a different impression of DeWine’s claim. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-05828	Says critics called the original GI Bill "welfare."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/feb/17/lawrence-odonnell/lawrence-odonnell-says-critics-called-original-gi-/	In a promotional spot for his MSNBC program, Lawrence O’Donnell speaks proudly of his father attending college on the post-World War II benefits package that transformed the nation. O’Donnell further says of the original GI Bill: "It’s the most successful educational program that we’ve ever had in this country -- and the critics called it welfare." They did? Austin lawyer Terral Smith, a former Republican member of the Texas House, urged us to check this after seeing the ad in January. After asking MSNBC to elaborate, we looked for authoritative recaps of how the far-reaching law came to be. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act, the "GI Bill of Rights," into law in June 1944, according to the Veterans Administration’s online history of the agency. Broadly, the history says, the act provided millions of veterans with up to four years of education or training, plus a monthly subsistence allowance; offered them federally guaranteed home, farm and business loans with no down payment; and provided for unemployment compensation of $20 weekly for up to 52 weeks for veterans who had served 90 days or more. The VA’s web post is silent on the act’s progress through Congress -- and any related criticism. Next, we turned to the American Legion’s online post of a 1949 article by a Washington reporter, David Camelon, recapping the law’s roots. This story says the American Legion drafted the proposal in 1943 and lobbied for it the first part of 1944 -- surprisingly drawing early opposition from other veterans groups, including the Disabled American Veterans. According to the article, that group’s representative, Millard Rice, sent a Feb. 22, 1944, letter to Walter George, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, objecting to the proposed unemployment benefits. Rice’s letter said, in part: "The lazy and 'chisely' types of veterans would get the most benefits, whereas the resourceful, industrious and conscientious veterans would get the least benefits, if any." The article says Rice and others assumed too many veterans would idle for the 52 weeks of unemployment payments. Despite such critiques, a revised version of the proposal shortly won unanimous Senate approval, according to the article. In the House, though, Rep. John Rankin, chairman of its committee for veterans affairs, had misgivings about the unemployment compensation element. In his 2009 book, "Beyond the Bonus March and GI Bill," Stephen Ortiz, an assistant professor of history at Binghamton University, says Rankin "viewed the educational features (of the GI Bill) with skepticism, believing that only a small percentage of already privileged veterans would take advantage of them. Moreover, he treated the unemployment features with outright disdain. An ardent white supremacist, Rankin feared the unemployment provision’s impact on the work habits of the African Americans in his state and region. African Americans would not quickly rejoin the work force, he argued, if they were being paid generous unemployment benefits. Rankin complained further that it would ‘spoil’ them." In a telephone interview, Ortiz told us that no critics called the GI Bill "welfare," but some admirers later considered the law a welcome step toward the United States becoming more of a social-welfare state. Back to our timeline: House committee members sent their version of the legislation to the House, which gave unanimous approval in May 1944, the American Legion story says. A House-Senate conference committee convened to iron out differences between the bodies. By early June 1944, its members had resolved many provisions though, the article says, they broke down seemingly over which agency would oversee veteran job placements, a standoff that the article calls a camouflage for continued uncertainty over the measure’s 52-20 unemployment compensation feature. The impasse ultimately cleared after a Georgia member of the conference panel flew in overnight to vote for the compromise, the story says. By email, MSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski sent us two batches of excerpts, some attributed to members of Congress as quoted in the 1944 Congressional Record. Many of the excerpts covered objections noted in the American Legion magazine article. A memo from Melissa Ryerson, a producer of O’Donnell’s program, says some lawmakers and critics also fretted over the GI Bill’s "broad" education provisions. The memo also suggests that objections mentioning "relief" or "the dole" were equivalent to modern-day references to welfare. "If Mr. O’Donnell had used the word ‘relief’ instead of ‘welfare’" in the advertisement, the memo says, "no one would have understood what he meant." A sampling of MSNBC’s excerpts: -- Comments from Rep. Rankin about fearing a "tremendous inducement to certain elements to try to get employment compensation. It is going to be very easy… to induce these people to get on federal relief." Another Rankin comment, suggesting the proposal would reward those who delayed seeking work: "The bane of the British Empire has been the dole system." He also aired a racist comment, saying: "If every white serviceman in Mississippi… could read this so-called GI Bill, I don’t believe there would be one in 20 who would approve of it... We have 50,000 Negroes in the service from our state and in, in my opinion, if the bill should pass in its present form, a vast majority of them would remain unemployed for at least another year, and a great many white men would do the same." -- A 1950 Saturday Evening Post article stating: "The education and training section of the GI Bill became, in reality, a relief act or a bonus act… more than 15 million veterans [were still] entitled to an average of 40 months of schooling at government expense, including subsistence." --A comment attributed to Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago from 1929 to 1951: "Colleges and universities will find themselves converted into educational hobo jungles… [The GI Bill] is a threat to American education [and] education is not a device for coping with mass unemployment." We spotted the same comment in a November 2004 commentary on the GI Bill’s origin by writers Paul Dickson and Thomas B. Allen. Before quoting Hutchins’ "hobo jungle" warning, the commentary says: "Racist politicians opposed provisions of the bill that would ‘put money in the pockets of black vets’ and some elitist educators opposed higher education as a benefit." By 1956, the commentary says, the law had helped to produce 450,000 engineers, 238,000 teachers, 91,000 scientists, 67,000 doctors, 22,000 dentists, and more than 1 million other college-trained men and women. Also, it says, 11 million of 13 million houses built in the 1950s were financed with GI Bill loans. Ortiz and Nancy Beck Young, a University of Houston historian who has studied the legislative history of the GI Bill, each told us it would be incorrect to say critics called the proposal welfare. Beck Young told us in a telephone interview that members of Congress were intent on ensuring returning troops did not face the fate of World War I veterans, some of whom marched on Washington only to be ignored and then mistreated. While there were concerns about the unemployment provisions and the measure's overall cost, she said, they "did not call it welfare. The (congressional) debates were about fine-tuning. Everybody realized something that had to be done; something generous." Beck Young cautioned against "cherry-picked research. It’s not right to say they called it welfare." Our ruling We found no evidence of critics referring to the GI Bill as welfare. Yet some fretted that the law’s unemployment compensation element would encourage laziness. We see a touch of truth to O’Donnell’s claim, which we rate Mostly False.	None	Lawrence O'Donnell	None	None	None	2012-02-17T13:03:26	2012-01-31	['None']

pomt-01062	"Today, home sales are up nearly 50 percent from where they were in the worst of the crisis."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/20/barack-obama/home-sales-are-nearly-50-percent-worst-housing-cri/	President Barack Obama is touting the apparent success of his policy decisions in speeches, telling a crowd in Phoenix that his actions have led to a rebound in the housing market. At a speech at Central High School on Jan. 8, 2015, Obama said programs to stop people from losing their homes and to help move homeless veterans off the streets has led to tangible economic benefits. "So as a result of all these efforts, today, home sales are up nearly 50 percent from where they were in the worst of the crisis." PolitiFact wondered if home sales had really jumped that much, or if Obama was just selling us a line. Tour of homes We contacted the White House, which said they used two sets of data to formulate this claim. One is new home sales, the measure of newly constructed houses as measured by the Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Commerce. The other is existing home sales, which is compiled by the National Association of Realtors. The two are tracked by separate entities because new home sales involve measuring other economic indicators, as well, like construction jobs and materials. The numbers the White House provided were measured like this: They took the average of the last six months of available data (ending November 2014, in this case) and compared it to the lowest point in sales for both kinds of sales. Those low points were in different months for each type of sale (February 2011 for new home sales and July 2010 for existing home sales). The census data an Obama spokesperson provided matched what we found independently, but existing home sales data are a little trickier. The National Association of Realtors splits that into two groups, single-family homes and condos or co-ops. The White House supplied single-family home numbers only, but NAR spokesperson Adam DeSanctis said the best measure is to combine both, because that gives a better overall picture, so we looked at it that way, too. Because we don’t want to make your head spin from all these digits, we’ll chart it out for you: Sale type June-November 2014 average Low point during recession Percent change New home sales 432,000 270,000 (February 2011) + 60 percent Existing home sales (single-family homes only) 4.49 million 3.06 million (July 2010) + 47 percent Existing home sales (single-family homes + condos and co-ops) 5.096 million 3.45 million (July 2010) + 48 percent For reference, this is approaching a return to more normal transaction numbers, because sales were grossly inflated during the housing bubble. Sales of new homes reached a peak of almost 1.4 million in July 2005, while existing home sales topped out at 7.26 million in September 2005, before the bubble finally burst around 2008. Obama said "nearly 50 percent," so he could be talking about simply existing home sales, but the White House supplied us with both. We can’t simply average out the two different percentages because they cover different time periods, but both have recovered considerably. Beyond an upswing in sales, reports from real estate data firms RealtyTrac and Core Logic show foreclosure filings (things like default notices, bank repossessions and scheduled auctions) in 2014 were down more than 60 percent from their 2010 high of 2.87 million, back to pre-recession levels. That’s not to say the housing market is necessarily robust, either. Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies said in its latest State of the Nation’s Housing report that new single-family housing starts are still depressed, and existing home inventories are constrained. Households that pay an excessive portion of their incomes to live in their property remain near historical highs, as well. In any case, the approximation of the rebound in the national market is accurate, although one expert told us it still doesn’t paint the clearest picture of the economic recovery. "While encouraging, national numbers mask the uneven nature of the housing recovery," said Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University. "In many towns and neighborhoods the legacy of the crisis is strong, and these areas continue to struggle with weak demand, underwater homeowners and high levels of vacancy and abandonment." Debbie Goldstein, executive vice president at consumer protection group the Center for Responsible Lending, credits the Obama administration for pushing several policy positions that helped prospective homebuyers secure loans, and helped delinquent homeowners refinance. She said the Home Affordable Refinance Program that started in 2009 saved many homeowners from defaulting on their mortgages. She also said more recent underwriting rules will help lenders and buyers avoid some problems that led to the housing crisis. But she also said Washington could have done more, such as reducing principal for underwater homeowners, helping more first-time homebuyers get into the market and improve lending access to minorities. Plus, Congress could always roll back the underwriting rules and change everything. Our ruling Obama said, "Today, home sales are up nearly 50 percent from where they were in the worst of the crisis." That number matches census data for new home sales, although the White House said they also based the claim on existing home sales, which have increased by about 60 percent over the lowest point during the recession. The national numbers are largely accurate, although Obama’s statement doesn’t provide details about pockets of the market still experiencing trouble, nor does it address whether the recovery would have happened regardless of his policies -- although experts say those policies were a factor in the recovery. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-01-20T19:32:51	2015-01-08	['None']
pomt-02741	"About 40 percent of workers don’t ... have a single paid sick day."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/17/vicki-shabo/about-40-percent-workers-dont-even-have-single-pai/	Panelists on MSNBC’s The Cycle chewed on the topic of mandatory paid leave -- and how it isn’t a thing for all American workers -- on the heels of new legislation from Democrats that would create a program to make it happen. The Family and Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act, sponsored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., would allow workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid family and sick leave through the creation of a trust fund, administered by the Social Security Administration, that would be funded by contributions from employers and employees of 0.2 percent of earnings (2 cents per $10). One big supporter is the National Partnership for Women and Families, which was very involved in the passage of the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act of 1993 that guaranteed 12 weeks of unpaid leave for most workers. Now, the group is pushing for the law to go even further so that more workers can take off -- and be paid -- during emergencies. America is far behind the modern world in the area of paid leave, said Cycle guest Vicki Shabo, director of work and family programs at the National Partnership for Women and Families, on Dec. 12, 2013. "About 40 percent of workers don’t even have a single paid sick day," Shabo said, "much less the long-term leave that the FAMILY Act would provide." We wondered if her statistic was accurate. Her source: the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2013 National Compensation Survey. The data show 61 percent of all private-sector workers were offered paid sick leave, leaving about 40 percent without it. The BLS count for public and private workers, excluding those who are self-employed or work for the federal government, is a tad higher at 65 percent. State and local government workers have a much higher rate of getting paid sick leave compared to other sectors, at about 89 percent. Employees of smaller firms and the leisure and hospitality sector are the least likely to have paid medical leave, the survey shows. The rate of paid sick leave increases with pay level, with the rise of white-collar jobs being the main reason that more workers have access to paid sick leave than 20 years ago. Under current law, workers are eligible for 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for reasons that include childbirth, caring for a spouse, child or parent with a serious health issue, dealing with a serious health problem of their own, among others. According to the Department of Labor, nearly 60 percent of workers are eligible for unpaid leave through the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act of 1993, and 13 percent reported taking leave under FMLA in the past year. The Gillibrand-DeLauro proposal would provide leave to every worker, including those who work for smaller employers or are self-employed or unemployed, "as long as the person has sufficient earnings and work history," according to a DeLauro press release. The idea is modeled after programs in California and New Jersey. Payments to employees on leave would be equal up to 66 percent of monthly income, capped at a monthly amount. We checked in with the conservative Employment Policies Institute, which opposes pro-labor policies. Research director Michael Saltsman said Shabo's statistic, while accurately sourced, does not account for workers given a pool of hours to use for vacation, illness or personal reasons. Widening the scope shows 77 percent of private-sector workers receive paid vacation time, he said, referencing the BLS. "Of course, that makes the statistic appear far less 'shocking' than Shabo would like it to be," Saltsman said. Consolidated leave plans, which offer employees a block of leave time per year to use for various reasons, are becoming more popular for American workers, particularly those in the insurance and health care sectors, according to the BLS. The BLS found 26 percent of all workers were offered consolidated leave plans in 2012. Our ruling Shabo accurately referenced 2013 federal data when she said, "About 40 percent of workers don’t even have a single paid sick day." Saltsman did offer one caveat, however, noting that some workers have a pool of days that can be used for illness or vacation. That caveat is enough to rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01051	Starting in December 2007, "1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/jan/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-gained-million-jobs-while-re/	Rick Perry reminded lawmakers in his last speech to them before ending more than a decade as governor that he’s proud of Texas job gains on his watch — and the rest of the country lost jobs in recent years, he said. "I have been guided by a simple philosophy: That job creation, not higher taxation, is the best form of revenue generation," Perry said in his Jan. 15, 2015, speech. "And we have created jobs. In the last year, we have created 441,000 jobs. Since I became governor, with your help, we have created almost one-third of all the nation’s new jobs." Those figures hold up if you get your wording straight. We found True Perry’s past claim to Texas’ accounting for one third of net new jobs in the country. As we checked this latest statement, analyst David Cooper of the liberal Economic Policy Institute crunched the latest federal figures and told us Texas jobs accounted for 27 percent of the net jobs gained in the 43 states that gained jobs since 2000. "Still pretty impressive," Cooper said by phone. In his speech, Perry added accurately: "The unemployment rate in Texas is significantly below the national average. And right here in Austin, Texas, it’s below 4 percentage points." Then Perry said: "In fact, if you look at the last seven years…starting in December of 2007, you will see that 1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs." That much of a Texas/Not-Texas gulf? By email, Perry spokesman Felix Browne pointed out U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures for Texas and other states and encouraged us to consult Mark J. Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan campus in Flint. Professor Perry wrote in a November 2014 online commentary that from December 2007, the start of the national recession, through October 2014, Texas saw civilian employment balloon by 1.36 million jobs. "In contrast," he wrote, "civilian employment in the other 49 states without Texas is still 0.26% and more than 350,000 jobs below the December 2007 level … — there were 134.9 million non-Texas jobs in October vs. 135.26 million in December 2007." To our query, the scholar emailed a chart showing that based on what the government calls "total employment," covering all jobs including self-employed posts, Texas had 1,410,400 more jobs in November 2014 than it had in December 2007 while the rest of the country had 352,440 fewer jobs. Total employment, he said, serves as a comprehensive indicator and is used to calculate unemployment rates. Mark Perry said the likely reason the latest figures weren’t perfectly echoed in the governor’s speech is the BLS recently revised upward U.S. jobs for November 2014, which had the effect of reducing the number of jobs lost outside of Texas in the cited period. A little more: The BLS says the definition of employment in the federal household survey, which the governor relied on for his comparison, "comprises wage and salary workers (including domestics and other private household workers), self-employed persons and unpaid workers who worked 15 hours or more during the reference week in family-operated enterprises. Employment in both agricultural and nonagricultural industries is included." In contrast, the government's oft-quoted payroll survey of employers "covers only wage and salary employees on the payrolls of nonfarm establishments." Cooper of EPI commented to us that the timeframe singled out by the governor may deliver a more glowing contrast for Texas than other periods. According to the government’s payroll surveys, he said, the country has added 9.1 million jobs since June 2009, the acknowledged end of the national recession, with Texas accounting for 1.5 million of the additions. Significantly, he said, the rest of the country as a whole lost jobs from June 2009 until February 2010. Since then, he said, the U.S. has added more than 10 million jobs with Texas (again) accounting for more than 1 million of them. Professor Perry said that in his view, the best comparison of Texas to the rest of the nation starts in December 2007. His point: "Texas never experienced significant job losses during the Great Recession, while the rest of the country did," he emailed. "Therefore, comparing job gains since June 2009 or Feb. 2010 really won’t make much sense. Of course the non-Texas US gained a lot of jobs since June 2009, and more than Texas, but that’s because Texas never lost any (very many) jobs in 2008 and 2009 like the rest of the country. Texas is a great economic success story, and an anomaly vs. the rest of the country regarding job losses/gains," he wrote. Separately, we asked a Dallas-based analyst about the governor’s claim. Cheryl Abbot of the BLS said by email the claim could have been precise by referring to "total civilian employment" rather than jobs. That said, as of November 2014, Abbot said, 24 other states had yet to reach pre-recession employment levels. "On a statewide basis, Texas by far leads all states, with total civilian employment growth of 1,410,440. California is a distant second with civilian (household) employment growth of 452,763," Abbot wrote. Our ruling Gov. Perry said that starting in December 2007, "1.4 million jobs were created in Texas. In that same period, the rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs." His figures mostly hold up according to household surveys by the federal government looking into civilian employment including self-employment, though positions not yet recovered outside Texas totaled closer to 350,000, according to the latest available data when Perry spoke.

pomt-07858	When the Milwaukee County mental health facility is full, "cops sit out there in their squad cars with a mentally ill patient" and sometimes "spend an entire shift out there doing that."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/10/jim-sullivan/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-jim-sullivan-/	During a two-month period in 2004, more than 60 people with mental health emergencies waited for up to 60 hours to get treatment at the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex. Some had to be kept under police guard until they could receive care. In early 2008, police agencies continued to rack up thousands of dollars in overtime as officers waited in their squad cars or in hospital emergency rooms with patients who needed psychiatric crisis services. According to Jim Sullivan, one of the five candidates running in the Feb. 15, 2011, primary election for Milwaukee County executive, the problem persists. In a Jan. 31, 2011 meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, Sullivan responded to a question about the Mental Health Complex by saying: "When they’re full up over there, our local police officers -- if you’ve got somebody who needs to be over at mental health because they’re mentally ill, they may pose a danger to themselves, any of these different things -- if it’s full, cops sit out there in their squad cars with a mentally ill patient in the back and they have to wait to unload and people will, in some cases, spend an entire shift out there doing that." If Sullivan is right, police officers are regularly experiencing hours-long delays at the Mental Health Complex when transporting someone who needs crisis services. Is he right? We asked Sullivan, a former Democratic state senator from Wauwatosa, the basis for his statement. He did not have any direct evidence, but said he heard the Wauwatosa and West Allis police departments experienced such waits. Thousands of people each year receive crisis care at the complex, 9455 W. Watertown Plank Road. Some are admitted to the 96-bed facility but most are treated and released. As Sullivan indicated, crisis patients are brought to the facility, often by police, because they are deemed a danger to themselves or others. The Journal Sentinel’s Patients in Peril investigation has uncovered numerous problems at the complex, from bungled care of patients and staff members falsifying documents to skyrocketing overtime costs. But delays faced by police officers transporting crisis patients have not been in the news recently. What’s more, Sullivan’s claim about delays is contradicted by an October 2010 study by a national consulting firm, which found that changes made by the county "have been very effective in reducing backups." The finding was reiterated by the Milwaukee-based Public Policy Forum research organization in a January 2011 report, which summarized issues for candidates in the county executive race. That report relied, in part, on a November 2010 county memo that showed a dramatic reduction in police waits beginning in 2008. To further check Sullivan’s statement, we contacted the two police departments he cited as well as the Milwaukee Police Department and the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office. Here is what they told us: Wauwatosa police: Long delays ended five or more years ago and current wait times are usually less than 30 minutes, said Capt. Jeff Sutter. "It would be extremely unusual for us to have what I consider a long wait," he said. West Allis police: Long waits ended three years ago, according to Chief Mike Jungbluth, who said his officers transport patients to the Mental Health Complex "every day." Milwaukee police: "We aren’t experiencing the issue anymore," said spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz. Milwaukee County sheriff: Deputies usually wait about 20 minutes, said Capt. Darlene Jonas. If several officers are trying to get patients treated, the wait time could be one to two hours, she said. So what’s the bottom line? Sullivan said delays in admitting people to the Mental Health Complex for crisis care can be so long that police officers spend up to an entire shift with patients waiting for them to receive treatment. Hours-long delays were a problem some years ago. But the four largest police agencies in the county now say waits are short. Perhaps there are isolated cases today in which officers waits for hours, but at minimum Sullivan’s claim is clearly dated. We rate it False.

pomt-06667	The Wisconsin Department of Corrections is considering implementing mandatory physical fitness testing for security staff.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/10/chain-email/email-claims-physical-fitness-tests-will-be-requir/	A fake story purporting to be from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s website got thousands of workers at the state’s Department of Corrections buzzing. And then re-buzzing. Some 10,000 employees of the state agency that oversees prisons received an email on Sept. 6, 2011, that included a "story" with the byline of Jason Stein, a reporter in the newspaper’s Madison Bureau. It looked like a JSOnline story, down to the same font and similar layout. The headline: "Dept. of Corrections considering yearly physical fitness testing." The item went on to say the department was considering new testing for "security staff" beyond what’s administered when they are hired. It even included a fake quotes from the department’s actual spokeswoman, Linda Eggert. All of this would no doubt come as a surprise for state employees. Many are already anxious about their jobs in the wake of a new state law pushed by Gov. Scott Walker greatly limiting collective bargaining for most public workers. And there are fitness tests at the time someone is hired. An applicant must clear a number of hurdles -- including a fitness test that consists of push-ups, sit-ups and a run. The standards vary depending on the age and gender of the applicant. So, an authentic-looking story could well get them wondering: Are regular push-up tests coming for prison guards already on the job? There’s only one problem. The story wasn’t published by JSOnline.com and the Corrections Department says the claims in it aren’t true. It’s another email hoax. Because so many people receive chain emails, PolitiFact checks them out. PolitiFact’s national site has evaluated 100 chain emails. Of the claims, 28 were rated False and 51 were rated Pants on Fire. Some of them are items such as one claiming the federal government is going to make you get rid of your light bulbs next year (Pants on Fire). Or that members of Congress and their families are exempt from repaying student loans (likewise). At PolitiFact Wisconsin, we looked at a chain email that -- also using a fake JSOnline story -- said Walker had hired convicted Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen to oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system to help balance the state budget. That email wound up, briefly, on a teachers union website in Little Chute before the hoax was revealed. We rated it Pants on Fire. Anyone sensing a trend? As for the new email, the agency first heard about it the morning of Sept. 6, 2011, when an employee from the Prairie du Chien prison contacted administrators in Madison, said Department of Corrections spokesman Tim Le Monds. That afternoon, the agency sent an email to all employees trying to set the record straight. "Enclosed is a ‘report’ that some of you may have received or seen. I want you to know that this report is false and has no merit or truth to it whatsoever," wrote corrections secretary Gary Hamblin. "No one from the Secretary’s Office had a discussion about this topic with any reporter nor is the issue of physical fitness testing being considered." Hamblin tried to close the door on this issue. But the fake story was pasted into his email which suggested it had actually been published. On Sept. 7, 2011, the secretary’s office tried again. "To further clarify, neither the Journal Sentinel nor any of its reporter/s was involved in any way in the creation of the ‘report’ enclosed in the message," wrote Eggert. The department does not know where the fake email originated and there are no plans to track down the source of the email. "It’s a waste of time," Le Monds said. Our conclusion A fake JSOnline.com was emailed around the Department of Corrections saying that prison guards could face fitness testing. The story was never published. And the department says there are no plans for such tests. Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2011-09-10T09:00:00	2011-09-06	['None']

pomt-03814	In 2008, "only 54 percent of Latinos in Texas were registered to vote and only 35 percent actually turned out."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/mar/22/battleground-texas/battleground-texas-says-54-percent-texas-latinos-r/	A pro-Democratic group says demographic changes and stepped-up voter turnout in Texas will lead to Democrats winning statewide sooner than later. On Comedy Central’s Feb. 26, 2013, "Colbert Report," Jeremy Bird, senior adviser to the newly announced Battleground Texas group, was asked if his mention of demographics was a liberal euphemism for more Hispanic and black residents. Bird replied: "If you look at the state, it’s not just about the demographics, it’s about the turnout. So in 2008, for example, only 54 percent of Latinos in Texas were registered to vote and only 35 percent actually turned out. So what you’re getting is, when only about 50 percent of the population turns out to vote in a place like Texas, you’re getting a government in Texas that’s for half the people and by half the people." We’re not wading in on that logic, nor are we getting into potential strengths or weaknesses of stirring citizens to vote who have historically not voted. We wondered instead if 54 percent of Latino Texans registered to vote in 2008, as Bird said, and 35 percent turned out, especially considering that no one marks down their race or ethnicity when they register to vote. Depending on estimates Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Los Angeles-based William C. Velasquez Institute, which says it conducts research aimed at improving the level of political and economic participation in Latino and other underrepresented communities, told us by telephone that there is no perfect way to pinpoint the makeup of any electorate. But for decades in even-numbered years, he said, the U.S. Census Bureau has followed up general elections by surveying residents about voting habits. He said he respects the surveys’ results, though they include some inflated responses. "It’s the government asking if you’ve voted or registered to vote," Gonzalez said. "So there’s an (unquantified) exaggeration factor." Alternatively, Gonzalez said, campaigns target Latinos after identifying them by surnames on state voter rolls. There are quirks here too: Voters who go by non-Latino last names tend to be missed and others who marry into Latino families might be miscounted. Also, he said, firms taking this approach depend on surname dictionaries that vary in quality. All told, 60 percent of more than 13.5 million Texas voters turned out for the 2008 presidential election, according to the Texas secretary of state’s office. Latinos made up 20 percent of the state’s November vote, according to voter exit polls, with 63 percent favoring Democrat Barack Obama for president and 35 percent backing Republican John McCain, who otherwise carried the state like every GOP presidential nominee since 1980. How Battleground Texas calculated When we asked Battleground Texas for backup on Bird’s figures, we heard from several individuals employed by or contracting with 270 to Win, a political consulting firm with offices in Washington, D.C., and Chicago. Lynda Tran, a partner at the firm, pointed out the Census Bureau survey taken after the 2008 general election. According to that survey, 54.3 percent of Latino Texas citizens 18 and older--an estimated 2.4 million of its estimated nearly 4.5 million Hispanic citizens in the state--said they registered to vote, with a margin of error of three percentage points. Nearly 1.7 million, or about 70 percent, of the Latino registered voters also said they voted, according to the survey, accounting for 37.8 percent of the state’s adult Hispanic citizens as estimated by the survey. This result had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points, making Bird’s declared 35 percent in range. Andrew Claster, a number-cruncher for the cause, said later by email that Bird drew his reference to 54 percent of Latino citizens registering to vote from the bureau’s post-election survey estimates. But he said the conclusion that 35 percent of Latino citizens voted was developed by estimating the number of Latino voters, 1,340,097, a figure reached by applying a "commercial ethnicity model" to the state’s 2008 voter file to determine ethnicity based on name and census information. Claster said the voter estimate was then divided by a 2008 bureau estimate of the number of Latino Texas citizens, 3,812,343, which did not come from the post-election survey. That estimate of voting-age Latino citizens runs some 700,000 less than the estimate of nearly 4.5 million reached via the bureau’s post-election survey. We asked why the group used one census study for one statistic and relied on another for the second. Claster replied that whichever estimate one chooses for the number of adult Latino Texas citizens, it appears that some 30 percent to 38 percent of those citizens voted, either way reinforcing Bird’s point. Other looks at Latino registration, turnout Three other analyses, developed in Texas, enabled us to reach our own statistical speculations. Compared to the post-election census survey, the other estimates suggest more Latinos registered to vote, but fewer turned out in November. Each of the calculations was based on identifying Spanish-surnamed voters on the state's 2008 voter roll. Republican pollster Mike Baselice of Austin and the Texas Tribune, teaming with the El Paso Times, each estimated that there were some 2.9 million Spanish-surnamed Texas registered voters that year. Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin told us by email that his audit of the voter roll, teasing out Latino voters based both on Spanish surnames and maiden names and also removing voters whose names were at least temporarily struck from the roll before the November election, indicates 2,713,681 Hispanic citizens registered to vote. Baselice and the Tribune/Times concluded that about 1.3 million Texas Latinos voted that year. That’s 400,000 fewer than indicated by the census survey. In contrast, Smith estimated that 1,382,360 Latinos voted. Summing up: The 2008 census survey suggests Texas had some 300,000 to 500,000 fewer Latinos registered to vote than the voter-roll analyses by the Texas outfits. The census survey indicates, too, that there were up to 400,000 more Latinos who voted than estimated by the other analyses. Baselice and Smith each said he did not try to gauge the number of Latino citizens who could have registered to vote nor did the Tribune air an estimate. Time for a little math of our own. We used the Texas analyses to stab at the share of voting-age Latino citizens who registered to vote. We did this by dividing each of the other estimates of Latinos who registered to vote by the census bureau’s survey estimate that there were 4,493,000 voting-age Latino citizens in 2008. By our calculations, 60 percent to 65 percent of voting-age Latinos registered that year, more than the 54 percent suggested by the census survey and echoed by Bird. Next, we divided the Texas-devised estimates of Latinos who voted by the census survey’s estimate of 4,493,000 voting-age Latino Texas citizens, a methodology that suggests 29 percent to 31 percent of voting-age Latlnos turned out in November--a bit under the 35 percent figure aired by Bird. Footnote: Census Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us results from the bureau’s 2012 post-election voting surveys were not finalized. Our ruling The Battleground Texas advocate said that in 2008, "only 54 percent of Latinos in Texas were registered to vote and only 35 percent actually turned out." Research rooted in federal surveys and an analysis starting from the state's 2008 voting roll supports those figures, while our own estimates starting from Texas studies suggest a larger share of voting-age Latino citizens registered and a smaller share of them voted--which, if so, could still be fodder for pushes to improve participation. We rate this claim as Mostly True.	None	Battleground Texas	None	None	None	2013-03-22T10:00:00	2013-02-26	['Texas']
pomt-05498	Says opponent Ted Cruz has not led businesses.	true	/texas/statements/2012/apr/16/tom-leppert/tom-leppert-says-ted-cruz-has-not-led-businesses/	Businessman and former Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert says fellow candidate Ted Cruz, a Houston lawyer, has a meaningful gap in his background. During the April 13, 2012, Republican U.S. Senate debate at WFAA-TV in Dallas, Cruz asked Leppert to comment on another candidate’s position on wage taxes. Leppert didn’t go there, instead replying: "The reality of it is that you have been a terrific staffer in the attorney general’s office. But the reality of it is you haven’t led businesses. So when you start talking about these issues, on how they impact business, to you it’s really an academic exercise. To me, it’s a career." Has Cruz never led a business? In a telephone interview, Leppert spokesman Daniel Keylin told us that Leppert based his claim on Cruz’s biography as presented on Cruz’s campaign website. Cruz says in the site’s biographical section that he is now a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP in Houston, where he "leads the firm’s U.S. Supreme Court and national appellate litigation practice." From 2003 to 2008, the section says, Cruz was the state’s solicitor general, leading state government’s legal appeals before state and federal courts, including the Supreme Court. (Cruz was appointed to the post by Attorney General Greg Abbott, the state’s chief lawyer.) From 2004 to 2009, the entry says, Cruz also taught U.S. Supreme Court litigation as an adjunct professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law. And before that, the entry indicates, he held back-to-back federal posts and helped George W. Bush run for president. "Prior to serving as solicitor general, Ted served as the director of the Office of Policy Planning at the Federal Trade Commission," Cruz’s entry says. He earlier was "an associate deputy attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice," according to the entry, after serving as "domestic policy advisor on the 2000 Bush-Cheney campaign. "In addition, Ted clerked for Chief Justice William Rehnquist on the U.S. Supreme Court," the entry says. We asked Cruz’s campaign if Leppert’s claim about his not leading any businesses holds up. Spokesman James Bernsen pointed to Cruz’s campaign biography. We rate Leppert’s claim as True.	None	Tom Leppert	None	None	None	2012-04-16T14:09:19	2012-04-13	['Ted_Cruz']

pomt-03976	On his definition of "takers" and "makers"	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/13/paul-ryan/has-ryan-remained-consistent-talking-about-what-h-/	In the 2012 presidential campaign and for years before that, Paul Ryan warned that a culture of European-style dependency on government programs had created as many "takers" as "makers" in American society -- or even a majority of "takers." So when President Barack Obama in his second inaugural address proclaimed that Social Security and Medicare strengthen America rather than make it a "nation of takers," many saw it as a swipe at Ryan. Ryan blasted Obama’s words as misleading. Republicans, he said, had not meant to include elderly recipients of Social Security and Medicare as "takers." Those folks, Ryan said, helped earn their retirement benefits through payroll taxes deducted from their paychecks specifically for those programs. Ryan critics in the media labeled it a reversal and an attempt to soften the GOP rhetoric on fiscal issues. But Ryan insisted the position didn’t change, though Obama’s words created another impression. Has Ryan’s position remained the same? Or has the 2012 Republican vice-presidential candidate altered it as the GOP repositions itself following a painful defeat in the presidential race? With Ryan a possible presidential candidate in 2016, we thought we’d roll out the Flip-O-Meter. Our standard note: The Flip-O-Meter does not measure whether a change is good politics or good policy, only whether a politician has been consistent. So, what about those "takers" and "makers"? We’re not sure who introduced the terms into the political debate, but Ryan helped popularize them, notably after a 2009 report by the business-backed Tax Foundation on the redistribution of federal tax dollars and spending. That report categorized Americans by whether they had received more in federal benefits than they had paid in various federal taxes, though it used the gentler terminology of "givers" and "receivers." The study, cited frequently by Ryan, calculated that 60 percent of families were net receivers and projected the figure would rise to 70 percent under Obama’s policies. It is important to note that Medicare and Social Security benefits were included in the Tax Foundation calculation. The report, and subsequent ones that borrow from it, make clear that "all federal spending" is covered. The studies also make clear that taxes people pay toward those programs were included on the other side of the ledger. Enter Ryan, who picked up the 2009 report’s conclusion in support of his argument that America was at or near a "moral tipping point" and already at a fiscal crossroads. His warnings were sometimes dire, and based explicitly on the Tax Foundation report. In a 2010 interview on a cable show hosted by U.S. Rep. Walter Jones (R-North Carolina), Ryan promoted his debt-reduction plan, including gradually reducing Social Security benefits for younger Americans and replacing Medicare’s guaranteed health benefits with vouchers to help buy private coverage. Those big entitlement programs "are exploding our debt" in a way that threatens the U.S. economy, Ryan said. He told Jones: "Right now, about 60 percent of the American people get more benefits in dollar value from the federal government than they pay back in taxes. So we’re going to a majority of takers vs. makers in America and that will be tough to come back from that." Ryan repeated the point with conservative political activist Star Parker in September 2011. "Right now according to the Tax Foundation, between 60 and 70 percent of Americans get more benefits from the federal government than they pay back in taxes," he said. "So we’re getting toward a society where we have a net majority of takers vs. makers, who, if that trend continues, then we’ll have a European situation on our hands. Campaigning in August 2012, just days before officially joining the presidential ticket with Mitt Romney, Ryan told a MacIver Institute interviewer: "We risk hitting a tipping point in our society where we have more takers than makers in society, where we will have turned our safety net into a hammock that lulls able bodied people into lives of dependency and complacency which drains them of their will and incentive to make the most of their lives." Obama, Ryan said, wrongly portrays Republicans as favoring a "dog eat dog" society. They actually want a safety net that provides "equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome," he said. Ryan avoided the "takers" and "makers" line -- and references to the Tax Foundation study -- after his August 2012 selection as the veep nominee. It was a hot topic, though, after a video surfaced of Romney’s remarks that 47 percent of Americans are content to be dependent on government, and they support Obama. In a campaign interview with the Journal Sentinel, Ryan blamed Obama and the bad economy for increasing dependency, and said people were not dependent by choice. Also during the 2012 campaign, Ryan pulled back from his 2005 description of Social Security as a socialist-based "welfare transfer" and "collectivist system" that was too costly and should be converted to a system of individual accounts that workers could invest as they wished. Let’s look now at Ryan’s post-election comments. Two days after Obama’s inaugural jab at those who call Social Security and Medicare recipients "takers," Ryan told a conservative talk show host that Obama had used a "twist of terms to try and shadowbox a straw man in order to win an argument by default." "No one is suggesting what we call our earned entitlements -- entitlements you pay for, like payroll taxes for Medicare and Social Security -- are putting you in a taker category," Ryan said on the Laura Ingraham radio show. "No one suggests that whatsoever." Ryan said his primary concern was welfare programs of the sort Washington reformed in the 1990s. That change was under President Bill Clinton, eliminating the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program in favor assistance tied to work. Ryan’s comments on the show were the first instance we could find of him separating Medicare and Social Security from what he calls the "takers." We asked Ryan’s office if there any instances before the election in which he made the distinction between the retirement programs and "takers." The office did not provide any. Instead, they pointed us to comments he made after the inaugural to Journal Sentinel reporters and editors, in which Ryan noted that Social Security helped him go to college after his father died. Ryan also said he didn’t think of his mother, who is on Medicare, as a taker. In those interviews, Ryan argued that he had only used the Tax Foundation figure of 60 to 70 percent as a device to highlight his larger point that it’s not too late yet to reverse course because not all takers see themselves that way. That’s accurate to a point. In some instances he made the larger point by citing surveys showing only 30 percent of Americans favor a welfare state. But in several interviews his point was simply the need to cut the budget to prevent the 60 percent "takers" figure from growing. But here we’re looking at how Ryan defined "takers" before the election and whether it changed after the election. We found no record of Ryan prior to the election spelling out, program by program, which federal benefits would cause him to view a recipient as a "taker." Rather, he took an all-in approach. Ryan labeled all recipients of federal benefits that way, elevating numbers buried in a think-tank report to the statistical centerpiece of his budget-cutting message over a period of years. Indeed, his warnings about dependency were made all the more dramatic because the numbers he cited were so large -- in part because they included the entitlement programs. Had Ryan taken out the big entitlement programs the number would have been lower, said Gerald Prante, the former Tax Foundation economist who devised the methodology used in the paper. In our view, by distancing himself from his prior, broad denunciation of "takers" in connection with all federal benefits, Ryan’s post-election approach has changed dramatically. That’s true both on the key point of how retirement benefits should be viewed, and in the style of his presentation. A major reversal earns him a Full Flop.

pomt-04942	Says Donna Campbell is pushing a 35 percent sales tax extending to medicine, groceries and real estate.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2012/jul/27/jeff-wentworth/jeff-wentworth-says-donna-campbell-pushing-35-perc/	State Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio says his opponent in a July 31, 2012, Republican primary runoff has a hankering to hike taxes. A Wentworth campaign mailer tells residents of the Austin-to-San Antonio Senate district: "Don’t be tricked: Donna Campbell," his New Braunfels runoff opponent, "is pushing a 35% national-state-local sales tax on medicine, healthcare, groceries, water and real estate!" Another Wentworth mailer presents her as saying: "Texas needs a 35% sales tax on groceries, medicine, healthcare, water and ALL purchases." And a July 18, 2012, news article in the San Marcos Daily Record quotes Wentworth as saying: "My opponent's call for a 35 percent sales tax in Texas on medicine, groceries, water, real estate and all purchases is absurd." A refresher: The existing state sales tax of 6.25 percent applies to retail sales, leases and rentals of most goods plus 17 categories of taxable services including Internet access and security services. Also, Texas cities, counties, transit authorities and special-purpose districts have the option of imposing an additional local sales tax for a combined total of state and local taxes of 8.25 percent. Many items -- including water, groceries and medicine -- are exempted from the sales tax. So, Wentworth is saying that Campbell both wants to more than quintuple the state sales tax rate and start applying the tax to some essential items. One hitch for us in starting this fact-check was the absence of any public sign that Campbell has been campaigning for a 35 percent state-federal-local sales tax. Any such proposal goes unmentioned on her campaign website, where she says she will work to decrease taxation. Asked how Wentworth unearthed his opponent’s double-digit tax-hike push, Wentworth’s consultant, Bryan Eppstein, pointed out that while Campbell was running for the U.S. House in 2010, Austin’s KVUE-TV quoted her as advocating the replacement of federal income taxes with a 23 percent federal sales tax on consumer goods and services, a position then pointed out by her Democratic opponent, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett. An online version of the Oct. 29, 2010, KVUE news story quotes Campbell as saying: "Income tax, payroll tax, you wouldn’t pay any of that" under the approach. "If it’s a retail tax, and you buy something new you’d pay 23 percent," she said. Eppstein further pointed out that an official with the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation, Talmadge Heflin, testified afresh in May 2012 in favor of the state wiping out property taxes and making up the lost revenue with changes in the sales tax. He said that based on Heflin’s testimony, Wentworth concluded that Campbell favors a state sales tax rate of 12 percent. Heflin, a former chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, hearkened in his testimony to an April 2009 foundation report stating that revenue generated by property taxes could be replaced by money raised from the sales tax by setting the rate at 12.5 percent if the existing tax is extended to property sales or, he said, 9 percent if the tax is extended to property sales as well as all services that are taxed in at least one other state. The report says that if the sales tax is not expanded to additional items or services, its rate would need to be around 14.5 percent to raise revenues lost by eliminating property taxes statewide. Eppstein also noted that Campbell has the endorsement of Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, a group that asked candidates seeking its support to fill out its 2012 candidate questionnaire, including questions about phasing out property taxes in return for raising sales taxes. One question on the survey refers to "end-user consumption taxes," meaning sales taxes. The questions says: "Would you support moving Texas away from property taxes in favor of the existing sales and use tax?" Candidates are asked to support or oppose. The question is followed by this text: "Note: Tax swaps, phase-outs or trade-offs are not considered tax increases unless the total tax burden is increased." Next on the questionnaire: "Statement: Texas should phase out property taxes in favor of end-user consumption taxes." Candidates are asked to agree or disagree. By email, Campbell spokesman Jon Oliver said that Campbell replied on the questionnaire that she supports moving Texas away from property taxes to the existing sales tax and also agreed that Texas should phase out property taxes in favor of end-user consumption taxes. But, Oliver said, in order to have Campbell’s support, a proposal to replace property taxes with sales taxes would have to lower the overall tax burden for Texas families and businesses; be limited to taxing items currently covered by the sales tax; be phased in gradually; and win voter approval at the polls. Earlier, Oliver said by email: "She is intrigued by the overall idea of a consumption tax instead of a property tax if it would truly lower the tax burden, but it's not part of her platform and she certainly wouldn't support a state sales tax in the form Sen.Wentworth has claimed she would -- that is, taxing items that are currently exempt." Oliver noted, too, that Campbell has signed three pledges disavowing higher taxes: the Americans for Prosperity Taxpayer Pledge in favor of requiring voter or legislative supermajority approval for tax and spending increases; Gov. Rick Perry’s "budget compact" pledge to oppose any new taxes or tax increase; and one to taxpayers, advocated by Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, stating she "will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes." We circled back to Eppstein, asking for evidence of Campbell talking up a 35-percent sales tax. By telephone, Eppstein said he has heard Campbell indicate as much, but did not record it. Our ruling Wentworth says Campbell is pushing a 35 percent sales tax extending to medicine, groceries and real estate. She’s not, though we can see the threads behind this misleading claim. While running for Congress in 2010, Campbell spoke out in favor of a possible 23 percent federal sales tax in return for wiping out federal income taxes. In the same spirit, she now supports replacing property tax revenue collected across Texas with income from the state sales tax. By itself, that move could drive the state sales tax rate to 14 percent or so. Then again, the conditions her campaign lays out could be taken as signals she’s not ready to embrace any sudden surge or broadening of the tax. Campbell’s two stances, taken years apart in campaigns for different offices, reflect on sales taxes at different levels of government.This claim distorts both positions by effectively combining the possible tax rates. All told, too, it’s ridiculous to assert that Campbell, who has signed no-new-tax pledges, is pushing or calling for an expanded sales tax set at 35 percent. Pants on Fire!

pomt-14522	Says Dontre Hamilton, who was killed during a confrontation with a Milwaukee police officer, was "unarmed."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/18/hillary-clinton/black-man-was-unarmed-when-shot-dead-white-milwauk/	The disproportionate incarceration of black males was posed by a Facebook user during the Feb. 11, 2016 Democratic presidential debate, which was hosted by PBS in Milwaukee. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders responded to the question first. When former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton followed, she made a claim about the 2014 death of a black man at the hands of a white Milwaukee police officer that we want to check. Clinton, after alluding to a statistic cited by the questioner, said: "And we know of the tragic, terrible event that led to the death of Dontre Hamilton right here in Milwaukee. A young man, unarmed, who should still be with us. His family certainly believes that. And so do I." The key word in Clinton’s claim, of course, is unarmed. We found this to be one of the more difficult claims we have rated. Moments before he was shot to death by the officer, Hamilton had taken the officer’s baton and struck the officer with it. But Hamilton, who was mentally ill, had no weapon when he was rousted by the officer shortly after two other officers had allowed Hamilton to continue sleeping in a park. In that sense, Hamilton was armed only after he had been struck. Sequence of events Diagnosed with schizophrenia, Hamilton, 31, was described as having long suffered from mental illness, including making a suicide attempt the year before his death. He had a history of encounters with Milwaukee police, but no convictions for any violent crimes. Hamilton was shot to death April 30, 2014 after police were called to Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee. Here’s an overview of the incident, based on a report by Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm. Chisholm’s report was based on an investigation done by a division of the Madison-based Wisconsin Department of Justice and a review by Emanuel Kapelsohn of the Peregrine Corp. in Pennsylvania, whom Chisholm cited as a leading national expert in use-of-force reviews. First police contacts: Shortly before 2 p.m., an employee of the Starbucks located at Red Arrow Park called police about Hamilton, who was sleeping in the park. The call was classified as a "welfare check" -- in other words, to check if Hamilton was OK. A desk sergeant called downtown officer Christopher Manney’s cell phone and left a voicemail message, saying he wanted Manney to go to the park about "a homeless guy sleeping" there. Manney, a 38-year-old, 13-year veteran of the department, was working another call downtown. Because he didn’t immediately respond to the voicemail, the Starbucks call was referred to a dispatcher, who then dispatched two other officers to the park. They found Hamilton lying on his back with his eyes closed. They nudged Hamilton, he got up and provided identification; he said he was taking a nap and was all right. The officers left, since Hamilton was not disturbing anyone, according to the report. About 2:10 p.m., another call to police about Hamilton came from Starbucks. The two officers went to Starbucks and told the employees Hamilton was not doing anything wrong. The officers left shortly before 3 p.m. So, at this point, police had no concerns that Hamilton was armed or dangerous. Manney responds: Just before 3:30 p.m., Manney listened to the voicemail. He called dispatch and asked if there was an assignment for Red Arrow Park. Told there was not, Manney asked, according to the report, "that he be recorded as responding to a trouble with subject" call, and he went to the park. He apparently was not aware the other officers had preceded him. Manney approached Hamilton, who was lying down, helped him up and then began to pat him down. Hamilton resisted. Witnesses told police that Manney, who was yelling commands at Hamilton, struck Hamilton one or more times with his baton before Hamilton took the baton and struck Manney with it one or more times, according to the report. The witnesses said Hamilton was holding the baton -- one said menacingly -- when Manney fired his service weapon. It was determined that Manney fired the gun 14 times, resulting in 15 gunshot wounds to Hamilton. So, Hamilton had no weapon when Manney approached him. He was armed, with Manney’s baton, only after Manney struck him with the baton. It’s worth noting that Flynn said, when he later fired Manney, that "officer-created jeopardy is a term that has real meaning in the training circles of police departments around the country." He said officers, in their use-of-force training, "are taught not to create circumstances that place them at a situation where they have no choice." (Chisholm opted not to file criminal charges against Manney, saying Manney's use of force was justified self-defense.) Our rating Clinton said Hamilton, who was killed during a confrontation with Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney, was "unarmed." Hamilton had no weapon when he was confronted by Manney. After Manney rousted Hamilton and began patting him down, a struggle ensued and Manney used his baton to strike Hamilton. Only then did Hamilton take the baton and strike Manney. That’s when Manney shot and killed Hamilton. Clinton’s statement is accurate, but needs clarification. That’s our definition of Mostly True. More on police use of force Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said that in 2012, there were nearly 12.2 million arrests and only 410 "uses of deadly force" by police in the United States. Our rating was Mostly True. Flynn correctly quoted FBI statistics on arrests and justifiable homicides by law enforcement officers, although the 410 appeared to be an undercount of the number of people killed. PolitiFact National rated Half True a claim by National Urban League president Marc Morial, who said: "The number of killings of citizens by police is at a two-decade high." The former New Orleans mayor also cited FBI figures. But only a fraction of law enforcement agencies provide such data to the FBI, and the agencies that file the reports change from year to year, complicating comparisons. Conservative Michael Medved, a nationally syndicated radio talk show host, said: "More whites than blacks are victims of deadly police shootings." That earned a Half True from our partners at PunditFact. In absolute terms, the claim was accurate. But when comparing death rates, blacks are about three times more likely than whites to die in a confrontation with police.

pomt-10462	"As a state senator, he (Obama) even refused to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship!"	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/23/focus-family-action/he-wanted-local-officials-to-decide/	A letter from the conservative group Focus on the Family Action makes a multifaceted attack on Sen. Barack Obama in an attempt to portray him as someone who would be "the most left-wing president in our nation's history." The article, written for the organization's Web site and widely circulated via chain e-mail, tries to paint Obama as bad for families, accusing him of everything from trying to further "the homosexual agenda" to being soft on the war against terrorists. Focus on the Family Action is the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, an organization founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson. One of the claims in the article, written by Tom Minnery, senior vice president of Focus on the Family Action, is that, "As a state senator, he (Obama) even refused to support a measure to stop sex businesses from opening near schools or places of worship!" It's true. But before you go fitting Obama with Hugh Hefner-esque silk pajamas, some explanation is in order. The bill that came before the Illinois state Senate on March 29, 2001, sought to prohibit adult businesses from being located within 1,000 feet of public or private elementary or secondary schools, public parks, places of worship, preschools, day care facilities, mobile home parks or any areas zoned residential. Obama argued that kind of regulation is better handled by local officials through zoning. He noted that the City of Chicago opposed the bill as a pre-emption of its home rule. Addressing the assembly, Obama stated: "This is one of those areas where nobody likes, necessarily, to have — well, I don't say nobody, but most of us would prefer not to have an adult bookstore or movie theater or something next to our residence. But that's exactly why we have local zoning ordinances. And that's why, presumably, we have council members or heads of townships or all the various branches of local government who are much closer to the ground than we are in making these determinations. And it seems to me that if there's ever been a function that has historically been relegated to local control and it is appropriately there, it's these kinds of zoning matters. I would urge a No vote." But Obama didn't actually vote "no." He and four others voted "present." In the Illinois state Senate, lawmakers sometimes vote "present" instead of "no" to block bills without officially opposing them. (Earlier in the campaign, Sen. Hillary Clinton questioned whether Obama used present votes 129 times over eight years as an Illinois state senator to duck tough votes. PolitiFact examined Obama's present votes here. ) The political considerations here are obvious. Had he voted no, the attack would now be that "Obama opposed..." instead of the weaker "Obama refused to support..." The small distinction didn't appear to have saved Obama much grief. The vote came down 33 in favor; 15 against, with 5 voting "present." Because the bill needed 36 votes in favor — a three-fifths majority — it narrowly failed. Any implication that Obama's vote means that he supports sex businesses opening near schools or places of worship would be false. But in Minnery's article, which has been widely circulated through chain e-mail, he states that Obama "refused to support" a bill that would have prohibited sex shops near schools and places of worship. That's True.	None	Focus on the Family Action	None	None	None	2008-04-23T00:00:00	2008-03-26	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-11428	"Research shows that 1 percent of licensed dealers supply a whopping 57 percent of the guns that are recovered in crimes."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/mar/16/cory-booker/are-1-percent-gun-retailers-responsible-more-half-/	As tens of thousands of students across the country walked out of their schools to protest gun violence, members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee examined school safety procedures and gun policies ahead of the Parkland school shooting. During the hearing, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., repeated a talking point among people who support gun restrictions and expressed the need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. He said most guns used in crime come from only a handful of places. "We see guns pouring into our community, and we have found that a significant number of them are coming from a very small group of retailers that sell to criminals or straw purchasers," Booker said March 14, a month after the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He turned to Thomas Brandon, acting director of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives: "You’re aware of that, correct?" Brandon said yes, but Booker took the claim a step further: "We know the research shows that 1 percent of licensed dealers supply a whopping 57 percent of the guns that are recovered in crimes." Brandon said Booker’s claim rested on outdated research. "Yes, senator. That’s a study that, I think, is over 20 years old," Brandon said. "I would not agree with that statistic today." Booker continued to press Brandon about the distribution between licensed gun dealers and guns recovered in crimes and then talked about the need for more research on gun violence. Still, the differing assertions made us wonder about Booker’s statistic. As we’ve found in the past, a federal report from 2000 backs this up. But there are several caveats worth pointing out. Booker’s claim stems from 20-year-old data Booker's point matches data from a 2000 report from the federal Bureau of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Department. The report found that 1.2 percent of licensed gun dealers accounted for more than 57 percent of the crime guns traced to current dealers in 1998. The study looked at the number of licensed retail dealers and pawnbrokers nationwide and aimed to track the movement of a firearm recovered by law enforcement officials from its first sale by the manufacturer. An ATF spokesman said the agency no longer uses that study to evaluate current crime trends. Frank Kelsey, chief of the public affairs division at ATF, said tracing a gun used in a crime back to a dealer does not necessarily indicate illegal activity by the dealer or its employees. And he noted that a gun might have changed hands any number of times — legally or illegally — before it was used in a crime. That said, there isn’t any more up-to-date information on the subject — and there’s a reason for that. In 2003, Congress and the George W. Bush administration, with the support of the National Rifle Association, passed the Tiahrt Amendment, which forbids ATF from sharing information about guns it has traced with the public except with state and local police agencies in the course of a criminal investigation. Two of the experts we reached out to (Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, and Jaclyn Schildkraut, assistant professor of Public Justice, State University of New York at Oswego) said that they wouldn’t completely dismiss the findings of the 2000 report, unless there was any evidence that showed otherwise. Still, more information is needed. Glenn L. Pierce, the director of the Institute of Security and Public Policy at Northeastern University, helped compile the ATF’s 2000 analysis. Pierce said the pattern found in 1998, when there were 105,563 federal firearms licensees, is very similar to the pattern identified in the 1995/1996 first report to ATF, at which time there were about 258,000 federal firearms licensees. "At least over those years, the pattern stayed very much the same even (as) the number of (federal firearms licensees) showed a steep decline due to legislation implemented in 1994 during the Clinton administration," he said. Still, he said, it would be necessary for ATF to conduct another study to determine the extent to which this is actually the case today. "The firearms trace patterns found in the 1995 and 2000 reports might well persist today, but it would be necessary for ATF to conduct such a trace data analysis to determine the extent to which this actually the case." Our ruling Booker said, "Research shows that 1 percent of license dealers supply a whopping 57 percent of the guns that are recovered in crimes. Booker made his claim in the present tense, but the data that backs his point is almost 20 years old. We do not have better data to represent the current picture. The 2000 report traced the purchases of guns used in crimes back to the original dealer. But it didn’t take into account whether the firearm changed hands, illegally or legally, before it was used in a crime. That said, Booker is relying on the latest, best data available. Booker’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information about the study's age. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-09112	The addition of a 1 percent sales tax would cost a typical household in Hillsborough County approximately $12 a month.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/18/hillsborough-area-rapid-transit-hart/brochure-estimates-financial-impact-hillsborough-t/	After decades of fits and starts, Hillsborough County commissioners agreed to ask voters to consider a 1 percent sales tax increase for expanded bus service, light rail and road improvements. The issue will appear on the November ballot. One question many voters want answered: How much will the new tax cost me? In a brochure outlining how rapid transit can boost the economy and ease traffic congestion, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit says the tax will cost the average family $12 a month. That figure comes from the Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning Organization’s long-range transportation plan. It puts the cost of a 1 cent sales tax for the average family at $142 a year, and the average for a single person at $85 a year. The MPO came up with those numbers by plugging the county’s household incomes into the IRS sales tax deduction calculator, available on the agency’s Web site. The IRS developed the calculator because tax rules allow people to deduct either sales taxes paid annually or state income tax from their federal returns, and the calculator enables them to arrive at a reasonable estimate without having to save a basket of receipts. MPO planner Beth Alden said she used average household income rather than median income. “The number we’ve been using is the higher one, just to be more conservative,” she said. The county’s average family of three has a household income of $77,852, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. A single household’s average income is $44,832. We plugged those figures into the IRS calculator and it showed the average family would pay $141.83 a year in local sales tax, which currently is 1 percent. A single person would pay $91.50. That’s virtually the same as the MPO estimates. The figure does not include sales taxes on major purchases, such as cars, mobile homes or construction materials for a house. Those are listed separately on tax returns. The county sales tax on items worth more than $5,000 is capped, meaning the maximum amount paid on any single item would be $50. But how accurate is the IRS calculator? Skeptical observers say it spits out a low figure. “It’s in the IRS’ interest to have that on the lower end, obviously, to decrease the deductions,” said Rusty Spoor, a tax accountant at Foley & Lardner. He guessed the calculator could be as much as 30 percent off. Like other tax experts, he noted it’s impossible to determine exactly how much people pay a year in sales taxes without saving receipts, so the IRS calculator is a useful tool. “That’s the best of the poorest options,” he said. “I don’t think that number’s great, but it’s the best starting point.” The calculator is based on spending patterns captured in the Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted annually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, IRS spokesperson Florida Mike Dobzinski said. That’s the best method for calculating how much people pay in sales tax, according to Frank Williams, chief economist for the Florida Department of Revenue’s Office of Tax Research. “It should be fairly close,” he said. “It may understate it by 2 to 5 percent, but that’s just a gut feel.” Opponents of the sales tax say it will cost residents much more than the MPO estimates. Jim Hosler, a demographer running for Hillsborough County commissioner, initially figured it would cost households nearly $400 a year. He came up with that number by dividing the estimated revenue from the tax — about $174 million, according to the Florida Legislative Committee on Intergovernmental Relations — by 454,000, the approximate number of households in Hillsborough County. That comes about $383. Trouble is, residents aren’t the only ones who pay sales taxes. Tourists, commuters and businesses also pay them. Experts say there’s no way to know exactly who pays what, but most estimate that non-residents bear about 20 percent of the tax burden. Under that calculation, the cost is $307 per household. But that spreads out sales taxes equally among all households, regardless of income. And a household that earns $200,000 a year will pay much more in sales taxes than a $20,000 household, simply by virtue of having more disposable income. Hosler concedes his number may be high. “But their number is definitely a low number,” he said. “The real number is probably somewhere in between.” Clearly there are a number of ways to calculate the figure, and the result for all of them is a somewhat imprecise. Still, our research shows that the number in the brochure is very close to the one provided by the MPO, and HART used a recognized, legitimate source in coming up with the figure. The IRS calculation, while perhaps on the low side, is a recognized standard. So we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-02564	Says Alex Sink "even supported a tax on homeowners insurance policies."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jan/31/national-republican-congressional-committee/alex-sink-supported-tax-homeowners-insurance-polic/	In the special election for a U.S. House seat, Republicans are taking aim at Democratic nominee Alex Sink’s career in both the public and private sector. On a website called The Real Alex Sink Truth Team -- intentionally aping Sink’s own Truth Team page -- the National Republican Campaign Committee calls her out for allegedly supporting higher taxes while serving as Florida’s elected chief financial officer, or CFO. "Alex Sink has consistently supported higher taxes, including property taxes, sales taxes, and taxes on water, sewer and cable television," the site reads. "She even supported a tax on homeowners insurance policies." We’ve seen all these claims often repeated during the campaign (so far, we’ve rated the one on water and TV Mostly True). But the one about whether she supported a tax on homeowners insurance deserves some attention. Avoiding a catastrophe To back up this claim, the the NRCC pointed us to a story in the Palm Beach Post from June 2008, after Sink had become CFO. The article detailed a Cabinet meeting between then-Gov. Charlie Crist and Sink, both of whom voted to extend a 1 percent assessment on private home, car, boat and motorcycle policies to cover a $625 million shortfall in the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, often referred to as the CAT fund. The assessment was put in place in 2007 to cover outstanding claims from the very heavy 2005 hurricane season. The purpose of the fund -- established in 1993 after Hurricane Andrew destabilized the state’s insurance market -- is to pay policyholders when insurers are unable to cover all their obligations. Because of the vast number of claims following Hurricane Wilma, the fund was falling short, so an emergency assessment was enacted to cover the lack of funds. By law, the fund only has to pay out claims to the extent of its cash balance, and it issues bonds to cover the difference should claims exceed that balance. To cover the repayment of those bonds, an emergency assessment is made on all policyholders to share the burden. The 2007 assessment was set to expire in 2012, but Crist and Sink changed that so the assessment would last until Dec. 31, 2014. The NRCC pointed to a partial quote from Sink, who said extending the assessment was "really a tax on insurance policies." But nuances keep this from being slam-dunk support for the NRCC’s claim. First, in a literal sense, the emergency assessment is not a tax. The state statute for the CAT fund says so. In addition, there’s evidence that Sink was not a fan of the process at work here. The fund was facing scads of new claims after Wilma, and Sink had been supporting changes in state law to shore up its finances. But state legislators hadn’t taken action on her recommendations before the extension. She and Attorney General Bill McCollum continued to press the Legislature for changes to Citizens after the extension, as well. "It's certainly not a good time to be telling homeowners they've got a $600 million tax increase in addition to what they were already paying," Sink was quoted as saying about a month before the vote, referring to the onset of the Great Recession and again characterizing the assessment as a tax. She confirmed to us through her campaign that she "believed it was not a good time to keep the assessment and was not an enthusiastic supporter of it." Crist and Sink both voiced concerns that state policyholders were on the hook for potentially fraudulent claims, but agreed to extend the assessment because CAT fund director Jack Nicholson said there were only about 10 or 20 weeks worth of money still available for payouts. One alternative would have been to increase the emergency assessment, which happened when it was bumped up to 1.3 percent in January 2011, covering an additional $676 million in bond payments, and is slated to last until July 1, 2016. A big reason for the shortfall was the poor estimates from insurers about how much they would need to cover claims, a process that happened in 2006, before Crist and Sink took office. Nicholson told PolitiFact the fund now "is in the best situation that it has ever been in financially," and that it would take storm claims in excess of $25 billion to force the state to issue more bonds. Our ruling The NRCC said Alex Sink "supported a tax on homeowners insurance policies," and it used Sink’s own words as evidence. In casting her Cabinet vote to extend an emergency assessment on policyholders to pay for hurricane claims, she did use the term "tax." However, it wasn’t officially a tax. And Sink supported the policy grudgingly, saying it was unfair that consumers would have to continue paying for old storm damages. Sink had a history before and after the Cabinet vote of trying to scale down the state’s exposure to hurricane coverage and reinsurance to private companies The ad is wrong to call it a tax, but Sink’s vote -- grudging though it was -- did serve to maintain an increase in insured consumers’ out-of-pocket costs, which had the effect of seeming a lot like a tax to policyholders. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-02813	Republican ideas on health care don’t give people "an option to even enroll in something that they can afford."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/26/donna-brazile/brazile-says-gop-lacks-plan-help-working-poor-get-/	Republicans have been pointing out the failures of the Obamacare rollout, telling voters, "We told you so." But the health care law’s problems aren’t a complete boon for the GOP. More and more, they’re getting questions about what their big ideas for health care are. Democratic pundit and sometimes political adviser Donna Brazile made that point during an installment of CNN’s Situation Room. "They have a blank slate," Brazile said. "They're not offering an alternative. They're not giving people who are desperately seeking health care an option to even enroll in something that they can afford." We asked Brazile if she was referring to the approximately 47 million uninsured people in the country and she told us "Yes. I was referring to those who would qualify for Medicaid, etc." We wanted to know what the Republican ideas would do to make insurance affordable for people of modest means. So we looked at some of the bills they’ve introduced this session to fact-check Brazile’s statement. Ideas on the Republican menu Not all but most of the nine bills on our list use the tax code to put more money in citizens’ pockets on the condition that the money will be spent on health care. We found three basic approaches that potentially address insurance affordability. Overhauling health care tax deductions The most generous proposal comes from the conservative Republican Study Committee, which put forward a bill with 100 cosponsors. H.R. 3121 would give a $7,500 deduction to individuals and a $20,000 deduction to families. We saw two big catches here. You would need to have insurance in the first place. Plus, the bill would eliminate the biggest tax break households enjoy today, the portion of their premiums paid by their employer. Getting rid of that $170 billion tax benefit would be a tough sell and a dramatic change to employer-provided insurance. Refundable tax credits These are like tax deductions, with the big difference that you can claim the credit even if you don’t have taxable income. H.R. 2300 from Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., offers a maximum tax credit of $5,000 for families making up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $47,000 a year. The bill covers the cost of the tax credits with a blend of savings from medical malpractice reform, reducing waste, fraud and abuse, and cuts in discretionary spending. Health Savings Accounts These are accounts that enjoy a trifecta of tax breaks. Money goes in tax-free, the returns on investment accumulates tax-free and some withdrawals are tax-free. Several bills loosen the rules on health savings accounts to allow more people to put more money into them. Other ideas Additional GOP ideas include medical malpractice reform, allowing small business to form their own insurance buying pools, letting insurers sell policies across state lines and subsidizing state high-risk pools for people who can’t insurance anyplace else. These changes would be significant but would have only an indirect impact on families seeking affordable insurance. Assessing the Republican options None of the Republican proposals have undergone an intensive independent analysis of how they would help the needy. Based on interviews with experts and our research, the two possibilities that would most directly provide affordable insurance are tax deductions and refundable tax credits. A tax deduction that would offset payroll taxes could touch many families of limited means. About 50 million taxpayers making less than $40,000 a year pay such taxes. But there’s a chicken-and-egg issue here. Until you have insurance, you can’t get the tax break and the bill doesn’t provide a way to help workers get over that hurdle. Plus, the bill relies on the elimination of the tax break on employer-sponsored health insurance. This would represent a radical shift in federal tax policy. In terms of feasibility, the majority of analysts we talked to give the edge to the refundable tax credit approach. That does not mean there is a resounding consensus on how much it would achieve. The proposal from Price would make credits payable in advance. In other words, you could use the federal credit even if you didn’t have the money up front to pay for insurance. While the details are different, this resembles the program put forward by President George W. Bush. A 2005 study of the Bush plan by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, found that "lower-income individuals experience the largest declines in uninsurance rates" under the Bush proposal. However, of the 45 million people uninsured then, Bush’s $3,000 tax credit plan would have helped only about 2 million people who made less than 200 percent of federal poverty and just a bit over 3 million overall. Thomas Buchmueller, a health economist at the University of Michigan, said it is a major undertaking to provide insurance to those who lack the money to pay for it. "Tinkering with tax deductions and making health savings accounts more attractive is not going to change that basic fact," Buchmueller said. "Roughly half of the Affordable Care Act coverage gains come from expanding Medicaid. I don't see anything in these proposals that would do much for the people who will gain Medicaid under the ACA." Conservative analysts see more promise in the use of refundable tax credits. Nina Owcharenko with the Heritage Foundation, a group that has supported tax credits for many years, wrote in 2005 that this approach could go far to level the playing field, "especially lower-income individuals who do not fit into today's patchwork health care system." One of the widest gaps between Democrats and Republicans is the basic understanding of what it means to offer a plan to people of limited means. For Democrats, a plan is an identified insurance policy, whether public, as in expanded Medicaid, or private, as in buying subsidized private insurance through a web-based, highly regulated marketplace. For Republicans, a plan is anything that makes buying insurance more affordable, however the person finds the policy. Our ruling Brazile said Republicans offer no option for those who are desperate for coverage the chance to enroll in something they can afford. Within a more Democratic definition of a plan, that claim is accurate. However, using a broader definition, the Republican plan to use refundable tax credits would likely have some impact on Americans of very limited means. Opinions vary widely on how many Americans this would help, but a program of this sort would do something for a portion of the people Brazile had in mind. While the Republican option is full of uncertainty and results might be limited, they are more than nothing. Still, supporters of the GOP reforms were unable to point to independent studies to show how much their ideas for tax deductions and tax credits would accomplish, and previous independent analysis suggests they would have a modest impact on reducing uninsurance rates.

pomt-01327	Rep. Carol Shea-Porter "votes with Nancy Pelosi’s Democrats 95 percent of the time," but Frank Guinta "will take on both parties" and has "independent New Hampshire values."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/oct/24/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-ad-says-carol-shea-porter-partisan-democrat-f/	In New Hampshire’s highly competitive 1st Congressional District race, a Republican group is using a new ad to draw a stark contrast between Democratic Rep. Carol Shea-Porter and her GOP challenger, former Rep. Frank Guinta. Here’s the narration of the ad, which was paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House Republicans’ election arm: "Carol Shea-Porter votes with Nancy Pelosi’s Democrats 95 percent of the time. More spending, higher taxes. We need a change. As mayor, Frank Guinta brought a tax cap to Manchester and balanced four straight budgets. Frank will take on both parties. Cut spending, fight for a balanced budget, and restore Medicare to protect our seniors. Independent New Hampshire values, that’s Frank Guinta." But is the comparison in partisan voting patterns really that stark? The answer is no. Their records are easy to compare, because Shea-Porter and Guinta have traded off ownership of the seat over the past several election cycles. Shea-Porter was elected to the House in 2006 and 2008, lost to Guinta in 2010, then beat him in a rematch in 2012. The ad footnotes Shea-Porter’s 95 percent partisan voting record to a Washington Post vote study. That shows that Shea-Porter did indeed vote with her party 95 percent of the time in the current Congress. A similar study by Congressional Quarterly shows Shea-Porter’s partisan unity score ranging between 95 percent and 98 percent each year during her congressional career. So the ad has a point that Shea-Porter has loyally voted the party line in the House. The problem with the ad is in suggesting that Guinta has done the opposite. He hasn’t. The same Post tally shows that in Guinta’s term in Congress -- covering 2011 and 2012 -- he voted with his party 96 percent of the time. That’s barely distinguishable from how Shea Porter voted with her party. The CQ tally shows much the same: Guinta had a 97 percent partisan unity score in 2011 and 95 percent in 2012. NRCC spokesman Ian Prior countered with two arguments. First, he said that if Guinta had served as Manchester mayor with a "my-party-is-100-percent-right attitude, he wouldn’t have been able to implement a tax cap (or) balance four straight city budgets." Second, he said that Shea-Porter’s votes that make up that 95 percent "are out of touch with her district and show that she puts her own liberal agenda ahead of her district." Both points have merit but are far from bulletproof. On Prior’s first point, city-level policymaking tends to be more technocratic and shaped less by the national political partisanship that drives Congress. In the exact comparison between the two candidates -- how they have voted in Congress -- they have both voted in virtual partisan lockstep. On his second point, that Shea-Porter’s votes are out of step with the district, we’ll just note that the district voted for Obama for president not once but twice. It’s possible that voters have grown disgusted with his agenda since his 2012 reelection. We’ll soon find out: That’s what elections are for. Our ruling The NRCC ad says that Shea-Porter "votes with Nancy Pelosi’s Democrats 95 percent of the time," but Guinta "will take on both parties" and has "independent New Hampshire values." That’s a pretty stark comparison -- yet by the most apples-to-apples measurement of how both candidates have voted in Congress, Guinta scored a 96 percent partisan unity with Republicans during his term in Congress, which is hardly evidence of a big contrast. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-02111	Says he’s "the only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/may/14/john-stone/stone-claims-unique-position-gun-dealer/	It’s an attention-grabbing campaign ad. John Stone fires a cannon that he says resembles the one his forefathers used in the Revolutionary War. "As the only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress, I’m willing to do the same if we have to," Stone declares on the video. "But it's a whole lot easier just to vote in new House Republican leaders who will stand up to Obama and defend our Constitution." Stone, a Republican and former congressional aide, is making his second bid to unseat five-term 12th District U.S. Rep. John Barrow, a Democrat from Augusta. He last tried in 2008. The Second Amendment is a galvanizing issue, and politicians know it. Barrow pulled out his father’s gun, his grandfather’s gun and his National Rifle Association endorsement for an ad when he was fending off other challengers two years ago. And it’s unlikely that many would say it was coincidence that this year, with the entire General Assembly up for re-election, state lawmakers passed a gun bill that the NRA called the "most comprehensive" in recent Georgia history and that critics decried as one of the nation’s most extreme. But can Stone really say he’s the only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress? We decided a fact check was in order. We saw the potential to check Stone’s claim. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives keeps a database of all federal firearms licenses, so a check of those names against the names of all U.S. House and Senate candidates could do the trick. The only problem: There are about 140,000 current federal firearms licenses, and many are issued in the names of businesses and corporations, not individuals. Stone was forthcoming with us about his license (he even emailed us a copy) and about how he came to make his only-one-in-the-country claim. Friends in the firearms industry pointed out to him in 2012 that he might be the only U.S. House candidate with an ATF license, Stone said. He said he went to multiple sources for verification, including the NRA, Gun Owners of America, the National Shooting Sports Foundation and the ATF. "To everyone’s knowledge, I am the only one," Stone said. "I have Google and Bing searched this extensively, and to the best of my knowledge and ability to check, I am the only one." He volunteered that he would change his ad if another candidate were found to be able to make the same claim. But our research turned up another question: Can he really call himself a dealer? Stone has a federal firearms license. It is what’s known as a Curio and Relic license. He collects, restores and trades historic firearms, at least 50 years old, and as a hobby, not a business. When we asked the ATF to assist in our search for his license, we were told that, based on a code on the license, "he’s a collector, not a dealer," a distinction we wondered about since his ad says dealer. The ATF does issue what it labels as "dealer" licenses. They are largely reserved for gunsmiths, pawnbrokers and others who make a living buying and selling many types of guns. Jerry Henry, with the gun advocacy group GeorgiaCarry.org, said he thinks Stone’s YouTube claim is "misleading at best." "He’s a collector," Henry said. "That’s not what I consider a firearms dealer." Others we talked to agreed. Tim Coker with the National Firearms Dealer Network said gun enthusiasts hearing the claim would assume that Stone is a licensed dealer, selling modern firearms. NRA officials were not aware of Stone’s claim, spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said. The group has been a Barrow supporter. "He (Barrow) has stood steadfast with gun owners, hunters and sportsmen thought his career," Arulanandam said. Stone remains insistent. He sent us two dictionary definitions of dealer. He also said he deals in black-powder firearms and pre-1899 firearms, which require no ATF license, restrictions or registration on buying and selling. "I am a firearms dealer. I buy and sell firearms," he said. "This fact is indisputable." When we first started the fact check, we asked Stone why he decided to tout the fact that he was a federal firearms dealer. He said the discussion of where a candidate stands on Second Amendment rights can be time-consuming. With the dealer moniker as his calling card, he said his position is immediately clear. In summary, Stone, a former congressional aide, has proclaimed himself the "only licensed firearms dealer in America running for Congress." He said he wasn’t able to document that statement, but after talking with people in the firearms community, he believes it’s true. We couldn’t find any sources to definitively prove or disprove Stone’s claim of exclusivity. He does have a federal firearms license for a very niche group of collectors. He contends this status allows him to make the claim that he is a gun dealer. Others suggest his statement is misleading. Overall, a viewer of Stone’s ad needs much more information to weigh the value of his claim -- an awful lot of context is missing even though there is some truth to part of his statement. We rate the statement Half True.	None	John Stone	None	None	None	2014-05-14T00:00:00	2014-04-23	['United_States', 'United_States_Congress']
pomt-15081	"We had a three-hour debate, no discussion about the national debt, very little about the economy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/20/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-cnn-debate-had-no-question-debt-a/	The high polling numbers for the GOP presidential field’s "outsider" candidates are in part the result of the media refusing to discuss substantive issues, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. Rubio said on the Sept. 20, 2015, episode of This Week that political newcomers like Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson were seeing success because people were tired of establishment candidates. But the CNN debate earlier in the week in Simi Valley, Calif., also showed that coverage isn’t focused on the country’s problems, he said. "I don’t think it’s limited to the politicians, it’s also the media," Rubio said. "We had a three-hour debate, no discussion about the national debt, very little about the economy. It was a constant he-said-she-said, what do you say because so-and-so called you this name or that name." What did the candidates really discuss during the debate? We reviewed the transcript and wouldn’t say there was "no discussion" about the debt, but Rubio has a point there was little said about the economy. The economy We’ll actually start with how much the candidates said about the economy, because it came up first, much in the way Rubio described. (We reached out to his campaign for more on this but didn’t hear back.) After lengthy discussions about Trump’s worthiness as a candidate, Russia’s involvement in Syria, Congress attempting to defund Planned Parenthood, immigration and other issues, moderator Jake Tapper switched gears. "We've received a lot of questions on social media about the economy and about jobs," he acknowledged, but used the pivot to asked Fiorina to respond to Trump’s criticism of her record as CEO of Hewlett-Packard. Fiorina then recounted her history with the company, before mentioning voter concerns over the nation’s $18 trillion debt as an attack on Trump. "There are a lot of us Americans who believe that we are going to have trouble someday paying back the interest on our debt because politicians have run up mountains of debt using other people's money," Fiorina said to Trump. "That is in fact precisely the way you ran your casinos. You ran up mountains of debt, as well as losses, using other people's money, and you were forced to file for bankruptcy not once, not twice, four times, a record four times." Tapper later asked questions about the minimum wage and tax policy, which one could argue are related to the economy. But he asked no direct questions about job creation or debt. Still, candidates did mention the economy as they addressed other questions. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said that when he left Congress, "we had a $5 trillion surplus, and the economy was booming." He implied his time as a congressman from 1982 to 2001 will help him find consensus as president to "create a stronger economy for everybody." Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker pointed out Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton’s call for a higher minimum wage is "her answer to grow the economy." Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee mentioned that finding cures to cancer, heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer’s will save the country trillions, and would "change the economy and the country." Rubio, meanwhile, discussed the economy when answering a question about climate change. He said disregarding alarms raised by "the left-wing government" was necessary because "every proposal they put forward are going to be proposals that will make it harder to do business in America, that will make it harder to create jobs in America." "We are not going to destroy our economy," he said. "We are not going to make America a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing, nothing to change our climate, to change our weather, because America is a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, absolutely." New Jersey Gov. Christie also made mention of agreeing with Rubio that "we shouldn't be destroying our economy in order to chase some wild left-wing idea that somehow us by ourselves is going to fix the climate." Back in April, PolitiFact checked a statement by Rubio that "with certainty (cap and trade) would have a devastating impact on our economy." We rated it False. The national debt So candidates did discuss the economy, though with little in the way of concrete plans. There also were a few mentions of the national debt, in addition to Fiorina’s attack on Trump. Christie cited debt service as a major portion of what the federal budget is stuck dealing with. "Seventy one percent of all federal spending is on entitlements and debt service," he said. Bush said his 4 percent economic growth plan will "deal with the structural fiscal problems that exist because of our entitlement problems that will overwhelm and create way too much debt," but didn’t discuss specifics about controlling projected costs. Rubio brought up the national debt while trading barbs with Trump; Rubio mentioned the debt as a symptom of Washington dysfunction. "You have millions of people in this country living paycheck to paycheck, and nothing is being done about it," Rubio said. "We are about to leave our children with $18 trillion in debt, and they're about to raise the debt limit again." Our ruling Rubio said, "We had a three-hour debate, no discussion about the national debt, very little about the economy." He’s right there was very little mention of the economy, but the national debt was brought up by some of the 11 candidates, usually while addressing an opponent. We should note that even then, no one gave any specifics about what to do beyond some broad talking points. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-00291	Says Sen. Bill Nelson is a socialist.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2018/sep/27/rick-scott/gov-rick-scotts-ridiculous-statement-sen-bill-nels/	As dead fish washed up on some Florida shores, politicians dished blame about red tide. Now they are debating another type of red scare: socialism. "Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum — they're socialists," Gov. Rick Scott said at a Titusville event for his U.S. Senate campaign. Scott explained his comments further in an interview with Florida Today. "They want big government and socialism," Scott said. "They're both into higher taxes. Gillum said he's going to raise corporate taxes 40 percent. Nelson said that, if the Democrats get control, he's going to go back and raise the taxes. They don't believe that the tax cuts that we did this year are good for our state. If you look at their programs, they just want government to run everything." Scott linked the duo as offering a "very liberal, very radical and very risky direction for our state and country." We’ve previously rated a claim from Gillum’s opponent Ron DeSantis that Gillum has a "far left socialist platform" akin to Venezuela as False. Scott’s labeling of Nelson as a socialist is a misleading red-scare tactic — one from the Republican playbook this cycle after the surprise Democratic primary win of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist, in New York. Calling a politician in Florida a socialist packs particular punch because some Hispanic voters, a battleground demographic, have fled socialist regimes. What is socialist about Nelson’s record? Nelson has praised Gillum and may get a boost from the voter excitement he is generating. But he does not share Gillum’s more liberal positions. Scott’s campaign said in a press release that Nelson called Gillum's support for higher taxes, government-run health care and abolishing ICE "mainstream." The campaign linked to a Miami Herald article that didn’t make those points. The article said that Nelson and Gillum "represent two diverging camps of the Florida Democratic Party." Nelson said that Gillum’s policies weren’t too progressive for Florida, but he made no specific reference to raising taxes, government-run health care or abolishing ICE. Here is what Nelson actually said about Gillum’s platform: "You characterize it as being to the left," Nelson said to reporters. "You look at his positions, they’re mainstream: strengthening education, pay teachers, clean up the environment. Go through all the issues and I think that’s where the people of Florida are." In an interview with the Tampa Bay Times editorial board, Nelson showed that he doesn’t share all of Gillum’s views. Nelson said he doesn’t want to abolish ICE. When asked about Medicare for All, Nelson didn’t show interest. "I've got enough trouble just trying to save Obamacare," Nelson said. "I'm into results." Even though it doesn’t factually check out, the Scott campaign also said that Nelson "voted more than 300 times to raise taxes" — which we have rated False. Scott inflates the number by including nonbinding budget resolutions and multiple votes on the same piece of legislation. The list neglects that Nelson has, on occasion, voted for lower taxes. Nelson has been a critic of the 2017 tax bill, but that doesn’t mean he wants to raise taxes across the board. He said the bill didn’t do enough to help the middle class and shown support for reversing some cuts that benefit the rich. The Scott campaign also said that Nelson "embraced Obama’s plan to appease Cuban dictators and palled around with Assad and Hugo Chavez." But Nelson repeatedly criticized Chavez in 2004 and 2005, calling him a "serious threat." While While Nelson agreed with Obama’s decision to normalize relations with Cuba in 2014, Nelson has criticized Castro. (We fact-checked a similar attack by a GOP group about Nelson’s statements about Chavez and the Castro brothers and rated it Pants on Fire.) Experts said the socialist label doesn’t apply to Nelson Socialism is when the government owns (or at least controls) the means of production. Nelson hasn’t called for a government takeover of businesses. "Claiming that Nelson is a socialist is ludicrous," said Philip J. Williams, professor at the Center for Latin American studies at the University of Florida. "His stance in opposition to the tax cut bill and in support of Medicaid expansion are mainstream Democratic positions. (Even some Republican governors have supported Medicaid expansion, including John Kasich.)" While some might describe Medicare or Medicaid as socialism, because the government is providing health insurance to citizens, the health industry remains in private hands, said Sean D. Ehrlich, a Florida State University political science professor. "The government doesn’t control the production of health care," Ehrlich said, "they merely regulate some elements and reimburse providers and consumers for their health care costs." University of Miami professor Merike Blofield, an expert in Latin American and comparative politics, said that by the standards of other wealthy liberal democracies with public, universal health care, Nelson’s policy proposals are conservative. Our ruling Scott’s description of Nelson as a "socialist" is an inaccurate red scare tactic. The definition of socialism is a government takeover of production, and Nelson hasn’t called for that. Scott’s campaign pointed to Nelson’s support for Gillum, the Democrat running to the left of Nelson in the governor’s race. While Nelson has shown enthusiasm for Gillum, they are not lockstep on all issues. Gillum has called for abolishing ICE and Medicare for All, and Nelson has said he does not agree. Nelson’s criticism of the Republican tax bill isn’t the same as calling for higher taxes in general. And supporting an expansion of Medicaid is not the same as calling for government-run health care.

pomt-03688	"No poll done this year ... shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/22/dianne-feinstein/sen-dianne-feinstein-says-every-national-poll-year/	Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told fellow senators before they voted down her renewed ban on assault weapons that the American people sided with her. What’s more, she told them: Every poll said so. "In poll after poll, that support is there," she remarked from the Senate floor on April 17, 2013, the same day broader gun control legislation failed. "In no poll — even with all the discussion, even with the mobilization of gun owners and the NRA, a majority in every single national poll done shows that the majority want controls over assault weapons. I know of no poll done this year that shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons." A 1994 assault weapons ban, written by Feinstein, lapsed in 2004. After a gunman killed 20 children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012, she proposed the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 — a renewal and expansion of the original ban. Senators, who considered it as an amendment to a broader bill, voted 40 to 60 against it. Did they vote against a majority of Americans? "No poll done this year ... shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons," Feinstein said. We went in search of polls. ‘Assault weapons’ We combed through 18 polls with questions about assault weapons conducted between Jan. 9 and April 7. Nearly half of them occurred in January, both before and after President Barack Obama released his plan to reduce gun violence. He called for "banning military-style assault weapons." Feinstein’s bill, introduced a week after the president’s plan, proposed blocking the future manufacture, possession, sale and importation of 157 specific "semiautomatic assault weapons," such as AK-47s and UZIs, along with any other weapon with a detachable magazine and at least one "military characteristic," such as a pistol grip or barrel shroud. Pollsters used a range of phrases to describe firearms as they asked Americans about their support or opposition to a ban, from "assault rifles and semiautomatic weapons" to "military-style assault weapons." Here's a quick look at the results: Poll Date Question Support for ban Reason-Rupe Jan. 17-21, 2013 "Do you think people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons, or should people be allowed to own them?" 44% CNN/ORC International April 5-7, 2013 "Please tell me whether you would generally favor or oppose each of the following proposals which some people have made to reduce the amount of gun violence. ...

In 15 polls, conducted by organizations from ABC News/Washington Post to Quinnipiac University, the idea of a ban on such weapons got support from 54 percent to 69 percent of respondents, depending on the timing and phrasing of the question. In two, from CNN/ORC International and Fox News in April and March, support was 51 percent — with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. That means the polls reflected support between 48 percent and 54 percent, perhaps a majority and perhaps not. In other words, the "majority" wasn’t statistically significant. And one poll, from the libertarian Reason Foundation, asked the question in a distinctly different way, and got a different result. Most pollsters asked whether people supported or opposed a ban on assault weapons. Reason asked: "Do you think people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons, or should people be allowed to own them?" They found that just 44 percent of respondents thought people should be prohibited from owning assault weapons. We’ll note that the question goes beyond Feinstein’s legislation. Nothing in the bill would have prohibited people who already owned such weapons from keeping them. Still, argued Emily Ekins of Reason, "response variability across polls demonstrates support for an assault weapons ban is not as clear cut as some may have previously thought." Indeed, a USA Today/Gallup poll from December, in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shootings, also showed only 44 percent support for a law similar to Feinstein’s. Meanwhile, polls showed a partisan divide. In a January poll from Pew Research Center, for example, 55 percent of respondents favored an assault weapons ban. But just 44 percent of Republicans did. And a separate poll from Quinnipiac University in February showed that nearly half of Republicans might be less likely to vote for a member of Congress who voted for a ban on the sale of assault weapons — in addition to a third of independents and 11 percent of Democrats. That lack of support was most pronounced in the West. So, while national support was generally strong, as Feinstein said, individual lawmakers faced a different reality. Our ruling Feinstein claimed that a majority of the American people supported her bill, saying "no poll done this year ... shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons." She's largely accurate, though the "majority" in two national polls wasn’t statistically significant, and a poll by a libertarian foundation showed less than majority support for prohibiting assault weapon ownership. Meanwhile, limiting her statement to "this year" excluded a USA Today/Gallup poll from December that undermined her point. Still, the libertarian poll went beyond Feinstein’s proposal, which didn’t prohibit ownership of assault weapons by those who already own them. Otherwise, two polls teetered on the edge of majority support, while 15 others unequivocally supported her claim. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-15331	"We don’t have a (military) reserve force if something happens."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/14/joe-theismann/former-nfl-qb-joe-theismann-we-dont-have-reserve/	Former NFL quarterback Joe Theismann recently joined the all-female cast of Fox News’ Outnumbered to offer his perspective on recent news, from a federal judge ordering the logo of his former team to be canceled to the slaying of a San Francisco woman that sparked fresh debate about this country’s immigration policy. Theismann called the murder of Kathryn Steinle, 32, a tragedy and bemoaned the porous borders that allow undocumented immigrants to access the country, including the alleged killer, a Mexican felon who had been deported five times named Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez. After criticizing Donald Trump’s proposal to build a wall on the border as an unrealistic fix, Theismann warned that budget cuts to the military are making the already chaotic environment worse. "Our border patrol is spread out so thin that people just walk through, they don’t even know they’re there," Theismann said during the July 9 episode. "We’re faced with a situation now where you talk about National Guardsmen going down there. We’re about to cut the military by 40,000 people, which is another subject. We went from 500,000 down to 400,000. "We don’t have a reserve force if something happens." The retired quarterback who later had a long career as a sports broadcaster threw out a slew of facts, but the last one sounded the most alarming. Are U.S. leaders really sacrificing the military reserve as they whip the country into top fiscal shape? No — a fact Theismann acknowledged during a phone call with PunditFact. Theismann said he was trying to highlight cuts to the military that are, in fact, happening due to automatic federal spending cuts known as sequestration. But he took it too far. "With all the things that are happening in the world, especially in the Middle East right now, if we ever felt like we needed to get our ground forces involved, what position would we be in to deal with any difficult situation that could come up anywhere in the world?" Theismann told us. "Because I still believe that we should be the world power and by continuing to cut the military, I think we diminish the ability to be the biggest stick in the valley." "That was what I was trying to say in a short period," Theismann said. America’s reserve military forces include both the reserves and the National Guard. People may use the terms interchangeably, but they are different. National Guard units are jointly controlled by both state governors and the president and often respond to state-level emergencies, including riots, hurricanes and other disasters. Full reserves fall under the control of the president and the branch of the military in which they serve. Theismann clarified that he was talking about the Army Reserve, not the Army National Guard or other components of the National Guard. While it’s important to have your vocabulary correct, it doesn’t really affect the accuracy of Theismann’s claim either way. Both the National Guard and reserves expect cuts. But both will most definitely continue. The Army National Guard is scheduled to shed 15,000 soldiers by Sept. 30, 2017, as part of sequestration. This will bring the Army National Guard to 335,000 soldiers — down from its current size of 350,000. The Air National Guard will not lose positions due to sequestration, said National Guard spokesman Kurt M. Rauschenberg. The Army Reserve also expects to lose positions. On July 9, coincidentally the same day as this episode of Outnumbered, the U.S. Army announced how it would go about budget cuts that would affect active and reserve military. The Army Reserve said its force would drop to 185,000 if sequestration continues through the 2017 fiscal year, part of an overall cut of 60,000 soldiers. The active military could fall to 450,000 soldiers by the end of fiscal year 2018, down from 570,000 in 2012 after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under the current plan for cuts, the overall Army would drop from 1,042,200 soldiers to 980,000, a total that includes active-duty Army (full-time), Army National Guard (part-time, can be activated to respond to state emergencies) and Army Reserve (part-time branch of the Army). Army Reserve employees would fall from 202,000 soldiers to 195,000 by the end of the 2017 fiscal year. "I believe that where we are now is about as low as we can go," Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno told reporters in a May conference call, according to Army Times. "If we continue to go lower, we're going to have to say we cannot do all the things we're doing today." Our ruling Warning of a shorthanded military amid a border crisis, Theismann said, "We don’t have a reserve force if something happens." Theismann later admitted he didn’t choose his words very carefully. Automatic federal cuts as part of sequestration are shrinking the military. Leaders have warned that cuts could reduce the Army’s ability to respond to crises. But the Army Reserve, which Theismann says he was talking about, very much remains in existence. The Reserve would be available, along with the National Guard, to assist the border patrol or active military in emergencies. We rate his claim False.

pomt-02273	Says he was the only statewide elected official to speak in favor of a federal guest worker plan at the 2012 Republican Party of Texas convention.	true	/texas/statements/2014/apr/08/jerry-patterson/jerry-patterson-flew-solo-among-statewide-elected-/	Jerry Patterson, an unsuccessful candidate for lieutenant governor this year, subsequently said that he somewhat uniquely spoke out for a federal guest-worker program a few years ago. According to a March 30, 2014, news story in the San Antonio Express-News, Republicans including state Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, who's in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the party's lieutenant governor nomination with incumbent David Dewhurst, have talked about not putting language supportive of a guest-worker program in this year’s party platform, which is to be finalized by delegates to the next state convention in June 2014. Patrick has stumped on securing the Texas-Mexico border, also objecting in a Jan. 25, 2014, Twitter post to the "illegal invasion." The Express-News story described Patterson, the state land commissioner since 2003, as saying he was the only statewide elected official to speak in favor of the guest-worker plank at the June 2012 state convention where it was initially adopted. Patterson separately said on his 2014 campaign website: "Many of my elected colleagues privately expressed support, but told me that they just couldn’t take the risk." Did Patterson, who often flies his own plane between cities, venture solo in this way? Immigration in 2012 platform The immigration plank, on page 21 of the platform, states that mass deportation of all the undocumented individuals in the United States "would neither be equitable nor practical," while "blanket amnesty" would only encourage more illegal entries. The plank also calls for securing the border, modernizing Social Security cards and limiting birthright citizenship to babies born to a U.S. citizen. Finally, the plank calls for a temporary worker program "to bring skilled and unskilled workers into the United States for temporary periods of time when no U.S. workers are currently available," to be self-funded through participation fees and fines, the plank says. The guest-worker plank was characterized by proponents at the time as a meaningful breakthrough for the state party. A June 9, 2012, Texas Tribune news story quoted TexasGOPvote.com's Bob Price, a convention delegate, as saying adoption of the guest-worker provisions "takes away a tool that Democrats have used for years to drive a wedge between conservative Hispanics and Republicans." William Kelberlan, a delegate from Williamson County, told the Tribune: "It was a tough pill to swallow; it didn't go down easily." Kelberlan said he recognized the need for immigration reform but thought more time was needed to hammer out the details of what form it should take. Patterson spoke in favor of the guest-worker plank, according to the story, but it was silent on whether he was the sole statewide elected official to do so. Patterson invokes 'cojones' To our inquiry, Patterson indicated he remembers his solo status well. "Ain’t much to elaborate," he said by email. Asked if he’d heard the speeches given by other statewide elected officials and why he knows he was alone in this regard, Patterson replied: "I know all the statewides. I know what they do and say. I know who has cojones" (um, courage) "and who doesn't. I was the only one." By email, Steve Munisteri, the party chairman, confirmed Patterson was the only statewide elected official to speak during floor debate of the guest-worker plank and then only after delegates agreed to let him do so, Munisteri said. Separately, Brad Bailey told us he helped draft the relevant language as a delegate from Senate District 11 in Houston. By phone, Bailey said Patterson was alone among statewide elected officials in speaking about the guest-worker section. Main speeches lacked mention of guest-worker idea We didn't have to take anyone's word for this. Munisteri reminded us the party placed video recordings of the convention online. So we watched the speeches given by several statewide elected officials: U.S. Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn; Gov. Rick Perry; Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst; Attorney General Greg Abbott; Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples and State Comptroller Susan Combs. None — plus Patterson, in his main speech to the convention — aired support for a guest-worker law. In fact, only Staples mentioned conditions near the Texas-Mexico border. Patterson spoke from floor during platform debate But as delegates discussed the party platform, Patterson stepped to a microphone on the convention floor after Munisteri adjudged that two-thirds of the delegates, by a show of hands, had agreed to suspend the rules to let him join the conversation even though he wasn’t a delegate. (Hear Patterson’s remarks starting about the 11:15 mark of the video here.) Patterson opened by describing himself as a conservative who believes the platform’s immigration plank and border security "go hand in hand." He then said he supported the then-pending state law requiring most voters to present photo identification at the polls as well as initiatives stressing English as the state’s primary language. Patterson said he also supported a physical barrier on the U.S.-Mexico border, including a fence in some cases. He added that he opposed "unconditional birthright citizenship," bilingual "balance" and restrictions on police officers asking someone’s immigration status during an apprehension or investigation of a crime. Further, he said, he was opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants. But, Patterson said, "I will tell you… that I very loudly, firmly and with great fervor support… a guest-worker program as part of our border security." "We have folks in this country who are here to do us harm," Patterson said. "They are criminal, they are coyotes, they run things back and across the border whether they are illegals, whether they are drugs or contraband. "And we also have folks in this country," Patterson continued, "who want to work hard, pay their taxes, obey our laws. And there is no way for those to come here and do that lawfully because our immigration system is broken. We need a guest-worker, temporary guest-worker program that is in the immigration plank in our platform," he said. Our ruling Patterson said he was unique among statewide elected officials in speaking for the guest-worker section that became part of the Republican Party of Texas platform in 2012. True.

pomt-10178	"I introduced a bill that would’ve helped stop the multimillion-dollar bonus packages that CEOs grab on their way out.. (McCain) opposed that idea."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/25/barack-obama/mccain-never-talked-about-the-bill/	As Congress worked through the details of a $700-billion bailout of the financial system, the presidential candidates zeroed in on the issue of executive pay and skirmished over who could rightly take credit for sounding an alarm about highly compensated CEOs at troubled financial firms. Appearing in Dunedin, Fla., on Sept. 24, Barack Obama depicted John McCain as a recent convert on the issue of corporate accountability, and took credit for introducing legislation last year that would have imposed some formal restraint on big bonuses and severance payments that corporations routinely award top executives. "In the last few days, my opponent has decided to start talking tough about CEO pay. He’s suddenly a hard-charging populist. And that’s all well and good," Obama said. "But I sure wish he was talking the same way over a year ago, when I introduced a bill that would’ve helped stop the multimillion-dollar bonus packages that CEOs grab on their way out the door. Because he opposed that idea." Obama also lamented that McCain didn't join him in demanding accountability from troubled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose former chief executives received pay and bonus packages worth a combined $24-million. Obama was trying to tap into mounting public frustration over the prospect of CEOs exiting their posts with lavish pay and benefit packages while taxpayers cover the cost of saving their former firms. The Bush administration yielded this week to demands from congressional critics in both parties that the proposed bailout package include a provision to limit the pay packages of those executives whose companies would benefit from the bailout. But is Obama’s populist attack grounded in facts? We’ve already dealt with McCain’s response to the problems at Fannie and Freddie here (he called for a vigorous response to a 2006 report detailing shady accounting at Fannie) and his position on the bailout of the giant insurer American International Group in this item (he said management and speculators who created the mess shouldn’t be bailed out). It’s true that Obama wrote a bill that would have changed federal securities law to require shareholders of publicly traded companies to hold nonbinding votes on executive compensation packages. The measure, introduced on April 20, 2007, was one of a number of proposals circulating in Congress at the time that attempted to apply limits to executive compensation. But Obama's proposal has never come up for a hearing or a vote in the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. As for Obama’s contention that McCain opposed the measure, we reviewed McCain’s public statements and found nothing in his press releases or in the Congressional Record expressing opposition or support for Obama’s bill. We asked Obama’s campaign for evidence that McCain was against the proposal. They provided a copy of remarks McCain senior policy adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin made to the Wall Street Journal in April 2008 that the Arizona senator opposes legislative or regulatory fixes for executive pay problems, preferring private-sector intervention. But as early as 2002 McCain criticized excessive executive pay packages in the wake of the accounting scandal at energy giant Enron Corp. In a July 11, 2002, appearance at the National Press Club, McCain outlined a series of steps to "restore public confidence in corporate America" that included forcing executives to return any compensation directly received from their proven misconduct and preventing them from selling holdings of company stock while serving in that company. So Obama can legitimately take credit for introducing legislation that took aim at executive pay practices that have aroused tremendous public ire in the wake of the proposed financial bailout. But there's simply no evidence to support Obama's contention that McCain "opposed that idea." We can find no record that McCain ever uttered an opinion on Obama's proposal, and in fact it's clear that McCain has criticized excessive executive payouts in the past. The only thing the Obama campaign has to support its contention that McCain opposed Obama's executive pay bill is a remark in a news story from one of his to advisers about McCain's general preference for private-sector remedies — a remark made a full year after the Obama bill was introduced. It's not unreasonable to think McCain might have preferred a different approach to what Obama proposed, but that's just not enough to support what Obama is saying. We rate this attack Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04121	"Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with guns."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/09/pardeep-kaleka/son-sikh-temple-mass-shooting-victim-34-gun-murder/	After his father and five other worshippers were killed Aug. 5, 2012, in a mass shooting at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, Pardeep Kaleka joined a national campaign to address gun violence. Kaleka’s father, Satwant Singh Kaleka, died trying to stop gunman Wade Michael Page, who also wounded four other people, including a police officer, before killing himself. Pardeep Kaleka took part in promoting Demand a Plan, an effort to press President Barack Obama and Congress to develop a plan to counter gun violence. Kaleka spoke in a one-minute video posted on Demand a Plan’s website on Dec. 17, 2012 -- two months after three people were shot to death at a suburban Milwaukee salon and three days after 26 people were gunned down at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. He ended his plea by saying: "Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with guns. That’s 48,000 Americans murdered with guns during President Obama’s next term. I need to know what our leaders are going to do to stop the gun violence. I demand a plan." Let’s check the 34 Americans murdered figure, a statistic repeated by Kaleka’s brother, Amardeep Kaleka, in his own video on the website. Shootings spurred campaign The shooting at the Sikh temple, located in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek, is one of at least 62 mass shootings in the U.S. in the past 30 years, according to a December 2012 article in Mother Jones. Most of the killers were mentally ill and obtained their guns legally, the liberal magazine reported. Demand a Plan was launched in July 2012 after 12 people were shot dead earlier that month at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. The sponsor of the campaign is Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a national group that includes Oak Creek Mayor Steve Scaffidi and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. The mayors group, headed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, backs legislation that would, among other things, require every gun buyer to pass a criminal background check; and ban military-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines. Similar claim checked The claim Kaleka makes in his video was also made in December 2012 by Democrat Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, N.J., on ABC's "This Week with George Stephanapoulos." PolitiFact New Jersey rated it Mostly True. Our colleagues found that, between 2005 and 2009, an average of 34 Americans were killed by guns each day. The figure, which doesn't include suicides or accidents, is from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But more recent figures from the CDC, which tracks the causes of deaths for U.S. residents, had been released in September 2012. The newer figures show that, for 2006 through 2010, the five-year rolling average for gun homicides dropped to 33. In 2010 alone, there were 31,672 gun-related deaths, including 19,392 suicides and 11,078 homicides. The remaining deaths were classified as unintentional (606), undetermined (252), or legal intervention/war (344). PolitiFact New Jersey also pointed out that, on an annual basis, the gun homicide figure is dropping. An average of 30 people were killed in 2010 and the preliminary figure for 2011 is also 30. That's down from the average of 35 in 2006, the highest year of the decade. Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for Demand a Plan, told us the number of gun homicides might be declining because of improvements in medical care have resulted in more lives being saved. She cited a December 2012 news article in The Wall Street Journal. The article said that the number of people shot in the U.S. is increasing, but the percentage who die is decreasing. The article quoted experts as saying improvement in medical care is a major factor in the decline in gun homicides. Our rating As part of a national campaign to address gun violence, Pardeep Kaleka, the son of a Wisconsin gun homicide victim, said: "Every day, 34 Americans are murdered with guns." The average for 2010, the most recent year for which complete figures are available, was 30. But the latest rolling five-year average, the type of measure Kaleka used, was 33, slightly less than what Kaleka claimed. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-11558	"First NFL team declares bankruptcy over kneeling thugs."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/07/blog-posting/no-jaguars-nfl-team-didnt-declare-bankruptcy-after/	Taking a knee in protest during the national anthem has led the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team to bankruptcy, a fake viral post on Facebook said. "First NFL team declares bankruptcy over kneeling thugs," said a Feb. 2 headline on TopBuzz, an open platform where anyone can post articles and videos. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that there is no evidence that the Jaguars plan to file for bankruptcy as a result of players taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality or injustice against African-Americans. The fact-checking website Snopes found that the same story was posted by Patriot Post, a satirical website, on Dec. 3. The article has since been posted by many other websites including Defense USA, Santa Christmas and Policetask. The Feb. 2 story said that "last week" 31 of 42 men on the Jaguars took a knee during the national anthem. (The Jaguars’ schedule shows their last game was Jan. 21, so technically they didn’t play the week before Feb. 2.) The players angered "every God-fearing, country-loving American who has either had the honor to serve or know someone who did. They might as well have wiped their proverbial asses with the American flag," the story said. The story said that the Jaguars were "quietly maneuvering behind the scenes to file a Chapter 11 reorganization of debt bankruptcy in the 3rd District Court of Atlanta next week." We found no such court in Atlanta, and we found there is a bankruptcy court much closer to home: the Florida Middle Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville. We searched news reports and found nothing about the Jaguars moving toward bankruptcy. Forbes valued the Jaguars at about $2 billion, in 25th place, in it’s 2017 ranking of the value of NFL teams. The controversy about football players’ silent protests began in 2016, when then-NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick initially sat, and later switched to taking a knee, during the pre-game anthem to protest racial discrimination, especially at the hands of police. Those protests became even more politicized after President Donald Trump tweeted Sept. 23, 2017 that any such players who don’t stand during the national anthem should be fired. The next day, dozens of NFL players nationwide took a knee in protest, including some Jaguars players during their game in London. The Jaguars drew particular attention because their owner, Shahid Khan, a Pakistan-born Muslim and only nonwhite NFL owner, publicly showed his support for the protests. Khan joined his team on the field and locked arms to show solidarity during the game. "We have a lot of work to do and we can do it, but the comments made by the president make it harder," Khan said in a statement. "That's why it was important for us, and personally for me, to show the world that even if we may differ at times, we can and should be united in the effort to become better as people and a nation." Khan had donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration but has also criticized Trump’s attempt to ban immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries. We emailed the Jaguars’ public relations office and did not get a reply. The protests by NFL players have fueled multiple fake news stories including that a flight crew took a knee and stranded the New Orleans Saints on an airport runway, and that the NFL fined Pittsburgh Steelers $1 million each for skipping national anthem and that Fox Sports cancelled NFL broadcasts. All of those stories rated Pants on Fire, and in this case the claim that the Jaguars declared bankruptcy over "kneeling thugs" is also made up.

pomt-03664	A recent study of a proposed cap-and-trade policy’s effect on Wisconsin consumers showed it could "raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent" by 2030.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/28/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-recent-study-showed-wisconsin-gas/	Ron Johnson described believers in man-made causes of climate change as "crazy" when he ran for U.S. Senate in 2010, saying that sunspot activity or "just something in the geologic eons of time" were more likely explanations for extreme weather. Now in his third year in the Senate, Johnson is markedly more diplomatic when responding to constituents who want him to support limits on greenhouse gas emissions. "Thank you for taking the time to contact me regarding cap-and-trade policies and climate change," he wrote to Greg Everett, a retired musician from Conover on March 26, 2013. "I share your desire to protect our natural environment." Still, Johnson sought to make clear to Everett -- who had signed a petition asking Johnson to support cap and trade -- his continued opposition to government intervention in this realm. "But I am equally concerned that misguided efforts to improve the environment can destroy much-needed jobs and new job creation," Johnson said in a response that Everett posted on his blog. "Too often, these policies become so prohibitively expensive that they undermine economic growth and the average American's ability to support himself or herself." Johnson then referred to "a recent study of a proposed cap-and-trade policy." The study, he wrote, "showed it would cost Wisconsin nearly 75,000 jobs by 2030 and result in a loss of disposable income of up to $6,900 per household. It could also raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent." We’re aware there’s general agreement that cap-and-trade legislation carries a cost for most -- if not all -- consumers. But the numbers Johnson cites on gas and electric costs are eye-popping. Let’s take a look. How cap and trade works Generally speaking, cap and trade works like this: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. Companies that find ways to reduce pollution easily and cheaply can end up with extra credits, and sell them to other companies that have trouble reducing their emissions or want to make longer-term investments in conservation, according to a summary by the Environmental Defense Fund. While companies may exchange allowances, the overall limit on pollution remains in place. The cap would then be reduced over time to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions. A lower cap aims to make it more costly for utilities and industries to continue burning fossil fuels. When we asked Johnson for backup, a spokesman in his office said the constituent response refers to a 2008 study commissioned by groups concerned about a cap-and-trade bill introduced in the Senate. The study does have numbers very close to what Johnson cited -- 141 and 177 percent increases, for gas and oil, solely because of the bill. The study broke out price effects for each state, as well as a national figure. But several things jumped out at us about the study. In predicting price effects over nearly 25 years, the study presents a range of low and high price-hike estimates, not single figures. The low-cost estimate for gasoline is 72 percent, half of the worst-case estimate. For electricity, the low end increase was 126 percent. Johnson mentions only the worst-case scenario, though he did frame it as prices "could" jump by the higher figures. The study was commissioned by two groups that have opposed legislative efforts on climate change on the same economic grounds that Johnson cites. They are the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF) and National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). It is relatively recent, 2008, but it focused on a bill -- the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act (S. 2191) -- first introduced in 2007. It was replaced by a companion bill in 2008, which died in the Senate. Neither got as much traction as a 2009 bill that passed the House. When we broadened our search, we found numerous impact studies by public and private entities on cap-and-trade legislation, and specifically on Lieberman-Warner. According to experts, all such efforts at forecasting energy price increases are iffy due to the complexity level. The cost projections on Lieberman-Warner are "at best speculative" and should be viewed skeptically, warned an exhaustive Congressional Research Service review of six studies. "It is difficult to project costs up to the year 2030, much less beyond. The already tenuous assumption that regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic, and other unforeseen events loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled." Fuel price estimates, in particular, vary widely depending on various assumptions made by researchers, the review said. And the study for the manufacturing group -- cited by Johnson -- showed dramatically higher increases in gasoline prices than predicted in studies by two government agencies and a non-profit that supports cap and trade, the research service found. Gasoline: The Johnson-cited study projected hikes of $1.70 to $3.25 per gallon by 2030, while the federal government’s official source of energy statistics, the Energy Information Administration (EIA), predicted increases of 40 cents per gallon. The non-profit Clean Air Task Force put the hike at 25 cents. The figures compared are national, not specific to Wisconsin. Electricity: The Johnson-cited study predicted increases at least twice as high as studies by EIA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Task Force, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Mining Association. Again, the figures are national. The CRS specifically warned about breaking down cost impacts state by state -- as the manufacturers study did -- saying: "Simple attempts by some presentations to break down the cost by industrial sector or by state should be viewed with attentive skepticism." Overall, the service found, "the more comprehensive analyses are the work by EPA, EIA, and MIT." Another bill, another study The two groups behind the study Johnson relied on also did a separate projection of the Wisconsin energy cost impact of a more recent bill -- the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 sponsored by U.S. Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey. The Waxman-Markey bill, unlike Lieberman-Warner, passed the House 219-212 on June 26, 2009. It did not get a Senate vote. Its impact was studied in 2009. In that study, the two groups projected much smaller price increases from Waxman-Markey (19.9 percent to 26.1 percent for gas, and 37.5 percent to 59.7 percent for electric)than from the bill Johnson chose to highlight (increases well over 100 percent). That’s likely because Waxman-Markey rolled some of the revenue from pollution permits back to consumers in the form of rebates or expanded efficiency programs. Johnson spokesman Brian Faughnan told us Johnson’s climate change letter was simply an attempt to show the reasonable possible impact of major legislation that started in the Senate, the chamber where he serves. "Senator Johnson’s letter does not claim to give a full range of the estimates of the impact of cap and trade," Faughnan wrote in an email to us. And in any event, the two studies by the manufacturers show major increases in gas prices, and significantly greater electricity costs, Faughnan wrote. Our rating Experts agree that cap and trade likely means higher energy costs for consumers. Johnson goes further, saying it would be "prohibitively expensive." He tells constituents he opposes it in part because a "recent study" showed it could "raise gasoline prices by 141 percent and electricity rates by 171 percent." There is a study that includes those estimates for Wisconsin. But Johnson ignores critical facts. The same study cites much smaller increases under a second scenario. And its conclusions, published by opponents of the bill, are an outlier among several other studies that independent congressional researchers say were more thorough -- and show much smaller increases. He also ignores studies that said a more recent bill dramatically held down the size of cost increases to consumers. In an area in which precise conclusions are difficult, Johnson cherry-picks one study of a dead bill and presents its worst-case scenario as hard evidence of "prohibitively expensive" effects of a cap and trade approach. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2013-04-28T09:00:00	2013-03-26	['Wisconsin']

pomt-11456	"The Koch brothers have given" Paul Ryan "$500,000 in campaign contributions."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/09/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-stumping-paul-ryan-opponent-randy-b/	At or near the top of liberals’ love-to-hate list are "the Koch brothers" -- billionaire industrialists and funders of conservative causes, Charles and David Koch. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders took a swipe at them with an eye-popping statement about campaign cash during his most recent visit to Wisconsin. The Vermont independent, who won the Badger State during his 2016 bid for the Democratic nomination for president, was keynoting a Feb. 24, 2018 rally in Racine for Randy Bryce. Bryce is one of two Democrats running for the southern Wisconsin congressional seat held by Republican U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan. Ryan, who was first elected to the seat in 1998, has repeatedly said he won’t decide until spring whether he’ll run for re-election in November 2018. Sanders said: And this particular election could not be clearer in terms of the competing visions for America. It is not an accident that Paul Ryan now has, I think, $10 million in his campaign war chest. It is not an accident that the Koch brothers have given him $500,000 in campaign contributions. It had been reported a month before Sanders’ visit that Ryan had $10 million in cash on hand in his campaign account as of the end of 2017. But did $500,000 of it come from the Koch brothers? It may not seem like it sometimes, but there are still limits on how much individuals can give to candidates. We found Sanders’ claim is partially accurate, but takes things out of context. The money To back Sanders’ claim, his campaign directed us to page 364 of a January 2018 Federal Election Commission report filed by something called Team Ryan. The report shows that in November 2017, Team Ryan received $247,700 each from Charles Koch and his wife, Elizabeth Koch, of Wichita, Kan. That’s a total of almost $500,000 ($495,400). But were those campaign contributions given to Ryan? Not exactly. To ‘Ryan’ Team Ryan is a joint fundraising committee that raises and transfers money to three groups: 1. Ryan for Congress -- that is, Ryan’s own campaign fund. 2. Prosperity Action, a leadership political action committee run by Ryan that gives money to other politicians. 3. National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm for House Republicans. In disputing Sanders’ claim, Ryan’s campaign said the vast majority of the Koch money goes to the National Republican Congressional Committee, given that there are federal limits on what an individual can give to Ryan’s campaign ($5,400 per election cycle) and to Ryan’s leadership PAC ($5,000 per calendar year). Campaign finance experts from three nonprofits, the Center for Responsive Politics, the Campaign Finance Institute and Common Cause, confirmed to us that those limits apply to the Koch donations. That means the $495,400 in Koch money to Team Ryan would break down this way: Ryan’s campaign $10,800 Ryan’s leadership PAC $10,000 National Republican Congressional Committee $474,600 Two points worth noting as we close: 1. Team Ryan raised $44 million in 2017, a record for a House speaker in a non-election year. In announcing the $44 million in January 2018, Team Ryan said it would be transferring $32 million to the NRCC. 2. The contributions by Charles and Elizabeth Koch were made 13 days after the House passed the Ryan-backed GOP tax reform that was signed into law by President Donald Trump. Both Charles and David Koch were major advocates for the tax plan, which cuts the corporate tax rate and estate taxes. Our rating At a campaign rally for one of the candidates running for Ryan’s U.S. House seat, Sanders said "the Koch brothers have given" Ryan "$500,000 in campaign contributions." It wasn’t the two Koch brothers but rather one of the brothers, and his wife, who contributed $495,400. The money was given to a joint fundraising committee controlled by Ryan. But it primarily funds campaigns of other Republicans because, by law, only $10,800 could go to Ryan’s own campaign fund. We rate Sanders’ statement Half True.

pomt-02487	"When union membership goes down, so do (middle class) wages."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/18/ed-schultz/schultz-go-unions-so-go-wages/	In the days before workers rejected an attempt to unionize a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., MSNBC host and union supporter Ed Schultz attempted to underscore what he thought was at stake. "If it fails, it could be a major setback for workers all across this country," Schultz told viewers. Schultz then pointed to a chart showing two lines that headed down over time. One was the percentage of union workers and the other was, in his words, "middle class income." "Quite the parallel there, isn’t there?" Schultz said. "When union membership goes down, so do wages. This vote is a pivotal moment for union workers in this country." Schultz, who did not respond to our requests for comment, is right to point out that union membership affects wages. But his wording takes things a little too far. We’ll explain why in this fact-check. How unions affect wages We found the chart that Schultz had on his show. It comes from the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy group, and shows the percentage of union workers falling from about 28 percent in 1967 to about 11 percent today. In the same period, the share of the nation’s income going to the middle 60 percent of households declined from 52.3 percent to 45.7 percent. That seems to support Schultz’s claim, but actually it doesn’t prove his point. First, he talked about wages and the chart talks about the share of the national income, which is different. One is money in your pocket and the other is money in your pocket compared to the money in rich peoples’ pockets. In fact, according to the Pew Research Center, a reliable source of neutral number crunching, household median income rose between 1967 and 2012 by about $7,000 after accounting for inflation. If you want to find the strongest evidence for Schultz’s statement, you have to look at the wages for men. Work by economists Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney finds median wages for men slipped slightly starting in 1970 and have remained stagnant ever since. But while wages and union membership might have fallen (or flatlined) at the same time, it doesn’t mean one caused the other. That’s where independent research picks up. Most analysts have looked at Schultz’s claim from another angle, by seeing if unions raise wages. The research shows generally, yes. We found near consensus that unions tend to deliver higher pay for their members. "Unions raise wages for people in the middle of the skills distribution about 10 to 15 percent," said David Card, one of the leading economists in this field at the University of California-Berkeley. Card’s work is full of daunting equations and statistical techniques, but within those, he teases out the role a person’s skill level plays. Card has found that people with higher skills are less inclined to join unions and that union employers tend to avoid lower-skilled workers. That means the biggest impacts of unions are felt among people in the middle. Another leading researcher, David Macpherson at Trinity University, uses data from the federal government’s Current Population Survey to produce a database called Unionstats.com. In the latest numbers for 2013, Macpherson finds unions play a larger role in shaping wages in the private sector than in the government sector. "The union premium is about 20 percent in the private sector," Macpherson said. "While in the public sector, it’s about 9 percent." Any number, however, has caveats and is imprecise, economists told us. They point to holes in the data and the challenge of separating the impact of unions compared to other macroeconomic forces, such as global competition. There’s also evidence the union effect has dropped over time. Still, according to the experts we reached, unions are good for their members. For the record, economist John DiNardo at the University of Michigan studied companies where unionization votes -- both for and against -- were very close. DiNardo found that it didn’t really matter whether workers approved or rejected unions. Wages in both kinds of companies followed the same path. Where Schultz goes too far So there is broad consensus that unions are typically good for people who join them in that it results in increased wages. But Schultz’s claim was broader than that. He said that when union membership goes down, people not only lose the potential to earn more -- their wages drop. And that happens regardless of whether you had the chance to join a union or not. That’s a trickier claim to substantiate, but there are some theories on how that could happen. Labor economist Richard Freeman at Harvard University speaks of the "threat effect", that is, when non-union employers raise wages to avoid a successful union vote by their workers. Freeman found evidence of companies raising wages to undermine union growth in the 1950s and 1960s when unions were strong. But today is a different story, he said. "To go from those situations and show they affect the whole economy is a stretch," Freeman said. "Schultz's claim is plausible, and it may be right, but we don't really know the magnitude of the spillover." Other powerful forces are also at play, Freeman said. Global competition and much greater use of technology hurt some workers and helped others. There is no consensus on the role unions by themselves played over the decades. On one end, there is the work of Macpherson and his colleagues. Macpherson looked at how much of the nation’s total income went to workers since the mid 1960s. It has gone up a bit and down a bit, but generally it held steady even as the percentage of union workers fell. "I don’t see any evidence that wages across the board went down as union membership declined," Macpherson said. But Macpherson’s data didn’t look at the distribution of those wages. A CEO’s pay was mixed in with that of a store clerk. Other researchers have focused on how pay is spread around. Sociologists Jake Rosenfeld at the University of Washington and Bruce Western at Harvard concluded that men who work full-time would be doing appreciably better if union membership hadn’t fallen since the 1970s. How much better? Rosenfeld said if more men -- again, it’s the male workers -- had belonged to unions, their yearly wages would have increased about $2,600. Card at the University of California had similar results. "The decline in unionization has reduced wages for people in the middle relative to those in the top," Card said. Setting aside the matter of unions and income inequality, here is one point on which Rosenfeld, Macpherson and Freeman generally agree. The impact of unions depends heavily on the nature of the work and where it takes place. When unions are strong in a particular industry and a particular region, Rosenfeld said it raises the bar and non-union managers tend to mimic their neighbors. "If that (other) firm happens to be union, then you're paying union-level wages regardless of whether your company is organized," Rosenfeld said. "Was Ed Schultz right to say that 'when union membership goes down, so do wages?' " Rosenfeld said. "Sure -- for union members and for those non-members who worked in areas and occupations where labor was strong. For everyone across the whole economy? Probably not." Our ruling Schultz said when union membership goes down, so do wages. Schultz emphasized that "all workers" have a stake in this and his chart tied union membership to the income of everyone in the middle class. Schultz would have done better to have talked about the distribution of income rather than wages. His claim is most likely to be true for male union workers and only partly true for non-union workers. Even for union workers, other factors such as globalization and technology have diminished the union effect. The ability of unions to push up wages for workers outside the union is limited to certain industries that operate in the same region. Schultz’s statement has a measure of truth but in today’s economy, the data don’t support the strong tie he suggests between unions and wages overall. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-02729	"Florida has experienced positive job growth for 39 consecutive months."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/dec/19/republican-party-florida/nod-rick-scott-republican-party-says-florida-had-3/	After a recent Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times investigation revealed that state incentives have so far only led to a tiny sliver of promised jobs, Gov. Rick Scott and the Republican Party of Florida decided to fight back with their own job statistics. "Florida has experienced positive job growth for 39 consecutive months," the Republican Party of Florida posted on Facebook this month. The claim seemed odd to us, since 39 months would include part of former Gov. Charlie Crist’s term. We wanted to dig further. Florida job statistics currently are available through October 2013, meaning Scott has been in office for 34 months where figures are available. In that time, Florida has gained jobs in 29 months and lost jobs in five months -- including as recently as May. That means Florida has added jobs for five consecutive months, according to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, not 39. Case closed? Not entirely. The state Republican Party told us it didn’t mean "consecutive" as in month after month. Instead, Republicans said they were comparing each month to the same month the previous year -- so October 2012 vs. October 2013, etc. By that measure, Florida has had 39 months of positive job growth. According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, the last month that saw a decline in the total number of people employed compared to the same month the previous year was July 2010. We turned to economists to see what they thought of the GOP’s wording and approach. They said the GOP was misleading in its wording but that one measure of job growth isn’t necessarily better than the other. Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody’s and Bill Seyfried, an economist at Rollins College in Florida, told us it can be more useful to look at trends over a few months in a row. "For example, In March and April of 2013, the Florida economy added about 25,000 and 19,000 jobs, respectively," Seyfried said. "There were about 5,000 fewer jobs in May but then about 36,000 jobs added over the next two months. As an economist, I view May as the outlier given solid employment gains in the two months before and two months afterwards. I wouldn’t extend that to 12 months, but normally would focus on the three-month average (as opposed to just one month at a time)." Gary Burtless, an economist at Brookings, said that most readers would have misinterpreted the Republican Party’s statement to refer to one month followed by the next month. "Employment has generally increased over the past 39 months," he said. But "it simply hasn't increased for 39 consecutive months." Retired University of Florida economics professor David Denslow agreed. The GOP "should have said, Florida has experienced positive year-over-year job growth for 39 consecutive months,’ " Denslow said. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said "Florida has experienced positive job growth for 39 consecutive months." Economists say the state GOP is guilty of sloppy wording here. Florida has not experienced 39 consecutive months of job growth. The correct figure is five. But there is a sliver of truth if you look at the claim through the GOP’s eyes. Florida has seen year-over-year job growth for 39 consecutive months, which while not what Republicans said, is an equally notable metric. Words matter. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03340	The city of Brookhaven’s ordinance could cause the Pink Pony to close, thereby "putting 300 Pink Pony employees out of work in this economy."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/22/pink-pony/pink-pony-ad-warns-fight-could-cost-jobs/	We couldn’t resist. The folks who run the Pink Pony Gentlemen’s Club recently paid for an ad in a community newspaper claiming several hundred people would be unemployed if a city of Brookhaven ordinance forced the strip club to shut its doors. Dancers. Bartenders. Even "house moms." We’ll get to the house moms in a minute. "FACT," the ad says in red letters. The ad said the city’s ordinance would put "300 Pink Pony employees out of work in this economy." A colleague saw the ad in a DeKalb County newspaper and forwarded it to us. The ad included a prior fact check we wrote looking into the Pink Pony’s claim that management has never been cited for a violation of a state law or ordinance. That one was rated True. We at PolitiFact Georgia are typically digging into technical topics and slogging through long reports; so we virtually danced (with our clothes on) at another opportunity to fact-check a claim by the club. Does the Pink Pony really employ 300 people? "Three hundred might be a conservative number," said Aubrey Villines, an attorney who specializes in First Amendment issues who represents the club. In May, the Pink Pony filed a lawsuit against the DeKalb County municipality claiming Brookhaven’s ordinance to regulate sexually oriented businesses would put the club out of business. Specifically, the ordinance would prohibit nude dancing, with or without serving alcohol. The city has said it will not enforce the ordinance until a DeKalb County Superior Court judge rules on its legality. The lawsuit is serious business, Villines says. The Pink Pony claims Brookhaven would lose $450,000 a year in property and sales taxes, along with license and permit fees. It’s also a big deal for Brookhaven taxpayers, who are paying legal fees associated with the lawsuit. There’s been plenty of news coverage over the years about how the strip club business has made it rain with greenbacks in Atlanta. (See: The Gold Club, Adam "Pacman" Jones.) Cab drivers, food delivery workers, they all make money off the Pink Pony, Villines said. "If we leave that area (of Brookhaven), it will cave under," Villines said, stressing that was the main point of the ad. Villines estimated the Pink Pony employs about 200 dancers. Some work there a couple of days a week, he said. Others, he said, work as many as five days a week. There’s the bartending staff, servers, the kitchen crew, security, disc jockeys, the janitorial staff. And, yes, house moms. House moms, Villines explained, are women who help dancers if they encounter work-related trouble, such as a flat tire en route to the Pony. Their duties include making sure the dancers don’t drive home under the influence. "They’re the first line of defense," Villines said of house moms. The Pink Pony, though, wouldn’t show us any proof that they have 300 people on the payroll. They couldn’t reveal that sort of information, Villines said. DeKalb County, though, requires strip club dancers, waitresses, bartenders and bouncers to get an annual license to work at adult entertainment establishments. The dancers pay $300 a year; the other occupations pay $200 a year. As of July 18, there were 352 men and women licensed to work at the Pink Pony, county records show. The records do not show each employee is currently working there. So, there are more than 300 people currently licensed to work at the club, which is more than what the Pink Pony claimed in its ad. Still, we don’t know if all of them are regularly working there. Do the majority of the 200 or so dancers work two days a week? Once every two months? The Pink Pony claim is partially accurate, but it ignores a lot of context that would give a reader a different impression. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08903	"I don't think the argument can be credibly made that the United States of America is undertaxed compared to our competitors."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/29/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-us-not-undertaxed-compared-its-c/	Tim Pawlenty -- Minnesota's outgoing Republican governor and a likely candidate for president in 2012 -- met with Washington reporters on July 26, 2010, for a wide-ranging discussion of politics and policy. One of the things he said made it into the reports of at least two journalists in attendance, Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post and John Dickerson of Slate.. Asked what his reaction would be if a presidential commission on the national debt were to recommend a mix of spending cuts and tax increases, Pawlenty said, "Not good. I don't think the argument can be credibly made that the United States of America is undertaxed compared to our competitors." In an opinion column published the following day, Marcus took aim at Pawlenty's remark. "Actually," Marcus wrote, "the United States is on the low end in terms of the overall tax burden -- 28 percent of gross domestic product in 2007, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, compared with an average of 36 percent in the 30 OECD countries. Only South Korea, Mexico and Turkey were lower." By locating the OECD chart -- which is exactly what we would have done -- Marcus ably did much of our work for us. But we still wanted to check with a few tax experts to make sure that she didn't miss anything in her analysis. Three experts we queried -- Daniel J. Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, William Ahern, the director of policy and communications at the Tax Foundation, a tax research group, and Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research -- all agreed with Marcus's conclusion, though Ahern and Mitchell took the opportunity to add some additional context. Ahern said that tax-burden-to-GDP ratios -- the data that underlies the OECD chart -- should be used carefully because they can obscure deficits. A country with a low tax-to-GDP ratio may have a substantial deficit, and in time, that deficit will put upward pressure on taxes. So nations with low tax-to-GDP ratios may not find those ratios sustainable over the long term. Mitchell, for his part, agreed with Marcus' point about the overall tax burden, but he noted that in the U.S., the burden from different types of taxes varies. Some types of taxes, such as corporate taxes, are among the highest of the OECD nations. Others are closer to average, such as the top income tax rate and the capital gains tax rate. "The big reason the U.S. has a lower aggregate tax burden when measured as a share of GDP is that we don't -- yet -- have a value-added tax," Mitchell said. "Our payroll taxes also tend to be lower than average." Indeed, when we contacted Pawlenty's camp, a spokesman cited the high rates of corporate taxes in the U.S. "This unacceptably high corporate tax rate makes the U.S. less competitive by encouraging companies to shift investment to nations with lower corporate tax rates," said spokesman Alex Conant. Despite the caveats from our experts, we see no reason to undercut Marcus' finding that the U.S. ranks low among other developed countries in total tax burden. Corporate taxes are comparatively high in the U.S., and that's a worry for businesses and, indirectly, for their employees and customers. But corporate taxes only accounted for 12 percent of federal tax revenues in 2008, so we don't think it's valid to focus on that factor to the exclusion of the broader tax burden.

pomt-13570	"22 veterans take their own lives each day."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/aug/23/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-slightly-claim-about-veterans-suicid/	In her campaign for U.S. Senate, California Attorney General Kamala Harris has pledged to "clean up" the scandals and reduce wait times at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The issue, Harris has said, is a matter of life and death. "It is unconscionable that 22 veterans take their own lives each day. We must ensure that they have support to adjust to civilian life," Harris, a Democrat, said on Twitter on August 18, 2016. Harris made the same claim about veterans suicides on her website here, where she adds that she’ll work "to ensure that every Veteran knows what benefits they earned and how to access those benefits." We wondered whether the suicide statistic Harris used is correct. Checking a somber number Her campaign spokesman said Harris used a widely-cited figure of 22 suicides per day from the VA’s 2012 Suicide Data Report, which examined veterans deaths in 21 states, from 1999 to 2011. That study’s researchers, as noted by the Washington Post Fact Checker, cautioned against the use of the 22-deaths figure more than once in the study: "It is recommended that the estimated number of veterans be interpreted with caution due to the use of data from a sample of states." Researchers gave a range of 18 to 22 veteran suicides a day. Harris chose the high-end of this range. Importantly, Harris’ figure of 22 suicides per day fails to account for research the VA released in July for its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides. The VA examined about 55 million veterans records from 1979 through 2014. It found that in 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, 7,403 veterans took their own lives, or an average of about 20 a day. That’s close to the 22 suicides per day cited by Harris, a figure that continues to be used by many others despite the new, more extensive research. It does not take away from the point Harris is trying to make: That the rate of veterans suicide is far too high. VA figures show that in 2014 veterans accounted for 18 percent of all deaths from suicides among adults in the United States while they made up only 8.5 percent of the population. Capital Public Radio / File photo One prominent voice in American politics has cited the new number. PolitiFact Virginia rated a claim by Donald Trump in July that "a shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans," as True, based on this new report. PolitiFact Virginia added that the VA always acknowledged that this old study (from 2012) was limited. Notably absent were records for California and Texas — two states with very high veteran populations. The new figure of 20 veteran suicides a day is based on records from every state. When asked, Harris’ campaign spokesman acknowledged there has been new research. "Kamala believes strongly we must work hard to get that number to zero," the spokesman added. Old study widely cited Harris is not the only person to cite the 22 suicides per day statistic from the old study. Her opponent and fellow Democrat in the race for U.S. Senate — U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez — has repeated it, including in this video posted in November 2015. Our ruling Kamala Harris recently said "22 veterans take their own lives each day." The number she cites relies on data from a 2012 VA study by the VA, which was limited and included caveats. That old report has been widely cited by Republicans and Democrats, including Harris’ opponent in her run for U.S. Senate. But Harris’ claim ignores research the VA released in July for its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides, with records from all states. The new study found an average of about 20 veterans a day, two fewer than what Harris claimed. Harris’ statement is close, but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-11817	"Since 2015, Scott Walker has not done a public event where you don't have to pay admission or be on an approved list."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/nov/15/scot-ross/how-often-does-gov-scott-walker-seeking-re-electio/	Gov. Scott Walker has repeatedly been criticized for not being accessible to the general public. In 2013, state Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, went extreme, saying Walker "hasn't done a public event this entire year." That rated Pants on Fire. We noted a number of events, such as a Martin Luther King Jr. ceremony in the Capitol rotunda attended by hundreds of people (including a few who booed during Walker’s remarks). In 2016, we rated as True a much narrower statement from state Rep. Dana Wachs, D-Eau Claire, that Walker's "listening sessions" were "invite-only and excluding the press." As he traveled Wisconsin to meet with residents, Walker asked various people, including Democratic lawmakers, for suggestions on who to invite to his listening sessions. But these events -- held by Walker, rather than him attending events staged by others -- were not open to the public or to the press, only to people who were invited. Now the 2018 campaign for governor is in full swing, with Wachs among seven Democrats hoping to challenge Walker. And the attacks on Walker’s accessibility are returning. On Nov. 3, 2017, Scot Ross, executive director of the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, was interviewed on "The Devil’s Advocates," a liberal radio talk show based in Milwaukee. During a discussion about Walker, host Mike Crute said the governor doesn’t often meet with the general public, "not unless they’re invited, not unless they own a corporation. What about the town hall meetings or lack thereof, Scot?" Ross replied: No, I mean, since 2015, Scott Walker has not done a public event where you don't have to pay admission or be on an approved list. I mean, it is disgraceful, this guy -- I mean since 2015, we’re talking two years you have not been able to go to a Scott Walker event unless you open your checkbook or your organization is a lobbying firm and they open their checkbook. As we’ll see, Walker does attend events held by others that are open to the public, but at events he stages, access is more limited. Ross’ evidence When we asked Ross to back his statement, he reiterated that he was referring to events Walker hosts, not events held by others that Walker attends. He made these points: "The closest you can find to Walker attending events that the public can attend without paying or being on a list were the holiday tree lighting ceremony … and his attendance at the last two Martin Luther King Day Jr. celebrations as a guest of the organizers." "Walker doesn't release his schedule publicly." "Even Walker's re-election events have all been held at private businesses that do not allow the public to attend." In July 2016, One Wisconsin Now said it had analyzed campaign contributions of people attending Walker listening sessions during the first three months of the year, and they had made nearly 4,000 contributions totaling over $1 million, overwhelmingly to Republicans and conservatives. Walker’s response In response, Walker’s campaign cited these events attended by Walker: Holiday events: Attending the 2017 Memorial Day ceremony at Wood National Cemetery in Milwaukee and participating in Fourth of July parades, such as the ones in Wauwatosa and in Menomonee Falls in 2017. Other events not organized by Walker: Participating in events such as the first lady’s walk, Special Olympics torch run, ceremonies honoring law enforcement officers, groundbreakings and ribbon cuttings. Re-election tour: At 14 campaign announcement events around the state in 2017, people were asked to register ahead of time, but were not turned away if they hadn’t, according to the campaign. Walker’s campaign also cited a 9/11 event cosponsored by the governor's office and a September 2016 news event in Madison, noting Ross attended, in which Walker made an announcement about refinancing student debt. Ross said he heard secondhand about the event, at a UW Credit Union, and that it was not generally known or accessible to the public. Our rating Ross said: "Since 2015, Scott Walker has not done a public event where you don't have to pay an admission or be on an approved list." It’s pretty clear that access to Walker is limited. His schedule is generally not made public ahead of time, making it difficult for people to go to events he attends. There are events that are open to the public, such as holiday ceremonies, that Walker attends. But in terms of events Walker himself holds, his campaign team cited campaign events at which registration is requested but not required, a 9/11 ceremony that the governor's office co-sponsored and a news event that had not been announced to the general public. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. Editor's note: This article was edited on Nov. 17, 2017 to indicate that a 9/11 ceremony was co-sponsored by the governor's office and to make clear that registration was requested but not required at Walker campaign announcement events.

pomt-13303	Says he has "a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/09/donald-trump/donald-trump-has-no-fiduciary-responsibility-his-p/	In response to a New York Times article dissecting leaked pages from his tax returns, Donald Trump’s presidential campaign released a statement that sought to justify Trump’s efforts to keep his personal income taxes low. The Times article followed months of refusal by Trump to release his tax returns, something that all presidential candidates since 1980 have done. The paper reported that a $916 million loss could have enabled Trump to cancel out earned income in other years, enough to legally pay no personal federal income tax for up to 18 years. The Trump campaign’s unsigned statement argued in part that Trump had an obligation to pay the lowest amount of taxes possible. "Mr. Trump is a highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required,’ the statement said in part. But does Trump have a "fiduciary responsibility" to pay as little as possible in personal income taxes? Most experts agreed that no such responsibility exists. (Trump’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Let’s start with defining what "fiduciary responsibility" means. The most basic definition of fiduciary responsibility is a legal obligation of one party to act in the best interests of another. (There are other types of fiduciary relationships than economic ones -- such as attorneys to their clients, priests to their parishioners and doctors to their patients -- but we’ll set those aside here.) In a business setting, fiduciary obligation most often refers to the principle that a company’s management has a responsibility to act in the best interests of those who own the company -- its stockholders. There’s some disagreement about how this principle should be put into practice -- for instance, should a company maximize its short-term income regardless of the risks that doing so could carry for the long-term success of the company? In general, though, the overarching principle is considered fairly straightforward: A company’s manager is under an obligation to put shareholders’ interests ahead of his or her own personal financial interests. This principle is commonly followed in the business world. But most experts we contacted said that while the fiduciary principle would govern how a company pays its taxes, it would not apply to Trump’s personal tax return. "The general view is that corporate law imposes a fiduciary responsibility on company managers to maximize company profits on behalf of the company’s owners," said Dennis Caplan, associate professor of accounting at the University at Albany. That means that if Trump managed a company owned by others, he’d have an obligation to minimize corporate taxes in order to maximize profits, he said. But that’s not the case for personal income tax returns -- and it is those returns that were leaked to the New York Times and that were the subject of the speculation about 18 tax-free years. "I do not see how the taxes on his personal tax return would be relevant with respect to this particular fiduciary responsibility," Caplan said. Other experts agreed. Richard W. Painter, a University of Minnesota corporate law professor who was previously chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, told PolitiFact that "one does not have fiduciary duty to other people, except perhaps a joint-filing spouse, when filing personal tax returns." Painter added that there is also "no such thing" as a fiduciary duty to oneself. "That’s called greed," he put it in an interview with the New York Times. "And greed is not a component of the law of fiduciary duty anywhere." The fiduciary responsibility argument is something that Trump is "making up," said Daniel Shaviro, a professor of taxation at New York University Law School. "No such responsibility would extend to his personal taxes, even if he were the CEO of a publicly traded company," he said. There’s a difference between tax evasion, which is illegal, and tax avoidance, which is legal, said Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware's John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. He suspects that Trump was trying to echo this old piece of wisdom, but not successfully. The statement was not done in the "most artfully crafted" way, Elson said. At most, Trump might be able to argue that he has some fiduciary obligations to his employees, suggested Lawrence White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. That would be arguable "to the extent that any bankruptcy -- which might have arisen if he had not availed himself of these loss carry-forward/carry-back opportunities -- would have converted them into unsecured claimants for any delayed wages or other benefits," White said. However, that’s a "novel" argument untested in the courts, said University of Chicago Law School professor Daniel Hemel, writing in a Medium post. "Employers generally have no fiduciary duties to their employees," Hemel wrote. Our ruling The statement from Trump’s campaign said he has "a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required." That might have been a credible argument if he were referring to his companies’ tax returns. But the statement was in response to controversy surrounding Trump’s personal tax returns. Experts we contacted said there is no generally accepted fiduciary obligation keep one’s own taxes low. The statement is not accurate.

pomt-11848	Says "FBI and Texas State Police are both confirming that Raymond Peter Littleberry, the man accused of shooting up a Texas church, was an avid atheist on the payroll of the Democrat National Committee."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/06/freedomjunkshuncom/no-texas-church-shooter-was-not-dnc-payroll-s-fake/	Fake news bloggers have seized on the mass shooting at a Texas church, which killed 26 and injured 20 others, to spread disinformation about the shooter’s identity and motive. Freedumjunkshun.com, a self-avowed fake news website, portrayed the perpetrator as a desperate Democratic activist whose killing spree at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, was motivated by atheism. "FBI and Texas State Police are both confirming that Raymond Peter Littleberry, the man accused of shooting up a Texas church, was an avid atheist on the payroll of the Democrat National Committee," the article claimed. The fake news article missed basic facts and fabricated others. It wrongly identified the alleged shooter as Raymond Peter Littleberry. Law enforcement officials identified the gunman as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley. Some media reports quoted acquaintances of Kelley describing the man as an avowed atheist. But the fake news article’s claim that atheism motivated the attack was undercut by law enforcement officials who said religion was not a factor, and that the shooting appeared to stem from a "domestic situation." "There was a domestic situation going on with this family. The suspect's mother-in-law attended this church. We know that she had received threatening texts from him," Freeman Martin of the Texas Department of Public Safety told reporters in a Nov. 6 press conference. Martin added the shooting "wasn't over religious beliefs." The fake news article portrayed the perpetrator as "a liberal island in the middle of a conservative sea" who organized Black Lives Matter protests and gay pride parades. It noted that the shooter "was on the DNC payroll," in reference to the Democratic National Committee. "That’s completely false," DNC spokesman Michael Tyler told PolitiFact of the alleged connection. Freedumjunkshun aims to dupe conservative readers into mistaking its satire for truth. "Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate," its disclaimer reads. "Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won’t find any of it here." The fake story was wrong to say that Kelley was on the DNC payroll, and authorities said his religious beliefs do not appear to have been a factor in the shooting.

pomt-06023	"In 1958, there were 16 states in this country that prohibited -- prohibited -- an African-American and a Caucasian from being married."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/15/sheila-oliver/sheila-oliver-says-16-states-prohibited-interracia/	Gay rights advocates are casting the fight for same-sex marriage as a struggle mirrored in the nation’s past. "This is a civil rights issue," Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver said during a news conference announcing Democratic plans to legalize same-sex marriage in New Jersey. Oliver recounted the story of an interracial couple forced to leave Virginia in the 1950s or face jail time for being married. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually heard Richard and Mildred Loving’s case and ruled state statutes banning interracial marriage unconstitutional. But, "in 1958, there were 16 states in this country that prohibited -- prohibited -- an African-American and a Caucasian from being married," Oliver (D-Essex) said on Jan. 9. "Without question, Senator (Stephen) Sweeney said it best: this is a civil rights issue. It is a snapshot in time in the history of our country issue. And I think for those of us that believe in equality, equality, equality, marriage equality represents the third leg on the stool of civil rights and equality in this country." A spokesman said Oliver based her statistic on a New York Times article published earlier this month. It put the number of states where interracial marriage was illegal in 1958 at 16. It’s actually more than that, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Oregon repealed its law in 1951, becoming the first state to do so since Ohio in 1887. Colorado, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota followed suit. By 1958, two dozen states still prohibited interracial marriage: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming. Although California still technically had a miscegenation law on its books in 1958, "once the state Supreme Court declared the law invalid in the 1948 Perez V. Sharp case, it was no longer legally enforceable. So from 1948 on, California is put into the ‘legal column,’" Renee Romano, the author of "Race Mixing: Black-White Marriage in Postwar America" and an associate professor of history at Oberlin College in Ohio, said in an email. "The Speaker was responsibly relying upon the data graphic included in that New York Times [article]," Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, wrote in an email. "The Speaker’s overall point was to note that same-sex couples continue to suffer from the same wrongful discrimination that interracial couples such as the Lovings and many, many others endured until the Supreme Court rightly put a stop to it." By the time the Supreme Court unanimously ruled miscegenation laws unconstitutional in 1967, 16 states still had such statutes. "Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State," then-Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the opinion for the court for the Loving v. Virginia case. Romano said the analogy between interracial marriage and same-sex marriage isn’t exactly parallel, but it’s powerful. If you can make the case that 50 years ago people supported bans on interracial marriage, but "now, we know that it goes on and it’s no big deal, you can sort of use that," she said, to say in another 50 years, people may ask "what the hullabaloo is about. It’s a really powerful analogy. There’s a lot of richness there politically." Our ruling Oliver claimed that 16 states prohibited interracial marriage in 1958. There were actually 24 states with legally enforceable statutes banning the marriage of blacks and whites then. Oliver’s number is off, but the precise figure only further supports her point about discrimination against interracial couples in the 1950s. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-11118	Says "Rosie O’Donnell apparently committed the same offense five times, five times, when she broke the identical law that Dinesh (D'Souza) was prosecuted for."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/06/ted-cruz/dinesh-dsouza-and-rosie-odonnell-fec-violations-di/	Backlash to President Donald Trump’s pardon of Dinesh D’Souza caused complaints of a double standard among conservatives. In an interview with the Austin American-Statesman, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told the reporter that D’Souza faced political persecution for a crime liberal comedian Rosie O’Donnell had committed five-fold. (Cruz also claimed credit for the pardon and called D’Souza his friend.) "What’s interesting is, just a few weeks ago we saw revelations that Rosie O’Donnell apparently committed the same offense five times, five times, when she broke the identical law that Dinesh was prosecuted for," Cruz said. "I don’t recall any of those liberal activists on Twitter calling for Rose O’Donnell to be prosecuted." Did O’Donnell commit the same offense as D’Souza? The two cases are very different. The Federal Election Commission caps donations to individual candidates at $2,700 per election. Primaries, runoffs and general elections are counted separately. On May 20, 2014, D’Souza was convicted of a felony for making illegal contributions to Wendy Long’s unsuccessful challenge of Kirsten Gillibrand to represent New York in the U.S. Senate. Long was a friend from D’Souza’s time at Dartmouth College. D’Souza was allowed to contribute a maximum of $5,000 to a single candidate. (The limit on each election was $2,500 in 2012 due to inflation, and this covered the primary and general election.) In March 2012, D’Souza gave $10,000 on behalf of himself and his wife. He then directed his assistant and a lover to also contribute $5,000 each on behalf of themselves and their spouses for a total of $20,000. D’Souza reimbursed them. D’Souza pleaded guilty "to violating the federal campaign election law by making illegal contributions to a United States Senate campaign in the names of others," the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said in a statement. He "admitted that he knew that what he was doing was wrong and something the law forbids." D’Souza faced eight months in a supervised community confinement center, five years of probation, and a $30,000 fine. Trump pardoned D’Souza on May 31. The New York Post reported that O’Donnell made the following contributions, exceeding the individual limit of $2,700 by a total of $5,400. $4,700 to Alabama Sen. Doug Jones in the special general election against Roy Moore. $3,600 to Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb for the special election he won in March. $2,950 to California Rep. Adam Schiff for his primary congressional race. $4,200 to Lauren Underwood, an Illinois congressional candidate, for her primary. (Note: when we searched the FEC individual contributor database, we found $2,700 are marked as going towards the primary campaign and $1,500 towards the general.) $3,450 to Omar Vaid, a congressional candidate in Staten Island and Brooklyn, for his primary. O’Donnell told the New York Post she did not deliberately exceed the limit. "If $2,700 is the cut off — (candidates) should refund the money," she said. "I don’t look to see who I can donate most to … I just donate assuming they do not accept what is over the limit." O’Donnell indeed broke FEC rules, but campaign finance experts told us this type of violation goes unpunished as long as there is no intent to deceive. The money can be refunded or redirected to the candidate’s next race. "The rather small amounts in excess of the limits, as well as the fact that O’Donnell made no effort to conceal the contributions, indicates this is just a sloppy mistake," said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at the left-leaning watchdog group Public Citizen. "Rosie O'Donnell contributed her own money in her own name to the candidates in question," said Michael Malbin, executive director at the Campaign Finance Institute. "The candidates are in fact responsible for keeping records and returning the extra, although she should also know what she is doing, as most donors do. Her contributions were fully disclosed." In an op-ed calling out a double standard, D’Souza said he did not buy O’Donnell’s defense. "I find this defense implausible because O’Donnell used four different – though similar –variations of her name and five different addresses," D’Souza wrote. The variations in her name were as follows: Rose Odonnell, Rose O’Donnell, Rosie O’Donnell, and Rosie Odonnell. She listed two different zip codes (which correspond with homes she owns) in two of the donations that exceeded the limit. Experts said D’Souza’s case was distinct by legal standards. D’Souza violated statutes 52 U.S.C. 30116 for exceeding contribution limits, 52 U.S.C. 30122 for making contributions in the name of another, and 18 U.S.C. 1001 for lying to law enforcement. The last (and most serious) charge was eventually dropped in the plea bargain. O’Donnell violated only the first statute. But criminal enforcement is only deemed appropriate if the violation is knowing and willful. Violators are usually subject to a civil penalty instead. The FEC has not announced an investigation of O’Donnell, although Holman said they "likely deemed that violation as unintentional and just not worth their time." Our ruling Cruz said, "Rosie O’Donnell apparently committed the same offense five times, five times, when she broke the identical law that Dinesh was prosecuted for." Both D’Souza and O’Donnell violated campaign contribution limits, which is a criminal offense. Those cases are subject to prosecution if determined to be willful. D’Souza’s violation was considered willful. He violated another law by using straw donors to donate $20,000 over the legal limit to one Senate candidate. O’Donnell surpassed the limit by a quarter of that money in donating to five different campaigns under her own name. We rate this statement False.

pomt-10141	"1.3-million people in America make their living off eBay."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/07/john-mccain/ebays-big-but-not-that-big/	Asked during the second presidential debate whom he would consider for treasury secretary, Sen. John McCain floated the name of former eBay chief executive Meg Whitman, then talked her up with an astounding statistic. "I like Meg Whitman," McCain said during the Oct. 7, 2008, debate. "She knows what it's like to be out there in the marketplace. She knows how to create jobs. Meg Whitman was the CEO of a company that started with 12 people and is now — 1.3-million people in America make their living off eBay." That's way off. We hate to nitpick apparent misstatements, but this one's a doozy — 1.3-million is the number of people worldwide who make some money off eBay, according to a 2006 A.C. Nielsen study. As of 2003, some 20,000 Americans made their living off eBay, company executive Jim Griffith told a Colorado newspaper at the time. These days, the company only keeps track of eBay entrepreneurs worldwide, and doesn't distinguish between full time and part time online auctioneers, a representative told us. But it's not conceivable that the number of Americans making a living off eBay has climbed to 1.3-million. In 2005, the latest year for which statistics are available, just 724,000 Americans made money selling on eBay, according to a Nielsen study. But that includes many who made just a few bucks – not a living. We examined this issue before , when McCain said 50,000 Americans made their living off eBay. The company told us it didn't know where he got that number, but we gave him a Half True because we couldn't be certain he was wrong. This time, his number is more than a million higher, and not even conceivably true. McCain bought himself a False.

pomt-13036	CNN accidentally aired 30 minutes of pornography in Boston on Thanksgiving night.	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/nov/29/blog-posting/reports-cnn-showed-pornography-instead-anthony-bou/	Following this year’s Thanksgiving dinner, a lone Twitter profile alleged that CNN was serving up something difficult to stomach — a half-hour of hardcore pornography. Apparently starved for content, the media ate it up. Around 10:30 p.m. ET on Nov. 24, 2016, Twitter user @solikearose tweeted from Boston that the scheduled episode of Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown was not appearing on CNN. She said there was an explicit sex scene showing on the network, instead. The user shared several images with TiVo digital programming information included, tagging from Boston-area cable provider RCN. (Image via Mediaite) Twitter being Twitter, rumors of explicit sex on a cable news channel spread quickly. Other users included the hashtag "#BourdainPorn" while sharing the images and discussing the alleged incident. By 9:54 a.m. ET the next day, cable provider RCN responded to the tweets. They said there had been no similar reports of pornography shown on CNN. At some point, major media outlets picked up on the subject and started posting stories based on @solikearose’s tweets. It’s not exactly clear what media outlet first wrote up a story, because so many have since edited their postings. (The Verge contends it was the U.K.’s Independent, which was then sent out by The Drudge Report with a tweet that read, "CNN accidentally airs 30 minutes of trans porn…") See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com Other outlets that wrote posts about the supposed network nookie included the Daily Mail, Fox News, The Wrap, Esquire, Maxim, the New York Post, the New York Daily News and more, on down to smaller sites like Sputnik News and RT.com. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com The porn star in the photos, whom Twitter users identified as Riley Quinn, acknowledged the alleged exposure on Twitter. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Variety even quoted a CNN representative as saying the event indeed happened. "The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation." But while the story was shared far and wide in less than a day, it appeared by Friday evening that no one else had witnessed the same thing @solikearose had. On Friday evening, BuzzFeed News posted an interview with the purported original Twitter user, whom they only identified as a Boston woman named Rose. "I initially posted because I wanted to see if anyone else in Boston had been affected," she said. "I think it was a broadcasting error that affected only my house." The person BuzzFeed News interviewed assured the site that the incident was real, and that she had conversed with a customer service representative who advised her to restart her digital cable converter. The pornography then stopped, she said. She said had made her Twitter account private because she had been harassed online. BuzzFeed News quoted RCN Boston general manager Jeff Carlson as saying there had been no other complaints about the event. The account @solikearose has since been deleted, and most of the posts on the incident have since been updated, many of them calling the incident a "hoax." When we contacted CNN, the network gave us the same response it gave other outlets on Nov. 25: "Despite media reports to the contrary, RCN assures us that there was no interruption of CNN’s programming in the Boston area last night." CNN also noted to us that while many media outlets referred to the network airing the footage, the CNN feed is the same nationwide. That means every market gets the same programming, and any difference would be through the local cable provider. Shortly after the BuzzFeed News interview was posted, RCN wrote on their Facebook page about the flap. When we contacted RCN, they referred us to the same statement, attributing it to Carlson. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Bloggers said CNN accidentally aired 30 minutes of pornography in Boston on Thanksgiving night. Every account of this incident, which undoubtedly would have given thousands of viewers indigestion, relies on tweets from a single Twitter user. Media accounts appear to have spread based on the same information, despite no other reported complaints to the cable provider. The single customer’s cable equipment may have malfunctioned somehow, the provider said, but the person’s account is working properly. Media outlets that repeated the story have since backtracked on their single-source posts.

pomt-11057	"NASA announced that it communicated with four races of aliens."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/25/blog-posting/no-nasa-has-not-communicated-aliens/	Social media users were puzzled when an online blog resurfaced a years-old claim saying NASA has communicated with four separate alien races. This ridiculous claim can be traced back to satire from 2016. "NASA announced that it communicated with four races of aliens," said a June 23, 2018, headline from The Life Buzz, an online blog. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to the false report, a NASA spokeswoman named Trish Chamberson said during a press conference that the space agency had known about alien life for years. "During the two hour briefing, NASA scientists confirmed previously speculated information about UFOs and Alien technology, confirming that four separate races of aliens are in regular contact with NASA, and have actually asked the agency to say hello to everyone on the planet for them," the false report said. This bogus story actually originated as satire on Waterford Whispers News, an Irish site that identifies as "a satirical newspaper and website" and "uses invented names in all its stories," according to its disclaimer page. The original article was published Aug. 26, 2016, and is clearly made-up. NASA does not list anyone named Trish Chamberson on its website. In fact, Snopes issued a fact-check in 2016 of websites attempting to republish the Waterford Whispers News article as a real news story. Several similar stories appeared without a disclaimer on blog sites and social media postings during 2016 and 2017.

pomt-15251	"97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/03/martin-omalley/97-planned-parenthoods-work-mammograms-preventive-/	The vast majority of Planned Parenthood’s work goes toward mammograms and preventive care, said former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. Since an anti-abortion group released videos Planned Parenthood officials talking about aborted fetal parts, Republicans have pushed to take away federal funding from the women’s health organization. Democratic presidential candidates, on the other hand, are showing their support, if subdued. O’Malley said he hadn’t seen the videos, speaking to reporters in New Hampshire July 26. "And I don't generally make a habit of responding to right-wing videos," O'Malley said, according to Washington Post’s Dave Weigel. "I do know that 97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health. So that's what I know, but I'll defer to others for commenting on that video and whatever videos they're pumping out there." Is 97 percent of what Planned Parenthood does mammograms and other preventive care, as opposed to abortions? O’Malley spokeswoman Haley Morris pointed us to a Planned Parenthood press release that had a similar, but not identical, statistic. "More than 97 percent of Planned Parenthood's services are primary and preventive health care, including lifesaving cancer screenings, birth control, testing and treatment of STDs, annual exams and health counseling," the 2011 release said. As we’ve found in previous fact-checks, Planned Parenthood comes to this number by adding up the number of individual services provided each year. In total, they provided nearly 11 million services in 2013, according to their most recent annual report. (Planned Parenthood clinics saw 2.7 million individual patients in 2013, so many received multiple services.) Here’s the breakdown from the annual report: Abortions: 327,653 Sexually transmitted infection/disease testing and treatment: 4,470,597 Contraception: 3,577,348 Cancer screening and prevention: 935,573 Pregnancy tests: 1,128,783 Prenatal services: 18,684 Family practice services: 65,464 Adoption referrals: 1,880 Urinary tract infection treatments: 47,264 Other: 17,187 Based on this list, it’s accurate that abortion procedures only count for 3 percent of all services provided, meaning 97 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides are other forms of reproductive and primary care. By far, contraception and STI/STD testing and treatment are the most frequented services. Of their services, Planned Parenthood considers many to be preventive care in that they manage health and prevent disease or worse problems down the line. This includes STI/STD testing and treatment, contraception and cancer screening and prevention -- 8,983,518 services provided in 2013. Not included in this list are abortions, pregnancy tests, prenatal services, adoption referrals, UTI treatments, family practice services (a vague category that could include certain preventive care), and other services -- 1,606,915 services in 2013. Based on this breakdown, about 85 percent of Planned Parenthood’s work is preventive. Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Elizabeth Clark put the figure at 90 percent. But both are a bit lower than what O’Malley said: that 97 percent is preventive care and mammograms. Oh yeah, what about mammograms? Within the category of "cancer screening and prevention services," Planned Parenthood said it offered 487,029 breast exams or breast care services in 2013. However, as we’ve noted before, Planned Parenthood clinics do not provide mammograms themselves. Rather, Planned Parenthood physicians perform other types of breast exams and refer patients to outside clinics where they can get a mammogram. An October 2012 statement posted on Planned Parenthood’s website explained the group’s approach, which they said is helping women access mammograms via referral even though the clinics do not perform them in-house. So O’Malley’s 97 percent figure has some basis -- that’s the percentage of Planned Parenthood’s services that aren’t abortion. But that’s a broader category than "mammograms and preventative health," which O’Malley said. Our ruling O’Malley said, "97 percent of the work that Planned Parenthood does is about mammograms and preventative health." According to Planned Parenthood, about 97 percent of the services the group provides in a given year are services other than abortion. That includes preventive and primary care. Preventive care accounts for about 85 to 90 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides. While mammograms are considered a form of preventive care, Planned Parenthood doesn’t do their own mammograms. Clinics perform breast exams and refer patients to outside clinics for an actual mammogram. The claim wasn’t pulled out of thin air, but it’s missing some important information, so we rate O’Malley’s claim Half True.

pomt-01162	Terrorist detainees "were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/14/dick-cheney/wake-senate-report-dick-cheney-says-terrorists-not/	Former Vice President Dick Cheney has had a relatively quiet couple of years since leaving the White House. But with the recent release of a Senate report on alleged torture by the CIA, it was inevitable that Cheney -- who is closely associated with the post-9/11 policy of "enhanced interrogations" for captured terrorists -- would return to television screens. On Dec. 9, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released a report about the CIA’s interrogation techniques in the wake of 9/11. About 500 pages of the 6,700-page report were made public. The report concluded that the techniques were not an effective way to gain intelligence from detainees, and that the CIA misled Congress and the White House. The report detailed such techniques as "rectal rehydration" and the use of coffin-size confinement boxes. A few days before a scheduled appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, Cheney sat for an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier. Here’s a portion of their exchange on Dec. 10, focusing on the fate of the detainees discussed in the Senate report. Baier: "Is there anything to the Geneva Convention, to the world rule of law on this?" Cheney: "Sure there is. But remember, the terrorists were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment you would accord to those." There’s significant disagreement between Cheney and his critics on the issue of torture or "enhanced interrogation techniques." Still, experts told us that the question of what protections, if any, the detainees qualified for under the Geneva Convention -- is somewhat more clear-cut than other aspects of this policy debate. So we’ll take a closer look at Cheney’s claim that terrorist detainees "were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment." The Geneva Conventions First, some background on the Geneva Conventions. They are a group of four international treaties covering different aspects of how civilians, prisoners of war and soldiers are to be treated once they are rendered incapable of fighting. (Read more about them here.) The most recent version of the treaties in force date from 1949; the United States has ratified all four though it has not ratified some of the protocols added later. The conventions guarantee a certain level of protection for former combatants, including prisoners of war and civilians. They set out in detail the requirements for food, clothing, shelter, safety from combat, access to medical care, and other matters. However, whether fighters could qualify for these protections depended on whether they adhered to some basic rules of law such as wearing uniforms, carrying arms openly, answering to a chain of command, and not committing war crimes. Many of those who would one day end up in Guantanamo Bay and other sites were from non-state terrorist groups and did not adhere to these rules. So these fighters were not guaranteed the same protections afforded POWs. Cheney’s strongest point in his interview with Baier was to draw this distinction between prisoners of war, who receive these extensive protections, and "unlawful combatants," who do not. There is, in fact, a distinction in the level of protection. What undercuts the accuracy of Cheney’s claim, however, is a different part of what he said. It’s misleading for him to say that such combatants are "not covered by the Geneva Convention." While detainees who do not have POW status don’t get the top level of protection, they do get more basic protections from the Geneva Conventions. And glossing over those less-stringent protections hides an important point: Even the lower level of protection would have shielded detainees, at least on paper, against some of the harsh treatments now alleged in the Senate report. Experts pointed us to identical passages in each of the four conventions, known as "Common Article 3." Among other things"prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever" by Common Article 3 are "violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture" as well as "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment." In other words, despite the implications from what Cheney said, even unlawful combatants "have minimum protections under the Geneva Conventions," Richard D. Rosen, director of the Center for Military Law & Policy at Texas Tech University Law School. The Hamdan decision In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, there was considerable debate inside and outside the Bush administration about how captured members of al-Qaida and the Taliban should be treated. The Bush administration contended that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to terrorism suspects held abroad, siding with White House and Pentagon lawyers over objections from the State Department. Administration lawyers also approved the "enhanced interrogation techniques" and said they were legally permissible. The debate about the Geneva Convention piece of the equation ended in June 2006, when the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling in Hamdan vs. Rumsfeld, a watershed case on detainee rights. The 5-3 majority wrote that Common Article 3 "affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory who are involved in a conflict 'in the territory of' a signatory." In other words, by this decision, "our own Supreme Court has made it completely clear that, whatever their status, (detainees) are entitled to some minimal protections under the Geneva Convention," said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. "That ruling is binding law in the United States, no matter what the former vice president says." University of Notre Dame law professor Mary Ellen O’Connell, a specialist on international law, agreed. "The Supreme Court's ruling in Hamdan conflicts directly with the vice president’s assertion," she said. We will also note that while Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is one source of basic protection for detainees, their rights to these protections may be bolstered by other international agreements as well. One is Article 75 of Additional Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, which includes minimal protections for all people, whatever their status, who are caught in a conflict. While the U.S. has not ratified this protocol, the U.S. government has said that, "out of a sense of legal obligation" it will adhere to Article 75 for "any individual it detains in an international armed conflict, and expects all other nations to adhere to these principles as well." And despite resistance during the Bush administration, two other international agreements to which the United States is a party -- the 1984 Torture Convention and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights -- would also prohibit torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, experts said. Our ruling Cheney said that terrorist detainees "were not covered by the Geneva Convention. They were unlawful combatants. And under those circumstances, they were not entitled to the normal kinds of courtesies and treatment." Cheney has a point that unlawful combatants are not afforded as high a level of protection as prisoners of war or civilians. However, his comment glosses over the fact that unlawful combatants are still accorded a minimum degree of protection, including a ban on "violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture," and "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment," both of which have been validated by the Supreme Court. This is an important omission, since some of these very actions have been alleged in the Senate report. Because the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00581	"If you care about the environment, we've got record funding."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2015/jun/08/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-we-have-record-funding-environment/	Gov. Rick Scott says that Florida has invested big bucks in the environment. As he boasted about the state’s record during his economic summit for GOP presidential contenders in Orlando June 2, Scott reeled off a bunch of statistics about Florida’s budget and economy including this one: "If you care about the environment, we've got record funding." Scott’s record on the environment has been scrutinized since he first ran for office in 2010. Since that time, news reports detailed how state officials under his watch have been banned from using terms such as "climate change," environmental fines have nosedived, and Scott has boasted about reducing the number of days to get an environmental permit. But despite that record, does Florida now have "record funding" for the environment? No, it doesn’t. Everglades and springs funding Scott’s spokesman pointed us to his proposals to increase funding for springs restoration and for preserving the Everglades. During his re-election campaign in 2014, Scott promised to propose a $500 million plan over 10 years to restore springs. The 2013 budget included $10 million for springs, and the 2014 the budget included $30 million. In his budget proposal for 2015-16, Scott recommended $50 million. As for the Everglades, the state reached an agreement in 2012 with the federal government to end a dispute that predates Scott. Over 13 years, the state will spend $880 million on Everglades cleanup, or about $32 million a year. In 2014 the Legislature increased Everglades restoration funding to $169 million, more than double the previous year’s total. The Legislature also earmarked $90 million for raising 2.6 miles of the Tamiami Trail to let the Everglades flow more freely beneath it. That brought the total amount during that session to $259 million. "The one place where he did step up was on the Everglades," said Frank Jackalone, Sierra Club’s Senior Organizing Manager in Florida. "It was the environmental highlight of his term as governor." But where Scott has fallen short on the Everglades is acquiring U.S. Sugar land south of Lake Okeechobee, Jackalone said. A deal in the works for the state to buy about 46,000 acres fell apart earlier this year. Department of Environmental Protection While Everglades and springs restoration are important parts of environmental funding, they don’t provide a complete picture. If we look back a decade at funding for the Department of Environmental Protection, the high point was $2.9 billion in 2006-07 under then Gov. Jeb Bush. DEP is tasked with protecting air, water and land. Under Scott, DEP’s budget peaked at $1.8 billion in 2011-12. In 2006-07, the state used an extra $310 million (on top of Florida Forever’s usual $300 million land-buying program) to purchase Babcock Ranch, 73,000 acres of cypress domes and pine forests in Charlotte and Lee counties. DEP’s budget was also in the $2 billion range part of the time under the next governor, Charlie Crist. But once the recession kicked in, DEP’s budget decreased. This year, the total budget is $1.56 billion, and for next year Scott proposed a budget of about $1.53 billion -- $29 million less than the current year. (You can see the year-by-year DEP funding and caveats including that it combines state and federal dollars.) What Scott omits There have been several other cuts related to the environment under Scott: In 2011, Scott and the Legislature abolished the Department of Community Affairs, which for decades reviewed development plans in cities and counties; The same year, Scott and lawmakers forced state water management districts to slash property tax collections. Water management districts handle planning for water resources and wetlands protection, among other environmental issues; Revenue collected from environmental penalties plummeted from $9.3 million in Scott’s first year to $1.4 million in 2013; Funding for Florida Forever, the state’s land acquisition program, was about $100 million when he took office. It has stayed below $28 million since. That led to environmentalists advocating for Amendment 1, which was approved by 75 percent of voters in November. Scott took no position on the amendment before it passed, and his spokeswoman did not mention it as part of his evidence for this fact-check. Amendment sponsors had hoped that the land buying program would get $300 million to return it to pre-recession levels, but Scott’s budget proposal this year included $100 million for Florida Forever, while legislators proposed less. "Record funding" for the environment has become a talking point for Scott. But after we rated a similar claim False in 2014, he tweaked his message to talk specifically about "record funding" for springs. On the national stage surrounded by presidential contenders in May, he went back to talking about record funding generically for the environment. But environmentalists say he doesn’t hold a record for overall environmental funding. "He cut back services to DEP, he cut back funding to various water management districts in state, he hasn’t done what needs to be done to acquire sugar land south of Okeechobee to finish Everglades restoration," Jackalone said. Also, "he cut back on environmental enforcement." Our ruling Scott said, "If you care about the environment, we've got record funding." Scott's team points to investments the state has made to restore the Everglades and springs during Scott’s tenure -- and he has championed both. While those are high-profile projects, he claimed that Florida has "record funding" for the environment overall, and that’s not the case. The budget for the state Department of Environmental Protection and for Florida Forever were not a record under Scott -- two major pots of money that relate to the environment. Scott repeated a previously debunked claim in a national forum; his statement has long been proved incorrect.

Robert Brown wants to strengthen Georgia's animal cruelty laws and made his case at a recent hearing. "Animal abuse is often an indicative trait of future acts of violence against humans," said Brown, a Democrat from Macon, "and prosecuting such behavior is our first line of defense against potentially dangerous criminals." Is it true? Are people who abuse animals more likely to hurt people? "He's right," said Mary Lou Randour, professional outreach director for animal cruelty for the Humane Society of the United States. "It's just another example of the type of people who are anti-social and aggressive." Animal cruelty became a hot topic in these parts in 2007 when one of the state's biggest athletic stars, Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, was accused of participating in a dogfighting ring with some of his longtime friends. Vick pleaded guilty, served time in prison and is now the starting QB for the Philadelphia Eagles. Randour sent us links to several academic studies that link animal abuse to violence against people. We looked at those. And we looked at a variety of other information relating to the subject. Researchers have been conducting more detailed studies on the subject for several decades. The findings are similar: - The Chicago Police Department looked at 332 animal cruelty and related cases from July 2001 to July 2004. Police found 70 percent of suspects had prior arrests for other felonies. Eighty-six percent of them had two or more prior arrests. - A 2007 study of some women in domestic violence shelters found their abusers were 11 times more likely to have harmed or killed a pet. - A 1983 study of alleged child abuse found evidence in 60 percent of the cases of possible earlier animal abuse. - Of 117 men serving time in South African prisons for crimes "of aggression," nearly two-thirds of them admitted to cruelty to animals, according to a 1999 study. Brown authored legislation in 2000 that allows animal abuse to be charged as a felony. The senator said he pushed for the changes, in part, from anecdotal stories of people who abused animals when they were young and committed felonies against people as adults. Brown also was swayed by FBI agents who made the connection between animal abuse and violence against people. Brown said he's considering legislation that would create tougher penalties on people who abuse animals in the presence of children. Brown said he's not sure whether it will pass when the Legislature convenes in January because he understands lawmakers will be focused on the state's budget challenges and there will be a large freshman class at the Gold Dome next year. "We want to look at a remedy [to the existing law] that will have some broad impact," he said. Brown appears to have done his homework on his claim about the connection between animal abuse and violence against humans. There is overwhelming research that Brown is right. This one is a slam-dunk. We rate his claim as True.	None	Robert Brown	None	None	None	2010-11-10T06:00:00	2010-10-29	['None']
pomt-03125	Warren Buffett recently said "Scrap Obamacare and Start All Over."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/17/blog-posting/bloggers-say-warren-buffett-recently-turned-agains/	Conservative Internet bloggers are turning up three-year-old quotes from Warren Buffett and casting them as fresh evidence that American support is dwindling for President Barack Obama's health care law. But the quotes are not properly identified as three years old and do not reflect Buffett's full thinking on the health care law. It's unclear why or how the old quotes resurfaced. But we started seeing the Buffett quotes in Facebook feeds on the morning of Sept. 17, 2013, after the Weekly Standard linked to it, starting its blog post, "You know things are bad for President Obama when even Warren Buffett has soured on Obamacare and says that 'we need something else.' " The link went to a website called Money Morning, which posted an entry on Sept. 13 titled, "Buffett: Scrap Obamacare and Start All Over." The post on the website includes quotes from Buffett, including: • "Health care costs in the United States are like a tapeworm eating at our economic body." • "We have a health system that, in terms of costs, is really out of control. And if you take this line and you project what has been happening into the future, we will get less and less competitive. So we need something else." • "Attack the costs first, and then worry about expanding coverage. I would much rather see another plan that really attacks costs. And I think that's what the American public wants to see. I mean, the American public is not behind this bill." The post goes on to paraphrase Buffett as saying he would scrap Obamacare and start over. A variety of other conservative media outlets spotlighted the post in the past week as a development in the ongoing battle over the health care law, such as Wall Street Journal blogger James Taranto and Newsbusters. But the comments come from an interview that Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., gave to CNBC on March 1, 2010 -- three and a half years ago, before the bill was signed. Buffett's office told PolitiFact that the blog reports do not reflect his views. Buffett "has never said or thought that Obamacare should be scrapped," said Debbie Bosanek, Buffett's assistant. She said she showed him our research and that he said our analysis "covered it very well." So what did Buffett say in 2010? They can be found in a Politico article published at the time that summarized the interview. That article also includes other tidbits excluded from the more recent blog posts that paint a more nuanced picture of his views. • Buffett was referring to a bill that was still pending in Congress. At the time of his comments, a bill had passed the Senate, but lawmakers were still deciding how to get it through the House, so he’d have reason to think his comments might carry some weight in bargaining over details. He was not referring to the law after it was on the books, and he did not make his comments with three and a half years of hindsight from looking at its implementation. • Buffett said the bill he was criticizing was still worth passing despite its imperfections. According to Politico, Buffett was asked on CNBC whether he would be in favor of scrapping the Senate’s version of the health care bill; he responded: "I would be." However, Politico also noted "that while he does not like the Senate bill, he’d vote for it in preference to doing nothing." Buffett said in the interview, "If it was a choice today between plan A, which is what we've got, or plan B, … the Senate bill, I would vote for the Senate bill. But I would much rather see a plan C that really attacks costs." It’s worth noting that in July 2012, just after the Supreme Court upheld the health care law, Buffett told Bloomberg TV that the court made the right decision. Invoking the same metaphor, Buffett said health care is "the tapeworm, essentially, of the American economy, and we have not dealt with that yet." But he added, "Obamacare is a step in the right direction in many ways." Shortly after we started looking into the blog posts, the Weekly Standard added an "update" to its post. It said, "It appears that Buffett made his anti-Obamacare comments in 2010, thereby showing that he, like most of the American people, has opposed Obamacare since even before it was passed — a point that Mark Hemingway addressed yesterday in response to USA Today’s implication that Americans’ widespread dislike of Obamacare is mostly attributable to Republicans’ efforts to fight it." We sent inquiries to the Weekly Standard and Money Morning but did not hear back. We also sent an inquiry to Buffett and will publish a comment if he offers one. Our ruling A variety of blogs reprinted an item indicating that Warren Buffett recently said "Scrap Obamacare and Start All Over." However, the comments came from an interview in 2010, when the health care bill was still being debated, and are not based on the subsequent three and a half years of seeing the law implemented. If anything, comments by Buffett in 2012 suggest that he’s pleased to see the law being put into effect, despite the shortcomings he sees. The notion that Buffett had recently turned on a president he supported by souring on his signature health care law could have been easily debunked using Google searches.

pomt-08636	Harry Reid has voted "to give illegals Social Security benefits even for the time they were here illegally."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/17/sharron-angle/sharron-angle-says-harry-reid-wants-give-illegals-/	We’ve rated one claim in an ad by Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle as False. That was a claim that Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid voted "go give special tax breaks to illegal aliens." The second charge in the ad is that Reid voted "to give illegals Social Security benefits even for the time they were here illegally." Until a change in the law in 2007, illegal immigrants had a right to receive credit in their benefits calculation for Social Security payments they had made while working illegally, typically while using an unauthorized Social Security number. They received such credit only after they had received legal working papers and a genuine Social Security number. As much as several billion dollars a year are typically collected from illegal immigrants by the Social Security system. Reid voted twice to uphold this system. During a Senate debate over immigration reform in 2006, Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., offered an amendment to prevent anyone from earning credit for Social Security payments made using an unauthorized Social Security number -- a provision that would mostly if not entirely affect illegal aliens. On May 18, 2006, the Senate voted on a motion to table -- that is, to stop consideration of -- the Ensign amendment. By a bare one-vote majority, the chamber voted to table the amendment. Reid's was one of the 50 votes in favor of tabling. Then, on July 19, 2007, Ensign tried again, proposing a similar amendment to the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. Under the rules in effect, the amendment needed 60 votes to pass but only got 57, so it failed. Reid was one of the senators who voted against the amendment. So the fact that Reid voted "no" twice provides support for Angle's claim. But it isn't foolproof. First, Reid also cast another vote on this issue that Angle's camp doesn't mention. On Oct. 23, 2007, during another immigration bill debate, Ensign offered a similar amendment. This time, the Senate passed it by an overwhelming 92-2 vote. Reid was one of 92 senators to support the amendment. But that's not all. We also see problems with the ad's explanation of what was being voted on. For one thing, the vote wouldn't have given current illegals Social Security benefits, as the ad implies. Instead, Reid's votes affected the policy for former illegal aliens who were later made legal. For another, the vote was not about giving benefits but rather on whether to change the calculation process so that former illegals could get credit for money they had paid into the system years before, when they were illegal. We consider these descriptions misleading, and in combination with the ad's decision to ignore Reid's contrary vote, we feel the this part of the statement deserves a rating of Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05994	President Obama has "said he is going to cut veterans' benefits."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/20/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-obama-wants-cut-veterans-benefi/	Rick Santorum says the president wants to solve the budget deficit by picking the pockets of America’s military veterans. In a debate on Jan. 19, 2012, in Charleston, S.C., Santorum said he grew up in VA housing and saw Vietnam vets who were badly in need of medical and psychological care. He said service members returning from war now should have better support. "We need to be much, much more aggressive. We have the president of the United States who said he is going to cut veterans' benefits, cut our military, at a time when these folks are four, five, six, seven tours, coming back, in and out of jobs, sacrificing everything for this country," Santorum said. We decided to check: Does President Barack Obama intend to cut benefits for veterans? Expansions to benefits Obama’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2012 increases the overall Veterans Affairs budget by more than 10 percent. The numbers are big: from $53 billion in FY 2010 to almost $59 billion in FY 2012. It provides new benefits for veterans’ caregivers, including health care and mental health services, and invests nearly $1 billion in VA services for homeless veterans and those at risk of becoming homeless. The White House pointed us to several examples of how VA services have been beefed up, summed up in a comment Obama made in 2009: "We dramatically increased funding for veterans' health care: more care for women's veterans, for our wounded warriors from Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injuries," Obama said at a 2009 signing of a bill that funds veterans’ medical care a year in advance. Separately, PolitiFact has given Obama seven Promise Kept ratings on pledges he made to improve services to veterans, compared with zero Promise Brokens. Proposed cuts Santorum’s campaign did not respond to our email about his statement, but he may have been referring to Obama's deficit reduction plan, which increases fees for some programs. In September 2011, Obama submitted his outline for how to pay for his American Jobs Act. It was intended to serve as a guide to the joint committee tasked with finding savings in the federal budget. In that plan, Obama proposed three possible "reforms" or increases in fees in military programs: * A new $200 annual fee for TRICARE for Life recipients. Open to veterans 65 and older, TRICARE for Life pays out-of-pocket expenses not covered by Medicare. This proposed fee is estimated to save approximately $6.7 billion over 10 years, according to the plan. * Increases in pharmacy co-pays. The plan says "co-payments for military members have lagged behind other federal and private plans. For example, the average co-payment for a costly brand-name drug purchased at a drug store by a federal retiree in the most popular medical plan option is estimated to be $45, compared to $9 for a military retiree." * Review and reform military retirement benefits. The current system, the plan states, "provides generous benefits to the relatively few members who stay for at least 20 years and no benefits for the roughly 80 percent of service members who stay less than 20 years. To consider reforms the Administration plans to set up a commission to develop recommendations for reforming the current military retirement system." We should add that the president suggests grandfathering in those now serving so that major reforms don’t affect them. What others say We contacted a few veterans groups to get their take on how the president has served veterans. Joe Davis, director of public affairs for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said Obama "has been consistent in statement and action on protecting the Department of Veterans Affairs budget." But the changes Obama has floated are a concern. "We are, however, concerned that budget cuts currently under consideration by the Department of Defense could undermine the viability of the all-volunteer force by changing the current military retirement system and by diverting more health care costs—higher enrollment fees and prescription co-payments—onto the backs of military retirees who were first required to donate 20 or more years of their youth to their nation. This is in addition to previously announced plans to shrink the size of the active-duty force," Davis said in an email. Joe Violante, national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, echoed that sentiment. "The president has increased vet funding over the years and has expanded many programs, women vets, caregivers and PTSD and TBI (traumatic brain injury), to name a few. He is also responsible for supporting advance appropriations for VA health care funding. While you are correct in saying there are proposals to TRICARE fees, these are not usually considered vet programs and come under DOD. Thus far, vet programs have done well under this administration," Violante said in an email. Our ruling Santorum said that Obama has pledged to cut veterans’ benefits. That is not the case with the VA budget, which Obama wants to increase. But there are some proposals for programs in the Defense Department budget that might shift more expenses to veterans. On balance, we rate Santorum's claim Half True.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2012-01-20T18:21:40	2012-01-19	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-11771	"If you don't pay income taxes ... you'll have more money" under the Republican tax plan.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/29/tim-scott/if-you-pay-no-taxes-will-you-end-more-money-under-/	Will the Republican tax proposals be a boon for Americans who currently don’t earn enough to pay taxes? Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., says yes. Days before the Senate was slated to take up the tax bill, Scott was interviewed by Martha Raddatz on ABC’s This Week. Here’s a portion of their exchange about the Senate legislation: Raddatz: "About 45 percent of Americans don't pay income tax, and many of those are the working poor. So, how does it help them?" Scott: "Well, if you don't pay income taxes and we increase your refund by 40 percent, that is a direct dollar impact. In other words, you'll have more money to use to keep those ends together, those single mothers like mine, who are working paycheck to paycheck, they will now not get a $9,300 deduction." To streamline the wording, we decided to fact-check his overall point that a typical family not currently paying income taxes would receive more money under the overhaul. (His office did not object to that paraphrase.) These people would not be getting an increased "refund of 40 percent," or a "$9,300 deduction," even though Scott said that. Those changes would not improve the position of people who already do not pay income taxes. (Scott’s office said those points referred to an earlier discussion in the interview.) The 40 percent figure refers to early estimates by the Republican staff of the Senate Finance Committee about how Americans with specific income and family structures would gain from passage of the bill. (More recent projections are here.) As for the $9,300 deduction, that’s roughly the amount the Senate bill would increase the current standard deduction for single heads of households. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., interviewed on ABC's "This Week" Again, those don't apply here, even though they were in Scott's claim. So we wondered how it would be possible for Americans who already don't pay income taxes to see money from the proposed tax overhaul. The individual mandate If a household already was paying no taxes, having more money in their pocket would require either getting more money back from the government through the tax process, or arguing that the economic growth spurred by the tax bill would inevitably generate raises for the workers in that household. However, the GOP tax bills do not expand the earned income tax credit, which is a refundable credit designed to put more money in the pockets of the working poor. If anything, the bills' use of a slower-growing inflation measure called chained CPI would make EITC refunds less valuable over time. And another refundable tax credit, the child tax credit, would see tighter eligibility rules for the refundable portion, which could result in some households losing that portion of the credit. Meanwhile, even those who argue that the bill’s corporate and income tax cuts will spur economic growth can’t guarantee that any particular American will receive a raise. As it turns out, Scott’s office offered a different justification -- one involving the proposal in the Senate bill to rescind the individual mandate for purchasing health insurance. That provision of the Affordable Care Act requires that Americans who don’t have health insurance to pay a tax penalty. "By repealing the individual mandate, a tax paid overwhelmingly by the middle and working classes, the Senate bill removes a burden placed on low-income families," said Michele Exner, a spokeswoman for Scott. The individual mandate penalty does fall disproportionately on lower- and moderate-income households. And lower- and moderate-income households are also likeliest to owe no federal income taxes. Here’s how Scott’s example of a family saving money from the tax bill would work. Say you’re a family that did not earn enough to face a tax burden. Currently, you’d have a choice regarding health coverage -- either pay for insurance, at roughly $2,500 a year after subsidies for a typical Affordable Care Act plan, or forgo insurance and pay the penalty. This year, the penalty is either 2.5 percent of income, or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, up to a family maximum of $2,085 —whichever is higher. If the individual mandate is rescinded, this family would have a different choice: Either keep paying for insurance, or drop their insurance and save whatever their individual-mandate penalty would have been. Here’s what could happen Does Scott’s justification hold water? This scenario could leave certain low-income households with more money in their pocket -- but there's no guarantee. One possibility is that a family would keep their insurance despite the removal of the individual mandate; in that case, they wouldn’t be assured of saving any money. Health care experts say that if too many young and healthy Americans go without insurance, the premiums for everyone else will go up. If that scenario plays out, this group might end up with less money in their pocket, contrary to Scott’s assertion. The alternative would be for this family to drop their insurance. This could lead to a gain in pocket money, depending on how much they spend on health care. That's because the family would now be on the hook for all of their medical expenses. If they were blessed with luck and stayed healthy, they would come out ahead compared to the status quo. But if they fell seriously ill, the costs could be ruinous. "Whether I will have more or less money in my pocket at the end of the year depends on whether or not I incur sufficiently higher medical expenses to wipe out the savings," said Daniel Shaviro, a New York University law professor who specializes in tax law. "Even insofar as the statement is literally true in some cases, it’s fundamentally dishonest and misleading." What an independent analysis shows So how would lower- to middle-income families fare overall under the Senate bill that includes the elimination of the individual mandate? The Joint Committee on Taxation -- Congress’ nonpartisan office for analyzing tax proposals -- has found that the provisions in the Senate bill, taken collectively, would increase tax collection from the lowest income ranges. In 2019, each of the three income ranges below $30,000 would see increases in tax revenue. (This refers to cumulative totals for all households within that income range; individual households may see their taxes go up or down, depending on their specific situation.) And by 2027, every income range below $75,000 would see a collective tax increase. Here’s the summary table. (This assumes no further action from Congress during that time.) See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Lower-income Americans could get another hit from the Republican tax proposal if budget cuts are needed to offset the loss of federal tax revenue for programs that help the poor, said Gary McGill, director of the Fisher School of Accounting at the University of Florida. All in all, McGill said he finds Scott's argument to be an odd one. "If I quit paying rent, I’ll have more money in my pocket, but I’ll be homeless," he said. "Or if I quit buying food, I’ll have more money -- until I’m dead." Our ruling Scott said, "If you don't pay income taxes ... you'll have more money" under the Republican tax plan. Scott’s logic rests on Americans who do not pay income taxes no longer having to pay the penalty for not carrying health insurance. However, people who decided to keep buying health insurance despite the lifting of the individual mandate penalty wouldn’t benefit under Scott’s scenario. And if they decided to forgo health insurance and pocket the amount of the individual mandate penalty instead, they would only end up ahead if they remained healthy enough to keep their medical costs low. That’s more of a gamble than anything close to a certainty. We rate this statement False.

pomt-07699	Says city of Portland has a one-time $22 million surplus	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/mar/07/sam-adams/sam-adams-says-portlands-finances-show-one-time-22/	Despite these hard economic times, the city of Portland is doing just fine. It’s doing so well, in fact, that it’s running a budget surplus. At least, that’s what Mayor Sam Adams has been telling residents. The news seems to have first cropped up in Adams’ own blog on Dec. 8, 2010: "In last two years, because of our more conservative revenue forecasting, a federal accounting rule change & tamped-down spending (ex: no CPI raises for city staff) results in $21 million one-time surplus." In recent weeks, Adams has been using the line with some frequency. In a question-and-answer with Willamette Week published Feb. 16, 2011 he said, "You asked me what I was proud of. And we have a budget surplus. A one-time budget surplus. We’re in a very different position than most major cities in the United States and most of the governments around us." He repeated the claim in more detail during his State of the City address on Feb. 18, 2011. In fact, he repeated it twice: "Let me repeat. Next year we begin with a $22 million, one-time, general fund surplus." If that’s true, it’s a pretty good reason to be self-congratulatory. After all, like Adams said, most other budgets aren’t looking so good these days. Take, for example, the multibillion-dollar shortfall the state is facing going into the next two-year budget cycle. But, we wondered, is it true? Could Portland really be running a surplus when all we hear about are deficits? So, we decided to check out the mayor’s State of the City claim that Portland is starting next year with a $22 million one-time surplus. In order to see what the city’s finances look like, we turned to a 5-year budget forecast that was released in December. The document, on first glance, seemed to back Adams up. Resources for the upcoming budget should be somewhere in the neighborhood of $398 million while required expenditures are estimated at $376 million. Take the latter from the former and you get a budget surplus of $21.7 million. If you keep reading, though, the numbers get murky. For instance, Table 1 mentions an additional $10.5 million in "continued unfunded ongoing" expenditures. Basically, that category is made up of things that traditionally get funded but aren’t "required." You throw that into the equation and suddenly the city’s surplus is halved ($11.2 million to be precise). The confusion doesn’t end there. Continue on to Table 2, and the report offers a separate scenario. Again, we start with a $21.7 million surplus, but then, it says, there are two new categories to consider: "new one-time" expenses and "additional on-going spending." Those two bits add up to $15 million. Take that from the $21.7 million surplus and the city is left with $6.7 million. What’s more, the forecast goes on to say that the city really shouldn’t spend that $6.7 million. See, the city budgets with five-year forecasts. The idea is that the budget being crafted this year will pave the way for a zero-balance budget five years down the road. In order to get to that zero balance, the city needs to hold onto that $6.7 million, according to the report. So, the forecast concludes, the city’s surplus might not even exist. City of Portland economist Josh Harwood puts it this way: "We're not in crisis mode. We're not short-selling the house, but we're not buying a new car either." Until the details of the budget are hammered out, it’s difficult to tell what surplus -- if any -- will remain. According to the December analysis, that remaining balance could be as high as $21.7 million or as low as, well, nothing. We gave the mayor’s office a call to see if we’d missed something. "The number is accurate," Roy Kaufmann, the mayor’s spokesman said, referring to the $21.7 million figure. But "it does not take into account the one-time spending." "We're too early in the budget process to know ... how that all is going to shake out," Kaufmann added. "I think that the point that the mayor was making was demonstrating to city residents how Portland was being fiscally responsible and fairly fiscally conservative since he was elected, even before he was sworn in." That may be true, but if it’s too early in the budget process to know how the one-time funding is going to shake out, it seems to us that it’s also too early to be trumpeting a surplus at all -- let alone a pretty optimistic one of $22 million. We rate Adams’ claim that Portland has a one-time surplus of $22 million as Half True -- the statement is partially true, but it leaves out some pretty important details. Comment on this item.

pomt-04694	"Republicans would give seniors a (Medicare) voucher that limits what's covered, costing seniors as much as $6,400 more a year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/05/kathleen-sebelius/kathleen-sebelius-repeats-problematic-claim-romney/	Democrats pushed to reclaim "Obamacare" at their national convention in Charlotte, N.C., deploying the secretary of Health and Human Services to celebrate it as a "badge of honor." But Kathleen Sebelius trotted out some problematic talking points in her Sept. 4, 2012, defense of the president’s health care law, saying, for example, that "Republicans would give seniors a voucher that limits what's covered, costing seniors as much as $6,400 more a year." We’ve rated similar claims from Democrats about that extra cost, rating them Half Trueand Mostly Falsebecause they rely on an analysis of an outdated Republican plan. We’ve also rated whether Republicans "want to turn Medicare into a voucher system," finding it Mostly True— their plan is somewhere between "premium support" and "vouchers." Sebelius combined the two claims for a less-than-true statement. Let us explain. The Romney-Ryan Medicare plan Republican vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan released his initial Medicare plan in early 2011. Under this plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. This would have affected people who today are under 55 only, but critics said those who fell under the new rules would face an increasingly large gap between what the government paid for their benefits and what their health care services cost. It would limit "what’s covered," as Sebelius put it, in that seniors would get a defined contribution to buy coverage rather than the defined benefits of traditional Medicare. The plan was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate, where Democrats called it radical and harmful to beneficiaries. Subsequently, Ryan offered updated versions of the plan, the first in conjunction with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and then as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. It still offers seniors a defined amount toward private insurance rather than paying providers directly. That’s why we’ve said it’s Mostly Trueto call it a voucher system. But the new plan has two key differences from Ryan’s previous proposal. The newer version allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice — they can use their payment to buy private insurance or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Meanwhile, the size of the payment would be set by the market — the price of the second-cheapest plan. The most recent Ryan plan appears to be the closest to the Romney-Ryan campaign’s position. In an interviewwith a Green Bay, Wis., television station on Aug. 15, Romney said, "Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical — it's probably close to identical." That makes Sebelius’ claim about cost an outdated one. Here’s how. The $6,400 question Previous claims by Democrats of a $6,400 increase in out-of-pocket costs cite a reportby the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Here’s what the group said: "In 2022, the first year the voucher would apply, (the Congressional Budget Office) estimates that total health care expenditures for a typical 65-year-old would be almost 40 percent higher with private coverage under the Ryan plan than they would be with a continuation of traditional Medicare," center president Bob Greenstein wrote. "CBO also finds that this beneficiary's annual out-of-pocket costs would more than double — from $6,150 to $12,500. In later years, as the value of the voucher eroded, the increase in out-of-pocket costs would be even greater. The difference between $12,500 (the out-of-pocket costs under the Ryan plan in 2022) and $6,150 (the out-of-pocket costs that year under traditional Medicare) is $6,350, which is very close to $6,400. But here’s the problem: The CBO analysis, and other groups’ analyses built on those CBO numbers, refer to the original Ryan plan, not to the current one. The current plan, while it caps overall growth in Medicare spending, is slightly more generous in how fast it allows subsidies to grow as health care costs increase. Ryan also made a number of other technical changes to address concerns that the credits wouldn’t keep up if medical costs kept going up and up. As we mentioned before, the amount a beneficiary receives, for example, would be based on the second least-expensive plan available on a Medicare exchange. The earlier out-of-pocket estimate was based on the idea that seniors’ initial payments would be tied to how much the government had previously paid for their Medicare coverage, forcing seniors to pony up the difference for more expensive private plans. Traditional Medicare would not have been among their options. In the new proposal, Medicare is one of the options, and the payment’s size is based on the price of one of the available plans. So if Medicare were a cheaper option, seniors could use their premium support payment toward purchasing it and save money. If traditional Medicare were more expensive than the second-least expensive plan, it could cost seniors more out-of-pocket to keep it. An estimate of that expense, though, would differ from analysis for Ryan’s earlier plan. But Ryan hasn’t yet asked for a rigorous analysis of his new proposal. "CBO has not analyzed the policies that might be implemented to produce such a path for Medicare spending, including a premium-support approach to Medicare of the sort that Chairman Ryan and other Members of Congress have recently discussed," CBO wrote earlier this year. There is one clue that under the proposal, extra costs for seniors who wanted to keep traditional Medicare wouldn’t come close to $6,400. A study published Aug. 1, 2012, in the Journal of the American Medical Association says that if Ryan’s plan had been in place in 2009, the cost of the second-cheapest Medicare Advantage plan (and thus the size of the premium support payment) would have been 9 percent less than traditional Medicare. That would have required an out-of-pocket payment for seniors who wanted to use traditional Medicare of $64 a month — which adds up to less than $800 a year. Meanwhile, under the Ryan plan, seniors could also choose to buy the plan covered entirely by the premium support payment — for no extra out-of-pocket cost. And all plans offered under the proposal would have to provide at least the actuarial equivalent of traditional Medicare. Of course, absent details from the Ryan camp and an updated CBO analysis, it’s still not clear what would happen over time if the new, market-based payments grew faster than the Ryan plan’s cap on Medicare spending. Would savings still come from beneficiaries? Or providers? Or somewhere else? The absence of details and rigorous analysis of the new plan means that claims about its financial impact on seniors are speculative. It’s irresponsible of Sebelius to repeat a number about an old Republican plan just because she doesn’t have an updated analysis of the new — and different — plan. Meanwhile, to say the new plan provides a voucher "that limits what's covered," as Sebelius said, oversimplifies how it might work. Traditional Medicare limits coverage to specific areas such as doctor and hospital visits, which is why some seniors buy private "gap" insurance to add benefits such as vision, hearing and dental. Under the new Ryan plan, the voucher amount to buy a private policy or traditional Medicare would be limited to the cost of the second-least-expensive policy that provided at least the actuarial equivalent — or same value — of benefits under traditional Medicare. But what got covered might vary from policy to policy. Our ruling Sebelius recycled an old number about an outdated Republican plan when she said, "Republicans would give seniors a voucher that limits what's covered, costing seniors as much as $6,400 more a year." She’s right that a shift to paying a defined amount for seniors to buy their own insurance essentially offers them a voucher. But the Republicans’ Medicare exchange with market-based premium support payments would offer more protection than a pure voucher. And we simply don’t have enough details about that new plan to know how much extra money seniors might have to pay for traditional Medicare. We rate her full statement Half True.

pomt-12347	Rare is the president "who's passed more legislation, who's done more things than what we've done, between the executive orders and the job-killing regulations that have been terminated."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/13/donald-trump/donald-trumps-boasts-about-accomplishments-office-/	Some commentators called it "the weirdest Cabinet meeting ever": President Donald Trump’s leadership team gathered to deliver a litany of praise for the president. Trump saved some of the boasting for himself, making claims that his administration has been one of historic accomplishments. "I will say that never has there been a president -- with few exceptions; in the case of FDR, he had a major depression to handle -- who's passed more legislation, who's done more things than what we've done, between the executive orders and the job-killing regulations that have been terminated," Trump said, later adding, "We've achieved tremendous success." We’ve previously checked Trump’s claim in April that "no administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days" and found that assertion to be False. But given the high-profile setting of Trump’s comment -- his first formal Cabinet meeting -- we decided to take a look at his new statement. Presidential and congressional scholars aren’t any more convinced than they were in April. "Trump’s boasts are empty," said Max J. Skidmore, a University of Missouri-Kansas City political scientist who has written several books on the presidency. Legislation signed by Trump When we checked with the White House, they noted that in this remark Trump acknowledged exceptions such as Roosevelt. They also pointed to the statistics for the number of laws and executive orders signed by a president in 100 days -- a metric that Trump fares well on. Around the 100-day point of Trump’s presidency, we found that White House press secretary Sean Spicer was accurate on the numbers when he said that the current president has "worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since (Harry) Truman." We noted that in the first 100 days of his first full term, Truman signed 55 bills; the president with the highest count since then is Trump with 28. However, none of the bills Trump had signed at that point qualified as major pieces of legislation. None of the ones since are, either. They include, among others, two federal spending bills of the sort required periodically of every president and Congress to keep the government running; a bill overhauling government-employee travel policy; a bill about the United States competing for an international expo; a measure addressing Department of Homeland Security vehicle fleets; and the official naming of a federal courthouse in Tennessee. While the White House is pursuing several major issues in Congress -- notably the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act and efforts to cut taxes and promote infrastructure -- it would be premature for Trump to take credit for these. The health care bill has passed the House but not yet passed the Senate, while the tax and infrastructure measures haven’t even gotten that far. Trump is "correct that he has signed a rather large, although not unprecedented, number of bills," Skidmore said. However, "most of the bills he has signed are routine and unimportant." Sarah Binder, a George Washington University political scientist who specializes in Congress, agreed that "the absence of significant legislative movement is glaring. Contrary to Trump's statement, this is a Republican government struggling to legislate, despite control of both chambers and the White House." By contrast, even if you set aside Franklin D. Roosevelt -- as Trump did -- other presidents signed more far-reaching legislation during their first 100 days. Bill Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, while Barack Obama signed not only a nearly $800 billion stimulus package to combat a spiraling recession but also the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and a law expanding the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Obama also implemented two urgent economic programs formally passed in the final weeks of George W. Bush’s presidency -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the auto industry bailout. Meanwhile, John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps (later ratified by Congress), while Truman’s first 100 days were a whirlwind of foreign-policy actions -- the end of World War II in Europe, the writing of the United Nations charter, the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan, and Japan’s unconditional surrender. Trump’s most significant legislative achievements may be his use of the Congressional Review Act -- a previously little-used power that makes it easier for Congress and the president to overturn federal regulations. "Some of these regulations are substantively and politically important," such as the overturning of the Stream Protection Act, an environmental regulation that Trump and others said harmed coal mining, said Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist. Still, Koger added, "these definitely do not rise to the level of ‘landmark’ legislation, or even ‘major’ legislation." And John Frendreis, a political scientist at Loyola University in Chicago, added that such powers were not available to most postwar presidents, since the Congressional Review Act was only passed in the 1990s. This makes comparisons with past presidents difficult, he said. Trump’s executive orders As president, Trump has signed some three dozen executive orders, which also places him numerically above the presidents since Franklin Roosevelt. A number of these orders have addressed high-profile issues, and some could potentially have significant impacts. One -- a visa ban for individuals from certain Muslim-majority nations -- remains tied up in lawsuits and is headed to the Supreme Court. Another notable order directs the Treasury Department to stop collecting penalties related to not having health insurance. If this policy is followed and isn’t blocked by the courts, "it could cripple this aspect of the Affordable Care Act without altering the law," Frendreis said. Trump also used executive orders to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and to green-light key pipelines that had been held up by the Obama administration. And Trump also announced that the United States would be pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, though he didn’t use an executive order in that case. These are significant policy changes -- but it’s important to note some caveats about Trump’s use of executive orders. First, many of these orders started the ball rolling to overturn federal regulations, rather than overturning them in one fell swoop. Often, Congress needs to weigh in to change a law, or Cabinet departments must undertake a lengthy administrative process before policies officially change. And second, new presidents routinely issue orders during their first 100 days that overturn actions of their predecessors of the opposite party. Just two days after taking office, President Bill Clinton signed orders overturning restrictions on abortion imposed during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, and with equal speed, President George W. Bush overturned Clinton’s opposition to a ban on aid to international groups that participate in abortions. "Every president uses executive orders, especially when they cannot pass legislation because of a hostile Congress," Frendreis said. "So his actions here are typical, and not unusually impressive. In fact, his need to act administratively instead of legislatively implies legislative weakness, not strength, because he should be able to make policy through the legislative process since he has unified partisan control." All told, he said, "the early Trump presidency stands out in terms of the number of symbolic actions he has taken to ‘fulfill’ campaign promises, but his record of changing policy is not off to a fast start. Like all presidents, he has taken some impactful actions, but he does not stand out in this regard." Our ruling In his Cabinet meeting, Trump said that rare is the president "who's passed more legislation, who's done more things than what we've done, between the executive orders and the job-killing regulations that have been terminated." Scholars of the presidency and Congress are unconvinced that Trump’s legislative and administrative output is exceptional by historical standards. Trump has signed a relatively large number of bills so far, but comparatively few with significant impact. And while some of his executive orders have made an immediate impact, most have merely expressed his policy preferences or set in motion a process that may, or may not, change policies down the road.

pomt-05283	Since Scott Walker took office as governor in January 2011, there has been an increase of 33,200 jobs in Wisconsin.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/24/scott-walker/gov-walker-says-wisconsin-has-added-33200-jobs-he-/	With less than two weeks to go until the June 5, 2012, recall election pitting Gov. Scott Walker against Democratic challenger Tom Barrett, the top issues can be summed up this way: Jobs, jobs, jobs. And: jobs. Nowhere is this more clear than in a television ad from Walker that is built on new jobs numbers for 2011 that show a brighter picture than previous numbers -- including much-cited monthly tallies by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the nation’s official scorekeeper on jobs. In the ad, which began running May 16, 2012, Walker leans into the camera and tells viewers what they have heard about jobs going down is wrong. "The government just released the final job numbers," he says, "and as it turns out Wisconsin actually gained -- that’s right, gained -- more than 20,000 new jobs during my first year in office." He goes on: "Add the jobs created this year, and the total grows to over 30,000." There has been a blitz of job-related claims and counter-claims. We have already done items on several to help sort out the various aspects of what is being said. In this item, we are focusing on the claim Walker has made about how many jobs have been created. Is he right? One of our principles is that we rate statements based on the information available when they are made. For instance, when Barrett blamed Walker for worst-in-the-nation job losses from March 2011 to March 2012, we noted he was correct based on the official numbers at the time, but wrong to pin the blame solely on Walker and his policies. We rated the claim Half True. In the new Walker ad, two sets of words appear on the screen as the governor speaks. One quotes from a Journal Sentinel article and reads: "... a gain of 23,321 jobs between Dec. 2010 and Dec. 2011 ..." A second slide says "33,200 total new jobs." This is the figure Walker settles on and what we’re examining. How did Walker arrive at the numbers? Walker begins with the new numbers his administration submitted to the federal government May 16, 2012, the day the ad began. They are based on a required quarterly census of state employers. Walker compares the December 2011 numbers to the December 2010 numbers, to get 23,321. This is the same number included in the Journal Sentinel article the TV ad cites, which is understandable: The administration provided them to a reporter May 15, 2012, the day before it announced the census numbers that had been sent to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Walker then takes monthly numbers from the start of 2012, about 10,000, adds them to the numbers from 2011 and arrives at the 33,200 figure. Simple, right? Not really. The 2011 numbers are based on the jobs census, which covers about 95 percent of employers. They are deemed more accurate than the monthly numbers, which are based on a survey of sample of about 3.5% of employers, then extrapolated to get a state number. At various times Walker has touted and criticized these monthly numbers, depending on whether they have shown an increase or a decrease. And these are the numbers Barrett and Democrats have cited to argue the state is losing jobs under Walker. The BLS itself recognizes the census method as more accurate. Indeed, it uses those numbers to update the monthly numbers. Think of it as a picture that over time comes into sharper focus. The problems: -- The 2011 numbers are not final. They will be reviewed by the BLS and can change, though typically they do not change by a large amount. The normal procedure is the state gathers the employment data from more than 90 percent of state businesses -- some 160,000 -- and then submits it to the feds for review, said Abdur Chowdhury, chairman of the Marquette University economics department. "They vet the data and correct any mistakes in calculations," he said of the feds. "Sometimes the mistakes are very small, sometimes they are very large." -- The two sets of numbers are collected differently. If not an apples and oranges comparison, Walker is certainly mixing two different varieties of apples. They eventually will be combined by federal officials -- the census numbers will be the new basis for the monthly numbers as the ever-changing picture is updated. But this won’t happen for some time. Of course, that’s not satisfying for Walker who wants to highlight the numbers -- or for voters who must factor in progress on jobs (Walker’s top 2010 campaign promise was to create 250,000 new private-sector jobs over four years) before the recall vote. How do we evaluate them? First, the numbers provide the best current estimate for 2011 and the most recent 2012 count, so they offer a sense of where things stand. While the 2011 numbers are not yet "official," they are real numbers submitted by the state to the BLS. (We separately rated a claim by Barrett that the numbers were "just dreamed up" as False.) Chowdhury said the numbers released by Walker should be considered "raw data" because they have not been reviewed by the BLS. They are not, he said, the "final" numbers for 2011 employment. (We separately rated the claim in the ad by Walker that these were the "final numbers" as False.) When we asked Walker’s campaign about the numbers, spokeswoman Ciara Matthews said, "That’s the best data available to us." Barrett spokesman Phil Walzak noted the new 2011 numbers "raised some serious questions" because "they can't be verified and they won't be verified until after the election." He also noted that the Journal Sentinel story about them said never has there been such a large swing -- 57,000 -- between earlier numbers showing job losses and Walker's new numbers showing job gains. Are the April numbers included? The Walker campaign did not respond to efforts to clarify which set of numbers for 2012 were used. That is, was it the numbers for the first three months -- January, February, March? These were the latest released at the time the ad debuted, on May 16, 2012. Or the first four months, including April? Those monthly numbers were announced by the BLS the next day. When Matthews stopped responding to our questions on this point, we tried numerous ways to get the 2011 and 2012 numbers to add up as they do in the ad. The approach that came closest to the number used in the ad was using the January to April monthly numbers for public- and private-sector jobs. When added to the 2011 number, which also was for all jobs, it would mean an increase since he took office of 33,421. That compares with the 33,200 used. The April numbers actually showed a drop from March. Had the March numbers been used, the total cited in the ad could have been higher, about 39,600. Finally, there is the question of how much Walker is crediting his own policies as leading to the new numbers. A governor -- like a mayor -- has little control over national economic trends such as a severe recession. And any policy changes implemented in response take time to be felt. Thus, when we have evaluated similar claims in the past, the Truth-O-Meter winds up somewhere in the middle, often as Half True. In the ad, Walker presents the numbers as just the guv sharing good news. It’s not a full-throated credit-me approach. But in highlighting his own success and urging viewers to continue his policies, implicit in the claim is a statement taking credit for the improving numbers. What’s more, Walker has acknowledged the numbers were released in an unusual manner. Without the early release, they would not be out until well after the election. So, it is to his political benefit to release -- and tout -- them now. Thus, that deserves a big asterisk any time the numbers are cited. Indeed, the article the ad cites as support for the 2011 numbers includes all of these cautionary notes -- but in isolating a few words from the article the ad snips them out for more advantage. Our rating Walker’s ad says there are 33,200 more jobs in Wisconsin since he took office. To reach the number, he combined two data sets -- one that involves unofficial (but generally more accurate) numbers that could change in the weeks after the election; the other is volatile, but still official monthly numbers. From an accounting standpoint this would be flagged as a mistake. From a political standpoint, he is mixing and matching to present the best possible view. Walker presents it all as final and official, offering no cautionary notes or caveats -- even though there are many. And Walker credits his policies for the improvement, which overstates the impact a governor can make on broad economic trends in a short period of time. There is clearly some truth to the numbers. But in mixing everything together and not making it clear these numbers are preliminary, Walker ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That is our definition for Mostly False.

pomt-06498	Says he never called teachers "thugs" and has said nothing but "great things" about them during the fight over his curbs on unions	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/13/scott-walker/walkers-praise-teachers-not-all-encompassing/	At the NBC News "Education Nation" summit in New York City on Sept. 26, 2011, anchor Brian Williams put Republican Gov. Scott Walker on the hot seat over his cuts to school funding in the 2011-’13 budget. Williams opened by saying that among the 10 governors on the panel, only Walker was the subject of a social-media campaign questioning NBC’s decision to include him -- with one Twitter post Williams read comparing it with "having an arsonist talk about fire safety." Then he read from a letter sent to NBC by Wisconsin educator Heather DuBois Bourenane. The letter expressed shock that they were "featuring Scott ‘Teachers are Thugs’ Walker at the summit." Twice in the minutes that followed, Williams pushed Walker hard on the origin of "teachers are thugs" reference. Had Walker said it in the heat of the protests over his successful push to sharply curtail collective bargaining rights for teachers and other public employees? Walker first said it "came from the Internet and everything else" and later flatly denied saying it. He then went further, as he described his encounters with teachers around the state. "I’d have an open forum for an hour with teachers at our schools and they’d say, ‘Why are you pickin’ on teachers?’ And I’d say, ‘Go back to NBC, go back to YouTube, go back to all the statements I’ve made earlier this year and you’ll never find one time when I’ve said anything but great things about our teachers.’" He continued: "The teachers who teach not only my kids but all the other children across the state of Wisconsin, are great public servants. What I’m doing is long term, it’s making a structural change so that more of them can stay in our classrooms." Let’s see … high-profile statement, check. Strong comments, check. Important topic, check. A dispute over what was said, check. Yes, this is one for PolitiFact. So, is Walker right on the "thugs" comment and that he only had positive things to say about teachers? First, "teachers are thugs." It’s worth noting that prominent public officials -- as well as many political commentators -- have freely applied the term "thug" to aspects of the 2011 collective bargaining battle. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, said death threats were "thuggery," while former U.S. Rep. Dave Obey, D-Wausau, said Walker’s move against unions itself was "political thuggery." Bloggers saw "thuggery" everywhere. In the damage done to the Capitol grounds. In the prank phone call made to Walker. In Walker telling that caller he considered planting troublemakers among protesters. They also saw itin a union-supported boycott of pro-Walker businesses. In protesters’ angry confrontation with Republican state Sen. Glenn Grothman. And in a GOP open records request for emails sent by a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who compared Walker’s "style" to Joe McCarthy’s. But did Scott Walker say "teachers are thugs"? Certainly not in the sharp way that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie did in an April 2011 interview with ABC News about teachers there. "I believe the teachers in New Jersey in the main are wonderful public servants that care deeply," Christie said. "But their union, their union are a group of political thugs." We could find no instance of Walker directly addressing teachers -- or their union -- in that fashion. We did, though, find one instance in which Walker used a form of "thug" in discussing the reaction to his limits on unions. It came in a March 10 appearance on conservative talk host Sean Hannity’s TV show immediately after Republican lawmakers approved Walker’s legislation, ending a stalemate with Senate Democrats who fled to Illinois and blocked a vote for more than three weeks. Hannity asked Walker about "mayhem" at the Capitol, which was occupied for weeks by protesters. Hannity specifically mentioned Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald calling the Capitol "unsafe" for lawmakers trying to get to work, as well as reports of death threats against senators and protests outside Walker’s Wauwatosa house. Walker answered: "People should not be coming into the state trying to intimidate lawmakers, offer up threats or anything else. That’s just not the way it’s done, at least not in the Midwest. And thankfully, again, our lawmakers stood up to those sorts of thuggery attacks, and we’re not going to allow that here in the state of Wisconsin. We can have good civil debate." He added: "The people who work for state and local government have been decent, and I respect them throughout this process. But the people coming in from other states, that bring these sorts of tactics, just don’t belong here." In the view of the state’s largest teachers union, the "thuggery" remark was aimed in part at teachers. "Wisconsin teachers were a big part of the collective actions at the start of the movement he’s referring to -- and his take that there was ‘thuggery’ involved, and that it was out-of-state protesters driving these actions, was way off the mark," said Christina Brey, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Education Association Council. But Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the governor was not talking about teachers when he denounced "thuggery attacks." He said Walker was referring to death threats from out-of-state people. A multitude of threats of various kinds were cataloged by conservative observers and the mainstream media during the protests. In our view, it’s clear Walker directed the comment at what he characterized as out-of-state protesters, without specifically mentioning teachers or the teachers union. He didn’t exclude teachers, though. We asked DuBois Bourenane, the letter writer to NBC, about the "teachers as thugs" moniker she gave Walker. She is a post-secondary instructor whose Monologues of Dissent blog frequently blasts Walker as an enemy of public education. She joined in many of the protests at the Capitol, appeared on MSNBC’s "The Ed Show," and has blanketed Walker’s office with dozens of long, critical emails. She told us it was not meant to suggest that Walker ever said those exact words, but merely a device to highlight her view that Walker disrespects teachers. "I never said he said that and I’d be surprised if he did," she told us. "But I do think he actively promotes a rhetorical discourse that promotes the impression that teachers who disagree with his policies are bad for schools and dangerous and subversive." This gets us to part two of this fact check. To gauge Walker’s rhetoric regarding teachers, we examined dozens of Walker statements on education, on unions and on the Capitol protests that teachers figured so prominently in. During the 2010 campaign, Walker made clear he felt public schools -- and specifically underperforming teachers -- were failing Wisconsin’s students. On his campaign website, he called for teacher evaluations, merit pay and other measures, without mentioning his plan to severely limit collective bargaining. He touted an expansion of voucher and charter schools. But he also made clear the "vast majority" of teachers are succeeding, when he released his education plan during the 2010 campaign. After his election, Walker pressed the case against union rules. In a Wall Street Journal opinion column, Walker wrote that the teachers union "hid behind" a labor contract when an award-winning first-year teacher was laid off because of seniority rules under collective bargaining. In February 2011, after Walker unveiled his union limits and benefits cuts, major school districts across the state shut down when teachers flocked to protests in Madison. Walker praised the "good professionals "who went to work and said those who skipped out had every right to be heard, "but I said I’m not going to allow for one minute the voices of the tens of thousands here to somehow overpower the millions of hardworking taxpayers of my state who know what were asking for is modest." He was less diplomatic when referring to the teachers union. He told conservative talk show host Mark Levin on Feb. 21, 2011, that the union’s motivation was only to get its hands on teachers’ dues payments. By announcing it would give in to Walker’s benefits cuts if he would drop the limits on collective bargaining, "they threw their members under the bus," he said. The same day, Walker told Hannity that Republicans were "not going to be intimidated" by tens of thousands of protesters from Chicago, Nevada and New Jersey. (PolitiFact Wisconsin rated False Walker’s Feb. 22 claim that "almost all" the protesters were from outside Wisconsin at that point, while noting that Illinois teachers unions had sent buses of protesters to Madison.) In late February and early March, as the standoff with Democrats dragged on, Walker used a series of news releases to highlight deals that teachers had negotiated through their union -- or won in arbitration -- on pay, retirement benefits, overtime and working conditions. Some of the releases singled out small but attention-grabbing items in particular districts. One was, "Almost $10,000 Per Year for Doing Nothing," a reference to a teacher emeritus program. Another was "Arbitrator Reinstates Porn-Watching Teacher." Another: "$6,000 Extra for Carrying a Pager." Walker has taken steps to assert that he and his budget were pro-teacher. He frequently praises the public school teachers his two sons have encountered in Wauwatosa, and other outstanding teachers elsewhere. At the NBC summit, Walker repeated his respect for teachers. "I understand there’s sometimes a difference of opinion, but in the end, we believe the right thing to do is put the power in the hands of the teachers," he said. Brey, the statewide teachers union spokeswoman, says WEAC’s main beef with Walker is his actions, not his words. But she said Walker uses his words to depict unions as greedy (seeking an "expensive entitlement"); controlled by intimidating out-of-state "bosses"; and incompetent (with union hiring restrictions gone, Walker says, now we can keep the best teachers). Criticism of the union, Brey contends, amounts to criticism of teachers, who elect their union representatives. In our view, both sides have a gripe. Teachers who belong to the union feel aggrieved by Walker’s comments about their union. But being critical of a group is not the same as being critical of individuals, and it’s a stretch to call Walker’s calls for educational reform and school choice an attack on teachers, per se. On the other hand, it’s disingenuous for the governor to suggest that his praise of teachers is all-encompassing, but that when he’s talking about the protesters -- even mischaracterizing them as dominated by out-of-state interests -- and teachers organizations, it is limited. Our conclusion At the NBC Education Summit, Walker denied saying "teachers are thugs" and said he’s only said "great thing" about teachers. Though we looked at two pieces of the statement, it essentially amounts to single claim -- that he’s only praised teachers. There’s no evidence at all that he used the thug line -- and even the educator whose letter prompted the questioning doesn’t believe he said it. He did use the term "thuggery attacks" in response to a question about the protesters’ occupation of the Capitol, death threats against elected officials and protests outside his home. Many Wisconsin educators joined in that occupation, but Walker says he was referring only to death threats by out-of-state people. On the larger point of his rhetoric about teachers, we found Walker was careful about expressing his respect for teachers and other protesters, while offering criticism of the union that represents them. So, Walker can accurately claim he has avoided direct rhetorical attacks on teachers as a profession. But we found Walker said less than "great things" about the union that represents teachers, and in his "thuggery" comment Walker left room for teachers to assume he was passing judgment on their protests at the Capitol. Walker’s statement may be narrowly accurate, but it slips down the Truth-O-Meter when you examine the full context of his comments about the teachers union, teacher benefits and the protests. Taken as a whole, his comments fall short of the high bar he set about saying only "great things." We rate his statement Half True.

We freely admit we have egg on our face. If we were a cat, our ears would be lowered and our head down. If we were a dog, we’d be looking up at you with sad dog eyes. You get the picture. Last week we ruled True a statement by the Oregon Republican Party that Republican Rob Cornilles had the endorsements of a variety of local mayors, including Democrat, Republican and Independent. The upper case "I" means he had the backing of a registered member of the Independent Party of Oregon, which is a third party group. Well, we were wrong. We checked Cornilles’ list of mayors online, and confirmed their party registration. As we suspected, most are Republican. But we found six non-Republicans, including three registered Democrats. We originally emailed Amity Mayor Michael Cape and asked him if he was registered with the Independent Party, as opposed to being a non-affiliated voter. He said yes. But it turns out that he’s actually a non-affiliated voter. The Independent Party of Oregon was officially recognized by the Secretary of State in January 2007. Previously, people registered with no party could call themselves independent voters. Now they best stick to calling themselves non-affiliated voters. Cape said in a later interview that he considered himself independent, as in neither Republican nor Democratic. This is a confusing issue. When we first contacted the Yamhill clerk’s office, a person there said Cape was registered as Other-Independent. Which is not the same as registering with the Independent Party. Had the Oregon Republican Party used a lower case "i" they would have been accurate. They say that’s what they intended all along. But capitalization makes a difference.

"Actress Emma Stone: ‘For the first time in history we have a president that…" read the headline on April 1 on Politics Elite Trump, a blog site that publishes stories about Hollywood and politics. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat misinformation. The story quotes Stone as saying that even though she originally wanted Hillary Clinton to win the 2016 presidential election, she has come to realize that America made a great choice electing Trump. That didn’t happen. In reality, Stone called the results of the 2016 election "incredibly painful." Clinton and Stone have also been photographed together backstage at the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The story includes a doctored image of Stone wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat. It was photoshopped from a real photo taken of her at Disneyland in 2015. Stone was wearing a navy blue hat with a Mickey Mouse logo, but the article removed the logo replacing it with Trump’s campaign slogan. The article also claims that Stone stated that she is not usually involved in politics. Though Stone has said that she has stayed quiet in publicly expressing her opinions, she has recently said that she is speaking out more often. Stone has supported equal pay for men and women and Planned Parenthood. When searching for the quotes attributed to Stone in the article, we found no results.

pomt-13957	"The Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/15/donald-trump/donald-trump-suggests-barack-obama-supported-isis-/	In a series of comments designed to cast doubt on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump has charged that the Obama administration has actively supported the Islamic extremist group that became ISIS. In this fact-check, we’ll begin by recapping what Trump said. Then we’ll look at whether he has any evidence to support the allegation. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) What Trump said It all began with a June 13 interview with Fox & Friends, when Trump said, "Look, we're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind. And the something else in mind — you know, people can't believe it. People cannot, they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words 'radical Islamic terrorism.' There's something going on. It's inconceivable." Trump, as we have previously detailed, declined to clarify what he meant in a subsequent interview on NBC’s Today show. He said, "Well, there are a lot of people that think maybe he doesn't want to get it. A lot of people think maybe he doesn't want to know about it. I happen to think that he just doesn't know what he's doing, but there are many people that think maybe he doesn't want to get it. He doesn't want to see what's really happening. And that could be." Then, on June 14, Trump told the Associated Press that Obama "claims to know our enemy, and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies, and for that matter, the American people." A day later, Trump tweeted, "An: Media fell all over themselves criticizing what DonaldTrump "may have insinuated about @POTUS." But he's right." The tweet then linked to a Breitbart story that began, "Hillary Clinton received a classified intelligence report stating that the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State." Finally, later that day, Trump posted on Facebook, "Hillary Clinton --- is CROOKED! Hillary Clinton received a classified intelligence report stating that the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State." This post also linked to the Breitbart article. The 2012 intelligence memo The story on the conservative website Breitbart was based on a classified and partially redacted U.S. intelligence document written in August 2012 and released last year as a result of a lawsuit by the group Judicial Watch. The document outlines what is known about "the general situation" on the ground in Syria and Iraq after the rebellion against the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. In that context, the document refers, among other groups, to al-Qaida in Iraq, or AQI, which eventually morphed into ISIS, sometimes called the Islamic State or ISIL. The document calls AQI one of a few "major forces driving the insurgency in Syria." Specifically, it said, "AQI supported the Syrian opposition from the beginning, both ideologically and through the media. AQI declared its opposition (to) Assad’s government because it considered it a sectarian regime targeting Sunnis." (As background, AQI and ISIS are part of the Sunni branch of Islam, which is often in conflict with the Shia branch.) Meanwhile, the document said that "the West, Gulf countries and Turkey support the opposition, while Russia, China and Iran support the regime." The significance of the memo Trump sees the memo as the smoking gun that demonstrates U.S. support for ISIS or its predecessor group. But that’s not the case. Rather, experts say it means that the United States shared an overarching goal with the opposition -- namely, countering Assad -- without actively supporting all elements of that opposition. In the byzantine world of the Syrian opposition, the United States sought to support moderate elements while opposing extremists such as AQI and, later, ISIS. The White House firmly rejected the notion that the United States actively supported either AQI or ISIS, noting the number of terrorists the administration has killed, including major leadership figures. "We, in conjunction with our Iraqi partners, relentlessly pursued and ultimately degraded AQI with every tool in our arsenal -- including military force," said Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House’s National Security Council. "And, of course, the fact that we eliminated AQI's leader, Abu Ayyub al-Masri in a joint U.S.-Iraqi raid leaves no doubt about our determination to rid Iraq of this group." Independent experts agreed with the White House. "The United States has never backed AQI and has never backed ISIS," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. "It was never part of the opposition that the United States supported, full stop." Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, agreed. "It has never been the policy or stated goal of the Obama administration to arm or assist al-Qaida," he said. "I would say it's another unsupportable conspiracy theory," said John Limbert, an international affairs professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who previously served as a foreign service officer in post-war Iraq and as deputy coordinator for counterterrorism in the State Department. John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, said it would be putting it "mildly" to call it a conspiracy theory. And Gartenstein-Ross also used that term, tweeting that Trump’s effort to make this argument was a "transparently fallacious conspiracy theory." A point Trump could have made, but didn’t Ironically, experts say, Trump could have made a different point against the Obama administration's Syria policy. Gartenstein-Ross has written about the perils of the administration’s attempts to identify and support potential allies from the motley ranks of the opposition. The effort, he wrote, ended up "benefiting the very jihadist groups the U.S. has been fighting for the past 15 years." Specifically, the policy of arming and promoting Sunni rebel groups fighting the Assad regime ended up indirectly helping the al Nusra Front, an al-Qaida affiliate in Syria, Landis said. Al Nusra was "allied with many of the leaders that the U.S. did arm or assist," Landis said. And other rebel groups were overrun by al Nusra, he added, even having to surrender their U.S.-provided arms to the al-Qaida affiliate on occasion. The difference with what Trump said is that these developments were unintended -- and unwanted -- side effects of the United States’ policy, not a goal of it. "I think our policy has been both foolish and tragic, but it doesn’t make the argument from Breitbart true," Gartenstein-Ross said. Our ruling Trump said "the Obama administration was actively supporting Al Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group that became the Islamic State." U.S. efforts to court "moderate" opponents of Assad may have benefited other Islamic extremist groups such as al Nusra, but any such benefits were an unintended consequence of U.S. policy, not a goal of that policy itself. That’s different from the argument made by Trump -- that the U.S. was actively supporting ISIS or its predecessors. In fact, experts say that assertion is flat wrong. The implication that the Obama administration was actively helping the United States' enemies is ridiculous. It has always been U.S. policy to oppose AQI and ISIS, and the United States has aggressively fought the group for years.

pomt-03522	Wisconsin has "one of the most progressive tax codes in the country."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/02/dale-kooyenga/kooyenga-says-wisconsins-income-taxes-stand-out-na/	The author of a Wisconsin income tax overhaul sees the flat tax in the Flatland to the south as a beacon for Republicans trying to ease the Badger State’s heavy tax burden on the middle class. "We have a long ways to go in Wisconsin," state Rep. Dale Kooyenga, R-Brookfield, told reporters. "Everyone in Illinois pays 5 percent. Illinois millionaires … pay less of a rate in taxes than Wisconsin’s lower income, middle-class families." Researchers deem Illinois’ personal income tax structure "regressive" because a uniform tax rate ultimately takes a bigger bite from lower incomes than higher ones. Wisconsin pioneered the opposite approach, a "progressive" system in which tax rates rise with earnings. Kooyenga argues change is long overdue. "Wisconsin was the first state to enact an income tax in 1911," he wrote in a May 27, 2013 posting on the conservative Right Wisconsin website. "The complexity of the Wisconsin tax code has exponentially grown as Madison politicians believed the tax code was their magic wand which could be used to accomplish political and social objectives." His conclusion: "As a direct result, our tax code picks winners and losers and is one of the most progressive tax codes in the country." Kooyenga’s plan reduces rates and collapses several tax brackets. It comes on top of Gov. Scott Walker’s tax-cut proposal. Combined they reduce taxes by nearly $790 million over two years. Top earners would likely receive the majority of the $444 million in tax savings under Kooyenga’s plan, and those with modest incomes would land in the same tax bracket as very high earners, the Journal Sentinel reported. Kooyenga acknowledges that, but says everyone deserves tax relief and that the top 10 percent right now pay over 50 percent of the tax revenue in Wisconsin. But Kooyenga’s claim wasn’t about the impact of his plan. Rather it was about the tax system as it stands today. Does Wisconsin have "one of the most progressive tax codes in the country"? The rankings Kooyenga’s plan focuses on the personal income tax, so we’ll confine our analysis to that rather than all taxes in the code. We found two 50-state studies comparing income tax burdens by income level, and Kooyenga cited the same research when we asked him for backup. A March 2013 study of 2010 tax data by the non-partisan Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence, a research organization, concluded that: -- Among 42 states with an income tax (and the District of Columbia), Wisconsin is the 9th most-progressive when comparing married couples with $10,000 of gross income to those with incomes of $150,000, $250,000, $500,000 and $1 million. -- Wisconsin’s ranking drops lower, in a range from 11th to 15th "most progressive," when comparing a couple earning $35,000 to each of those four higher levels. The ranks were 11, 12, 15 and 15. Minnesota came in number 2. The second study cited by Kooyenga is a January 2013 examination by the nonpartisan, liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) in Washington, D.C. (The group is a partner organization to Citizens for Tax Justice, which has criticized the Walker and Kooyenga tax cuts as costly and regressive. Also, on May 30, 2013, ITEP released a review of Kooyenga’s plan, concluding that the top 20 percent of earners, a group with an average income of $183,000, would receive more than two-thirds of the benefit.) In any event, the group’s earlier 50-state study -- the one cited by Kooyenga to back up his claim -- found that Wisconsin’s income tax was the 12th most progressive in the nation. That ranking is not revealed in the report, which deals with a broader variety of state and local taxes, but the group made it available to us from its unpublished database. So, the two studies rank the income tax here in a range from 9th to 15th most progressive. That puts Wisconsin among the top 21 to 36 percent of "most progressive" income tax states, depending on the comparison point and the study. Of course, that’s just among the state’s that levy a personal income tax -- the tax that is the main way to add a progressive element to a tax system. Four states that don’t levy a personal income tax are on the ITEP’s top-10 "most regressive" list for their overall tax systems, so it’s safe to say Wisconsin’s income tax approach is more progressive than in those additional states that don’t even use this progressive tool. Of the two studies, the ITEP research is more up to date, but is limited to non-elderly taxpayers. It, unlike the Minnesota study, accounted for the effect of reductions that Walker initiated in 2011 in the earned income tax credit for low-income workers, a cut of 19 percent, or $56 million over two years. That change made the income tax less progressive, but we don’t know how it affected Wisconsin’s ranking vs. other states, some of whom made similar changes. Digging deeper From the ITEP study, Kooyenga highlighted tables showing that Wisconsin’s top 20 percent of earners pay an effective income tax rate considerably higher than the national average. Similarly, for the lowest 20 percent, Wisconsin’s burden is lower than the 50-state average. That’s true, and it demonstrates the progressive nature of the Wisconsin system. The progressive income tax offsets the regressive effect, for example, of the sales tax. Aside from the graduated rate structure that rises with income, the state’s sliding standard deduction is "powerfully progressive," as is the itemized deduction credit, notes Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance president Todd Berry. But the ITEP study also shows that by the time earnings reach an average of $28,000, Wisconsin’s personal income tax bite is already over the national average for the second 20 percent. PolitiFact Wisconsin in November 2012 reviewed a claim by state Rep. Robin Vos that on income taxes, "Wisconsin is one of the best places in the country to be poor but "top 4 or 5 worst" for middle-income earners. We rated it Mostly True. Wisconsin, in the 2013 ITEP study, is not singled out as at the very highest end as either progressive or regressive. "Unlike most states, Wisconsin allows a large capital gains tax break," ITEP executive director Matthew Gardner wrote in an email. "Since the benefits of this tax break go primarily to the best-off taxpayers, the capital gains tax break makes Wisconsin’s income tax much less progressive than you would think from just looking at the tax rates." Gardner said it would be reasonable to say that Wisconsin is in the upper tier of "least regressive" states based on its #12 ranking. But, in his view, "it’s hard to describe the Wisconsin income tax -- or the tax system as a whole -- as among the ‘most progressive’ in the US." In the Minnesota study, the rankings drop quite a bit when the comparison income is set at $35,000 instead of $10,000. The reason for that is related to the tax credits for very low earners that we mentioned earlier. Wisconsin has a prominent credit, helping to account for its progressive ranking. Such credits phase out as income rises, however, so those people would have a tax liability, unlike lower earners whose bill is wiped out by the credit, said Aaron Twait, research director at the Minnesota center. A few other states keep the credits in place at higher incomes, bumping up their "progressive" rating. Kooyenga could have balanced off some of the regressive effect of his plan by increasing tax credits for very low-income earners. But he notes that many workers in that category receive the credit even though they did not earn enough wages to have Wisconsin taxes withheld. It’s a wage supplement in the form of a refund. That, in Kooyenga’s view, is one of the inappropriate "social objectives" in the tax code, his office told us. Our rating PItching his plan to begin flattening the Wisconsin state income tax code, Kooyenga said Wisconsin has "one of the most progressive tax codes in the country." Kooyenga was talking about income taxes, and it’s clear from two national studies that Wisconsin’s tax is more progressive than two-thirds to four-fifths of the states that levy such a tax, depending on the study. So Wisconsin is clearly in the upper tier, but not in elite of the elite. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Dale Kooyenga	None	None	None	2013-06-02T09:00:00	2013-05-27	['None']
pomt-04427	Signs letter saying Consumer Product Safety Commission is acting "without consultation or input from the company" to stop the sale of Buckyballs.	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/oct/15/phil-roe/roe-letter-claims-consumer-commission-stopping-buc/	Buckyballs and Buckycubes, tiny rare earth magnets manufactured in China and sold by the Maxfield & Oberton Co. of New York, are intended to be adult desk toys. They’re marketed as "the amazing magnetic desk toys you can’t put down," and have received rave reviews in magazines like Maxim, Wired, Esquire and People. They’ve also been swallowed by children and have been the cause of emergency surgeries. In July, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, in filing only its second administrative complaint in 11 years, charged that their design poses a "substantial risk of injury to the public." U.S. Reps. Marsha Blackburn and Phil Roe, both R-Tenn., and five other members of Congress, wrote to President Obama on Oct. 1, saying the CPSC "is penalizing our nation’s brightest innovators and job creators through excessive and selective enforcement." The congressmen go on to say that they learned of the Buckyballs case during a recent hearing. They say CPSC "overreach and lack of flexibility has virtually eliminated these products and the jobs associated with their sales and distribution." They ask the president to review the case and for the CPSC to continue to work cooperatively with the company. They point out that 2.5 million of the small magnetic cube and ball toys have been sold in the past three years. Then they say that the "CPSC is working, without consultation or input from the company, to eliminate this product by stopping the sale of their products by directly approaching its retail partners and requesting a recall." We asked Blackburn’s communications director, Mike Reynard, for supporting evidence that the agency was acting without consultation or input from the company. After conferring with staffers, Reynard sent a USA Today story indicating the CPSC has been intervening with retailers to end sales of the magnets as it pursues its lawsuit. He said the lawsuit itself showed the agency is "done working with the company." In a followup email message, Reynard wrote: "You can't say you're working with someone when you are actively suing them to kill their product. That might be the administration's idea of a cooperative working relationship but it isn't for most Americans and business owners. CPSC should be working with Buckyballs to resolve any concerns around these limited cases when compared to the 2.5 million units sold. Clearly they have pushed to get this product off shelves as the USA Today story confirms specific vendors who have pulled the product." Roe spokeswoman Tiffany McGuffee said Roe takes the same position. Then we looked at the lengthy letter from Maxfield & Oberton CEO Craig Zucker laying out its case against the CPSC’s actions. It notes the "extraordinary lengths" the company has taken to prevent misuse of its products, including "warnings, education, labeling, retailer sales restrictions and continuous cooperation with the CPSC – right up until literally the moment they turned on us." Zucker’s letter explains the toys went on sale in March 2009 and were originally labeled for use by those 13 and older. When the federal rules for children’s games changed to include those 14 and older, the company entered into a May 2010 voluntary recall of all the toys with the original labeling. It went on to create a "comprehensive safety program" and began labeling the toys with a warning: "Keep Away From All Children." The company also required retailers to agree to rules for placement of its products in their stores, with new signs. It designed a Magnet Safety website in March of this year and met with three CPSC commissioners and staff in April to discuss the expanded safety program. The company also created a medical advisory group and, along with its competitors, created the Coalition for Magnet Safety. But on July 10, the commission voted 3-1 to file the administrative complaint after, it said, "discussions with the company and its representatives failed to result in a voluntary recall plan that CPSC considered to be adequate." The CPSC said that, despite the warnings and labeling, people were still ingesting the magnets, sometimes after placing them on tongues or on cheeks to resemble piercings. The CPSC warned that when two magnets are swallowed, they can be attracted to each other through stomach or intestinal walls, resulting in serious injury requiring surgery. CPSC spokesman Scott Wolfson said in an interview that gastroenterologists have said the injuries often resemble "a gunshot to the gut" but without entrance or exit wounds. Wolfson noted that both Maxfield & Oberton and a Denver-based company, Zen Magnets, were sued after they failed to provide adequate suggestions for making their products safer. They were the first such complaints since the Arkansas-based Daisy BB gun company was sued in 2001. "Due to the number of ingestion incidents received by CPSC staff since the 2010 recall announcement and 2011 safety alert, CPSC staff seeks the remedies outlined in the complaint to stop further incidents and injuries to children," the agency said in a statement. Those remedies include stopping the sale of the toys and providing consumers with refunds. Our ruling Blackburn, Roe and their fellow letter writers are concerned that the "nation’s brightest innovators and job creators" are being penalized by an overzealous consumer protection agency. We’ll leave it to others to determine whether the sellers of Chinese magnetic balls qualify as the nation’s "brightest innovators," and also decline to determine the truth of the letter writers’ assertion that the agency’s first administrative complaints in 11 years suggest "excessive and selective enforcement." Those are opinions, but it is possible to see whether the CPSC failed to consult or seek input from the company. The lengthy record laid out by the company’s CEO establishes there was, in fact, much consultation leading up the agency’s conclusion that the toys are inherently unsafe. We rule the Congress members’ statement False.	None	Phil Roe	None	None	None	2012-10-15T03:00:00	2012-10-01	['None']

pomt-05271	On transportation financing	half flip	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/27/chris-christie/christie-administration-backtracks-borrowing-trans/	New Jersey’s governor often portrays himself as a man of his word. Before taking office he vowed he wouldn’t raise taxes on millionaires and so far, he hasn’t. He’s also taken on the New Jersey Education Association by pledging to reform tenure and funding, infuriating numerous educators, administrators and legislators from Hackensack to Cape May. So it might seem surprising that the governor known for slashing budgets, requiring public employees to contribute more to healthcare and pension costs, and putting a chokehold on various types of aid is changing his tune a bit on one of his major funding concerns: transportation. The change is inconsistent with past statements made by Christie so we’re putting that change to the Flip-O-Meter. The Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It gauges whether they did. Christie’s stance changed with Wednesday’s announcement that the administration will borrow an extra $260 million for transportation projects. That’s contrary to a Christie announcement more than a year ago that through his transportation capital plan, the state would begin relying less on borrowing for that type of work. From a state Department of Transportation news release on Jan. 6, 2011: "Today, we are continuing to put New Jersey on the path towards fiscal health and proposing a sensible and responsible plan that prioritizes vital transportation projects, while limiting the already-heavy debt burden carried by the taxpayers of our state." So what happened? Call it a miscalculation of sorts. Both the Christie administration and David Rosen, chief budget officer for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, are estimating revenue shortfalls in the budget that will ultimately mean Christie has less available cash to give to transportation. Christie’s revenue shortfall is $676 million through the end of the next fiscal year, while Rosen’s is $1.3 billion. That’s a difference of about $600 million between shortfall predictions. Christie’s original transportation capital plan for FY 2012-2013 called for borrowing $986 million and using $260 million cash in 2013. Now, New Jersey will borrow the $260 million instead, increasing the total amount borrowed to $1.2 billion. The $260 million in cash in addition to other cost-saving measures would help plug the revenue shortfall and allow the administration to kick off an across-the-board 10 percent income tax cut. But Martin E. Robins, director emeritus of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University, told The Star-Ledger on Wednesday, "We’re really falling right back into the capital financing that the governor critized Jon Corzine for." Despite the move to increase transportation borrowing, State Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff emphasized that the governor’s original goal to lessen reliance on bonding for transportation remains. "This is a one-year initiative, and we do not make this recommendation casually," Sidamon-Eristoff said at an Assembly Budget Committee hearing Wednesday. Our ruling Christie has stated previously that he wants the state to rely less on borrowing for transportation projects and in January 2011 announced a transportation capital plan that calls for more pay-as-you-go financing. But now he’s saying the state will borrow an additional $260 million for transportation work next year in part because of projected revenue shortfalls in the state budget. The governor’s about-face is inconsistent with his previous statements, which rates the change a Half Flip on the Flip-O-Meter. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-09956	ACORN "could get up to $8.5 billion more tax dollars despite being under investigation for voter registration fraud in a dozen states."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/21/michele-bachmann/bachmann-claims-acorn-has-access-85-billion-federa/	U.S. Rep. Michelle Bachmann's latest outrage focuses on an old nemesis: ACORN. Not only are there new charges in two states related to fraudulent voter registration efforts by ACORN and its employees during the 2008 presidential election, she said, it now appears the group could tap into billions of dollars of federal money in the economic stimulus and the Obama administration's proposed 2010 budget. In a May 6 news release, Bachmann sounded the alarm: "At least $53 million in federal funds have gone to ACORN activists since 1994, and the controversial group could get up to $8.5 billion more tax dollars despite being under investigation for voter registration fraud in a dozen states. The economic stimulus bill enacted in February contains $3 billion that the nonprofit activist group known more formally as the Association for Community Organizations for Reform Now could receive, and 2010 federal budget contains another $5.5 billion that could also find its way into the group's coffers." She has since thrown these numbers out several times in interviews, including ones with Lou Dobbs on CNN and Glenn Beck on Fox. In January, we addressed a piece of this when we fact-checked a claim from House Republican Leader John Boehner, who warned the economic stimulus package "could open billions of taxpayer dollars to left-wing groups like the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN)." Boehner was referring to $2.2 billion in the stimulus package for "neighborhood stabilization," essentially money doled out to groups to buy up abandoned and foreclosed homes, to rehabilitate them and then sell or rent them out. ACORN said it had no plans to apply for the funding, and if it did, the money would have to be used to buy and fix abandoned houses, not for voter registration efforts. We ruled that claim Barely True . This latest claim from Bachmann follows the same tortured logic on an even grander scale. A spokesman from Bachmann's office said the congresswoman got her data from a May 6, 2009, Washington Examiner commentary written by Kevin Mooney, who got the $8.5 billion figure from Matthew Vadum, a senior analyst and editor with Capital Research Center, a conservative think tank. Let's first look at how they arrived at that number. It includes, of course, the same $2.2 billion that Boehner cited from the stimulus package. Vadum also adds $1 billion in the stimulus for Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds. ACORN could potentially tap into that, he said. The remaining $5.5 billion comes from the Obama administration's proposed 2010 budget, specifically the budget for Housing and Urban Development. The budget plan includes $1 billion for an Affordable Housing Trust Fund, plus $4.5 billion more for CDBGs. CDBGs have been around since 1974. Obama is seeking to increase the CDBG budget from about $3.6 billion in 2009 to $4.2 billion next year. And then there's the additional $1 billion for CDBGs in the stimulus. But the point is, this isn't some new pot of money that hasn't been available in years past. To the extent ACORN has been eligible for CDBG money for decades, it is available to ACORN now. But the fact is, ACORN isn't eligible for CDBG funding. At least not for the controversial voter registration efforts that Republican leaders claim are a willful effort to forward the group's liberal agenda. ACORN has a complex corporate structure. It's actually a network of affiliates. The ACORN that Republicans love to hate gets involved in political activity like voter registration. But there are other entities, like the sister company, ACORN Housing Corporation, a nonprofit that provides free housing counseling to low and moderate income homebuyers. Some of the ACORN Housing affiliates have also dabbled in affordable housing projects and have received federal funding. But ACORN Housing doesn't get involved in voter registration activities. CDBG money is given to local governments and states to use as they see fit for community development projects. But there are strings attached. CDBG rules list eligible uses of the money, including such things as building sidewalks, sewers and affordable housing, mostly. Specifically ineligible: "political activities." In other words, ACORN can't use the money for voter registration. According to the Washington Examiner 's report, ACORN and its affiliates have received $53 million from the federal government since 1994. Most of that federal money went to the ACORN Housing Corporation, which by law could not be used for voter registration. We checked, and there is no money in the stimulus package or the budget for voter registration programs. So if ACORN Housing was to apply for and receive CDBG money, it would be for a very specific project. And legally, it could not be transferred to other ACORN affiliates to perform political activities like voter registration. But some ACORN opponents allege that's exactly what would happen. "ACORN is constantly shifting funding," Vadum said. If ACORN Housing were to get federal funding, "we don't know where it would go. The problem is that ACORN transfers vast sums of money around in its network all the time. We don't know whether the money would be spent on voter registration or other activities." According to a July 2002 report from the Employment Policies Institute called "Rotten ACORN, America's Bad Seed," tax forms show that since 1997, the ACORN Housing Corporation has paid more than $5 million in fees or grants to other ACORN entities. The report does not claim, however, that federal tax dollars were shifted into ACORN voter registration efforts. Asked what funds ACORN Housing has transferred to other ACORN affiliates, Vadum said ACORN Housing has paid over $1.5 million to Citizens Consulting Inc., which he describes as "the shadowy part of the ACORN network where money seems to disappear into." That's absurd, said ACORN executive director Steven Kest. Citizens Consulting Inc. is the accounting arm of the ACORN organization. CCI handles bookkeeping, payroll accounting and other financial management services for ACORN and its many affiliates. And ACORN Housing doesn't even use CCI anymore, as it now does its accounting in-house, Kest said. Bottom line, we don't see any evidence that ACORN Housing has transferred money to ACORN for voter registration, so we think it's incorrect for Bachmann to link federal money that ACORN Housing might receive with the more controversial voter registration activities performed by sister organization ACORN. Even more ridiculous is the suggestion that ACORN or any of its affiliates might actually get $8.5 billion in federal tax dollars. Vadum said his report has been misrepresented by many on that point. "The key word here is eligible," Vadum said. "Eligible is a pretty expansive word. I made it clear they are not going to get that full amount." Yes, he made that point in the Washington Examiner. But when Bachmann says ACORN could get that amount, it assumes the group would get every single dime in the stimulus for fixing up abandoned homes. And remember, they said they don't even have plans to apply for any of it. "We think it's a great program," Kest said. "But that's not money we are applying for." And they'd also need to get every single dollar allocated through the CDBG program. That's beyond preposterous. Those grants are allocated to thousands of organizations around the country to perform very specific community development projects. "These are competitive grants for very specific projects," Kest said."The money can only be used for the project you bid for. It can't go to voter registration. If you've ever had any experience with grant funding from the federal government, they do a good job of making sure the money is used for the purposes it was intended. You can't use the money for any other reason. You can't transfer the money to other vehicles for other purposes." Charges of voter registration fraud by members of ACORN during the 2008 elections are a serious matter. Investigators allege ACORN employees tried to fraudulently register thousands of ineligible voters. Among them, one Mickey Mouse. But Bachmann's statement is irresponsibly misleading on several levels. She says the group under indictment for voter registration fraud could tap into billions of federal dollars. In fact, none of the federal money can be used for voter registration activities. An affiliate like ACORN Housing could conceivably apply for a grant to build an affordable housing project, or to buy, fix and sell abandoned homes, but that's exactly what the money would have to be used for. Suggestions that one of the affiliates might funnel money to ACORN for political activity is, so far, unsubstantiated conjecture. And then there's the matter of trying to make a splash by throwing out the massive $8.5 billion number, suggesting ACORN "could get" it, as in all of it. That's absurd. We rule Bachmann's statement False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2009-05-21T18:14:21	2009-05-06	['None']
pomt-09264	Alaska's Prince William Sound "is pristine now."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/30/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-alaskas-prince-william-sound-no/	With 200,000 gallons of oil a day spewing from an exploded oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, forming a slick the size of West Virginia and threatening the coastline of Louisiana, radio pundit Rush Limbaugh said there's no need to panic, that "the ocean will take care of this on its own if it was left alone and was left out there. It's natural." And to prove his point, Limbaugh pointed to the restoration of Alaska's Prince William Sound, which was devastated by an oil spill from the Exxon Valdez 21 years ago. "They were wiping off the rocks with Dawn dishwater detergent and paper towels and so forth," Limbaugh said on his April 29, 2010, radio show. "The place is pristine now." Government officials involved in the cleanup say the conditions are long way from being pristine, which is defined as "completely free from dirt or contamination." Despite the beautiful scenery and wildlife in full view in Prince William Sound, a report from the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council released last year on the 20th anniversary of the spill stated, "one of the most stunning revelations of Trustee Council-funded monitoring over the last 10 years is that Exxon Valdez oil persists in the environment and in places, is nearly as toxic as it was the first few weeks after the spill." The Trustee Council, formed by the Alaska government to oversee the restoration of the injured ecosystem, concluded the oil is decreasing at a rate of 0 to 4 percent a year, and "at this rate, the remaining oil will take decades and possibly centuries to disappear entirely." We asked Craig Tillery, deputy attorney general for the state of Alaska, about Limbaugh's comment. Tillery, a who has served as counsel to the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council, said it depends on how you define pristine. "The vast majority of oil that landed in Alaska is gone," he said. But the government dug hundreds of test holes and found pockets of "still fresh-looking oil that is still toxic to the marine environment." In all, they estimated 23,000 gallons (of the 11 million gallons spilled by the Exxon Valdez) remains in isolated pockets of some beaches. "It's buried, you wouldn't see it," said Tillery. "It looks pristine, but it's not pristine if your definition is that there's no oil left." And that oil is still getting into the environment, he said. Sea ducks and sea otters are still exhibiting signs of exposure to oil, he said. And animals such as sea otters, which dig for clams, have released some of the oil trapped under the ground. Most of the wildlife has recovered from the spill, Tillery said, but you also need to consider what you don't see. "You don't see as many killer whales as you did before the spill," he said. "You don't see herrings in the numbers you did before the spill. On the surface, you'd probably say this looks pretty pristine. Underlying that, though, there is still evidence of the spill." "There are beaches where you can turn a shovel and still find oil," said Stan Jones, director of external affairs for the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens Advisory Council. Prince William sound has "mostly recovered visually," Jones said, but to call it pristine is an "overstatement." Dr. Jeffrey Short, who was the leading chemist for the governments of Alaska and the United States following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, led a series of studies on the unexpected persistence of the oil. In a Q & A with the environmental group Oceana, with whom he is now employed, Short stated, "We found that it (oil) lasted a lot longer than we thought in some locations and it was much better preserved than we thought it would be. In some places the oil hadn't degraded much beyond the first couple months after it had spilled." We asked Short about Limbaugh's comment and he said that while it's fair to say most of Prince William Sound has recovered from the impact of the Exxon Valdez, "there are some places where the oil continues to linger." In fact, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council has a link on its website to its "Report on Recent Lingering Oil Studies." "At the time of the spill, most scientists believed that, within a few years, the process of weathering would either break down and decompose the oil, or would cause it to turn into a form of asphalt that would have little potential to release toxic components into the environment," the report states. "Contrary to these expectations, oil persists at some sites in Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska in a relatively unweathered and potentially toxic condition." "Organisms that use the intertidal were severely affected by the spill and continued to show adverse effects from exposure to oil for many years after the spill. These effects manifested themselves in reduced survival rates and diminished populations. In recent years, however, there is evidence of improvement. The extent of oil exposure appears to be diminishing in most species, and there is evidence that the populations of some species are beginning to increase." That sounds encouraging. But it doesn't change the fact that, despite outward appearance, 21 years after the Exxon Valdez spill, Prince William Sound is not pristine. You may not be able to see it, but scientists and anyone willing to turn over rocks with a shovel attest to the fact that thousands of gallons of oil remain buried in some beaches, and the oil continues to adversely affect the environment.

pomt-00481	"Wisconsin's still one of the highest-taxed states in the country."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/10/josh-pade/democratic-candidate-wisconsin-governor-miscalcula/	Josh Pade was a latecomer to the crowded Democratic governor’s race. The Kenosha lawyer has not been a major factor in the polls, or the fundraising tallies. But we were struck by a claim Pade made June 1, 2018, in an interview on WisconsinEye, since it went right to the tax cuts Republican Gov. Scott Walker touts as a major achievement. When asked what he would do about the state’s struggling middle class, Pade referenced his tax background and said as governor he wants to put together a bipartisan group to reform the state’s tax code. He also said this: "Scott Walker touts his tax cuts. Unfortunately Wisconsin’s still one of the highest-taxed states in the country." Is he right about Wisconsin’s tax status? The evidence When we asked Pade’s campaign to provide backup for the statement, spokeswoman Kate Cooney pointed us to a study by Wallethub, a personal finance website, that ranked Wisconsin as 46th in effective tax rate (Number 1 being the lowest). "We do acknowledge that other measurements of taxation have shown a lowered trend over time beginning before Governor Walker took office, but those studies are not as comprehensive in their data sets," said Cooney. "We have also pointed out the tax burden as a percentage of income in Wisconsin is often lower on the most wealthiest income brackets than those with lower income." A spokesman for Walker’s campaign declined to offer any evidence on the issue, so we checked with a variety of experts and other rankings. Since Pade’s statement referred to taxes in general, we’ll start with what experts said about the overall tax burden. Tamarine Cornelius, a research analyst at the Wisconsin Budget Project: She said the state ranks somewhere in the middle when looking at state and local taxes -- 20th when measured on a per-state resident basis in 2015 and 21st when measured as a share of personal income. "Measured either way, state and local taxes in Wisconsin are actually below the national average," she said, noting that when fees are included it drops Wisconsin’s rank even further. "In Wisconsin, residents pay lower fees than residents in many other states," she said. Tax Foundation: A 2018 report from the Tax Foundation, an independent tax policy nonprofit, also shows Wisconsin in the middle of the pack with a rank of 18 for state tax collections per capita for 2016. Richard Auxier, a research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute: "It looks like it’s a stretch to say Wisconsin is one of the highest taxed states in the country," he said. He mentioned the state’s "somewhat progressive" income tax rates, noting the top rate isn’t that high compared to other states; the existence of an Earned Income Tax Credit, though it isn’t as large as some others; and an average, if not low, sales tax rate compared to other states. So, all three put Wisconsin in the middle of the pack, not "one of the highest." Why does the Wallethub study differ? Cornelius said she had concerns with how Wallethub did its analysis. She noted thestate Legislative Fiscal Bureau had determined the amount of property taxes paid on a median-valued house in Wisconsin to be $2,830. Cornelius said the Wallethub study "overestimated property taxes on a median-valued house by 27%." Specific taxes What about Wisconsin’s rank for specific taxes? On property taxes, we contacted senior research analyst Adam Langley from the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a nonprofit focused on economic, social and environmental components of land. He pointed us to a ranking of states by property tax collection as a percentage of personal income from the Tax Policy Center’s State and Local Data Query Systembased on a survey of state and local governments. Wisconsin ranked 12th at 3.7 percent. He also pointed to an analysis his group did using U.S. Census Bureau data. That analysis examined the median property tax bill as a percentage of the median household income for homeowners for 2015. Wisconsin ranked eighth at 4.6 percent. "Property taxes are definitely higher in most New England states, New Jersey and Illinois than they are in Wisconsin," Langley said, "Depending on the specific measure of property taxes used for the comparison, there are several more states that also have higher property taxes than Wisconsin." On income taxes, Auxier called Wisconsin’s income taxes "somewhat progressive" and referenced the state Department of Revenue’s tax rates and an Urban Institute summary of U.S. Census Bureau data. Auxier said Wisconsin’s four brackets, with a top rate on income above $329,810 for married filers, are relatively progressive because half the states that have an income tax have one flat rate or a threshold for their top rate on income below $40,000, which is "essentially flat." Auxier said the most important thing to keep in mind when thinking about state taxes is different people pay different taxes. This is why statements saying one state is the highest-taxed are not that simple. He referenced an Urban Institute study he co-authored that estimated what each state’s revenue would look like with a tax system based on national average tax rates. Results showed "Wisconsin’s actual taxes raise about as much revenue as it would with the average system," Auxier said. Our rating Pade said "Wisconsin's still one of the highest-taxed states in the country." The study his campaign provided as evidence was from an organization that does not specialize in tax analysis and experts we spoke with were skeptical of how the study was done. In any case, the statement was too broad to be accurate. Specific taxes may rank higher than others, and the rankings might vary for different income groups. But the claim was about taxes in general. And, in general, the state is now more middle of the pack. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-04457	Says Romney wants to "take away early childhood education, slash K-12 funding, and cut college aid … to pay for a $250,000 tax break for multi-millionaires."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/10/priorities-usa-action/super-pac-says-romney-takes-education-gives-millio/	A new super PAC ad accuses Mitt Romney of pushing deep cuts in education to finance a tax cut for the wealthy. The ad from Priorities USA Action, which supports President Barack Obama, shows images of children playing, along with these words: "Take away his toys, and he’ll play with a stick. Take away their bikes, and they’ll still find a way to get where they’re going. But if you take away early childhood education, slash K-12 funding and cut college aid for middle class families, they won’t go far. Yet that’s exactly what Mitt Romney wants to do to pay for a $250,000 tax break for multi-millionaires." The kicker: "If Mitt Romney wins, the middle class loses." A spokesman for Priorities USA told us that the claims about education refer to the budget proposed by Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan. We’ll check whether the ad is accurate about the budget’s impact on education and if those changes are things Romney "wants to do" in order to fund a tax cut. The Ryan budget Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin, first presented his budget in 2011. Versions of it have passed the House each of the last two years, but it has never passed the Democratic-controlled Senate. The 2013 proposal cuts $5.3 trillion from the federal ledger over the next decade by enacting major changes in entitlement programs and making steep reductions in discretionary domestic spending. It’s important to keep in mind that Ryan’s plan doesn’t say which programs would be cut or by how much, nor does it dictate that programs be cut across the board. On early childhood education: Nowhere in the Ryan budget is there a line item cutting Head Start funding, or any other program. But because the budget reduces federal spending so drastically -- from its current level of 12.5 percent of GDP down to 5.75 percent by 2030 -- experts say deep program cuts will be necessary. The numbers alone have early education advocates nervous. One analysis by the National Education Association determined that Ryan’s proposed 2013 budget could eliminate spots in Head Start programs for about 191,000 children in 2014, and 2 million over the next decade. Head Start uses federal funds to provide education, nutrition and parent-involvement services to help low-income kids be school ready by age 5. Romney’s campaign website does not mention early education. We would note that during his time as governor of Massachusetts, Romney vetoed a bill that had passed the legislature authorizing universal prekindergarten in the state. On K-12 funding: the ad points to a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. The study notes that a cut of 22 percent in 2014 of non-discretionary spending, plus more in subsequent years, "would force states and localities to reduce the quality and reach of their basic public systems — their schools, clean water facilities, and law enforcement activities, for example — or raise new revenue or cut other programs to continue meeting these needs. Either way, the result would be a huge cost shift from the federal government to states and localities." Again, as this study points out, these cuts are speculative. It would be state and local governments deciding on the cuts, not the federal government. On college aid for the middle class: This charge stems from a study by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute, attempting to calculate the effects of Romney’s tax proposal. The proposal lacks detail but sets some broad outlines, including allowing the American Opportunity tax credit for higher education, which was part of the 2009 stimulus bill, to expire. According to the study, Romney’s economic advisers say that the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) would revert back to the Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally (HOPE) tax credit, which also provides aid to college students but is less generous and covers fewer Americans than the AOTC. In addition, Romney and Ryan have been criticized for what could happen to federal Pell Grants in Ryan’s budget. The program provides the largest source of grant funding for needy college students, with more than 9.7 million students expected to get grants worth up to $5,635 per student in 2013, according to the Education Department. Republicans say in documents accompanying the budget that they favor reining in the Pell program, by keeping the maximum grant award in 2013 at this year's level of $5,550, and other means. The House Budget Committee says it would stay at $5,550 for the full 10 years of the budget, though that’s not spelled out in the budget resolution itself. In fact, the budget resolution says nothing at all about Pell grants. Romney’s stance So where does Romney stand on the Ryan budget? That answer is something of a moving target. In March 2012, Romney said in Chicago, "I’m very supportive of the Ryan budget plan. The following week, while campaigning in Wisconsin, he added, "I think it’d be marvelous if the Senate were to pick up Paul Ryan’s budget and adopt it and pass it along to the President." More recently, since Ryan joined the ticket, Romney has said the two agree broadly. "I’m sure there are places that my budget is different than his, but we’re on the same page," he said in August. The campaign has also emphasized the Romney will put together his own plan. But on his website, Romney makes this promise about "stopping the bleeding" of federal spending: "Pass the House Republican Budget proposal, rolling back President Obama’s government expansion by capping non-security discretionary spending below 2008 levels." Regarding the specific charges in the ad, the Romney campaign points to remarks he has made on the trail. On early childhood education and K-12 funding: "I'm not going to cut education funding. I don't have any plan to cut education funding and grants that go to people going to college. I'm planning on continuing to grow, so I'm not planning on making changes there," Romney said in his Oct. 3 debate with Obama. On college aid: "We’re going to continue a Pell Grant program. … I think the Republican budget called for a Pell Grants being capped out at their current high level. My inclination would be to have them go with the rate of inflation," he said at a Univision Forum in Miami on Sept. 19. About those multi-millionaires Finally, the Priorities USA ad says Romney will make all these education cuts "to pay for a $250,000 tax break for multi-millionaires." The dollar figure also comes from the Tax Policy Center study. The authors found that under Romney’s proposal, people with $1 million or more in annual cash income will receive an average tax cut of $250,535. Those in the millionaire category will receive an 11.8 percent increase in after-tax income, easily the highest of any income group. Collectively, the tax savings for millionaires would amount to nearly one-third of all the tax benefits that result from Romney’s plan. But is the accounting really that simple? There’s not a direct link between spending cuts and tax rates for the wealthy, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. They’re separate policy areas, and legislation affecting each area would typically be handled separately. Nevertheless, choices about spending and taxes are not entirely unrelated, given the imbalance in the federal budget in recent years and the significant debt that is building up, MacGuineas said. We asked her in general about the various Democratic claims saying that specific spending cuts "pay for" tax breaks for the wealthy. "It’s a huge fight over priorities and semantics," she said. "But it’s difficult to say that one is linked to the other." Our ruling Priorities USA Action said Romney wants to pay for a tax cut for multimillionaires by taking away early childhood education, slashing K-12 funding, and cutting college aid for middle class families. Each charge is an interpretation of how the House budget, proposed by Ryan and somewhat embraced by Romney, could impact education at all levels. The warnings are plausible given the scale of spending cuts called for in Ryan’s budget, but they’re speculative -- these cuts aren’t specified in the Ryan budget, and Romney has said his policies would be different. Finally, spending cuts and tax breaks aren’t a one-to-one comparison, though they do reflect priorities. The ad’s claim contains an element of truth but takes liberties as it tries to fill in the blanks in Romney's plan. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-12150	"Bill Clinton gave North Korea $5 billion and two nuclear reactors in 1994, essentially giving them nukes."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/09/viral-image/viral-image-wrongly-blames-bill-clinton-giving-nor/	A viral meme spreading through Twitter blames former President Bill Clinton for not just allowing North Korea to develop nuclear weapons, but fostering their program more than two decades ago. "Bill Clinton gave North Korea $5 billion and two nuclear reactors in 1994, essentially giving them nukes," read the meme we first noticed on Aug. 9, 2017. It included an image that showed Clinton seated next to late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. It’s worth noting that the photograph is actually from Aug. 4, 2009, when Clinton traveled to Pyongyang to negotiate the release of two American journalists. Kim Jong Il died two years later. HELP KEEP POLITIFACT GOING! MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO SUPPORT INDEPENDENT FACT-CHECKING The meme popped up after revelations that Kim Jong Un’s regime had potentially developed miniaturized nuclear devices capable of fitting inside intercontinental ballistic missiles. The center of this claim — that Clinton negotiated a deal with North Korea that included two reactors — is based on a real agreement. But there are significant problems with the assertion that Clinton paid the country $5 billion, "essentially giving them nukes." The Agreed Framework While president, Clinton did broker a deal with North Korea, amid revelations that the country was building a full-scale processing facility to produce plutonium. North Korea had kicked international inspectors out of the country in 1993, announcing its intention to pull out of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, an international agreement North Korea had joined in 1985. By then, the North Koreans had separated enough plutonium from spent fuel from a reactor it had built while Clinton was governor of Arkansas to create a couple of nuclear weapons, according to Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. In October 1994, Clinton arranged a deal with incoming leader Kim Jong Il, whose father Kim Il Sung had died in July. North Korea would have to take its current reactor offline and stop construction of two other reactors they said were for electricity. In exchange, the United States would help the country build two so-called light-water nuclear reactors to produce power for the country. The light-water reactors would make it harder for North Korea to produce weapons-grade material. Those reactors were estimated to cost about $4 billion, and would be financed by South Korea, Japan, and possibly Germany, Russia and the United States, the Washington Post reported. In addition, the United States would help provide heavy fuel oil to North Korea, which would have to halt plans to produce nuclear weapons and submit to international inspections. It would have to surrender spent nuclear fuel once the new reactors were built. The deal, which did not require congressional approval, was referred to as the Agreed Framework. Clinton hailed it as a path to easing sanctions and normalizing diplomatic relations. "This agreement will help achieve a longstanding and vital American objective — an end to the threat of nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula," Clinton said of the deal. End of the deal Spoiler: The Agreed Framework failed. North Korea accelerated its efforts to enrich uranium, which wasn’t a direct violation of the framework, and accused the United States of reneging on fuel oil promises. That certainly irked the George W. Bush administration, which cut off fuel oil shipments in 2002. North Korea withdrew from the agreement, ending its obligation to abide by the deal’s terms. By 2006, North Korea claimed it had successfully tested a nuclear device. To say that Clinton’s deal was the culprit is wrong, however. Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, said that while the Agreed Framework was flawed, it impeded North Korea’s ambitions. The meme misrepresented much about the deal. "This is a problem that is years in the making, owned by bipartisan administrations, and — for a time, anyway — delayed by President Clinton rather than him giving North Korea nuclear weapons," Nephew said. Importantly, Clinton didn’t give North Korea two reactors, because the construction was never completed. You can even look up the unfinished sites online. And the $5 billion figure the viral image cited wasn’t cash, but likely included the construction costs of the reactors (which were never completed) and energy aid. The Congressional Research Service noted in a 2014 report that the United States provided more than $400 million in heavy fuel oil to North Korea between 1995 and 2003. The consortium created to oversee the reactors’ construction, the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, still exists on paper. It officially ended the light-water reactor project, but is still working "to settle financial and legal obligations stemming from the termination." "All the North Koreans got out of it in the end is that they stole the construction equipment" for the reactors, Pollack said. "They also learned a few things about building that type of reactor. They’ve tried to make a small initial one themselves, but it appears to have been stalled for years now." In the meantime, Pollack added, the North Koreans have created enough plutonium and enriched enough uranium to create as many as 60 nuclear bombs. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling An image circulating on the Internet claims "Bill Clinton gave North Korea $5 billion and two nuclear reactors in 1994, essentially giving them nukes." Clinton did negotiate a deal in 1994 to provide two nuclear reactors and provide heavy fuel oil to North Korea in exchange for the country giving up its nuclear weapons program. That's about where the truth of this image stops. The energy aid costs didn’t approach anywhere near $5 billion, and the reactors were never built. North Korea had continued to enrich uranium on its own, leading the Bush administration to end the deal. The agreement, while a failure, didn’t give North Korea nuclear weapons. Experts said the agreement actually slowed North Korea down. We rate this statement False.

pomt-05576	"I think it’s seven or eight of the California system of universities don’t even teach an American history course. It’s not even available to be taught."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/03/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-american-history-not-available-/	Rick Santorum might want to read more closely next time. On the stump in Wisconsin on April 2, 2012, the Republican presidential candidate filled in his audience on something he was "just reading … last night." "I think it’s seven or eight of the California system of universities don’t even teach an American history course. It’s not even available to be taught," he said. "Just to tell you how bad it's gotten in this country, where we're trying to disconnect the American people from the roots of who we are, so they have an understanding of what America should be." Soon the progressive news site Think Progress posted a video clip, along with some skepticism, triggering links around the Web. Readers asked us: Was Santorum right? Do that many state universities in California fail to offer American history courses? ‘The California system of universities’ California has a two-tiered university system, with 23 campuses in the California State University system and 10 University of California campuses. All 23 CSU campuses offer courses on U.S. History, the Constitution and American ideals, said Erik Fallis, media relations manager for the California State University — indeed, almost every student needs such a class (or two) to graduate. The story is slightly different at the University of California, which also has an American history and institutions requirement. The graduation requirement can be satisfied with a high school class, except at UC Santa Barbara, which requires a college-level course. Does that mean the campuses don’t offer American history courses? Not at all. Of the nine University of California campuses that offer humanities classes — the San Francisco campus focuses exclusively on health sciences — all nine offer American history. Do those classes get to "the roots of who we are," as Santorum said? Well, among the offerings at UC Davis is "The American Revolution, 1763-1790." UC Riverside teaches upper-division courses on "Revolutionary America" and "The Early Republic: The United States, 1789-1848." UC Santa Cruz includes a course on the "U.S. Revolution: 1740-1815." UC Berkeley addresses, "The United States from Settlement to Civil War." UCLA has "History of the U.S. and Its Colonial Origins: 19th Century" and "Constitutional History of U.S.: Origins and Development of Constitutionalism in U.S." Bottom line, of 33 state universities in California, just one, a health sciences campus, doesn’t teach American history — and nearly all graduates have to complete a related course to graduate, whether in high school or college. What was Santorum talking about? Santorum’s reading We contacted Santorum’s campaign to ask for support for his claim but didn’t hear back. So we tried tracing his reading material ourselves. Eric Dolan, an editor for progressive news site Raw Story, noted that Santorum appeared to be making a reference to a recent opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, "How California's Colleges Indoctrinate Students." The March 30, 2012, column by Hoover Institution fellow Peter Berkowitz argues that higher education is politicized and declining in quality as its curriculum changes. He notes: "None of the nine general campuses in the UC system requires students to study the history and institutions of the United States. None requires students to study Western civilization, and on seven of the nine UC campuses, including Berkeley, a survey course in Western civilization is not even offered." Berkowitz is right that most University of California campuses don’t require a college-level course, with the exception of Santa Barbara — though they do require at least a high-school level class. We didn’t check on class offerings in Western civilization, since that’s not what Santorum said. Berkowitz also cites a recent report, called "A Crisis of Competence," from the National Association of Scholars, where he’s on the board of directors. It mentions that "the vast majority of our colleges have made a course on the broad themes of U.S. history or government optional." Then it points out a laudable exception: The California State University system. "All but three of the more than twenty campuses of the CSU system require American History and Institutions as an essential part of their curricula. But the situation in UC is very different: not a single UC campus has such a requirement. … To be sure, UC requires a year of U.S. history in high school for undergraduate admissions, but University of California level instruction ought to be on a completely different level – why otherwise would students need to go on to a university at all if high school coursework is equivalent?" Santorum went much further than either Berkowitz or the National Association of Scholars report, declaring that at seven or eight universities in the California system, they "don’t even teach an American history course." There’s simply no support for that claim. Our ruling Rick Santorum said, "I think it’s seven or eight of the California system of universities don’t even teach an American history course. It’s not even available to be taught." While he appeared to be referencing a recent Wall Street Journal opinion piece, he bungled the details — and badly. Far from "not available," American history courses are offered at all but one of 33 state universities in California. We rate his statement False.

pomt-08076	The Milwaukee business community "did not speak about the facts" -- and in support of train manufacturer Talgo -- as the Milwaukee-Madison rail link was being killed.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/20/talgo-inc/talgo-says-milwaukee-business-community-did-not-sp/	Nearly two years ago, Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle made a quiet trip to Spain to look into high speed rail. During that jaunt -- announced the day he departed -- Doyle visited train maker Talgo Inc. Talgo had been seeking business in Wisconsin, and Doyle’s visit was another step in the courting dance between the Spanish firm and state and local officials, a relationship that turned into a sour one in December 2010. Not long after Doyle’s visit, Talgo won a $43.1 million no-bid contract to build two trains for Amtrak service between Milwaukee and Chicago. Local officials had hoped Talgo would share work with local firm Super Steel, but Talgo rejected that idea. Milwaukee later offered Talgo incentives to open its own factory at a portion of the old Tower Automotive site on the city’s north side. Talgo also received an option for two more trains as part of $810 million in federal funds for a planned high-speed route from Milwaukee to Madison. The firm was in the process of hiring 125 people to build the trains when the project hit the wall. Virtually all of that federal money was withdrawn Dec. 9 and sent to other states after Governor-elect Scott Walker held fast to his opposition to the Milwaukee-Madison link. And the finger-pointing began. Well, make that, continued. Talgo issued a statement from Nora Friend, the company’s vice president for public affairs and business development, that included this comment directed at the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce: "Talgo is also disappointed that the business community did not speak about the facts on this project." She added: "Talgo was encouraged by the business community to move to Wisconsin, and they were silent about the very same facts that made this project the only one in the nation that qualified to be fully funded by the federal government." So, did the influential MMAC really sit idle while a new employer was, in essence, sent packing? Even after, in late November, Talgo pleaded publicly pleaded that it speak out on behalf of the train project? We talked with MMAC president Tim Sheehy, one of the most plugged in business and political figures in the state. The high speed train situation, he said, was one of the most contentious matters he has grappled with in the 17 years he’s led the group. Sheehy took the unusual step of surveying his membership about high speed rail and posted the results online. "It was huge and it was hot," he said of the response. About 40 percent of MMAC members responded, and about 200 included comments with their vote. The key question: "Do you support creation of a high speed rail line between Milwaukee and Madison as part of a proposed Midwest rail network connecting Chicago to the Twin Cities?" The answer was a 50-50 split: 214 members for and the same number against. Said Sheehy: "When you have a membership split so dramatically and so evenly on an issue you don’t have anything to lobby for." The MMAC previously had supported the Milwaukee-Madison connection, along with the new trains and other upgrades for the service to Chicago. Sheehy said he went "line by line" through the application for the $810 million to tease out items that his members would agree upon. "We wanted to see if there was a way to keep half of the money," for existing rail service, he said, adding: "Why throw out the baby with the bathwater?" Sheehy’s efforts to find middle ground failed, in part because the positions of Walker and the federal Department of Transportation were so rigid. Five weeks after the Nov. 2 election, the feds said they would yank the money from Wisconsin. One day later Talgo said it would pull out the manufacturing jobs after the work was done. Some 60 maintenance jobs will remain. "Quite frankly, the door closed pretty fast here," Sheehy said. Sheehy included this statement with the survey results, which were posted after the state lost the train money: "We are disappointed the administration took an ‘all or nothing’ approach to these funds. While our survey reflected clear disagreement on the passenger rail spur to Madison, there was considerable support for individual components of the proposal that would have upgraded existing passenger and freight rail capacity." Friend said Talgo felt the MMAC survey "did not do justice or reflect benefits of rail development." She said Talgo thought the MMAC "would be a neutral educational resource and could speak factually about pros and cons of different infrastructure projects and help disseminate accurate information for people who naturally don't appreciate rail because they are not privileged to know that industry or its benefits." "A simple return on investment analysis could prove that a $810 million project shows a very positive return even if the state had to invest $7.5 million a year over 20 years." Talgo is not a MMAC member, but Sheehy said that had no bearing on the group’s handling of the issue. So where does that leave us? The state lost $810 million in federal funds, Talgo’s train manufacturing jobs and the area’s leading business group and political leaders have a black eye for wooing and then freezing out an international business. Some of Talgo’s ire was directed toward the MMAC, for not speaking out on its behalf. The organization said its hands were tied by a split membership. We rate the statement True.	None	Talgo Inc.

pomt-07591	On his support for sharply limiting collective bargaining by public employees.	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/25/jeff-stone/collective-bargaining-stones-votes-were-consistent/	State Rep. Jeff Stone’s path to keeping the Milwaukee County executive’s job in Republican hands became a bumpy one when massive protests greeted Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to sharply curtail collective bargaining rights for public employees. Stone supported Walker’s move in two Assembly votes, but his comments in between those votes drew criticism from opponent Chris Abele, who said Stone, R-Greendale, was trying to have it both ways. That means it’s time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter, which measures whether politicians have changed their position on key issues. Here’s our standard disclaimer: We’re not evaluating whether it was good or bad policy -- or politics -- to shift, just to what degree a shift occurred. Let’s start back in February. At a Feb. 11, 2011, news conference in Madison, Stone joined a small group who stood with Walker as the governor unveiled his budget-repair bill. The plan included the collective bargaining changes imposed new pension and health care contributions on workers. On Feb. 22, 2011, amid the Capitol protests, Stone argued against changes in Walker’s budget-repair bill, which he termed a difficult but reasonable step to solving deficits of $130 million in the budget year that ends June 30, 2011, and more than $3 billion for the next two years. "I don't think we can solve this problem by going part way with this bill," he said in lengthy remarks during the Assembly floor debate. He backed his words with his votes: Stone voted against dozens of Democratic amendments during the long debate on the bill, including ones that would have preserved the current collective bargaining setup. So, no change in position there. Ten days later, wearing his other hat as a candidate to succeed Walker as Milwaukee County executive, Stone took a different tack. He told a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter he would have taken a different approach to the budget than limiting collective bargaining and signaled he would have supported the budget bill without the provisions. "I understand it's a major issue to the unions," Stone said in the story. "It's not necessarily the way I would have drafted this budget-repair bill. I would have approached it in different ways." "Those weren’t elements that had to be included for me to support this bill," Stone said, according to the reporter’s notes. "I didn’t think they were necessary for me to make the (pension and health) changes in Milwaukee County." Stone, the Journal Sentinel story reported, emphasized that he felt the other provisions in the measure made the repair bill worth supporting. So Stone had voted against amendments that would have kept the bargaining rights intact -- but said soon after that he would have been willing to support a version that kept the bargaining rights intact. Was he doing one thing and saying another? It was those remarks that touched off partisan charges of double-speak and flip-flopping. They also drew some skeptical attention from a conservative Walker campaign supporter who backs the governor’s plans regarding unions. WTMJ-AM (620) talk show host Charlie Sykes asked Stone during his March 8, 2011, show to explain his position in light of his remarks to the newspaper. "I’m confused," Sykes told candidate Stone. Stone said he was "confused" about the story but did not suggest it was wrong. He said he was trying to draw a contrast between his views and those of Walker. He repeated his position that there were things he "might have approached differently" on bargaining. But moments later he tacked again, offering an unequivocal defense of Walker’s plan. "I support what’s in the bill," Stone said. "I support what Gov. Walker has proposed. I support the requirements there as far as the votes that are in the bill." On the same day, Stone’s office tried to remove all doubt, quoting Stone in a news release as saying: "My position on collective bargaining for public employees is this; the current practice needs to be ended." The Assembly gave the bill final passage on March 10 -- a scaled-down version that nevertheless kept intact all the collective bargaining restrictions. We turned to Stone to explain his shifting statements. He did not challenge that he told the Journal Sentinel he would have excluded the bargaining limits. He acknowledged that people could read into his remarks that he was against the move. Stone said he erred when he said that he would have written the bill differently. He said he underestimated the size of the state’s budget challenge, saying it became clear when Walker came out with his two-year budget for 2011-’13, which is separate from the short-term budget-repair bill. "I didn’t understand the budget situation," including how deep the cuts would be if the bargaining changes were not made, Stone said. But Walker’s budget was introduced two days before Stone made his remarks to the newspaper. "I never flipped on the bill," Stone said. "I voted for it both times." Stone’s right on that. But he has offered clearly inconsistent statements on his feelings on the most controversial aspect of the bill, appearing to want it both ways and changing rhetorical course several times. On the Flip-O-Meter, here is the definition for a Half Flip: "A partial change of position or inconsistent statements." That’s what fits here.

pomt-04722	Says that when Democrats controlled Congress and the White House, federal spending as a share of the Gross Domestic Product leapt from 18.2 percent in 2001 to 25.2 percent in 2009 -- the largest such increase in any eight-year period since World War II.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/aug/31/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-says-when-democrats-controlled-congres/	U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, recently declared an "inconvenient factoid" about Democrats and spending. Cornyn’s Aug. 21, 2012, Facebook post says next that "when Ds controlled Congress and WH: federal spending as a share of GDP leapt from 18.2 percent in 2001 to 25.2 percent in 2009 (this was the largest such increase in ANY 8 year period since WWII)." That is, Cornyn says, federal spending in comparison to the nation’s economic production, or Gross Domestic Product, spiked. Asked how the senator reached his conclusion, his spokesman, Scott Gosnell, pointed us to a chart in a report by the Office of Management and Budget, the budget-policy arm of the executive branch. And according to the chart, federal outlays were equivalent to 18.2 percent of the GDP in 2001 and 25.2 percent of the GDP in 2009, as Cornyn says. Such spending dipped to 24.1 percent of the GDP in 2010 and 2011, according to the chart, which appears on a White House web page in connection with President Barack Obama’s proposed budget for the 2013 fiscal year. And was the 39 percent increase over that period the greatest since World War II? Seems so. Federal outlays were equal to 9.8 percent of the GDP in 1940. They were 43.6 percent of the GDP in 1943 and 1944, the chart says, or more than quadruple the 1940 ratio.. From 1947 through 1974, by our calculation, the ratio averaged 18 percent. It was 20 percent to nearly 24 percent each year from 1975 through 1997, dropping to 18.5 percent in 1999. In other words, we did not spot any eight-year post-WW II spikes bigger than the one underscored by Cornyn. Then again, we noticed, federal spending as a share of GDP averaged 20 percent over his cited years, not much greater than in previous years. Also, in two years, 2004 and 2007, federal spending compared with the GDP was slightly down from the previous year. Next, we looked into whether Democrats controlled Congress and the White House over the cited years, as Cornyn says. Not exactly. A Democrat, Bill Clinton, was president for about four months at the start of the 2001 fiscal year. But George W. Bush, a Republican, was president from Jan. 20, 2001, until Obama, a Democrat, was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2009. Obama accounts for a little more than eight months of the cited years. And did Democrats rule Congress over those years? Occasionally, though Republicans were dominant for longer spells. As we noted in an earlier fact check, the GOP controlled the House from 1995 through 2006, while Democrats controlled the House from 2007 through 2010, as detailed on a House web page. According to a Senate web page, Republicans were the upper chamber’s majority party in 2000 through early June 2001 and again from Nov. 12, 2002, through 2006. Democrats have comprised the majority since 2007. So, a Republican was president for all but one of the cited years and Republicans held the House majority for six of the nine years and a Senate majority for about four years and seven months of the nine years -- with Democrats holding the Senate majority for four years and five months. Still, Democrats held House and Senate majorities from 2007 through 2010 -- and Obama was president for 2009 and 2010. Over this more limited time period, the ratio of spending to the GDP escalated from nearly 21 percent to 25.2 percent before dropping to 24.1 percent. We asked Cornyn’s office about the mixed-bag dominance of Democrats in his cited period. Gosnell replied by email that Cornyn "was making the point that out of the 8-point increase in outlays between 2001-2009, the majority of that increase (5.5 points) occurred in just three years – 2007-2009 – the same three years the Democrats controlled both chambers and then the WH in 2009. The point is: the huge jump in outlays occurred with D’s in charge." That’s an interesting focus, yet not what Cornyn wrote on Facebook. The theme of Gosnell’s reply, that the brunt of the spending-to-GDP uptick occurred when Democrats were dominant, was explored in a June 4, 2012, article by our colleagues at FactCheck.org, headlined: "Obama’s Spending: ‘Inferno’ or Not?" That article says the one-year 19 percent spending surge in fiscal 2009 "was mostly due to appropriations and policies that were already in place when Obama took office" in January 2009, the fourth month of the fiscal year. Obama’s spending initiatives, the story says, increased that year’s spending by up to $203 billion, or well under half the year’s overall increase, which was caused in part by bank bailout legislation approved by President Bush. The FactCheck.org article mentions a May 24, 2012, analysis in Forbes by Daniel J. Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, giving responsibility for even less of the 2009 increase to Obama. Generally, Mitchell concluded that since President Lyndon Johnson’s tenure, George W. Bush shakes out, like Johnson and Richard Nixon, a "relatively profligate" president. We asked Mitchell about Cornyn’s recent statement blaming Democrats for the spending-to-GDP increase. Mitchell replied by email that while most of the key spending increases occurred after Democrats won control of Congress in the 2006 elections, the bumps also had Bush’s approval, "so both parties deserve blame." Finally, the story by FactCheck.org says that the health care overhaul Obama signed into law in 2010 calls for a new spending wave, starting in 2014, to subsidize coverage for millions of Americans who would otherwise lack it -- adding an estimated $110 billion to federal outlays in fiscal 2015, and more in later years. Significantly, too, the story says, government revenue receipts are running well below historical averages. "It is the combination of historically high spending and low revenues that is producing the current string of trillion-dollar annual deficits, and piling up debt," FactCheck.org said. "Those who blame deficits solely on spending ignore the other side of the ledger." Our ruling Cornyn said that when Democrats controlled Congress and the White House, federal spending as a share of the GDP leapt from 18.2 percent in 2001 to 25.2 percent in 2009 -- the largest such increase in any eight-year period since World War II. Those percentages and the claim to a post-war record are correct. However, Democrats were in control of Congress solely in the last few years of the period and held the presidency for only eight of the 108 cited months. All told, Cornyn’s claim has the math right but errs significantly by laying all the blame on Democrats. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14436	"Almost every poll has shown that Sanders vs. Trump does a lot better than Clinton vs. Trump … and, that’s true nationally."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/08/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-he-consistently-beats-donald-t/	To potential supporters who worry about his viability as a general-election candidate, Bernie Sanders has often pointed to polls showing him doing better against Republican frontrunner Donald Trump than Sanders’ Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Sanders repeated this point during the Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., on March 6. "I would love to run against Donald Trump, and I’ll tell you why," Sanders said. "For a start, … not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders vs. Trump does a lot better than Clinton vs. Trump. … And, that’s true nationally." We decided to take a closer look at the national polling data and to check with polling experts to see whether head-to-head polls at this stage of the campaign are reliable. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER Using the RealClearPolitics.com poll archive, we found seven national surveys since Jan. 1 that tested both Clinton and Sanders against Trump in a general-election contest. Here’s the rundown. For each poll, the candidate who runs stronger against Trump is listed in bold. Poll and date Clinton vs. Trump result Sanders vs. Trump result CNN/ORC, 2/24-2/27 Clinton +6 Sanders +12 Fox News, 2/15-2/17 Clinton +5 Sanders +15 Quinnipiac, 2/10-2/15 Clinton +1 Sanders +6 USA Today/Suffolk, 2/11-2/15 Trump +2 Trump +1 Public Policy Polling, 2/2-2/3 Clinton +7 Sanders +4 Quinnipiac, 2/2, 2/4 Clinton +5 Sanders +10 NBC-Wall St. Journal, 1/9-1/13 Clinton +10 Sanders +15 The chart shows that Sanders has a point. Of the seven polls in 2016 that tested both Democratic candidates, Sanders ran stronger against Trump in six of them. (In one case, the USA Today/Suffolk poll, Trump beat both, but beat Sanders by slightly less.) Case closed? Not quite, say polling experts. Clinton has been scrutinized and attacked as a public figure for a quarter century, but Sanders is a relatively new figure to voters nationally. So while a lot of voters’ minds are already made up about Clinton based on her long history in the public eye, it remains to be seen how open potential voters will be to supporting Sanders once Republicans start airing negative attacks, especially ones that note his identification as a democratic socialist. (We have previously reported that, according to polls, being a socialist is a less attractive quality for voters than being an atheist.) "Very few Americans are making these comparisons yet, so opinion about these choices is likely to be weakly held, particularly for a large number of middle-of-the-road, independent, and disinterested Americans who are not participating in primaries and caucuses," said Steven S. Smith, a Washington University political scientist and a specialist in public opinion. Smith added that early polls do not weed out "likely voters," as polls later in the campaign do. This could matter, given Sanders’ high rates of support among college students and younger voters, who have not yet demonstrated a long track record of voting. "If Sanders draws disproportionately from people who are not likely to vote, which is a reasonable speculation at this point, then his support may be somewhat overstated in some comparisons," Smith said. (He added that the same high level of first-time or irregular voters applies to Trump, but this should be less of a factor for Clinton, whose supporters skew older and more experienced than Sanders’ do.) Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the American Enterprise Institute, agreed that "national polls don’t have a great deal of predictive value this early in the campaign." She pointed to research by Harry Enten, a polling analyst at the website fivethirtyeight.com. Enten found that since 1944, general election polls about a year before Election Day "have only been weakly predictive of the eventual result." He found that polls pitting the eventual Democratic and Republican nominees were, on average, off by more than 10 points from the eventual result. To cite just one example, Enten wrote that "if you trusted the polls in late 1991, you might have thought Bill Clinton was finished in the 1992 presidential election. George H.W. Bush was ahead of Clinton by 21 percentage points at the time; Bush was basking in sky-high approval ratings after the first Gulf War. But as the Gulf War triumph faded and the economy became the focus of the campaign, Clinton would gain in the polls and eventually overtake Bush." Our ruling Sanders said that "almost every poll has shown that Sanders vs. Trump does a lot better than Clinton vs. Trump … and, that’s true nationally." On the numbers, Sanders is right. He runs stronger against Trump than Clinton in six of the seven national head-to-head polls since Jan. 1. However, polling experts say such results should be taken with a grain of salt, since polls taken well before the start of the general-election contest have historically not been very accurate predictors of the November results. The statement is accurate but needs additional context, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-01332	"95 percent of job creators say Wisconsin is headed in the right direction."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/24/republican-state-leadership-committee/nearly-all-wisconsin-job-creators-say-state-going-/	The Republican State Leadership Committee, a Washington, D.C.-based group that works to elect GOP lieutenant governors and other "down-ballot" state officials, is new to PolitiFact. And it is newly making an eye-popping claim -- albeit one quite similar to a claim we rated more than a year and a half ago. In a Wisconsin radio ad released Oct. 9, 2014, the GOP group promotes the campaign of Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, who is running on the ticket with Gov. Scott Walker in the Nov. 4, 2014 election. They face Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke and her running mate, state Sen. John Lehman of Racine. The ad makes a number of boasts about the Walker-Kleefisch administration, including this one: "95 percent of job creators say Wisconsin is headed in the right direction." That's decidedly favorable; but, the way the group states it, also misleading. Previous claim Walker made a similar claim in February 2012, saying 94 percent of Wisconsin employers think the state "is heading in the right direction" and a majority say they will "grow their companies in 2012." We rated his statement Half True. Both numbers were correct. But they came from a small survey by the pro-Walker Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce of some of its members. The December 2011 survey of 281 chief executive officers amounted to a sample that is not reflective of the overall makeup of businesses in the state. For example, a majority of the survey respondents were manufacturing executives, but manufacturing establishments are just 6 percent of Wisconsin’s businesses. Walker, however, presented the statistics without noting the critical limitations. New survey WMC does its survey every other year. The latest one was conducted in November and December of 2013. This time, 95 percent of 341 CEOs said the state was going in the right direction. And that's the survey the national GOP group relies on in making its claim. But that claim has the same problems as the one Walker made. Our rating The Republican State Leadership Committee said: "95 percent of job creators say Wisconsin is headed in the right direction." The number is correct, but it comes from a small survey by one trade group and amounts to a sample that is not reflective of the overall makeup of state businesses. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-12734	"We've repealed regulations for the first time in 20 years using the Congressional Review Act -- three regulations that were going to cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/02/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-repealing-3-regulations-saved-milli/	With a powerful Republican ally in the White House, Sen. Rand Paul said Congress is moving fast to reduce the burden of government regulations. On ABC’s This Week on Feb. 19, Paul, R-Ky., held up the deregulatory action taken by Congress as an example of the administration’s earliest weeks not being as chaotic as they may have seemed. "We repealed regulations for the first time in 20 years using the Congressional Review Act," Paul added. "Three regulations that were going to cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs." We decided to review Paul’s claim about whether the moves saved money and jobs. His statement hinges on analyses by the government and industry advocates, but they also occasionally contradict his point. The rules Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can disapprove a rule by a simple majority vote, and then the president must sign off. Trump signed one disapproval on Feb. 14, which rejected a provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. The rule required publicly traded mining, oil and gas companies to disclose their payments to governments. Another, signed Feb. 16, nullified the Stream Protection Rule, a rule created by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (within the Department of the Interior) to limit coal mining companies from releasing waste into waterways. Opponents of the rule said that it would reduce jobs in an already-contracting industry. Proponents said it would help keep ecosystems free of the toxic waste. The third disapproval, which Trump signed on Feb. 28 after Paul’s interview, concerned some provisions of the 2007 National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Intended to stop the mentally ill from obtaining guns, the rule required the Social Security Administration to share information about beneficiaries who do not manage their own benefits to the national background check system. Expected financial toll Paul’s claim that these regulations could cost "hundreds of millions of dollars" is reasonable, said Brian Mannix, a research professor at the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center. He said many federal rules can cost much more than that, though it is difficult to say without a detailed analysis. We found some reports on the effects of the financial and environmental regulations. We did not, however, find a government report assessing costs or job impact for the rule on guns. The SEC estimated that 425 companies might be affected by the new financial disclosure regulation, with average total assets of $6.4 billion. The SEC also set compliance costs for the companies at $54.7 million to upwards of $700 million (the variation is due to variations in fixed costs), though they acknowledged "significant limitations" on their analysis that might have made it much lower. As for the cost of the Stream Protection Rule, the report prepared for the Office of Surface Mining and Enforcement’s estimated total U.S. compliance costs at $81.5 million (or 0.3 percent of estimated total annual revenue for the coal industry). That figure includes $63.6 million for operational costs, which includes commercial transport and reforestation. The government’s potential tax revenue loss to states was $995,000. Paul’s spokesman Sergio Gor sent us a study by Ranboll Environ that was prepared for the National Mining Association, a private group with public opposition to the rule. The study estimates the potential annual value of coal lost to production restriction is between $14 billion and $29 billion, with between $3.1 billion to $6.4 billion lost in state and federal tax revenue. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement declined to comment on the record. Expected jobs impact The question of whether these regulations would save "tens of thousands" of jobs is more complex. On the disclosure rule, the SEC report did not comment on potential job increases or losses. And again, there is no estimate for jobs lost as a result of reduced reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. As for the Stream Protection Rule, an impact analysis prepared for the Office of Surface Mining in November 2016 said the rule "would reduce employment by 124 jobs on average each year due to decreased coal mining," though the regulation might add 280 jobs in compliance efforts. The Ramboll Environ report stated that the Stream Protection Rule threatened 113,000 to 280,000 American mining jobs based on what it said was an independent analysis performed at 36 mines across the country. An expert said the government’s estimates are "much more reasonable" than the one completed for the mining association. "My take based on the available research is that the impact of the rule would be minimal," said Robert Godby, the director of the University of Wyoming Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy, said about the Stream Protection Rule. He said he thought that the NMA study conflated the potential effects of the Stream Protection Rule with other regulations enacted in 2009, and that the study didn’t account for other market factors that have caused larger downward trends in coal production. Our ruling Paul said that repealing three rules will save "hundreds of millions of dollars" and "tens of thousands of jobs." Studies of the regulations partially back up Paul’s claim, particularly in terms of financial burden. The evidence is less strong for his point about "tens of thousands" of jobs lost. The only information we could find for a regulation with a job-killing aspect is the stream protection rule. The government’s estimate said the rule could result in 124 lost mining positions a year (though compliance could result in the creation of more than twice as many). An industry-backed study offered a much more dramatic outlook for lost coal jobs, but one expert questioned its methodology. We rate this claim Half True. Correction: The Stream Protection Rule came from the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, which is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Interior. An earlier version of this story incorrectly characterized the source of the rule. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2017-03-02T17:38:04	2017-03-02	['None']
pomt-11709	"Law passed: All child support in the United States will end by beginning of 2018."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/19/tmzbreaking/no-trump-and-congress-didnt-pass-bill-ending-child/	Child support is coming to an end in the United States thanks to President Donald Trump and Congress, at least that's what a fake news story on Facebook would have you believe. "Law passed: All child support in the United States will end by beginning of 2018," stated the headline on tmzbreaking, a website that describes itself as "the most notorious fauxtire & satire entertainment website in the world." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake article has been circulating at least for a few months on Facebook. The end of the article directs readers to Channel50news, a prank website. The dateline on the story says Sept. 20, 2016, but when we read the oldest comments at the bottom of the story, they started on Sept. 20, 2017. Another hint that this is fake news is that the three-paragraph article has typos or sentences that make no sense: "President Trump claims he will no longer for any party of parent to pay child support. Trump also says that ant reports of abuse or negligence to a child from either party will result in the child automatically being turned over to the State Child Welfare." While this fake story suggests that the federal government is wiping out child support, it’s worth noting that states set child support policies and have enforcement programs. We emailed the authors of the website and did not get a reply. A story stated that a law will end all child support in the United States in 2018, but no such law has been passed.

pomt-00410	"While Richard Cordray was Attorney General, 12,000 rape kits like Allyssa's were left untested. Cordray's failure left serial rapists free to strike again. Then Mike DeWine became Attorney General. He tested all 12,000 rape kits. Now hundreds of rapists are behind bars."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2018/aug/30/mike-dewine/fact-checking-mike-dewines-attack-rich-cordray-abo/	Republican Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said he has tested thousands of rape kits that his predecessor Richard Cordray had let languish. "While Richard Cordray was Attorney General, 12,000 rape kits like Allyssa's were left untested. Cordray's failure left serial rapists free to strike again," said DeWine’s TV ad narrated by rape survivor Allyssa Allison. "Then Mike DeWine became Attorney General. He tested all 12,000 rape kits. Now hundreds of rapists are behind bars." DeWine ousted Cordray in 2010. The two men are now facing off for governor. DeWine portrays Cordray as ignoring untested rape kits as they piled up. But the backlog of untested rape kits can’t be blamed mainly on the attorney general; local police departments had a role, too. The ad omits that Cordray started to address the backlog as it drew more attention in the summer of 2010, but he had little time left in office. Cordray’s actions on rape kits "Rape kits" are shorthand for sexual assault forensic evidence kits, which are collected soon after a sexual assault or rape. A nurse or a doctor collects evidence including tissue and hair samples from the victim’s body and clothing, including saliva, blood and semen. The evidence helps law enforcement investigate assaults. The ad said that while Cordray was attorney general, 12,000 rape kits were left untested, but they were not sitting around his office. That number reflects those that were sent in by police departments across the state once DeWine took over. Untested rape kits languishing in police evidence rooms had been a longstanding problem in many states when Cordray became Ohio attorney general in 2009. Some departments didn’t test the kits, citing hassles or cost. The national backlog continues today. During Cordray’s tenure, news coverage by the Cleveland Plain Dealer led to more scrutiny. Here’s what was known about untested kits when Cordray was in office. In July 2010, the Cleveland Police said they had found in their possession more than 6,000 rape kits going back to 1993, some of which had already been tested. The department decided it would start submitting all kits for testing to the state. By mid 2011, Cleveland began submitting untested kits in small batches to the state, according to a timeline written by Case Western Reserve University. While Cordray was attorney general, Ohio -- like much of the country -- had no consistent testing policy. Each law enforcement agency decided whether and how to test rape kits, which could be done at local labs or sent to the state. Cleveland police decided whether to test kits on a case by case basis. The Plain Dealer reported that the state Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation would test every kit Cleveland planned to send, though its preference was for departments to limit their submissions to evidence that officials thought would be most likely to provide leads. (BCI is under the purview of the attorney general.) Cordray in 2010 called for lawmakers, law enforcement officials and victim advocates to study best practices for testing and develop a statewide protocol. In his final months in office, Cordray formed the Ohio Sexual Assault Kit Testing Commission and announced that the state would receive new DNA-testing robots to speed up testing. Cordray then lost to DeWine. In a recent conference call with reporters, Cordray questioned why DeWine took seven years -- until he was in the middle of a campaign -- to clear out the backlog. "What he cannot explain is why it took him seven years to do a job he says I should have done in five months," he said. Cordray counterattacked with his own ad that featured Republican Shelby County Sheriff John Lenhart. The sheriff said that Cordray put the technology in place and "fixed" the backlog that had stretched for decades. That’s misleading -- while Cordray started to address the problem, he didn’t fix it. DeWine’s actions on rape kits DeWine took office in January 2011. A few months later he restarted the rape kit test commission after the Cleveland Heights police department misplaced evidence tied to Anthony Sowell, a serial killer and rapist. The Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote in an editorial in May 2011 that "building on an initiative of his predecessor, Richard Cordray, DeWine says he will stop sending DNA samples to private labs." Instead, the state would handle processing. In December 2011, DeWine announced that police should submit all kits for testing if a crime probably occurred. At the time, about half of sexual assault kits were submitted to the state crime labs. DeWine started a new unit with four forensic scientists to test the old kits and began the push to clear out the backlog in 2012. Six more scientists were added later. Though DeWine deserves credit for tackling the backlog, so does Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty. His office worked with Cleveland police to inventory rape kits, which resulted in identifying thousands of untested rape kits that were submitted to the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation in 2014. The General Assembly played a role, too. In 2014, Gov. John Kasich signed Senate Bill 316 to require law enforcement agencies to forward untested rape kits to the state or other crime labs within one year. In February 2018, DeWine announced that the state had analyzed 13,931 rape kits and had loaded more than 8,600 DNA profiles to a federal database used by law enforcement. (The TV ad cited 12,000 rape kits because it subtracted any rapes that occurred after Cordray left office.) DeWine said that charges had been filed against hundreds of attackers. The Cuyahoga County Prosecutor said that they have convicted 376 defendants between 2013 and 2018 largely based on rapes that occurred between 1993 and 2010, before DeWine took office. The average prison sentence is 11 years. Our ruling DeWine said in a TV ad, "While Richard Cordray was Attorney General, 12,000 rape kits like Allyssa's were left untested. Cordray's failure left serial rapists free to strike again. Then Mike DeWine became Attorney General. He tested all 12,000 rape kits. Now hundreds of rapists are behind bars." The ad leaves out a lot of context when it blames Cordray. First, it omits that Cordray inherited a statewide problem. Cordray started to take steps to address the problem, but didn’t get far before he was ousted by DeWine in November 2010. The ad is on firmer ground when it gives credit to DeWine for his efforts to clear out the backlog. But it omits that it took him several years to do it. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-04139	Taxpayers are "on the hook ... for less than a third" of the proposed new Atlanta Falcons stadium, and those funds are "repaid from money that comes from outsiders."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/04/nathan-deal/deal-makes-premature-claim-falcons-stadium-bid/	The public may be wary, but key elected officials are warming up to the idea of helping the Atlanta Falcons build a new stadium for the low, low price of $1 billion. Taxpayers would help finance a projected $300 million to construct the retractable-roof colossus, but boosters say the burden is smaller than it seems. A cautious Gov. Nathan Deal recently told WSB-TV reporter Lori Geary that the plan could make fiscal sense. "I think that, overall, if we get a new facility that’s upgraded and meets the current demands and needs of the future, then being ‘on the hook,’ so to speak, for less than a third – that is repaid from money that comes from outsiders – I think that’s probably a pretty good deal," the governor said. There’s got to be a catch, right? A stadium can cost more than the price of on-site construction. Off-site roads, bridges and other infrastructure may need upgrades to accommodate crowds. Looks like it’s time for the Truth-O-Meter. If the Falcons get their wish, the 20-year-old Georgia Dome would be razed in favor of a facility with luxury suites and other features that could boost the team’s bottom line. Skeptical taxpayers stand in their way. The public fully financed the Dome. But in the decades since, voters have soured on helping sports teams build new arenas. Under the current proposal, they would pitch in big time. The facility would be owned by the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which owns the Dome, the Georgia World Congress Center and Centennial Olympic Park. Each year, a portion of the budgets for the Dome and World Congress Center come from a cut of an 8 percent tax on hotel and motel rooms within Atlanta’s city limits and unincorporated Fulton County. The GWCCA would help the Falcons pay for stadium construction with a bond backed by revenue it expects this tax to make over the next 30 years. The projected amount: about $300 million. We emailed Deal spokesman Brian Robinson for more information. He said the governor was speaking about the burden the stadium would put on state funds, and Deal overstated the cost. "In reality, it would come at no cost to STATE taxpayers," Robinson responded. We think viewers may have gotten the impression that Deal was talking about the total burden to taxpayers. The financing the governor mentioned in the interview would be backed by the local hotel/motel tax, not state funds. We’ll take both interpretations into account. This brings us to the first part of our fact check. Are taxpayers "on the hook ... for less than a third" of the stadium’s cost? This appears to be a matter of arithmetic. The $300 million contribution from local motel/hotel taxes is less than one-third of the projected $1 billion construction cost. If this were the only pot of public funds going to the stadium, then this portion of Deal’s claim would be correct. But there’s more to the story. In a "term sheet" approved in December that outlines the deal, both parties agreed that the GWCCA would buy land for the facility. Deal earmarked $15 million from the state budget in 2012 to buy land that could be used for the complex. Land acquisition costs could rise depending on which site planners select. In addition, roads and other infrastructure near the stadium may need hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrades. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said in September that these improvements could push the stadium’s total cost to $1.2 billion. This could push the cost to the public upward of $500 million. The Falcons expect to seek government help. The term sheet says that the GWCCA will cooperate with them "in pursuing other possible governmental funding sources with respect to such offsite infrastructure as may be required." Reed floated the possibility of using an additional $53 million in city economic development dollars. WXIA-TV recently reported that the stadium could receive millions of dollars in tax breaks from the state through an economic development program for projects of "regional significance." And furthermore, state money that the Georgia Department of Transportation gives local governments for road maintenance could be available, state DOT spokeswoman Jill Goldberg said. The project may be eligible for federal funds, too. Goldberg stressed, though, that no plans have been made, and the project may need no state money. Robinson told PolitiFact Georgia that he did not "foresee" state DOT money being used, but there are no set plans. "There’s too many unknowns at this juncture," Robinson said in an email. "There’s no deal at this time." Let’s move on to the second part of Deal’s claim. Will the public’s share of the cost really be paid for by "outsiders"? Not entirely. As we mentioned earlier, the GWCCA would use state funds to buy the site, and state, local and federal funds could be used for infrastructure. But the majority of the projected $300 million in hotel/motel taxes for stadium construction would be paid by outsiders. Some 86 percent of those who stay in hotels in unincorporated Fulton and the city of Atlanta are from out of state, Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau spokeswoman Lauren Jarrell said. Our ruling: Regardless of how you interpret Deal’s claim, it fell short. Yes, a large portion of the public’s contribution would come from local hotel/motel taxes, and these are overwhelmingly paid by "outsiders." But the state will buy land for the stadium, could chip in to help with hundreds of millions in infrastructure costs, and could provide substantial tax breaks. The total share for taxpayers could easily exceed $300 million. Deal’s claim is premature. And it leaves out important details. The governor gets a Half True.

pomt-12982	Say Bill Gates is linked to HPV vaccine related deaths in India.	pants on fire!	/global-news/statements/2016/dec/20/blog-posting/anti-vaccination-blog-revives-debunked-hpv-story/	The post on an anti-vaccination website was damning. The headline "Bill Gates uses 30,000 Indian girls as guinea pigs to test cancer vaccine," appeared on the Organic & Healthy blog in October and is still being shared. The article described a 2009 human papillomavirus vaccination demonstration project in India. In the span of about a year, thousands of girls between the ages of 10 and 14 received one of two vaccines to prevent genital warts that are linked to cancer later in life. According to the blog, the project went terribly wrong. In one Indian state, "some of the girls’ health deteriorated and five of them died the next year," the article said. In a second state, "two deaths were reported." One of our readers saw the blog post and asked us to check it out. We did and as with many false claims, it takes a thread of fact and weaves a blanket of misinformation. We specifically looked at whether the vaccinations led to any deaths. First, a little background on human papillomavirus, or HPV. HPV causes genital warts and cervical precancers that can lead to a variety of cancers. In the United States for example, HPV is responsible for over 30,000 cancers each year. Several vaccines to prevent the warts and precancers came on the market in 2006. Since then, about 200 million doses have been administered worldwide. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for the most common virus strains, the vaccines "provide close to 100 percent protection against cervical precancers and genital warts." So, what happened in India? In 2007, the Indian government’s Council of Medical Research and two state governments laid the groundwork for a project to see whether these vaccines could be delivered cost-effectively in lower income communities. An international nonprofit PATH was directly responsible for the work. The vaccinations began in 2009 and by March 2010, they had vaccinated about 24,000 girls between the ages of 10 and 14. The effort was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and in addition to India, it took place in Peru, Uganda and Vietnam. The trouble began when local newspapers reported several deaths linked to the vaccinations. In October 2009, a coalition of community organizations and health activists called for a halt to the project. Their cries grew more insistent. In an April 2007 letter to the Minister of Health, in addition to the deaths, they said over 120 girls had suffered everything from mood swings to epileptic seizures. The government agreed to stop. No deaths The government commissioned a group of physicians and researchers to investigate whether the vaccination program caused any deaths. In February 2011, the group reported there was no connection. One girl drowned. Insecticide poisoning killed two others. Two others had severe malaria. One was bitten by a poisonous snake and one died from a disease that physicians said "can not be linked possibly to HPV." No reputable study has ever tied the vaccine to a death. The vaccines can have side effects, including fever, headache, fainting and nausea. But according to many studies cited by the CDC, these pass quickly. Not guinea pigs The article paints a picture of global pharmaceutical companies experimenting on unsuspecting young, poor girls. In fact, the vaccines have gone through years of testing and have become commonplace in the wealthiest nations. Australia provides it to every girl and boy between 12 and 13 years old in public school. Vaccinations are routine in France, Germany and Holland. The vaccines are on the market in over 100 countries and the World Health Organization recommends it as part of the national immunization program for any nation that can afford it. A problem of process A 2010 article in the British medical journal Lancet assessed what went wrong in India. Its basic conclusion? Officials were too slow to respond when local concerns first emerged. "Reluctance by public health authorities to respond to issues of public distrust for fear that they will exacerbate the problem is dangerous," the authors wrote. The repercussions lasted for some time. In 2013, an Indian parliamentary panel chastised PATH, the international nonprofit, along with its Indian partners for failing to fully inform the parents of the girls of what they were doing and not having a system in place to track any side effects. Our ruling An anti-vaccination blog tied Bill Gates to the deaths of several girls who were part of an HPV vaccination roll out in India. A full medical investigation determined that the girls died from causes completely unrelated to the vaccine. Some were poisoned by insecticide, malaria took others, and one drowned. Many millions of young girls and boys have received the vaccine over the years and while there are some common side effects, they are mild. The blog post is a mash-up of outdated rumors that were disproven years ago. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-06801	When Standard & Poor's "dropped our credit rating, what they said is, we don't have an ability to repay our debt. ... I was proved right in my position" that the debt ceiling should not have been raised.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/12/michele-bachmann/bachmann-said-standard-poors-downgrade-proved-she-/	If you made a list of House Republicans who were the biggest opponents of raising the debt ceiling, Michele Bachmann would be near the top. Bachmann, R-Minn., and a Republican candidate for president, said consistently that she would not vote for an increase in the debt ceiling -- the legal limit on how much money the government can borrow -- regardless of the terms of the deal. She repeated her opposition at a Republican debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, when asked if she was concerned about the United States defaulting and not paying its debts. "If you had your way, the debt ceiling would not have been raised," said Susan Ferrechio, a debate moderator. "What do you say to analysts who insist that Americans' investments, their 401(k)s, their college funds would have been far worse off today?" "I think we just heard from Standard & Poor's," Bachmann said. "When they dropped our credit rating, what they said is, we don't have an ability to repay our debt. That's what the final word was from them. I was proved right in my position. We should not have raised the debt ceiling. And instead, we should have cut government spending, which was not done. And then we needed to get our spending priorities in order." Is that what Standard & Poor's said? And did the report support her position that the debt ceiling should not have been raised? Her statement was a disputed point in the post-debate analysis, so we decided to check it out for ourselves. (We should also note that her claim that the deal did not cut government spending is questionable at best. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that the deal would cut "at least $2.1 trillion" between 2012 and 2021.) A little background: Standard & Poor's is a New York-based ratings agency that studies the financial markets. It issues guidance to investors and rates various investments for financial risk. On Aug. 5, it downgraded its credit rating for the United States one notch, from the top-rated AAA to AA+. (The other two ratings agencies, Moody's and Fitch, did not lower the U.S. rating.) The Obama administration strongly objected to the ratings downgrade and disputed Standard & Poor's analysis. Others criticized the company for its performance in previous years, when it gave high ratings to mortgage securities that subsequently proved worthless. The downgrade didn't seem to have much effect on investors' desire to hold U.S. Treasury bonds and other securities, which are still widely perceived as safe investments. Bachmann said that when Standard & Poor's dropped the rating, "what they said is, we don't have an ability to repay our debt" and she said it supported her position that the ceiling should not have been raised and that spending should have simply been cut. Bachmann also opposed any type of tax increases, including closing loopholes, which Democrats supported. To fact-check Bachmann, we read Standard & Poor's original report on why it issued its downgrade. To put it in simple terms, Standard & Poor's had two main reasons for the downgrade: First, that the size of the U.S. debt is very large and growing, and second, that politicians seem unable to agree on what steps to take to reduce it. It called the political process "contentious and fitful," and said the firm was "pessimistic" that the White House and Congress would be able to agree on measures to significantly reduce the debt anytime soon. "The political brinksmanship of recent months highlights what we see as America's governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed. The statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy," the report said. The report does not say that the debt ceiling should not have been raised. If anything, there's an unstated assumption that increasing the debt ceiling was necessary. "The statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy," the report said. And in an interview on Fox News, Standard & Poors' managing director John Chambers seemed to express disapproval that it took so long for Congress to raise the debt ceiling. He said President Barack Obama "characterized the political system as dysfunctional, I think that's a good word. We got to a position where we were within 10 hours of having a major cash flow problem. This is not what happens in other countries," Chambers said on Aug. 8. Another official with Standard & Poor's, director Joydeep Mukherji, told POLITICO that the stability of American political institutions were undermined by the fact that "people in the political arena were even talking about a potential default." He didn't mention who those people were. "That a country even has such voices, albeit a minority, is something notable," he added. "This kind of rhetoric is not common amongst AAA sovereigns." As to which political party was in the right, the ratings agency did not explicitly tip its hand. The report said it took no position on whether taxes should be raised or spending should be cut. In the Fox News interview, Chambers was asked if the tea party movement was responsible for the downgrade as Democrats alleged. He declined to take the bait and assign blame. "I think that there's lots of blame to go around, and what we need to come to in the United States is a way of forging consensus, so that we can take the tough choices that lie ahead, because the fiscal situation in the United States is not sustainable," he said. Bachmann said that when Standard & Poor's "dropped our credit rating, what they said is, we don't have an ability to repay our debt. That's what the final word was from them. I was proved right in my position. I was proved right in my position." In fact, because the debt ceiling was raised, the United States is paying its debts. What Standard & Poor's actually said was that politicians in Washington can't agree on long-term solutions for how to reduce the debt -- not that the country is or was unable to pay its debts. The notion that the report supported her position is wishful thinking. For that, we rate her statement False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-08-12T18:27:11	2011-08-11	['None']

pomt-11335	A recent stomach virus outbreak at the beleaguered Quincy Veterans’ Home shows Gov. Bruce Rauner "is letting persistent health issues jeopardize the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/apr/10/jb-pritzker/facts-bug-new-pritzker-attack-line-quincy-veterans/	Gov. Bruce Rauner has faced a barrage of criticism for his administration’s response to deadly outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease at the state’s Quincy Veterans’ Home, which since 2015 have claimed the lives of 13 residents and sickened dozens of others. Now, Rauner’s re-election rival, Democrat J.B. Pritzker, is taking another Quincy-related swing at the governor following disclosure in late March by the Illinois Department of Public Health that 24 individuals at the state-run facility had been sickened by what appeared to be norovirus, a gastrointestinal illness that sometimes causes severe vomiting and diarrhea. "After fatally mismanaging the Quincy Veterans’ Home, @BruceRauner is letting persistent health issues jeopardize the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes," Pritzker said in a March 30 tweet. "This is a shameful display of failed leadership." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Pritzker tweet linked to an article in the Chicago Sun-Times about the stomach bug sweeping through the Quincy facility. The article also included other tweets from Democratic state lawmakers pinning the norovirus outbreak on Rauner. Rauner, a Republican, has been the target of bipartisan criticism for his administration’s handling of Legionnaires’ at Quincy after problems were brought to light by a WBEZ investigation last December. The Chicago public radio station raised questions about how patients were treated upon falling ill and revealed officials delayed informing the public after the disease surfaced. Critics have also blasted the Rauner administration for its delay in executing a long-term solution for eradicating the disease at the facility. But is the recent emergence of an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness at the Quincy home really an example of more of the same? And is there anything Rauner could have done, or should be doing, to prevent or mitigate the impact of the severe stomach bug residents have come down with at the home? Hand to mouth State health officials suspect norovirus is the culprit behind the latest outbreak at the home in downstate Quincy. The virus, which results in acute gastroenteritis, is the most common cause of diarrhea and vomiting both in the United States and globally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most stricken recover within days, although the illness can pose serious threats to those with compromised immune systems, with the majority of deaths occurring among the elderly. As a viral infection, no antibiotic can treat it. Individuals catch Legionnaires’ disease, on the other hand, by inhaling bacteria that thrives in poorly maintained water systems — something government management and oversight can control. The disease, which produces a severe form of pneumonia, requires treatment with antibiotics. The state health department reported on March 30 that 24 individuals, including both residents and staff, had fallen ill with stomach symptoms at the the veterans’ home, but said none of the cases were serious and that the patients were recovering. But this is general election campaign season, and both the Pritzker and Rauner camps are gearing up for a cutthroat and costly fight in which facts and nuance often take a back seat to any opportunity to raise doubt about an opponent. In that climate, stark distinctions between Legionnaires’ and norovirus can get kicked to the curb. Norovirus afflicts some 20 million people in the U.S. annually, unlike Legionnaires’, which resulted in 6,000 cases being reported to the CDC in 2015. The viral infection is spread through close contact with an infected person or by consuming food or water contaminated by an infected person, according to the CDC. It takes exposure to just a small amount of particles from an infected individual’s stools or vomit to spread the bug. That means enclosed places like nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, such as those at Quincy, as well as schools and cruise ships, are particularly vulnerable. Long-term care facilities play host to the virus more than any other location. They account for between two-thirds and three-quarters of the more than 1,000 norovirus outbreaks that occur annually nationwide, according to Dr. Benjamin Lopman, a professor at Emory University who worked as an epidemiologist with the CDC for seven years. Since 2014, Illinois has experienced 870 norovirus outbreaks, with 540 of them occurring in settings for the elderly such as Quincy, according to data from the Illinois Department of Public Health. "Noroviruses are exclusively human pathogens," Lopman said, explaining that makes the goal to stop transmission from person to person by isolating those who’ve developed symptoms. But because norovirus can also contaminate the environments where people get sick, with particles landing on surfaces that others may later touch, vigilant handwashing is also a must. Beyond that, the response of a care facility is limited. We asked Lopman what, if anything, management at a facility for seniors such as Quincy could do in the way of front-end prevention. "That is very difficult because … it’s very common in the community," he said. "It’s hard to stop someone coming in," between visitors who don’t appear symptomatic and new patient intakes. So we asked the Pritzker campaign to explain how the norovirus outbreak at Quincy could be construed as a blot on Rauner’s leadership. A spokesman for Pritzker responded with an emailed statement that avoided the question and dwelled on the Legionnaires’ issue. "The fact is, Rauner let the Legionnaires’ crisis spiral out of control in Quincy and is now leaving the same residents and staff to contend with both Legionnaires’ and new diseases as he fails to put forward a permanent solution that keeps veterans safe," the Pritzker campaign statement read. A follow-up query to Pritzker spokeswoman Galia Slayen shed no more light on the original question. "We think our statement is pretty clear in that he has failed to do anything to address health crises at the Quincy Veterans’ Home," Slayen said. Our ruling Pritzker’s March 30 tweet held out a recent norovirus outbreak that sickened two dozen individuals at a state-run veterans’ facility in Quincy as evidence of how Rauner had been "letting persistent health issues jeopardize the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes." Rauner has been under fire for his administration’s handling of deadly outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease at the facility. Yet unlike Legionnaires’, which is contracted by inhaling water vapor contaminated with the bacteria, the stomach bug state health officials suspect caused the latest Quincy health problems is spread from person to person, rendering a case for structural mismanagement something of a stretch. Norovirus spreads most frequently in closed environments like nursing homes and assisted living facilities such as Quincy. There is no specific cure for it, meaning the response from care providers is largely limited to isolating patients, casting doubt on what Rauner or his administration could have done to prevent or eliminate it. Asked how Rauner bears blame for the gastroenteritis outbreak, Pritzker’s campaign did not directly respond, instead attempting to characterize it as further evidence after the Legionnaires’ problems at Quincy that the Republican should not be trusted to handle any health issue at the state facility. That conflates two very different epidemiological challenges, and leaves an impression--disputed by experts--that more could have, and should have, been done to stop the spread of norovirus at Quincy. For that, we rate Pritzker’s claim as Mostly False.	None	JB Pritzker	None	None	None	2018-04-10T07:00:00	2018-03-30	['None']

pomt-10339	Obama "voted against funding our troops."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/21/john-mccain/mccain-cites-one-protest-vote/	An ad for Sen. John McCain makes the case that Sen. Barack Obama is a foreign policy lightweight who has voted against funding for troops. "Barack Obama never held a single Senate hearing on Afghanistan," an announcer states. "He hasn't been to Iraq in years. He voted against funding our troops — positions that helped him win his nomination. Now Obama is changing to help himself become president. John McCain has always supported our troops and the surge that's working." See our story for details about the ad's other claims. Here we'll look at Obama's votes on troop funding. The McCain campaign supported its claim that Obama voted against troop funding by citing a May 2007 Senate vote. The campaign is correct that Obama voted against a bill to fund troops, which passed anyway. Obama's vote came after Democrats had sought unsuccessfully to attach a timetable for withdrawing troops. After that language was removed, Obama and several other senators decided to vote against the measure, saying they could not rubber-stamp an open-ended occupation. (See our previous coverage of this issue .) "This country is united in our support for our troops, but we also owe them a plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war," Obama said at the time. "Gov. (Mitt) Romney and Sen. McCain clearly believe the course we are on in Iraq is working, but I do not." The vote came when the primary contest for both the Democratic and Republican nominations was wide open, seven months before the first primaries. Obama and fellow candidates Chris Dodd and Hillary Clinton voted against the bill; Republicans at the time said the vote showed the three failed to support the troops. Clinton, then the Democratic front-runner, was asked whether the vote would prove troubling later, an idea she dismissed. In 2008, Obama voted for a troop funding bill that passed overwhelmingly, 92-6. McCain was absent. Obama's campaign responded to the attack by pointing to Obama's support for bills that would increase benefits to veterans. McCain opposed the bills because he believed the new benefits would encourage active military to leave the service prematurely. The McCain campaign is correct that Obama voted against the 2007 funding measure. But the ad's statement — "he voted against funding our troops" — is phrased with no qualifications or caveats. Actually, Obama has voted for troop funding several times in other measures. So we find the claim in the McCain ad to be Half True.

pomt-07596	"Most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/24/lawrence-odonnell/msnbcs-lawrence-odonnell-most-americans-live-withi/	On MSNBC's Last Word on March 22, 2011, host Lawrence O'Donnell argued that evacuation plans for nuclear power plants in the United States are an unrealistic "fantasy" due to the huge population concentrations around them. That's especially the case, he said, if there were a call to evacuate a 50-mile radius -- the distance the U.S. government recently urged Americans to evacuate around an earthquake-damaged Japanese nuclear power plant. "The truth is, most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant," O'Donnell said. O'Donnell and his guest, Daniel Aldrich, author of Site Fights, used the example of the Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York. A 50-mile radius around that plant alone includes almost all of New York City, and large chunks of northern New Jersey -- more than 8 million people. Aldrich said evacuating a 50-mile radius around the Indian Point plant would cause a "tremendous amount of confusion and chaos as people locally flee and try to preserve themselves." Said O'Donnell: "There is no real evacuation plan from a place like Indian Point." The nuclear disaster in Japan naturally causes people to consider how a similar disaster might play out In the United States. So we were curious about O'Donnell's claim that most Americans live within 50 miles of a power plant. We turned first to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees emergency response plans in the event of a nuclear accident. The website includes a map of all the nuclear power reactors in operation in the U.S., so you can see how far away you live from one. According to a Federal Emergency Management Agency analysis using 2000 census data, there were 184 million people who lived within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant in the U.S., the NRC reported. According to the U.S. Census, there were 281 million people living in the U.S. in 2000. So by our math, about 65 percent of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant. "They typically build power plants where there are large populations," said Patricia Milligan, senior technical advisor for emergency preparation and response at the NRC. "Populations need power. They kind of go hand-in-hand." You could put power plants out in the middle of South Dakota, she said, but then the expense to transport the energy would be very high. So O'Donnell's statistic was accurate. But Milligan takes issue with O'Donnell's conclusion that evacuation plans are unrealistic. The decision for the 50-mile evacuation in Japan was based on several unique factors, she said. First, she said, "the communication coming out of Japan was confusing and contradictory." In addition, she said, you had three reactors with significant core damage, and two spent fuel pools "appeared to be significantly compromised." She's "completely confident" the complicating factors that led to the 50-mile evacuation recommendation in Japan wouldn't happen in the U.S. The NRC has "extremely good communication with the licensees." They also have an electronic reporting system, so they get the same information as the power plant operators in live-time. "We're in a much better position to access and evaluate information," she said. Emergency evacuation plans in the U.S. focus on 10-mile zones. Most accidents would not trigger an emergency response outside that 10-mile radius, Milligan said. But states and power plant operators are required to make emergency response plans for areas within 50 miles as well, including such things as protection of the food supply. While it's true that most Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant, those percentages drop off markedly when you consider 10- or 20-mile zones. According to FEMA data, about 8 percent of the American population lives within 20 miles of a nuclear power plant; and about 1.7 percent lives within 10 miles. In other words, while power plants are usually located near large population centers, "they tend to put them in the outer suburbs," Milligan said. Evacuations are an integral part of the emergency response plan, Milligan said. The NRC has done extensive study of emergency evacuations (for everything from floods to wildfires to gas leaks), and the agency is convinced they are feasible and realistic. "Evacuations do save lives," Milligan said. "They happen all the time in the United States, and they work well." But back to O'Donnell's statistic.

pomt-08260	As mayor, Barrett led efforts to redevelop the Menomonee Valley, "which now supports nearly 4,000 jobs in Wisconsin."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/11/tom-barrett/tom-barrett-says-he-helped-create-4000-jobs-menomo/	Once the industrial heart of the state of Wisconsin, over the decades the Menomonee Valley gradually deteriorated into a high profile eyesore. Polluted, smelly, and ugly ... all were used to describe the stretch of land from roughly the 6th Street viaduct to what is now Miller Park. Though hundreds of people worked there -- at the stockyards, gear manufacturer Falk Corp., railroad switching yards and other industries -- the area was best known for acre upon acre of brownfields. Local historian John Gurda noted the economic importance of the valley but said "its persistent pollution problems and the generalized ugliness of much of its development made the district a civic embarrassment to some Milwaukeeans." Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett put a different spin on it during his unsuccessful campaign for governor against Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, saying under his leadership the city had turned the area into a job-creating machine. In a video, Barrett compared the jobs created in the valley to the lack of development on county-owned land in the Park East freeway corridor, claiming: "Tom Barrett redeveloped the Menomonee Valley, which now supports nearly 4,000 jobs in Wisconsin." The election is over, but we were still wondering about that claim. Without a doubt, the recession cost the Milwaukee area thousands of jobs. The state Department of Workforce Development says metro area employment is 798,400, down about 65,000 jobs from December 2007, when the recession began. But this claim relates to a different time frame -- since Barrett took office -- and a specific area. So was the city able to add thousands of jobs in the valley? In an word: yes. But the work didn’t start with Barrett, who took office in 2004. There have been several master plans cooked up for the valley over the decades until the current onetook effect in 1998. As far back as 1977, Mayor Henry Maier saw the valley’s potential, saying: "The Menomonee Valley redevelopment project is probably the largest industrial revitalization project in the country, and I am determined that it will also be the best." Maier’s successor , Mayor John O. Norquist, spent years fighting for control of a key piece of valley property -- 134 acres held by CMC Heartland Partners, the parent company of the old Milwaukee Road railroad. The city finally wrested control of that site in 2003 for $6.8 million. That move in particular cleared the way for a city-owned Menomonee Valley Industrial Center. Additionally, moves under Norquist -- such as bringing the 6th Steet Viaduct down to the valley level -- improved access. The bridge previously stretched across the valley. What did Barrett do since taking office? According to Rocky Marcoux, head of the Department of City Development, the city has spent some $48 million in public improvements -- cleaning polluted "brownfields," site preparation and so forth -- and created seven tax incremental financing districts. It also spent $25 million to extend Canal St., which runs down the center of the valley, so it links up with the freeway at Miller Park. That’s important because it gives another easy way for traffic to reach businesses there. Marcoux said the city can offer business owners lots that compare with suburban industrial parks: "We can offer them land at market rates. We don’t have to induce them." A quick tally of the major additions to the valley on Barrett’s watch: Recreation-related: The Harley-Davidson Museum, Iron Horse Hotel, and Potawatomi Casino expansion. Combined, 1,332 jobs. Industrial park: From the first industrial park tenant, pizza maker Palermo Villa Inc., which has grown from 180 to about 500 jobs, to the most recent addition, windmill generator-maker Ingeteam. Combined 1,156 jobs. Others: An assortment of jobs retained (Cargill) and new ones (such as Zimmerman Design Group, Proven Direct). Combined: 1,671 jobs. That tallies out to 4,159 jobs, a figure deemed accurate by Laura Bray, executive director of the Menomonee Valley Partners, a nonprofit group established to promote business development in the area. It also corresponds with coverage in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel by commercial real estate reporter Tom Daykin. In all, about 10,000 people work in the valley -- a figure Bray called a rough estimate because there has not been a recent detailed study of total employment. And some 26 companies have moved or expanded in the valley, according to the Menomonee Valley Partners. In some cases, expansion hasn’t gone according to plan. For instance, Harley originally expected to build an office complex with nearly 400 jobs near its museum, but those plans have been on hold since the economy tanked. Nevertheless, there is plenty to look at in assessing Barrett’s claim. As a former candidate for governor, and current civic cheerleader, Mayor Tom Barrett boasts of creating thousands of jobs in the Menomonee Valley. While overall jobs in the city are down, and Barrett came into office with some key assets put in place by his predecessors, our tally puts new jobs in the valley since 2004 at more than 4,000.

pomt-11378	Many March for Our Lives speakers called for "the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government."	pants on fire!	/north-carolina/statements/2018/mar/29/beverly-boswell/nc-republican-march-our-lives-speakers-said-they-w/	Maddie King, who survived a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida that left 17 people dead, called on politicians to care more about their children than their guns. David Hogg, a Stoneman Douglas student and frequent whipping boy of gun rights advocates, said politicians should get their resumes ready. Another Stoneman Douglas student, Cameron Kasky, warned politicians who oppose stricter gun laws. "Either represent the people or get out. Stand for us or beware: The voters are coming," Kasky said. Thousands of Americans gathered in streets around the United States on March 24 to honor victims of gun violence and, generally speaking, to advocate for stricter gun laws. According to a North Carolina legislator, some March For Our Lives speakers also called for a far more nefarious approach. State Rep. Beverly Boswell, a Republican from the coast, suggested on her Facebook page that speakers at the marches expressed violent intentions. "Many of the speakers at these rallies were calling for gun registration, confiscation, Second Amendment repeal and even the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government," Boswell wrote on her campaign Facebook page. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Murder? That seems harsh. Boswell, who’s in her first term representing House DIstrict 6, has been an open critic of efforts to toughen gun laws. She recently referred to students who participated in the national school walkout as "Tide pod" eaters and boasted on Facebook about confronting a school leader who held an assembly on that day — which he says was simply to honor the victims of Parkland shooting. She was also recently scolded by the North Carolina Board of Nursing for misrepresenting herself as a nurse. Boswell’s comments about March For Our Lives were part of a side conversation on her Facebook page after she posted a photo of some students with the caption, "They’re out to take your guns, and our freedoms," at 8:10 p.m. on March 26. On March 27, she posted the comments about the march speakers after someone suggested Boswell’s original post was a "scare tactic" meant to distract people from the message of the march. What the ‘march’ wants The March For Our Lives website doesn’t say anything about forcefully taking guns from gun owners, much less harming them. The organization says it wants universal, comprehensive background checks and a digitized, searchable database of guns at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (known as ATF). It also wants bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to research gun violence. March For Our Lives has the support of several large, liberal organizing groups that support gun control. And a survey of the Washington marchers found that protesters there were largely liberal, with 79 percent of those who were randomly surveyed identifying as "left-leaning." But the group doesn’t appear to have ties to groups with a history of advocating violence. PolitiFact recently debunked a claim by the National Rifle Association that the March For Our Lives is "backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions." A story by Variety.com captured some of the marchers’ public disdain for the NRA, but none of the views expressed included calls for violence. "A video during the [Washington] event showed NRA officials, like Wayne LaPierre and Dana Loesch, as well as [the late actor] Charlton Heston, then the president of the organization, saying, ‘From my cold dead hands.’ In the crowd the images drew boos and the bird," Variety reported. In New York City, "Marchers chanted ‘NRA sashay away,’ at the New York rally, holding posters decrying the involvement of the National Rifle Association in government," Variety reported. PolitiFact emailed Boswell and asked if she could provide videos or news clips showing march speakers advocating violence. Luke Stancil, her campaign spokesman, responded by referencing a candidate for sheriff in North Carolina who joked about taking people's guns. Daryl Fisher, a candidate running for sheriff of Buncombe County in western NC, explained his views of people who invite him to pry their gun from their cold, bare hands. Stancil pointed out that Fisher shrugged said, "OK ... Whenever you pass away, we'll come get it." Fisher indeed said those things. But he didn't say them at a March For Our Lives rally. He later apologized. And Boswell said "many" speakers called for the murder of gun owners – and didn't cite any others. So we searched for evidence of violent rhetoric ourselves. What speakers said Alex Jones, a conservative conspiracy theorist who runs InfoWars.com, said on his show that marchers declared they would "kill anyone" who doesn’t turn in their guns. But PolitiFact found no credible evidence of rally speakers calling for violence against gun owners who might refuse to relinquish their guns. Most speakers at the Washington march and other marches across the country spoke about stricter gun laws and warned politicians of forthcoming punishment at the ballot box. Some of those comments, if taken out of context, could be misconstrued as threats. Delaney Tarr, a frequently-interviewed Stoneman Douglas student, said the Washington marchers are "are here to call out every single politician. We will take action where it counts." Those comments were preceded by a specific list of legislative demands that included an assault weapons ban, the "prohibition of high capacity magazines, reinforcement of background checks and closing of loopholes." In that vein, she said: "When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile." Alex Wind, a junior at Stoneman Douglas, used the words "life" and "death" to describe where politicians stand on gun restrictions. "To all the politicians out there, if you take money from the NRA, you have chosen death," Wind said. "If you have not expressed to your constituents a public stance on this issue, you have chosen death. If you do not stand with us by saying we need to pass common sense gun legislation, you have chosen death. And none of the millions of people marching in this country today will stop until they see those against us out of office, because we choose life." D’Angelo McDade, a student from North Lawndale College Prep in Chicago and members of the student non-violence group the Peace Warriors, specifically called for non-violent action. "When will we as a nation understand that we are not here to fight against one another and we are here to fight for life and peace?" McDade said. "Dr. King once said, ‘Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.’ Which now leads me to say that violence cannot drive out violence, only peace can do that." Speakers at marches in Boswell’s home state of North Carolina were similar. Speakers in Raleigh, Durham, Charlotte, Greensboro and Asheville reportedly focused on gun laws and the NRA. Our ruling Boswell said "many speakers" at the March for Our Lives rallies were calling for "the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government." She didn’t provide any evidence to back up her claim, and PolitiFact found no evidence. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-13971	"Never mind that no red light camera, no speed camera, nor any radar gun has ever stopped one accident from occurring."	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jun/14/tom-mccarey/radar-guns-and-cameras-dont-stop-accidents-huh/	Last week in Harrisburg, the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia met with members of the legislature to lobby for what it considers safer streets after the April hit-and-run death of cyclist Jamal Morris. The group wants an extension of the state’s red light camera program, a pilot program for speeding cameras on Roosevelt Boulevard and the use of radar detection by police. Before the meetings in Harrisburg happened, Penn Live published an editorial authored by Tom McCarey criticizing the Bicycle Coalition’s desire to push for radar use, the red light camera program and the speeding camera program. McCarey is a member of the drivers’ advocacy group the National Motorists Association and lives on the Main Line. He wrote, "Never mind that no red light camera, no speed camera, nor any radar gun has ever stopped one accident from occurring." The editorial itself felt a little out of place. A member of one lobbying organization was writing critically about an opposing lobbying organization. But was McCarey’s claim that these types of technology have prevented a single accident from occurring legitimate? The short answer is no. While the exact pros and cons of these technologies are up for debate, multiple studies show they have prevented accidents in numerous cities and certainly at least one accident. McCarey said he got his information from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) statistics and did not respond when asked to provide the specific data. The answer to whether such data to backup his claim exists is also no. "NHTSA has never made this untrue statement at all," said NHTSA spokesman Jose Ucles. "Neither does it agree with it." The organization has released a compendium of 13 studies looking at red light cameras and speed cameras, among other things. The studies the NHTSA regarded as the best showed a 20-to-25 percent reduction in injury crashes at sites with speed cameras. For red light camera studies, which the NHTSA did not regard as highly as the speed camera studies, there were reductions in overall crashes from 9-to-18 percent and 21-to-51 percent for injury crashes. Dominique Lord, a professor at Texas A&M, was commissioned by the Chicago Tribune to study the efficacy of red light cameras installed throughout the city. The study found no significant reduction in crashes at intersections where five or fewer crashes had been occurring annually but at intersections with five or more annual crashes there had been a reduction. It found certain types of injury accidents, such as right angle T-bone crashes, had declined while rear-end injury crashes had increased. "Has it at least saved one crash, a red light camera?" Lord said. "There’s no doubt about that." Lord added red light cameras should only one tool among many that can be utilized to cut down on accidents. "Red light cameras and speed cameras change the behavior of people," he said. "By changing the behavior of people you (decrease) risk." Our ruling Tom McCarey wrote in a Penn Live editorial the technologies being pushed for by the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia -- an extension of the state’s red light camera program, a pilot program for speeding cameras on Roosevelt Boulevard and the use of radar detection by police -- would make highways more dangerous and not stop a cyclist from being hit. At one point, he wrote Never mind that no red light camera, no speed camera, nor any radar gun has ever stopped one accident from occurring." But multiple studies have shown crashes have been reduced in areas where red light cameras and speed cameras are used. Dominique Lord, who completed a study that questioned the efficacy of red light cameras, said the cameras have prevented at least one crash. We rate the claim Pants On Fire.

pomt-02642	"The (New England) Patriots were led by an explosive offense that scored the second most points in the NFL."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jan/17/rhode-island-senate/rhode-island-senate-says-new-england-patriots-rank/	There are plenty of reasons for praising the New England Patriots, a team vying for a Super Bowl berth Sunday when they take on the Denver Broncos. But the Rhode Island Senate may have gone just a bit out of bounds on Jan. 15 when, without dissent, it passed a resolution lauding the team for its accomplishments and wishing them well against the Broncos. The resolution, sponsored by Paul Jabour, D-Providence, and Roger Picard, D-Woonsocket, states that, "The Patriots were led by an explosive offense that scored the second most points in the NFL and a tough and stingy defense." The resolution was read aloud. We won't get into the debate over how tough and stingy New England's defense is, especially during recent games. But the point total claim raised the hackles of one of our sports gurus, who said the Senate had made a rookie mistake. When another reader started raising questions about the Senate resolution on Twitter, we went to the official statistics page at NFL.com. According to the site, New England scored 444 points during the regular season. That put the team in third place, one point behind the Chicago Bears (with 445 points) and the Broncos (with a whopping 606). Third place isn't second place, so the claim seems to be False. But the resolution doesn't specify regular season. If you include postseason play, which purists are loath to do when comparing all the teams in the NFL, New England does rank second. (The Bears didn't make the playoffs.) By that measure, the resolution is correct. Denver has logged 630 points, New England 487 points, and Kansas City 474 points. (If you want to look at the postseason alone, New England ranks fifth out of 12 teams on point totals. San Francisco and San Diego have scored more points, but each team has played two games, while the Patriots have played just one.) In sum, the claim can be accurate, but only if you combine regular-season and postseason play, which means comparing teams that competed in 16 games with those that have played 17 games (or in a few cases, 18 games). That's a sizable caveat. Because the statement needs clarification or additional information to be correct, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-06798	Statistically, law-enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than the general population.	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/aug/14/robert-barber/retired-police-captain-says-law-enforcement-office/	Government pensions and other retirement benefits have provoked bitter debate between public employees, who have planned their retirements on the promise of a pension, and taxpayers who say the increasing costs of the benefits are more than they can afford. Retirement packages for police officers and firefighters often come under scrutiny because, in recognition of the extra stress and physical requirements of the job, they often permit workers to retire earlier. The threat of a pension cut in Cranston prompted Robert Barber, a 58-year-old retired captain in the city's Police Department, to argue that any reduction in benefits would be unfair. "The City of Cranston entered into a contract with me. The agreement was that I would serve my community and risk my life so that, at the end of my career, if I reached it, I would be able to live the rest of my life with some dignity," he wrote in a commentary in The Journal. And, he wrote, that life is not likely to be as long as most retirees’. "Statistically," he said, "law-enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than the general population." We were intrigued by that statistic. Police officers certainly experience a lot of stress in their jobs, but in some cases their level of physical fitness is higher. When we emailed Barber, who retired at age 50, he said he first heard the statistic in a Bryant University psychology class. He directed us to two documents. The first didn’t deal directly with longevity. It was a Reuters Health account of a 2009 study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, which compared 312 Buffalo, N.Y., police officers with 318 residents. Ultrasound showed that the officers tended to have thicker walls in their neck arteries, which might be an early sign of heart disease. The second was a 24-page report from 2002 on "Fitness in Law Enforcement" written by a member of the Pittsfield Township Police Department in Michigan. It promotes more fitness among officers and states, "Solid research has shown the life expectancy, after retirement, of a police officer is much shorter than that of the general population." But no research is cited. We were hoping for some harder evidence. So we went looking for some actuarial data on our own. When we called MetLife, the spokeswoman referred us to the Society of Actuaries. But the society didn't have any data either. "Unfortunately, we do not keep this type of data regarding life expectancy for various careers," spokeswoman Kim McKeown told us in an email. We examined two websites that calculate life expectancy, but they were more interested in income, education, smoking, drinking, exercise and seatbelt habits, and whether a person was in a manual or non-manual occupation. Being a law-enforcement officer wasn't a factor in the calculation. The creator of one of the sites, statistician Dean P. Foster of The Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania pointed us to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that fishermen, loggers, pilots, farmers, roofers and even garbage men face a higher risk of death on the job than police officers. A Google search helped us locate Steven Greenhut, director of the journalism center at the right-leaning Pacific Research Institute in California and author of "Plunder! How Public Employee Unions Are Raiding Treasuries, Controlling Our Lives And Bankrupting The Nation." He sent us a copy of an April 2010 study by the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which covers 1.6 million public employees. It compared life expectancies for male police officers with male workers and retirees who were not in the public safety field. Whether a person was age 50, 55, 60 or 65, the life expectancies of the police officers were slightly higher than for other workers. For example, men age 60 who had taken regular retirement were projected to live to age 82.7, versus age 81.9 for workers who were not in the public safety field. (Firefighter rates were close to those for police officers.) Even when CalPERS added in all the men who had retired as a result of work-related injuries, the life expectancies of the police officers were essentially identical to other public employees. The life expectancy for someone age 60, regardless of why they stopped working, was 81.8 years, just a tenth of a year lower than for regular workers. In 2006, Oregon's Public Employees Retirement System did an analysis comparing the life expectancies of members who were age 60. Police officers and firefighters were expected to live to age 82.6. The ages were 84.3 for school workers and 83.4 for other public employees. Women in the police and fire departments, and workers outside the school districts were expected to live to age 85.7. Among women working in the schools, the life expectancy was 87.0 years. Where does that leave us? Barber said police officers die 10 years earlier than the general population. But the actuarial studies we found showed little difference in life expectancy. In the latest California study, police officers were actually expected to live a bit longer than other state employees. In Oregon, the combined life expectancy for police and fire was only slightly less than average.

pomt-12197	Amazon has a "no-tax monopoly."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/26/donald-trump/amazon-no-tax-monopoly-donald-trump-said/	President Donald Trump took to Twitter to launch his latest salvo at Amazon, accusing the company of being a monopolistic tax cheat. "Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?" Trump tweeted. This is not the first time Trump has feuded with the online retail giant led by Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, which has published a number of news stories that have angered Trump. The president’s description of Amazon struck us as questionable. So we decided to look into it. Amazon is not a monopoly With more than $136 billion in sales last year, there’s no doubt about Amazon’s status as an online shopping empire. But Amazon is not a monopoly, said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on antitrust law. A monopoly exists when a company so dominates a market that it can reduce output and cause a rise in prices over a substantial period of time. This level of market control is outlawed by antitrust statutes designed to promote competition for the benefit of consumers. "We measure an antitrust violation by looking at consumer harm -- not harm to competitors," Hovenkamp said. "Most complaints about Amazon come from competitors. By and large, Amazon is pretty good with customers, so you don’t usually hear consumers squawking about this." Monopoly law typically kicks in when a company controls about 75 percent of a given market, Hovenkamp said. He noted that in 2000, Microsoft was deemed to be a monopoly because of its control of over 90 percent of the market for Windows-based computers. But no U.S. tribunal ― whether federal or state court, or the Federal Trade Commission ― has ever found Amazon to be a monopoly, Hovenkamp said. Amazon pays taxes Trump is wrong to say Amazon is not subject to tax. Like other businesses, Amazon pays taxes on corporate income, property, payroll and unemployment insurance, said Joseph Henchman, the executive vice president of the business-backed Tax Foundation. Amazon has also recently changed its policy on state sales tax, he added. According to regulatory filings, Amazon paid a combined total of $412 million in federal, state, local and foreign taxes last year. In 2015 it paid $273 million in combined taxes, and $177 million the previous year. But Amazon has faced criticism for taking advantage of tax breaks and loopholes. Only 13 percent of Amazon’s profits went to federal, state, local and foreign taxes from 2007 through 2015, according to an analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence. For the sake of comparison, that’s about half the average amount S&P 500 companies paid over the same period. Amazon’s combined tax burden also falls well below the official U.S. corporate tax rate of 35 percent. In fact, one study found Amazon paid just a 9.3 percent effective federal income tax between 2008 and 2012. Nonetheless, Trump is wrong to say they’ve avoided tax collectors altogether. At the state level, Amazon, which launched online in 1995, long resisted charging a sales tax. But by 2012, it was collecting and paying sales tax in California, Texas and Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. Today, the company collects taxes in all states where state sales taxes exist, plus Washington, D.C. (all states except Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon collect sales tax). Henchman noted that taxes apply to all of Amazon’s own sales, but not the large percentage of sales by other sellers using the Amazon platform. The digital retail giant’s decision to collect state sales tax is mostly voluntary. That’s because a 1992 Supreme Court ruling effectively restricts states from forcing online retailers to pay state and local sales taxes if the company has no brick-and-mortar property or employees in the state. The court’s ruling left the door open for Congress to override its decision through legislation -- and Amazon has lobbied Congress to do so by passing the Marketplace Fairness Act, which would subject online retailers to state sales tax. "We support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system," Amazon wrote in its 2016 regulatory filing. Currently, Amazon does not have physical buildings or employ workers in all the states where it charges taxes, though its footprint has grown in recent years and may grow larger still if its plan to acquire Whole Foods comes to fruition. Our ruling Trump said Amazon has a "no-tax monopoly." Amazon is an industry giant, but it does not exert enough market control to be considered a monopoly, and no U.S. tribunal has ever deemed it as such. While Amazon takes advantage of tax breaks and loopholes, it pays federal corporate tax, and charges sales taxes in 46 U.S. jurisdictions. It also supports federal legislation that would require other online retailers to pay state tax on internet sales. Trump’s statement is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

"Don't tread on us" sums up the reaction of GOP Gov. Rick Perry, who's running for reelection. In February, the state filed a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency to prevent the regulation of carbon dioxide. Perry has resisted the EPA's finding last year that greenhouse gases are a threat to public health — a verdict that sets the stage for federal regulation. State officials say such curbs could jeopardize jobs and threaten businesses in Texas, which leads the nation in carbon emissions. As evidence that Texas is doing just fine protecting natural resources, thanks, Perry says Texas also leads the nation in wind power. From a press release the governor issued Feb. 16 announcing the state's lawsuit: "Texas has installed more wind power than any other state, and all but four countries." Does Perry have it right? Let's start with those other states. According to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), a trade group that tracks development in the industry, Texas has the largest installed wind capacity in the country. That means its wind projects are producing more power than any other state. As of 2009, Texas boasted 9,410 megawatts of it — enough to power about two million-some homes here. Iowa has the second-largest installed wind capacity with 3,670 megawatts of power, followed by California, Washington state, and Minnesota. In 2009, Texas installed the largest amount of new capacity with 2,292 megawatts of wind power, trailed this time by Indiana, Iowa, Oregon and Illinois. So Texas is — sorry — blowing the competition out of U.S. waters. How does the state fare worldwide? The Global Wind Energy Council, of which the AWEA is a member, reports the United States had an installed wind power capacity of 35,159 megawatts as of 2009. Germany had 25,777 megawatts, China had 25,104 megawatts, Spain had 19,149 megawatts and India had 10,926 megawatts. Italy was the country with the sixth largest installed wind power capacity (4,850 megawatts) — just over half of Texas' capacity. Not including the U.S., Texas had installed more wind power than any all but four countries. And more than any other state. We rate Perry's statement as True.

pomt-06580	"If we had been on 'Obamacare' and a bureaucrat was trying to tell me when I could get that CAT scan, that would have delayed my treatment."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/27/herman-cain/herman-cain-said-government-bureaucrats-will-deter/	Herman Cain said at a Republican presidential candidates' debate last week that he would be dead if his cancer had occurred while "Obamacare" was in effect. Cain had made the statement previously, so Chris Wallace of Fox News asked him about it at the debate sponsored by Fox News and Google in Orlando, Fla. Wallace: "Mr. Cain, you are a survivor of Stage 4 colon and liver cancer. And you say if 'Obamacare' had been -- (Here Wallace was interrupted by sustained cheers and applause) and we all share in the happiness about your situation, but you say if 'Obamacare' had been in effect when you were first being treated, you'd be dead now. Why?" Cain: "The reason I said that I would be dead on 'Obamacare' is because my cancer was detected in March of 2006. And from March 2006 all the way to the end of 2006, for that number of months, I was able to get the necessary CAT scan tests, go to the necessary doctors, get a second opinion, get chemotherapy, go to get surgery, recuperate from surgery, get more chemotherapy in a span of nine months. "If we had been on 'Obamacare' and a bureaucrat was trying to tell me when I could get that CAT scan, that would have delayed my treatment. My surgeons and doctors have told me that because I was able to get the treatment as fast as I could, based upon my timetable, and not the government's timetable, that's what saved my life, because I only had a 30 percent chance of survival. And now I'm here five years cancer-free because I could do it on my timetable and not on a bureaucrat's timetable. This is one of the reasons I believe a lot of people are objecting to 'Obamacare,' because we need to get bureaucrats out of the business of trying to micromanage health care in this nation." "Obamacare," in case you haven't figured it out yet, is the Republicans' often mocking name for the health care law that President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. Some of the changes resulting from the law have already taken effect, including sons and daughters under 26 being allowed to be covered by their parents' health insurance. But many major provisions don't begin until 2014. Here's the general way the new law works: The major health insurance systems are left in place, especially the health insurance coverage people get through work and Medicare. For people who have to buy insurance on their own, the government adds new regulations for health insurance companies to follow. States will create "exchanges," which are virtual marketplaces where people will be able to comparison shop for insurance. The law says that everyone must have insurance or pay a tax penalty. (That's called the individual mandate, and it's being challenged in federal courts.) People who make modest incomes will qualify for tax breaks to help them buy insurance, and very poor people will be eligible for Medicaid. What the law is not is a single-payer system, as in Canada, where the government picks up the bills; nor is it a nationalized system like Great Britain's where the government owns hospitals and employs doctors. So if those are the systems Cain had in mind, that's not what the new health care law is. (We asked Cain's campaign what the basis was for his statement, but we didn't hear back.) Even for people over age 65 in Medicare -- the part of the health care system that most resembles a single-payer plan -- private physicians would still make decisions about scans and treatments. Still, opponents of the health care law have argued that it will eventually result in bureaucrats making decisions that affect treatment, particularly for Medicare recipients. But those claims have been rated False on our Truth-O-Meter when they have asserted that bureaucrats will make decisions about individual cases. For example, PolitiFact Georgia looked at a statement from Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., who said that under the health care law, "a bunch of bureaucrats decide whether you get care, such as continuing on dialysis or cancer chemotherapy." Gingrey said the bureaucrats are part of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB. The board is a new part of the health care law, and it was created in response to criticism that Congress has been unable to make the politically risky and technically complex decisions needed to slow the growth of costs for Medicare. Under the health care law, if Medicare spending growth is projected to exceed certain targets, the IPAB must come up with plans to slow the increase. If Congress does not act on the recommendation within a set time frame, the IPAB's plans are automatically implemented. Both sides of the aisle have problems with the board. Some worry it will be too hard for Congress to overrule IPAB recommendations or that the board will stifle innovation. In recent months, several members of Congress from both parties have signed on to repeal the board. But saying that the IPAB will determine the course of treatment for individual cases is an entirely different matter -- and it's factually incorrect. Even people who oppose the IPAB agree that it will not intervene in the cases of individual patients but will rather determine how much the government pays health care providers for various services. It can also reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of readmission or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. (See PolitiFact Georgia's fact-check for more details on the IPAB.) But we should point out here that the IPAB applies to Medicare. Medicare is a government-run health insurance program for those over age 65. When Cain was diagnosed with cancer in March 2006, he would have been 60 -- too young for Medicare. So the IPAB wouldn't even have applied, even if it had been in effect at the time. We don't know the personal details of Cain's health status or how he is insured. But it's impossible for us to see how a government bureaucrat could have delayed Cain's care. Cain said at the debate that, "If we had been on 'Obamacare' and a bureaucrat was trying to tell me when I could get that CAT scan, that would have delayed my treatment." But there is no part of the health care law that allows a government bureaucrat to weigh in on an individual's course of treatment -- not Cain's nor anyone else's. We rate his statement False.

pomt-07625	Says the majority of Americans support gay marriage.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/18/anne-hathaway/anne-hathaway-and-other-celebs-sign/	Actor Anne Hathaway and other Hollywood celebrities recently wrote to President Barack Obama urging him to support gay marriage. The letter said a majority of Americans now support it. Indeed, public opinion on gay marriage is shifting quickly. How quickly? Let's just say we're glad we waited a day to publish our item. The letter came on the heels of the White House announcement that it would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court. The act defines marriage as a legal union between one man and one woman. The letter, sponsored by Freedom to Marry, a group that advocates for marriage for same-sex couples, called the DOMA decision "a powerful statement about the law" and an "important step toward equal protection under the law for all Americans." The letter urged the president "to complete your journey and join us, and the majority of Americans, who support the freedom to marry." It was signed by a group of actors, musicians, business executives and pro athletes including entertainers Ellen DeGeneres and Martin Sheen; musicians Rufus Wainwright and Melissa Etheridge; and football players Scott Fujita and Brendon Ayanbadejo. Obama's position to date has been support for "strong civil unions," but he allowed in December that, "my feelings are constantly evolving," and that he will "continue to wrestle" with the issue. The American public has long been deeply divided over the question of same-sex marriage, and so we wondered if the letter is accurate that a majority of Americans now support it. Jackie Yodashkin, a spokeswoman for Freedom to Marry, backed up the claim by pointing us toward two polls. The first was a poll conducted by the Associated Press in August 2010 that asked the question, "Should the Federal Government give legal recognition to marriages between couples of the same sex, or not?" It was supported by 52 percent and opposed by 46 percent. The percentages were nearly the reverse in a poll the year before. The second was a CNN poll, also in August 2010, in which 52 percent responded "yes" to the question, "Do you think gays and lesbians should have a constitutional right to get married and have their marriage recognized by law as valid?" But the results differed slightly depending how the question was asked. Half got a question that read "should have" right to marry and the other half was asked if gay people "have" a right to marry. The "should" version produced a 52-46 majority in favor of gay marriage, while the "have a right" question produced a 49-51 majority against. Charles Franklin, co-founder of Pollster.com and professor of political science at University of Wisconsin at Madison, said the results show people understand "it isn't a settled constitutional right, though a majority think it should be one." Other polls show growing support for gay marriage, but less than a majority. For example, a Pew Research Center poll released on March 3, 2011, found that while the clear trend is heading in favor of gay marriage, the American public remains about equally divided. According to a Pew news release on its study, "The new poll finds that about as many adults now favor (45 percent) as oppose (46 percent) allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. Last year opponents outnumbered supporters 48 percent to 42 percent. Opposition to same-sex marriage has declined by 19 percentage points since 1996, when 65 percent opposed gay marriage and only 27 percent were in favor." A review of the totality of recent polls suggests that, "opinion has moved, but it is not a majority sentiment yet," said Karlyn Bowman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. "I'd rate it 'not true yet,'" Franklin said. "There are some individual polls that have shown support larger than opposition but the overall trend isn't quite there yet." But it's likely to be true soon, he said. "The consistency of the trends since 2005 all but guarantee support will exceed opposition within the year," said Franklin, who wrote about the trend in a recent Huffington Post story. Then, on March 18, 2011, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that a slim majority now supports gay marriage. According to the Post story about it, "The results underscore the nation’s increasingly tolerant views about homosexuals, and parallel a string of recent legal and legislative victories for gay rights advocates." "Five years ago, at 36 percent, support for gay marriage barely topped a third of all Americans," the story states. "Now, 53 percent say gay marriage should be legal, marking the first time in Post-ABC polling that a majority has said so." The story notes that opponents of same-sex marriage took issue with the wording in the poll: "Do you think it should be legal or illegal for gay and lesbian couples to get married?" According to the story, "Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, argued that the term 'illegal' could be inferred to mean that violators could be imprisoned, which most Americans would consider harsh." It is the same language used in Post-ABC News polls since 2003. "The only poll that counts is a free and fair vote on the part of the people," Brown told the Washington Post. "We’ve seen these biased polls time and time again -- right before votes in which same-sex marriage is rejected. It’s absurd. The people of this country have not changed their opinion about marriage." A couple of other caveats. When the option of civil unions (short of marriage) is added to the mix, the numbers change. In several recent polls that asked which of three options best describes their preference -- legalizing same-sex marriage, civil unions or none -- the top-rated option was legalizing marriage, with about 37 to 40 percent support. "I would not rate that as evidence of majority support for gay marriage, though it is an interesting change from the early 2000s when no legal recognition was the largest category," Franklin said. One other factor to consider: Public opinion sometimes shifts when the issue of gay marriage really heats up. "We saw movement away from gay marriage in 2004-05, showing that despite the long-term trend there is a possibility of reaction against expansion of gay marriage when the issue is made especially salient," Franklin said. "But that said, it is hard to imagine the lines don't cross in the next 12 months or so, given how much the gap closed in each of the last five years." Bottom line, most of the polls taken in 2010 and 2011 show that while there is a clear trend in recent years toward support for gay marriage, but it is not quite yet a majority. But there are some polls that have found the tipping point has been reached, and that a slim majority now support gay marriage. And that includes the newest poll, from the Washington Post-ABC News. And so we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Anne Hathaway	None	None	None	2011-03-18T16:56:16	2011-03-15	['United_States']
pomt-02246	"The Capitol rotunda was actually made to invite the people in and to accommodate protests."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/14/chris-taylor/rep-chris-taylor-says-state-capitol-rotunda-was-de/	Members of the the Russian punk band Pussy Riot helped breathe new fire into longstanding controversy surrounding the arrests of hundreds of protesters at the Wisconsin State Capitol. Band members Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alyokhina, who served time in a Russian prison after criticizing President Vladimir Putin in a 2012 performance, declared "Solidarity with Wisconsin!" in a video that argues for the dismissal of tickets issued to those who participated in noon hour singalongs at the Capitol. The daily singalongs are an outgrowth of the massive protests that engulfed the Capitol in early 2011 after Gov. Scott Walker unveiled his plan to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. In the summer of 2013, Capitol Police began arresting protesters in large numbers. Some protesters were arrested dozens of times, and hundreds of tickets -- mostly civil rather than criminal forfeitures -- were written. State officials said the singers had gathered illegally without a permit. Two protesters, with help from the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, sued Gov. Scott Walker’s administration, claiming the arrests violated the singers’ right to free speech. In July 2013, U.S. District Judge William Conley issued a preliminary injunction blocking two parts of the restrictions on demonstrations, but left in place the rules requiring permits for larger gatherings. The singing and the arrests continued. With the free speech case heading for a trial, the state and the singers reached an agreement in October 2013. The state agreed to pay more than $88,000 in attorneys fees and drop its requirement that larger groups receive a permit before staging protests in the Capitol. The agreement said protesters could stage five days of demonstrations if they gave the state two days’ advance notice. At the time, Larry Dupuis, legal director of the ACLU of Wisconsin said: "Giving notice is very informal. The state can't deny use of the Capitol to anyone giving notice, unless someone else has reserved the entire space by obtaining a permit for the same time." A total of 504 tickets were written. Of those, 192 have been dismissed, 11 found guilty, 28 were settled through deferred prosecution and two were declined by prosecutors, and two settled with a default judgment, according to Dana Brueck, spokeswoman for Attorney Gen. J.B. Van Hollen. That leaves 269 tickets to be settled. And that was the purpose behind the six-minute video, released March 11, 2014. It argues that the protesters were simply exercising their right to free speech by singing. State Rep. Chris Taylor (D-Madison) leads off with this statement: "The Capitol rotunda was actually made to invite the people in and to accommodate protests." Is Taylor right? About the building While Taylor argues the Capitol was actually designed for protests and gatherings, the state has argued it is primarily a place of business. That’s the approach Van Hollen took in 2012 brief filed in a Dane County Circuit Court case. "The prime use of the State Capitol is as an office building and a place for orderly legislative and judicial hearings on the most important issues of the day — not as an open public square," Van Hollen argued. He cited this comment from Secretary of Administration Michael Huebsch from an earlier case: "It is primarily the facility by which the Legislature, the Judicial, and the Executive Branches are able to conduct their business and do what they have been duly elected to carry out." In an email, DOA spokesman Stephanie Marquis cited the state’s Administrative Code, which says state buildings are available for a variety of uses, including "public meetings for the free discussion of public questions" providing the use doesn’t interfere with the prime uses of the building, doesn’t create a management problem, involve damages and is appropriate to the physical context of the building or facility." She also cited the history of the Capitol, including various moves and expansions made to handle the growth of state government: "The history talks about the purpose of the building is to conduct State and legislative business." Taylor’s case But Taylor’s argument is that the building was designed with a broader purpose in mind. Aide Craig Trost said she based her comments about the Capitol on part of Conley’s ruling. In his ruling, Conley described the Capitol, and especially the soaring rotunda, as a special place. He cited the June 10, 2000 nomination of the building for inclusion on the National Registry of Historic Places. The nomination, which was successful, was prepared by architectural historian Anne Biebel, who was part of the team that worked on a major restoration project that had been completed. The nomination noted that there is a "clear demarcation between public and private spaces, (that) is central to the development of (Capitol architect George Browne) Post’s scheme for the Capitol interior. The public spaces, such as the rotunda, chambers and major corridors, are monumental in scale and are characterized by ornate decoration, rich materials and lavish details. The private offices, designed with the goal of making them adaptable to changing needs, are constructed at a smaller and more intimate scale." Conley noted: "Whereas some statehouses are maintained apart from the urban fabric, the Wisconsin Capitol Rotunda functions, both literally and symbolically, as a city center and is fully utilized as a public space to which all have claim." Later in his ruling, the judge noted: "The Capitol rotunda is closer to an out-of-doors, traditional public forum in that it is a capacious gathering space with a unique history as a place for government and public discourse, which admits for (indeed, was designed for) a certain level of disturbance that would not be proper in a typical state office building or even a typical state capitol." Conley’s ruling also noted that the rotunda is the location of the state’s holiday tree, and the setting for numerous events and ceremonies. Our rating In the video, Taylor said the building was designed for such public gatherings. While it is a place of business, the building’s nomination for National Historic Landmark makes clear that it was designed to be open to the public for various gatherings. We rate Taylor’s statement True.	None	Chris Taylor	None	None	None	2014-04-14T05:00:00	2014-03-11	['None']

pomt-01745	Says a $12.5 million incentive deal she approved for Abbott Laboratories contained "strong protections for taxpayers if job creation goals were not met."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/03/mary-burke/mary-burke-abbott-deal-had-strong-protections-taxp/	Gov. Scott Walker alleges that former state Commerce Secretary Mary Burke "wasted" nearly $25 million in the so-far failed attempt to attract a major Abbott Laboratories expansion in Wisconsin. But Burke, Walker’s main Democratic challenger in the 2014 governor’s race, says her agency built tough failsafes into the deal. "Everyone from local officials to the local chamber of commerce to Walker's own administration agrees that this was and is a good deal from an economic development standpoint," Burke’s campaign said on July 9, 2014. "The grant," she continued, "contained strong protections for taxpayers if job creation goals were not met or infrastructure was not developed for economic development." On July 31, 2014, we rated Walker’s $25 million claim False, noting that Walker double-counted the $12.3 million cost of the deal. In the jousting over the strength or weakness of the deal’s protections, the two campaigns cite the same sections of the complicated Abbott aid agreement as evidence for their side’s view. Let’s start there. The 2006 deal passed $12.5 million in federal block grant funds through the Village of Pleasant Prairie and the Kenosha Area Business Alliance to purchase 40 acres of land to hold for Abbott, which already had amassed 500 acres for a potential Kenosha County corporate campus. If the pharmaceutical giant’s Wisconsin expansion proceeds, Abbott could buy the land for $1. State officials wanted a so-called "clawback" provision that would require Abbott to pay back the money if the company did not create at least 2,400 jobs, but Abbott declined to sign one, according to Michael Pollocoff, Pleasant Prairie’s administrator. Burke and then-Gov. Jim Doyle pushed forward without such a provision. It’s common for Commerce Department grants and loans to businesses to be tied to performance measures mandating partial or full return of such aid if jobs are not added, according to a 2006 state audit. Often the state’s contracts call for personal loan guarantees and financial penalties in case of non-repayment. Such conditions vary depending on the situation, but in the Abbott case, the state’s approach meant that the party the state was hoping to come through with jobs was not directly on the hook. It was subject only to indirect financial pressure to do so -- the loss of a "free" piece of land. Land sale envisioned The plan, however, did not leave the state without any recourse. Under the agreement, the business alliance, known as KABA, is responsible for returning some funds to the state if the Abbott jobs don’t emerge by 2016. That refund, though, was tied to what the 40-acre property could bring in a sale, and the plan came with some terms that weakened the possibility the full amount could be recovered. At this point, the land’s assessed value is about 55 percent of what KABA paid for it -- nearly $5 million lower than the $12.3 million purchase price (a pre-recession price paid to a truck stop developer who had leverage in the negotiation.) So at least as things stand now, far less than the full $12.3 million seems recoverable. The deal called for KABA and Pleasant Prairie to recoup their own costs related to holding and preparing the Abbott site for development. Those costs are nearly $4 million, said Pollocoff. So if the state were to immediately sell the property, the leftover funds might total only $2 million to $3 million. There’s nothing in the deal that would block the state from holding the land in hopes that its value in a busy corporate corridor would increase. "This is a unique piece of collateral with significant growth potential," Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki argued in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, "40 acres of land along a busy highway, next to up-and-coming businesses like Amazon and Uline." Todd Battle, president of the KABA group, didn’t respond to interview requests for this story, but in 2006 he described the land as "some of the most valuable real estate along the (Interstate 94) corridor." But there’s one more, major point here. Because federal officials in 2013 declared the deal ineligible for federal money in the first place, and the promise of jobs was so vague, the state is being forced -- now -- to pay back HUD from state tax revenue. Federal officials say the project was overly speculative and has not paid off over eight years. That’s something no one contemplated as a possibility, and one that a stronger and more properly drawn deal would have prevented as a matter of course. Mike Huebsch, state Department of Administration secretary and a top member of the Walker administration, is not impressed by predictions of money coming back to the state. "The deal was constructed in a way that put us at a disadvantage every step of the way," he told us. "The state’s position was not strong." We sought an outsider’s opinion and turned to Ronald D Berkebile. He’s a founder of Dominion Scientific Analytics, a financial analyst with the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia, and an author of articles on the financial impact of economic development projects. Berkebile didn’t fault the general structure of the deal, and said there’s an element of hindsight in the criticisms. If the economy had not soured, Abbott might have met the agreement’s expectations, and "no one would have asked about this situation," he said. "The economy (in 2006) likely supported the promise of a large pharmaceutical company developing the land. A promise of this nature is very enticing." But he said more performance milestones should have been built in to protect the investment, and there should have been better monitoring to avoid violating state and federal rules. If Abbott couldn’t produce by a date certain, "then KABA should have had the ability to exercise alternative property rights to develop the land in accordance with (block grant) standards," he said. Our rating Burke’s campaign said the $12.5 million incentive deal she approved for Abbott Laboratories contained "strong protections for taxpayers if job creation goals were not met." While the land provides some collateral, the deal’s protections and structure fell short of those used in many such cases, leaving the state vulnerable to picking up some or most of the pieces if Abbott doesn’t deliver. And it’s hard to reconcile how "strong protections" could have allowed the scenario now unfolding in which the state is paying cash to HUD. We rate the claim False.

pomt-02049	Says a "liberal" immigration reform group endorsed his GOP primary opponent, Dave Brat.	false	/virginia/statements/2014/may/30/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-liberal-immigration-group-backs-h/	U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor, R-7th, is portraying himself as a bastion against illegal immigration in fending off a June 10 primary challenge from Dave Brat, a professor at Randolph-Macon College. "Just yesterday, a liberal pro-amnesty group held a rally and encouraged their supporters to vote in our election for our opponent because Congressman Cantor is standing up to Obama on illegal immigration," Cantor’s campaign said in a May 29 email to supporters. The statement caught PolitiFact’s attention because we attended the May 28 rally at the state Capitol held by Casa de Virginia, a group that supports immigration reform. The speakers certainly needled Cantor, the House majority leader, for not scheduling a vote on a bill to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws. They held signs saying "Eric Cantor: the one man blocking immigration reform," and "Eric Cantor Give us a vote!" But we didn’t hear anyone endorse Brat, who accuses Cantor of being soft on immigration. To the contrary, U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., brushed off speculation that the primary was tied to the timing of the rally. "Some people think we’re here because there’s a primary next week, nothing could be further from the truth," Gutierrez said in the keynote speech. "The primary is really irrelevant to us. We’re here because the majority leader, Eric Cantor, controls the agenda of the Congress of the United States. And we have come here to say … Stop being an obstacle. Stop being in the way." Gutierrez said at another point that the primary might be impeding passage of immigration reform. "Here is the good news, they are going to finally have a primary here in Virginia," Gutierrez said. "Maybe after all the partisan politics are over, we can finally get back to the business of the people of the United States." We asked Ray Allen Jr., Cantor’s political adviser, for evidence that rally organizers urged those in attendance to support Brat. He pointed to a flier handed out at the event that said, "Vote *ABC* June 10 -- Anybody But Cantor." Allen sent us a photo of the flier in a red packet of immigration information that was handed out by organizers of the rally. "While the flier says vote for anybody but Cantor, Brat is the only anybody on the ballot," Allen emailed. "The intent of the flyer is obvious to all." But the "Anybody But Cantor" flier was not included in the packet the rally organizers gave to the media. A man disseminated the orange sheet before the rally, but his affiliation was unclear. A disclaimer on the bottom of the page provided no clues, saying, "This message is not authorized by any candidate." The same man also passed out the flier at news conference Brat held in the Capitol shortly before the rally. Brat used the occasion to question Cantor’s toughness on immigration reform. Zachary Werrell, Brat’s campaign manager said his campaign didn’t pass out the flier and he had no idea who did. Lindolfo Carballo, coordinator of Casa de Virginia, said his group is not connected to the flier. "It was someone who came to the event before we even started and was passing the flier around," he said. "We asked him to stop. He wasn’t part of our group and the flier wasn’t part of our package." Carballo said, "We’re not endorsing anyone. We are just asking Eric Cantor to allow a vote on immigration reform." As to Cantor’s claim that the group is backing Brat, Carballo said, "He is going to play this game of his. We are not here to play." Cantor has declined to schedule a House vote on a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate last year. The legislation would spend billions on border control and establish a lengthy path to citizenship for many immigrants who entered the country illegally. Cantor says rather than pass a comprehensive bill, Congress should take a piece-by-piece approach to immigration. The majority leader says he supports a path to citizenship for children who were brought into the country illegally by their parents. On May 16, Cantor announced that he would not allow an amendment to the defense authorization bill that would allow children of illegal immigrants to join the military and receive legal status once they’ve served. Cantor said he supports the concept of the measure, but did not want to attach it to the authorization bill. The majority leader has declined to say when or if he would set up a separate vote for the Enlist Act. Our ruling Cantor says Casa de Virginia, a group supporting immigration reform, endorsed his Republican primary opponent during a May 28 rally in Richmond. Seeking to shore up his conservative support, Cantor cited the action as proof that that he is "standing up to Obama on illegal immigration." The problem is that no speaker at the rally issued an endorsement of Dave Brat, Cantor’s opponent. To the contrary, the keynoter stressed that the group was not taking sides in the primary; it was simply calling on Cantor to allow a House vote on immigration reform. Cantor’s campaign points to a flier passed out at the event urging voters to support "anyone but Cantor" in the primary. Casa denies any connection to the flier. The missive was not part of an information package Casa distributed at the rally. We know this because we were there. Cantor’s statement is False.

pomt-05056	Toothpaste contains "the poison substance of fluoride."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/09/jim-bohl/milwaukee-alderman-says-fluoride-toothpaste-poison/	The debate over the use of fluoride in Milwaukee’s water supply was pretty much a one day affair. Led by Ald. Jim Bohl, in that short time frame, the public heard a barrage of unusual claims about their water, rat poison, and even their toothpaste. Indeed, we thought the debate over fluoridation of water had long been settled. Since 1953, the Milwaukee Water Works has added a tiny amount of fluoride to the drinking water. Many cities have done this for years to boost dental hygiene and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers it one of the most important public health efforts of the past 50 years. Some, including Bohl, have criticized the practice. They raise a variety of arguments including that the government is introducing poison into the water supply. Bohl tried unsuccessfully to get the Common Council to end water fluoridation in Milwaukee, arguing the money saved -- about $540,000 a year -- would be better used for dental programs in the central city. Bohl said that fluoride was a dangerous chemical, originally created for use as rat poison. Now, not only is it in the water, but also consumer products including toothpaste, he said. "We all know that we do not have children or anyone swallow toothpaste," Bohl said at a City Hall news conference May 29, cited in this report on WUWM. "And the reason we don’t do that is because of the poison substance of fluoride. If fluoride was such an effective and non-harmful substance, why would we not encourage everyone to swallow their toothpaste?" Bohl elaborated in a May 30 interview with the Journal Sentinel editorial board: "We’re talking about a substance that’s rated as more toxic than lead." That got our attention. Poison in our toothpaste? Are folks putting themselves in danger when they polish their pearly whites? Some -- but not all -- toothpaste contains fluoride, a substance known to prevent cavities. If it’s ingested alone, fluoride can cause serious illness in humans. So, toothpaste is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which limits the amount of fluoride allowed in the product. That’s why tubes of toothpaste with fluoride carry this warning label: "If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately." Apparently Bohl is not the only one who reads the fine print on their toothpaste tubes. Flouride calls are relatively common at the Wisconsin Poison Center, in part because of the warning label, said manager Cathy Smith. The agency, part of Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin, handles calls from around the state. Experts who field the calls determine the brand and type of toothpaste used and consult database to determine the concentration of fluoride in that particular product, Smith said. They then factor in the age and weight of the human and see if there’s a problem. And here’s where the scary talk from Bohl meets reality: Toothpaste doesn’t make people sick. "We have never, ever had a person who has ingested toothpaste, even a child, who has been referred to the emergency room," Smith said. How much toothpaste would you have to swallow before you’d be considered in any sort of trouble? A 30-pound child would have to ingest an entire six-ounce tube, according to the Poison Center. "Kids, number one, don’t eat that much," Smith said. " And, number two, they’d be puking it up if they did." In part, that’s because the product includes cleansers, detergents and other substances that would disagree with your stomach. By the Poison Center’s calculations, an adult would have to swallow about four tubes of toothpaste before they’d be a candidate for the E.R. We checked with Froedtert Hospital, which has one of the busiest emergency rooms in the state. Spokeswoman Kathleen Sieja said that the hospital didn’t track toothpaste-related ailments, but said she’d check with a long-time doctor there to see if he had heard of anything. Said Sieja: "The emergency dept physician responded that in his 17 years, he has never taken care of a fluoride overdose." We also checked with a few other sources, including toothpaste manufacturers, and found there’s little for people to worry about. "The amount of fluoride found in toothpaste is usually not swallowed in large enough amounts to cause harm," said an article on the New York Times Health section about how people should handle a possible fluoride overdose. And here’s what Proctor and Gamble, the maker of Crest, says about toothpaste dangers: "Occasionally swallowing a small amount of toothpaste is not a safety risk for adults or children. Our label cautions against swallowing because eating a large amount of toothpaste would be expected to cause nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Certain ingredients that are common in toothpastes have the potential to cause stomach irritation if enough is swallowed." Finally, there’s the question of what is a poison. Here’s what a couple of dictionaries say: -- A substance with an inherent property that tends to destroy life or impair health. Dictionary.com -- A substance that causes injury, illness, or death, especially by chemical means. The Free Dictionary.com -- A substance that through its chemical action usually kills, injures, or impairs an organism. Merriam-Webster.com A tube of toothpaste doesn’t seem to fit any of these definitions. We asked Bohl why he called fluoride a poison, and he sent us an email with links to more than a dozen websites that "spell out the toxic nature of the substance." Some are from government sources, such as the Environmental Protection Agency. Others were from groups opposed to fluoride, even one by a blogger who writes about "Energy healing program to boost the human aura, increase athletic performance and life extension." Bohl turned to the dictionary as well -- to define the word toxic: 1) poisonous. 2. manifesting the symptoms of severe poisoning. The FreeDictionary.com. Finally, we asked the Poison Center: Is fluoride a poison? Smith’s answer: "It can be toxic in certain situations." So, with this item adequately scrubbed, let’s put it to bed. In raising a slew of concerns about the use of fluoride in Milwaukee’s drinking water, Bohl said the public was being exposed to a dangerous chemical -- he called it a poison -- that is regulated by the feds. Many brands of toothpaste do contain fluoride, which is regulated by the feds. But saying toothpaste contains a poison, Bohl overstates his case and the alarm to the public. People generally don’t eat and swallow toothpaste. And if they did, it would take a massive amount to be at risk from fluoride poisoning. In fact, experts say a kid would vomit out the toothpaste long before that point. We rate Bohl’s claim Mostly False.	None	Jim Bohl	None	None	None	2012-07-09T09:00:00	2012-05-30	['None']
pomt-14344	"Out of 67 counties (in Florida), I won 66, which is unprecedented. It's never happened before."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2016/mar/24/donald-trump/no-donald-trump-winning-66-67-florida-counties-not/	Billionaire Donald Trump won an easy victory in Florida’s 2016 Republican presidential primary — so easy, he said, that he garnered an unparalleled amount of support in the process. "Out of 67 counties (in Florida), I won 66, which is unprecedented. It's never happened before," Trump said March 21. It is true that he won 66 counties (Sen. Marco Rubio won his birthplace of Miami-Dade before dropping out of the race), but Trump’s nearly unanimous win is hardly unprecedented. We looked at county-by-county election results from the state’s Division of Elections website. Big wins aren’t altogether unusual in Florida, if you go back just a few years. Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich split the state in the 2012 Republican primary, and both the GOP and Democrats split their primaries three ways in 2008. But in 2004, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry won all 67 counties for the Democrats. That feat was repeated by both parties in 2000, when Vice President Al Gore won all 67 for the Democrats and Texas Gov. George W. Bush won all 67 for Republicans. In 1996, Bob Dole took 66 of 67 counties for the GOP primary — but really, the 67th was a tie at 190 votes each for Dole and Pat Buchanan in Washington County. Bill Clinton took 63 counties in 1992’s Democratic primary. Paul Tsongas won Alachua, Martin, Seminole and Palm Beach counties. Pat Buchanan mounted a primary challenge to incumbent president George H.W. Bush that year and won Hardee County. Bush nabbed the other 66. In 1988, George H.W. Bush won 64 counties, losing three to Pat Robertson in the GOP race. Counties were split over their Democratic candidate, but Michael Dukakis won the state. Walter Mondale and Gary Hart divided the state for Democrats in 1984, with Jesse Jackson winning one county and John Glenn two. The state’s online data only goes back to 1978, but there were enough examples to prove Trump wrong in this case. In 1980, Jimmy Carter won 100 percent of Florida counties for the Democrats. But Trump can lay claim to beating the primary record of Republican hero Ronald Reagan. The actor defeated his eventual vice presidential running mate George H.W. Bush by 64 counties to 3. In addition to Alachua County, Bush took Dixie and Union counties by a single vote. Our ruling Trump said, "Out of 67 counties (in Florida), I won 66, which is unprecedented. It's never happened before." Trump won 66 counties, but it’s far from unprecedented for Florida primary winners to win by a huge margin. Going back even just a few decades, there are several instances of candidates winning all 67 counties.

pomt-10428	McCain sought the political support of minister John Hagee, "who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church 'the Antichrist' and a 'false cult.'"	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/15/moveon/true-but-hagee-has-since-recanted/	Note to readers: An update was posted to this item on May 23, 2008, to reflect new information. See note at the end of this story. In an e-mail to supporters, the liberal group MoveOn.org listed reasons people should not support Sen. John McCain for president. "McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years," the e-mail said. "McCain sought the political support of right-wing preacher John Hagee, who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church 'the Antichrist' and a 'false cult.'" Some of MoveOn's points are correct. McCain has accepted an endorsement from Hagee, an evangelical minister with a national following. Since MoveOn's e-mail went out, however, Hagee has renounced his previous controversial statements. Hagee heads the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, with 17,000 members. He has a nationally syndicated television show, John Hagee Today, a sprawling Web site and numerous books. His dominant issue is the defense of Israel: He founded the advocacy group Christians United for Israel in 2006, and his book Jerusalem Countdown takes grim satisfaction in predicting a nuclear confrontation in the Middle East with the United States and Israel on one side and Iran on the other. Hagee's endorsement of McCain on Feb. 27, 2008, set off several rounds of controversy. The day after the endorsement, the Catholic League called Hagee an anti-Catholic bigot and lamented McCain's connection to him. The Catholic League monitors anti-Catholic bias and emphasizes Catholic teaching on abortion and other moral issues. It pointed to a video of Hagee in which Hagee discusses the Book of Revelation and the Catholic Church. Hagee clearly uses the words "Antichrist" and "false cult" as he discusses the Catholic Church, the Crusades and the Holocaust. (His statements are a little confusing; watch the video here.) Hagee said he was only criticizing historical acts of anti-Semitism by the Catholic Church, not expressing anti-Catholic hatred. But Catholic League president Bill Donahue said Hagee's excuses weren't credible and continued calls for McCain to distance himself. During an interview with George Stephanopoulos on April 20, McCain said he still welcomed Hagee's endorsement but strongly condemned "any comments that he made about the Catholic church." The Catholic League was satisfied with McCain's comments but continued to criticize Hagee. On May 13, Hagee released a letter sent directly to Donahue in which Hagee expressed regret for his previous statements about the Catholic Church. Donahue accepted the apology. "The tone of Hagee's letter is sincere," Donahue said in a statement. "He wants reconciliation and he has achieved it. Indeed, the Catholic League welcomes his apology." While the back-and-forth was going on about the Catholic Church, Hagee also retracted his previous comments about Hurricane Katrina. Hagee had said in an interview on Sept 16, 2006: "The newspaper carried the story in our local area that was not carried nationally that there was to be a homosexual parade on the Monday that the Katrina came, and the promise of that parade was that it was going to reach a level of sexuality never demonstrated before in any of the other Gay Pride parades. So I believe that the judgment of God is a very real thing. I know that there are people who demure from that, but I believe that the Bible teaches that when you violate the law of God, that God brings punishment sometimes before the day of judgment, and I believe that the Hurricane Katrina was, in fact, the judgment of God against the city of New Orleans." A publicist for Hagee sent us this statement dated April 25, 2008: "As a believing Christian, I see the hand of God in everything that happens here on earth, both the blessings and the curses. But ultimately neither I nor any other person can know the mind of God concerning Hurricane Katrina. I should not have suggested otherwise." Hagee's modest backtracking isn't that surprising, said John C. Green, a senior fellow in religion and politics at the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, a nonpartisan research group that does not take positions in policy debates. Hard-charging rhetoric against the Catholic Church and other religions such as Judaism or Islam used to be more common among evangelical leaders, but it's now falling out of favor, Green said. "Most evangelicals today don't use that kind of harsh language, because they've discovered it has negative effects," Green said. "It's hard to make converts when you use that harsh language with them, and they've also realized it's not appropriate." Of course, we can't definitively rule on whether Hagee's new statements represent a true change of heart or just a political repositioning. MoveOn's attack was true when the group sent out the e-mail; it was only later that Hagee retracted his comments. With that significant caveat, we rate MoveOn's statement True. UPDATE: On May 22, 2008, McCain rejected the pastor's endorsement, after audio of Hagee preaching, reportedly during the 1990s, was posted to the Internet. In the recording, Hagee implied that Hilter and the Holocaust were part of God's plan to create the state of Israel. (Listen to the audio here .) McCain said Hagee's comments were "deeply offensive and indefensible," and "I did not know of them before Reverend Hagee's endorsement, and I feel I must reject his endorsement as well." Hagee, meanwhile, issued a statement saying that he was withdrawing his endorsement and that critics were distorting his views. "I am tired of these baseless attacks and fear that they have become a distraction in what should be a national debate about important issues," Hagee said on May 22, 2008. "I have therefore decided to withdraw my endorsement of Sen. McCain for president effective today, and to remove myself from any active role in the 2008 campaign."

pomt-14924	Among manufacturers with fewer than 50 employees, "the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/30/ben-carson/cnbc-debate-ben-carson-cites-high-cost-regulations/	Presidential candidate Ben Carson called for fewer government regulations at the Oct. 28 Republican debate. Responding to a question posed about whether the government should regulate pharmaceutical prices, the former neurosurgeon pivoted to talk about federal regulation more generally, saying more government involvement means more problems. "Well, the average small manufacturer, whatever they're manufacturing, drugs or anything, if they have less than 50 employees, the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee," Carson said. "Makes it a whole lot easier for them to want to go somewhere else. So what we're going to have to start doing instead of, you know, picking on this group or this group, is we're going to have to have a major reduction in the regulatory influence that is going on." We wondered if Carson’s claim that regulations cost $34,000 a year per employee at small manufacturing firms was correct. We found that Carson got the figure from a report, but the figure itself is not bulletproof. The figure comes from a 2014 report commissioned by the National Association of Manufacturers -- a group that advocates for regulatory reform -- which concluded that smaller manufacturers bear a bigger regulatory burden than medium and large firms. The study found that manufacturing businesses with fewer than 50 employees face on average $34,671 per employee per year in regulatory costs. The average among manufacturing companies of all sizes, conversely, is $19,564, and the average among all U.S. businesses is $9,991. The researchers were W. Mark Crain and Nicole V. Crain, economists at Lafayette College. In short, the Crains calculated a figure for the total cost of regulations in the United States, estimated what proportion of that cost various economic sectors bear, and then calculated the per-employee cost within each sector using payroll data. Their 2014 manufacturing study largely builds off of one they produced for the Small Business Administration, a government agency, in 2010. Many critics viewed the 2010 study as flawed because of the imprecise way the Crains calculated the primary figure: how much regulations cost in total, which came out to about $1.7 trillion. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service questioned the results in its own report. The gist is that they based it on the extent of regulation within the United States and economic growth, rather than the literal costs associated with particular regulatory policies. (For a detailed overview of the criticisms of the 2010 report, read this New York Times blog.) In an email to PolitiFact, Nicole Crain said they "took criticisms seriously" and adjusted the 2014 report as a result. One major change is that the researchers also surveyed manufacturers. They inquired about actual costs incurred by these firms, such as purchasing special equipment to meet regulations and the cost of hiring employees to monitor compliance. Crain said the survey results support the findings from the regulatory index analysis. "The results obtained from these two distinctly different approaches were quite similar," she said. We couldn’t find any other quality studies that calculated a similar figure with which we could compare the Crains’ data, and the experts we asked weren’t aware of any either. The Crains’ methodology is on the right track, but the problem is that they don’t have good data to back it up, said Richard Williams, an economist at the Mercatus Institute at George Mason University, who reviewed the 2010 study. The federal government publishes thousands of rules every year, but there is reliable cost data about very few of them. While it’s uncertain what the actual costs are, the $34,000 figure that Carson cited might not be totally off-base for manufacturers with fewer than 50 employees, Williams said. "This might be in the ballpark, but it might be a lot higher, but it might be a little lower," Williams said. This figure is so vague that it’s meaningless, said Brookings Institution senior fellow and economist Clifford Winston, noting that his work is generally critical of government regulation. There are so many rules and types of costs -- everything from the direct cost of hiring special employees to the indirect cost of lost efficiency -- that it’s difficult to develop a comprehensive number for how many dollars firms lose to federal regulations generally. Most researchers look at regulations much more narrowly, such as examining a specific regulation or business sector, he said. Further, the study doesn’t fully take into account the benefits of regulations, Winston said, adding that in some cases, the absence of regulations could be more expensive than the costs of compliance. Looking through the report, Winston said the figure cited by Carson is in no way a reliable snapshot of how much the average small manufacturer spends on regulatory compliance. Our ruling Carson said that among manufacturers with fewer than 50 employees, "the average cost in terms of regulations is $34,000 per employee." Carson cited a figure from a 2014 report out of the National Association of Manufacturers. However, the methodology behind the report has some significant shortfalls, so it’s not necessarily reliable. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-01622	Rick Scott took $200,000 from a family that leased land for drilling "and now he is trying to hide from it."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/aug/28/nextgen-climate/nextgen-ad-says-rick-scott-trying-hide-donation-re/	NextGen Climate has unleashed another attack on Gov. Rick Scott as it relates to a drilling project that the state ultimately shut down. "The Collier family, owners of the company that leased their land for oil exploration to the drillers that threatened drinking water for seven million Floridians," stated the narrator in the TV ad. "Rick Scott took $200,000 from them and now he is trying to hide from it. Sound familiar?" At that point, the screen shows a photo of Scott while the text states, "He took the 5th 75 times." The ad then replays video footage of Scott at a 1995 legal deposition saying, "I don’t recall. I have no idea. What’s your question?" PolitiFact Florida previously fact-checked a NextGen ad about that $200,000 donation, rating it Half True. And we have fact-checked a Florida Democratic Party ad about Scott taking the 5th 75 times and rated it Mostly True. Scott's pleading the 5th was related to a Medicare case, though, not oil drilling. But this new ad tacked on another allegation that we will fact-check here: Is Scott trying to hide from this donation? The Colliers’ land and their donation Checking whether Scott is trying to "hide from" a donation requires a bit of backstory. In 2012, Collier Resources Co. leased about 120,000 acres of mineral rights in Collier County to Dan A. Hughes. Collier County is in Southwest Florida and includes Naples, where Scott lives. But despite residents’ protests -- including in front of Scott’s home -- the state Department of Environmental Protection in September 2013 granted Hughes a permit to inject acid deep underground to fracture the limestone. But Hughes wanted to try a procedure that hadn’t been allowed in Florida in the past. In December 2013, Hughes went ahead and used that procedure even though DEP had asked it to hold off. That led the department to fine Hughes and later file a lawsuit, which Hughes is fighting. The Collier family is not a party to the lawsuit. Nor is Scott in his personal capacity. Why does this all matter for the ad? Because four members of the Collier family -- Barron, Miles, Parker and Thomas -- each gave $50,000 to Scott’s Let’s Get to Work Committee in January 2013. This led NextGen’s to allege in its previous ad that Scott was too cozy with oil interests: "A dangerous new type of oil drilling near the Everglades threatened drinking water for 7 million Floridians," part of the ad states. "But one Floridian is benefitting. Rick Scott drank from a fountain of campaign cash from the company that profited off pollution." The text on the screen states: "Rick Scott $200,000 from oil interests." The ad didn’t mention Hughes, the oil drilling company, or the Colliers, the landowners who gave the donations, by name. Because the ad lacked those specifics, and because no pollution has been found so far, we rated it Half True. The newest NextGen ad takes this dispute a step further, saying Scott not only took the money but that "he is trying to hide from it." That’s a reference to an argument by the Scott campaign that it didn’t take donations from Hughes. The Miami Herald reported that Scott’s campaign spokesman, Matt Moon, strongly denied NextGen’s suggestion that Scott had taken campaign cash from Hughes, the driller. "In fact, no political entity associated with Gov. Scott has ever received contributions from the company – in this election or 2010," Moon said. The Republican Party of Florida took a similar strategy in an ad, saying "Crist’s team says Gov. Scott took contributions from this polluter. It’s total fiction. Scott didn’t take a nickel. Scott held the polluter accountable. Shut down the wells." In fact, both sides are throwing up some fog here. The GOP is correct that Scott didn’t take a nickel from Hughes, but NextGen’s ad didn’t say he did. In the meantime, the Republicans are omitting a key point -- that Scott did take money from the Colliers, who are connected to the project referenced in the ad because they leased the land for the drilling. In the new ad, NextGen’s attack is somewhat careful in its wording. It didn’t say that Scott "is trying to hide it." That would have been more misleading -- these donations are a public record and Scott hasn’t done anything to restrict access to those records. Quite the contrary -- those donations have been reported by many media outlets, beginning in January 2013 when the Colliers first donated the money. But instead, NextGen said that Scott is trying to "hide from" the donations. There’s some truth there: When attacked over the donations, Scott’s camp released a statement that was essentially a misdirection. Scott’s statement failed to acknowledge that the landowners gave Scott’s campaign money, even though Hughes didn’t. Our ruling A NextGen ad says Rick Scott took $200,000 from the Collier family who leased their land for oil drilling "and now he is trying to hide from it." Actually, both sides are presenting self-interested portrayals of the truth. Scott called out NextGen for saying he had received Hughes’ money, but the group hadn’t explicitly claimed that he had, and the Scott campaign’s statement glossed over the fact that the campaign had indeed received money from Collier, a party who was integral to the drilling plan. For its part, NextGen’s charge that Scott is trying to "hide from" the Collier donations is exaggerated. The transaction was reported publicly per standard procedure, and there is no evidence that Scott has tried to restrict access to that information. Quite the contrary -- it has been discussed widely in media reports. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. So we rate this claim Half True.

They will all be gone.’ This is one of the ones where you can go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/04/tim-kaine/Kaine-Trump-said-undocumented-immigrants-will-al/	Vice presidential nominees Tim Kaine and Mike Pence used their only debate to attack the other candidate’s platform on immigration. Pence, the Republican governor of Indiana, criticized the Democratic ticket for an "open borders" policy (which is False), while Kaine, a Virginia senator, fired back on Donald Trump’s deportation plans. "When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said ‘no, we're building a wall, and we're deporting everybody.’ He said, quote, ‘They will all be gone. They will all be gone,’ " Kaine said during the Oct. 4 debate in Farmville, Va. "This is one of the ones where you can go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said." Trump has offered contradicting plans for deportations. He has said he would have a deportation force to round up people here illegally, and that while he wants families to stay together, "they have to go," but that there can be a "softening because we're not looking to hurt people, we want people." Kaine referenced Trump’s speech in Arizona on Aug. 31, where he outlined a 10-point immigration plan. We revisited Trump’s immigration speech to see if, in fact, Trump said immigrants in the country illegally will all be gone and that he plans to deport everybody. Trump has been steadfast on his plans to build a wall along the southwest border. But Kaine is oversimplifying Trump’s most-recent deportation priorities. When Trump got to point No. 3 of his immigration plan, he said there would be "zero tolerance for criminal aliens." He said that according to federal data, there are at least 2 million criminal aliens inside the United States. Trump, talking specifically about criminal immigrants in the country illegally, said his administration would begin moving them out "day one," working especially with police and law enforcement who "know who these people are." "They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone. "And you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone. "Beyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over. They're going out. They're going out fast." Trump did not say, as Kaine quoted, "they will all be gone," in reference to all people in the country illegally. However, in other parts of the speech, Trump stressed that non-criminal immigrants living in the United States illegally would also eventually have to return to their home countries and apply for re-entry. "Those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only: To return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined," Trump said. Trump’s campaign pointed to part of Trump’s speech in which he said after accomplishing his enforcement and deportation goals, including the construction of the wall, "then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain." But Clinton’s team pointed us to other parts of that speech where Trump said, "Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation." Trump went on to emphasize his priorities, including criminals, gang members and security threats. Our ruling Kaine said, "When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said ‘no, we're building a wall and we're deporting everybody.’ He said, quote, ‘They will all be gone. They will all be gone.’ This is one of the ones where you can go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said." Trump has not always been consistent about his deportation plans. But in Phoenix, he did not literally say of the entire undocumented immigrant population, "they will all be gone." He used that kind of language to describe his plans for immigrants who had committed crimes, saying they would be the first to go. However, Trump did say in the same speech that people here illegally today and who want to be legalized "have one route and one route only, to return home and apply for reentry like everybody else." Trump’s language in the Phoenix speech for the non-criminal pool of undocumented immigrants was more tamped-down than Kaine presented.

pomt-13737	Says Hillary Clinton and Ralph Northam "label police as racists."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/26/corey-stewart/corey-stewart-wrongly-says-hillary-clinton-ralph-n/	Corey Stewart, Donald Trump’s Virginia campaign chairman, recently laid blame on Democrats for the July 7 sniper shootings that left five Dallas police officers dead and nine wounded. "Liberal politicians who label police as racists - specifically Hillary Clinton and Virginia Lt. Governor Ralph Northam - are to blame for essentially encouraging the murder of these police officers tonight," Stewart, chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, wrote in a Facebook post shortly after midnight on July 8. We’re not fact-checking Stewart’s opinion that comments from "liberal politicians" triggered the Dallas shootings by a man who was upset by recent police killings of blacks in other cities. Our focus is investigating Stewart’s claim that Clinton and Northam have labeled police as racists. Stewart has rivalries with both Democrats. As Trump’s state chairman, he has a major role in trying to defeat Clinton this fall in Virginia. Next year, Stewart plans to seek the GOP gubernatorial nomination. That puts him at cross-purposes with Northam, who is the only announced Democratic gubernatorial candidate. Stewart doubled down on his statement in a follow-up Facebook post that said: "Va. Lt. Governor Ralph Northam and Hillary Clinton are pitting minorities against the police. Whenever there is a police shooting involving a minority, their knee jerk reaction is to allege racism." Trump’s campaign quickly distanced itself from Stewart’s statement that "liberal politicians" caused the Dallas shooting. "Corey does not speak for the campaign, and this is not something we agree with," Hope Hicks, Trump’s campaign spokeswoman, told The New York Times. Stewart’s social media posts don’t cite any comments by Clinton or Northam. So we asked Stewart to point us to specific statements by the two Democrats that prove both "label police as racists." He declined our request. We also reached out to the Republican Party of Virginia, to see if it’s aware of any comments that would back Stewart’s claim. The party didn’t provide any. "Not our statement," David D’Onofrio, a party spokesman, wrote in an email. So we looked on our own. Clinton After police fatally shot two black men this month - Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La., and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minn. - Clinton tweeted, "Alton Sterling Matters, Philando Castile Matters. Black Lives Matter." She attached a statement to her tweet: "Something is profoundly wrong when so many Americans have reason to believe that our country doesn’t consider them as precious as others because of the color of their skin." In a Jan. 16 primary debate, NBC News anchor Lester Holt asked Clinton about the 2015 fatal shooting of Walter Scott, a black man who was running away from a police officer in North Charleston, S.C. "We understand that a jury will decide whether that police officer was justified. But it played straight to the fears of many African-American men that their lives are cheap. Is that perception, or in your view is it reality?" Holt asked. Clinton said that, sadly, that is a reality. "There needs to be a concerted effort to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system," she said. "And that requires a very clear agenda for retraining police officers, looking at ways to end racial profiling, finding more ways to really bring the disparities that stalk our country into high relief." On the eve of South Carolina’s Democratic Primary in February, Clinton released a TV ad in which she lamented a "fundamentally broken" system where "African-Americans are more likely to be arrested by police and sentenced to longer prison terms for doing the same thing that whites do." Clinton said in the ad, "We have to face up to the hard truth of injustice and systemic racism." We asked Clinton’s campaign if it sees a distinction between her comments about "systemic racism" and Stewart’s claim that she labels police as racists. Sarah Peck, a Virginia spokeswoman for the campaign, sent us a series of Clinton statements this year voicing broad support for police officers. Here are a few: "I think the vast majority of police officers in our country are serving honorably and bravely, and that’s why it’s very important we support their work. That we respect their service," Clinton said during a July 8 interview with "ABC World News Tonight." "I think that most law enforcement is doing an excellent job. They are honorable, they’re working hard. But we don’t want to taint everybody with the problems that some have," she said during a Feb. 12 interview with WSPA-TV in Spartanburg, S.C. "Now I think you know, because I sure believe, there are many police officers out there every day inspiring trust and confidence, putting themselves on the line to save lives. So let's learn from those who are doing it right and apply those lessons across the country," she said during a Feb. 16 speech in Harlem, N.Y. Clinton has called for improved police training to combat "implicit bias." She also wants to create federal matching grants to help police forces buy body cameras to protect officers from unfair accusations and suspects from mistreatment. Northam Contrary to Stewart’s claim, we couldn’t find any comments by the lieutenant governor that even remotely accused police of racism. We searched the archives of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Washington Post, The Virginian-Pilot, The Roanoke Times and the Daily Press. We also combed through Northam’s website, his Facebook page and Twitter pages for the lieutenant governor’s office and Northam’s gubernatorial campaign. The only Northam statement we found on the violence was released shortly after the Dallas shootings and expressed grief felt by the lieutenant governor and his wife. "Pam and I are heartbroken over the horrific violence against the police in Dallas," Northam said in the written statement. "With so much violence and tragedy in Dallas, Minneapolis, and Baton Rouge, this is a time for our nation to come together and heal. Having cared for those who are wounded in service of our country, I know the sacrifice these officers make and my prayers are with the victims, their families, all first responders and all communities affected by violence." Alexsis Rodgers, Northam’s policy director and spokeswoman, told us the lieutenant governor’s office is perplexed by Stewart’s claim. Our ruling Stewart said that Hillary Clinton and Ralph Northam "label police as racists." He declined to offer any statements by the two Democrats that would back his claim. Clinton has said racial profiling needs to end and that law enforcement needs to confront "systemic racism" in the criminal justice system. That lends an element of truth to Stewart’s statement, but it’s a far cry from Clinton labeling all police as racists. Clinton has said repeatedly that the actions of a few officers shouldn’t taint all law enforcement officers. With Northam, we can’t find any statement that supports Stewart’s incendiary claim, and Stewart dodges his burden of proof. All told, we rate Stewart’s statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6eabf830-e0ae-41a5-9009-62513628fbe5	None	Corey Stewart	None	None	None	2016-07-26T10:08:52	2016-07-08	['None']

pomt-15231	Says Scott Walker's defunding of Planned Parenthood "left women across the state stranded with nowhere else to turn" for cancer screenings, breast exams and birth control.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/07/hillary-clinton/scott-walker-left-women-stranded-defunding-planned/	Well before the release of videos that ignited debate about the sale of fetal body parts, Republican Gov. Scott Walker boasted about defunding Planned Parenthood in Wisconsin. In a video of her own released Aug. 3, 2015, Hillary Clinton attacked Walker’s move. "When politicians talk about defunding Planned Parenthood, they're talking about blocking millions of women, men and young people from life-saving, preventive care, cancer screenings, breast exams, birth control. They're talking about cutting people off from the health care provider they know and trust," Clinton said. "Unfortunately, these attacks aren't new; they're more of the same. We've seen them in Wisconsin, where Governor Walker defunded Planned Parenthood and left women across the state stranded with nowhere else to turn." The claim by the leading Democratic contender for the White House runs counter to statements made by Walker, who has said during his presidential campaign that he simply transferred money from Planned Parenthood to other organizations. What we found is that when it comes to cancer screenings, breast exams and birth control, women in some parts of the state -- particularly those with lower incomes -- lost their local health care provider and might have to travel much farther for services. That’s because Planned Parenthood shut down five facilities after losing the state funding. At the same time, the closures were done in only certain parts of the state. And it goes too far to say the former Planned Parenthood patients have "nowhere else to turn," given that they were referred to other providers -- albeit, in some cases, providers outside their home community. Defunding in Wisconsin Clinton’s campaign cited a number of news articles that detailed the defunding as well as the fallout. We went to a Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin leader to fill us in further. Nicole Safar told us the group was getting public funding for family planning services (but none for abortion services) from three sources: a direct federal grant and from Medicaid, both of which continue; and from the state, in the form of an annual grant. Walker "defunded" Planned Parenthood by taking aim at the only source he controlled. In his first state budget, for 2011-’13, Walker proposed eliminating $1.9 million per year in state grants for family planning activities such as contraceptive services and supplies, pregnancy testing and cervical cancer screening. About $1 million of that had been going to nine Planned Parenthood clinics, with the rest given primarily to other private organizations and county health departments. In analyzing Walker’s proposal, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, said the potential effects were unclear. The clinics losing the state funding would have to replace those dollars or change their operations. On the other hand, most of the revenues generated for the services that those clinics provided came from sources other than the state. Before adopting the 2011-’13 budget, the Legislature rejected Walker’s proposal to eliminate the $1.9 million in grants. Instead, it reduced the amount to $1.7 million. But it also changed state law so that any agency that provides abortion services could not receive the money. That meant Planned Parenthood lost its $1 million-per-year allocation. Over roughly the next three years, Planned Parenthood closed five of the nine clinics that had been receiving the state money -- in Fond du Lac, Beaver Dam, Johnson Creek, Chippewa Falls and Shawano. (Currently, Planned Parenthood has a total of 22 health facilities in Wisconsin.) Safar told us that some 3,000 patients who had used the clinics that were shut down were referred to other facilities, but those women typically had to travel farther to get services. For example, women using the Planned Parenthood clinic in Shawano, which had been open for 34 years, were referred to a facility in Green Bay -- nearly 40 miles away. Most of the patients received discounted services because of their income. "There just aren’t providers on every corner willing to take low-income patients," Safar said. Kim Mueller, director of the Fond du Lac County Health Department, told us that lower-income women seeking birth control or treatment for sexually transmitted diseases were particularly affected by the closure of the Planned Parenthood clinic in Fond du Lac. "Planned Parenthood was amazing -- you could walk in and get care right away," she said. Though there still are Planned Parenthood facilities in neighboring counties, and some local physicians accept low-income patients, some women are less likely to get birth control or STD treatment if they have to travel longer distances and start relationships with new providers, Mueller said. It’s important to note that the reduced amount of state funding for family planning services -- $1.7 million -- was still allocated for family planning and the other services Clinton cited. And Walker’s campaign pointed out that the state has continued to fund another program that pays for mammograms, Pap tests and other health screenings. Our rating Clinton said Walker's defunding of Planned Parenthood "left women across the state stranded with nowhere else to turn" for cancer screenings, breast exams and birth control. Walker in 2011 eliminated all state funding to Planned Parenthood, which in turn closed five clinics over the next three years. The loss of those clinics meant women were referred to other facilities, in some cases a considerable distance away, in order to continue getting services. But Clinton’s statement goes too far in that Walker’s move affected only some parts of the state and it’s wrong to say women in those areas have "nowhere else to turn." For a statement that is partially accurate, we give Clinton a Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-08-07T05:00:00	2015-08-03	['None']

One was made by Randy Bryce, a Democrat who is running for the southern Wisconsin U.S. House seat being vacated by Republican Paul Ryan, the House speaker. Bryce, a union ironworker, was interviewed by CNN talk show host Don Lemon on March 14, 2018. Asked about the surprise win that night by Democrat Conor Lamb in a special House election in Pennsylvania, Bryce said: Well, he ran a very pro-union campaign. Being a union member, that’s something that’s been very important for me, standing up for working people. I mean, our campaign staff was the first to unionize in the history of politics. So, that’s something I’m very proud of. First ever? Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc Bryce's evidence Bryce’s campaign spokeswoman, noting it’s hard to prove something has never occurred before, told us she was not aware of any previous campaign staffs that unionized before Bryce’s campaign workers joined the Campaign Workers Guild and forged a contract with Bryce in December 2017. The deal was announced three months later. The union itself is new, having started organizing in early 2017. So we sought out experts in labor history. Asking the experts Of the 12 labor history experts we contacted (see the list of sources accompanying this article), none said they were aware of any previous campaign staffs that had been unionized. But none could say for sure that it had never happened. More fact checks on unions: Scott Walker: Did FDR oppose collective bargaining for government workers? Alberta Darling: Wisconsin lawmaker voted to allow using tax money to pay for Viagra for public school employees? Here are some of their responses: I suspect there have been staff who joined unions, but he (Bryce) may be the first to recognize and bargain with them. I don’t know of anyone who’s studied this question. -- University of Minnesota history professor William Jones I think we can say it’s true for contemporary politics. I am not going to vouch for anything prior to the National Labor Relations Act (signed in 1935) because I’m not sure we would know. -- Kate Bronfenbrenner, labor education research director at Cornell University I don’t know for sure, but it seems unlikely that in 200+ years no one did this before. -- Ruth Milkman, sociologist of labor and labor movements at City University of New York Graduate Center I don’t know of any, but that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. There is no central database for local unions, and many do not affiliate with a national union. Campaign staffs could have been unionized and we would never know. -- Rutgers University labor studies professor Dorothy Sue Cobble We also checked with the National Labor Relations Board, which also does not keep such records. The Office and Professional Employees International Union wasn’t able to help us and we didn’t hear back from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO). Our rating Bryce says: "Our campaign staff was the first to unionize in the history of politics." The dozen experts we consulted said they were not aware of any previous campaign staff unionizing, though they could not state flatly that it had never occurred.

pomt-05966	"When I was fighting against cap and trade, the speaker was sitting down with Nancy Pelosi on a sofa encouraging it."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/24/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-fought-cap-and-trade-newt-gingrich/	Mitt Romney fought back against surging rival Newt Gingrich, fresh off a South Carolina primary win, during the Jan. 23 debate in Tampa. To emphasize his credibility as a conservative leader, Romney brought up how Gingrich resigned as speaker of the House "in disgrace," and that he's been "working as an influence peddler in Washington" in the years since. And another thing... "When I was fighting against cap and trade, the speaker was sitting down with Nancy Pelosi on a sofa encouraging it," Romney said. Ouch. If you're a GOP presidential contender, it'd be hard to think of a more toxic couch-fellow than Pelosi, the leader of the Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives and a former speaker herself. But the bipartisan canoodling happened. We know because we've examined this line in some form twice this campaign season. It's been used by super PACs supporting Romney and departed candidate Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Back in 2008 in a television ad, Pelosi and Gingrich sat on a couch and had a smiley chat about climate change: "We don’t always see eye to eye, do we, Newt?" Pelosi says. "No," Gingrich answers, "but we do agree: Our country must take action to address climate change." Pelosi: "We need cleaner forms of energy, and we need them fast." Gingrich: "If enough of us demand action from our leaders, we can spark the innovation we need." The ad directs viewers to the website WeCanSolveIt.org, with the final words from Pelosi, "Together, we can do this." The commercial was created by a climate-change awareness organization now known as the Climate Reality Project, which former vice president Al Gore founded. (WeCanSolveIt.org is the old name of the site now called ClimateRealityProject.org.) Gingrich and Pelosi were asked to do the bit as part of a larger campaign featuring unlikely pairs who can agree on the need to act on climate change, Gore said in an interview with The Young Turks, an online news show, in December 2011. Gingrich has since renounced the collaboration, saying in a Fox News interview in November that it was "probably the dumbest single thing I've ever done." A section of his website called "Answering the Attacks" says, "Newt absolutely opposes 'cap and trade' as well as any system of taxing carbon emissions." What is cap and trade? The idea is that the government sets a limit (the cap) on how much carbon different companies can emit. The government then issues permits to businesses - typically electric utilities and manufacturers - and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those that lower emissions most effectively. The Gingrich and Pelosi ad didn't specifically mention cap and trade, but our previous research has shown Gingrich supported cap and trade as recently as 2007. Romney said that Gingrich was sitting on the couch encouraging cap and trade, but Gingrich didn't specifically mention the policy in that ad. This brings us to the second part of the claim, that while Gingrich was couch sitting, Romney was "fighting against cap and trade." Like Gingrich, Romney has changed his public statements on cap and trade. As Massachusetts governor in 2003, Romney joined in support of a compact among several northeastern states to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. In a letter to then-New York Gov. George Pataki, he said, "I concur that climate change is beginning to affect our natural resources and that now is the time to take action toward climate protection." The Economist named him a "Climate-Friendly" Republican in 2004. But in 2005, the same day he announced he would not seek re-election, Romney abruptly pulled out of the regional cap-and-trade agreement. He told the New York Times the pact did not protect businesses and consumers from increased energy costs. Environmental advocates fumed. Let's recap: Gingrich certainly appeared in a 2008 video with Pelosi and said "we must take action to address climate change." He didn't specifically promote cap and trade, though he had supported it in the past. It's also true that Romney rejected what was hailed as a landmark regional cap-and-trade agreement among several northeastern states in 2005 -- although it came after two years of him touting its merit. Both facets of Romney's claim are factual, though they did not occur simultaneously, as his use "while" would suggest. They actually were three years apart. We rate Romney's claim Half True.

pomt-05204	A new manufacturing plant is slated to create about 3,000 jobs in central and northeast Georgia and "create about a $3 billion infusion" into the economy.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/11/paul-broun/broun-manufacturing-claim-based-weak-proof/	Primary Election Day is less than two months away, which means U.S. Rep. Paul Broun of Athens is busy burnishing his accomplishments. Broun marked the recent launch of his re-election campaign by saying his proudest achievement is helping to lure the manufacturer Caterpillar to the Athens area, where it will open a plant to make construction equipment, he said in a television interview. Caterpillar’s factory is "going to create about 3,000 jobs here in central Georgia and northeast Georgia. It’s going to be about a $3 billion infusion of cash into our economy," Broun said May 23 on WMGT-TV in Macon. Those numbers make it sound like Broun is doing a heck of a lot for his constituents. But is he padding his resume? Landing the 1 million-square-foot Caterpillar plant was a coup for Georgia. Gov. Nathan Deal announced the victory himself, and both his office and Caterpillar headquarters issued news releases that described the plant’s economic impact. Caterpillar will invest about $200 million to open the plant, and it expects to employ 1,400 people when it opens for business in late 2013, the Governor’s Office announced. In return, the state and its taxpayers are giving the company a $75 million package of incentives. PolitiFact Georgia called and emailed Broun’s office for more than a week but received no replies. So we took to our own research and found that Broun’s figures are problematic. First of all, Broun’s figures don’t match the estimates by Caterpillar. Caterpillar’s news release about the new facility cited economic impact figures from Sharon Younger, who runs a market research firm with headquarters in Jackson, Tenn., that also specializes in public relations. Younger’s research was funded by Caterpillar, although she did not know what firm she was working for when she did her calculations, she told PolitiFact Georgia. Younger told PolitiFact Georgia that she estimated the impact for 12 counties that surround the plant’s site: Banks, Barrow, Clark, DeKalb, Gwinnett, Jackson, Madison, Morgan, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Rockdale and Walton. The Caterpillar plant will create more than 3,600 jobs for this area, and its economic impact will total about $2 billion in a single year when it starts running, Younger said. (In Caterpillar’s news release, she placed the impact at about $2.4 billion.) When compared with Caterpillar’s official estimate, Broun’s job number is about 17 percent too low, while his economic impact number is about a half-billion dollars too high. Also, Broun’s geography is wrong. Caterpillar’s impact figures are for counties in northeast Georgia only. None of the counties Younger considered are in Middle Georgia. Younger released only the bare outlines of her methodology, saying most of the information is proprietary. This means that no one can verify her numbers. Younger defended her estimates by saying that she used a standard method to make them. But that doesn’t mean her estimates are correct. PolitiFact Georgia frequently writes about economic impact studies, and we’ve found that the information she did not release can make the difference between a credible study and one that’s bunk. This is why: Researchers must predict how much a new factory will change economic activity in the local area in order to make an accurate economic impact estimate, according to the manual that outlines the method that Younger used and Bruce Seaman, an economist with Georgia State University. This prediction is crucial, Seaman said. If the Caterpillar plant gets all its parts and materials for its excavators from the Athens area, it’ll have a much bigger impact on the local economy than it would if it uses steel from China and electronics from Germany. Figuring out how much of this activity takes place locally can take a great deal of research. Younger said she did this work but did not detail how. Another impact estimate released by a University of Georgia expert is more conservative. Jeffrey Humphreys, the director of UGA’s Selig Center for Economic Growth, said the economic impact would be $1.4 billion, according to an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. For each job at the plant, 2.4 will be created across the state. Caterpillar’s estimate was for a smaller 12-county region. Humphreys was on leave and could not be contacted by deadline. How do we rule? Broun’s jobs figure is lower than those released by Caterpillar, while the amount of economic impact he described is at least a half-billion dollars higher than the one the company gave. Broun also gave an incorrect description for the region covered by Caterpillar’s economic estimate. It’s for northeast Georgia, not northeast and Middle Georgia. Caterpillar’s estimates were not peer-reviewed or conducted by an independent professional. Most importantly, the methodology behind them is not transparent. Broun’s overarching point is this: The new Caterpillar plant will bring a lot of jobs and inject a lot of money into Georgia’s economy. But he strays on some of the finer points, and PolitiFact could not verify the methodology used to come up with some of the numbers. His estimates need a lot of context and clarification, even though his larger point has merit. We therefore rule Broun’s statement Half-True.

pomt-07117	Says Ocean Spray is moving its Bordentown processing facility to Pennsylvania largely because of costs associated with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/20/diane-allen/sen-diane-allen-blames-regional-greenhouse-gas-ini/	Editor's Note: This Truth-O-Meter ruling is the subject of a story found here. Before Gov. Chris Christie announced plans in late May to withdraw from a cap and trade program, Republicans had added a new ingredient to the ongoing debate: cranberries. In early May, Ocean Spray announced plans to close its Bordentown facility, where the growers' co-op makes beverages, and relocate operations to the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania. On May 9, Republicans held a news conference and issued a press release to call for an end to the state’s involvement in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Under RGGI -- or "Reggie" as it’s called -- energy companies buy allowances to comply with a cap on carbon dioxide emissions. State Sen. Diane Allen (R-Burlington/Camden) cited Ocean Spray's move as an example of how the RGGI was hurting the state's businesses. "As a former president and CEO of a small business, I can attest to the impact rising energy rates have on an employer’s ability to add jobs and expand," she said in a May 9 news release. "Just ask Ocean Spray, which last week announced it will be moving its Bordentown processing facility to Pennsylvania, in large measure due to the costs associated with RGGI." PolitiFact New Jersey dug into her claim and quickly found it didn't have much juice: Five news articles and two TV segments about Ocean Spray's move didn’t mention any connection between the decision and RGGI. We checked with Adam Bauer, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, who said Allen’s comments were based on information she received from longtime cranberry grower Bill Haines Jr. According to Ocean Spray, Haines served on the Ocean Spray board of directors between 1996 and 1999, and then again in 2002. Haines never called us back, so we asked Ocean Spray. Company spokesman John Isaf said in an email that higher energy rates factored into the decision to leave Bordentown, but "not the RGGI program or its contribution to the rate." The decision, he said, "was based on a variety of factors -- lower energy costs, improved transportation and distribution (warehousing/freight) logistics; proximity to supply chain partners and customers; lower labor costs; other utility cost advantages (water/wastewater/gas); and a more efficient and modern infrastructure and facility," Isaf said in the statement. "While energy costs were one of several considerations that went into our decision, and NJ’s costs are significantly higher than other states, we were looking at the total rate paid, not the RGGI program or its contribution to the rate," Isaf said. That's enough for the Truth-O-Meter, but we thought it was also worth exploring the senator's underlying point, that the cap-and-trade portion is driving up electricity costs. Utility representatives and experts have an answer: not so much. According to Karen Johnson, spokeswoman for Public Service Electric and Gas, which supplies power to the Bordentown area, the cap-and-trade portion doesn’t affect electricity bills very much for a customer in Ocean Spray’s rate class. For the average customer in that rate class, the cap-and-trade portion -- meaning the cost of purchasing allowances -- accounts for 0.4 percent of the annual bill, Johnson said. Judi Greenwald, vice president of Innovative Solutions at the Virginia-based Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the effects of RGGI on utility costs have been mostly undetectable. "The rate impacts have been miniscule and probably not even perceptible," Greenwald told us. Across the 10-state region within the RGGI, the emissions cap accounted for between 0.24 and 0.61 percent of average residential electricity bills in 2010, according to a fact sheet prepared by RGGI. That impact represents 46 extra cents per month for a typical household’s electricity usage, according to the RGGI. In many cases, electricity prices in New Jersey are based on bids submitted by suppliers in non-RGGI states, according to Peter Shattuck, a carbon markets policy analyst for Environment Northeast. For instance, if a supplier in Pennsylvania, which is not part of RGGI, sets the price, New Jersey utilities are not facing RGGI-related charges, he said. So let’s review: Allen claimed that Ocean Spray was leaving Bordentown "in large measure due to the costs associated with RGGI." Yet Ocean Spray said it did not consider RGGI and its impacts on the energy rate. On top of that, a PSE&G spokeswoman and energy experts said RGGI has had a minimal impact on utility costs. We rate Allen’s statement False. To comment on this ruling, join the conversation at NJ.com.	None	Diane Allen	None	None	None	2011-06-20T05:15:00	2011-05-09	['Pennsylvania']
pomt-02380	Says Mary Burke's "2007-'09 state budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion -- costing every man, woman and child in the state an extra $310."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/16/republican-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-gop-says-mary-burke-scott-walkers-challe/	With a page on its website, the Wisconsin Republican Party claims Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke uttered four lies. We’ve already rated a version of one of the claims, about Burke’s service on the Madison School Board. And we rated versions of two claims regarding her time as state commerce secretary under Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle. We were struck by the final statement -- that Burke "says she’s on the side of the middle class," but that "Burke’s 2007-'09 state budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion -- costing every man, woman and child in the state an extra $310." Burke’s state budget? Was she governor? Asked for backup to the claim, state GOP spokesman Jesse Dougherty said Burke created the Commerce portion of the 2007-’09 budget; worked with Doyle "on his final product"; and promoted the overall budget. As we found in rating a similar claim by the state party in February 2014, Burke was responsible for and submitted the Commerce portion of Doyle’s overall 2007-’09 budget. We also found that she spoke out enthusiastically in favor of the overall plan, saying it "identifies our priorities for success." But to call it "Burke’s budget" is something different. The GOP might as well have called it Frank Busalacchi’s budget (he was Doyle’s transportation secretary at the time) or Kevin Hayden’s budget (Doyle’s health and family services secretary). For that matter, when Doyle’s 2007-’09 budget proposal was introduced it exceeded $57 billion, with the Commerce Department getting about $413.7 million, or less than 1 percent of the total. In Wisconsin, the state budget is set by elected officials, not appointed Cabinet secretaries. The governor submits a budget. The Legislature, typically after making changes, adopts the budget. Finally, the governor signs the budget into law. As for the rest of the claim, that the budget raised taxes by $1.8 billion, Doyle’s proposed budget did seek a total revenue increase of nearly $1.8 billion -- $1.37 billion in taxes and the rest in fees. Wisconsin's total population was about 5.67 million at the time, so the total increase in taxes and fees would have been about $310 per person. But, while the figures are essentially correct, the thrust of the claim is an attack on Burke. And to say Doyle’s budget was hers goes too far. Our rating The state GOP said "Burke's 2007-'09 state budget had a tax hike of $1.8 billion -- costing every man, woman and child in the state an extra $310." The figures are basically on target, but the real target of the party’s claim was Burke. And to put a governor’s entire state budget on an appointed Cabinet secretary is a misfire.

pomt-13914	Says Donald Trump called pregnant employees "an inconvenience."	true	/ohio/statements/2016/jun/24/hillary-clinton/clinton-trump-called-pregnant-employees-inconvenie/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton uncorked a torrent of criticism on her opponent, Donald Trump, at a rally in Ohio’s capital city. The premise: what America’s economy would look like with Trump in charge. "Over the years, he’s said all kinds of things about women in the workforce," Clinton said. "He once called pregnant employees -- and I quote -- ‘an inconvenience.’ " Clinton went on to say that even she was incredulous that Trump made remarks like the "inconvenience" statement, despite assurances from her researchers and speechwriters. We searched for the clip. Trump’s comment stems from a Dateline NBC interview of Trump from 2004. The segment, "Blonde Ambition," was about Carolyn Kepcher, Trump’s Apprentice sidekick and executive vice president of Trump’s golf properties. Kepcher had just released Carolyn 101, a memoir of her business experience. Kepcher describes herself as a straight-shooter, but as her Dateline interviewer points out, that seems to conflict with an anecdote in the book in which Kepcher recounts waiting six months before telling Trump that she was pregnant. "You were worried that he might feel inconvenienced?" the reporter asked. "Maybe, in my mind, he might think perhaps that this might be a setback," Kepcher answered. When the piece turned to Trump, he answered a question that the viewers don’t get to hear, due to editing. "Well you know, pregnancy is never, um -- it’s a wonderful thing for the woman, it’s a wonderful thing for the husband, it’s certainly an inconvenience for a business. And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business." Because the viewers don’t hear the question Trump is responding to, and the only other person to use the word "inconvenience" was the Dateline reporter, it’s possible that the term may have been introduced as part of the reporter’s question. Studies have shown that the costs of accommodating pregnant employees is minimal. The National Women’s Law Center published a fact sheet in 2012 that pointed out that the accommodations employers already provide for disabled employees are much the same as what pregnant women require, only temporarily. And the positive gains -- better recruitment and retention of workers, boosts in productivity, reductions in absenteeism, better workplace safety -- far outweigh any costs, according to the fact sheet. Trump’s views on pregnancy didn’t sway Kepcher’s admiration for her former boss. "If there’s one thing I’ve learned from Donald, it’s to make a decision, make it fast, and stick with it," she said. Trump certainly didn’t view his daughter Ivanka’s pregnancy as an inconvenience when she stood beside him, well into her third trimester, stumping in New Hampshire and South Carolina. Trump told crowds in both states that he’d love for his daughter to have her baby there. "You know, she had a baby like five days ago," Trump said of Ivanka at a March rally in New York, about 10 days after Ivanka gave birth. "She did a good job. So I should not say Ivanka, you're fired, right? I promise." We searched but were unable to find any additional comments made by Trump about women employees becoming pregnant. Our ruling Clinton said that Trump called pregnancy "an inconvenience" for business owners. Trump indeed used that word in a 2004 interview with NBC’s Dateline. "The fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business," Trump said. Clinton’s claim is accurate.

pomt-13329	"Gov. Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/05/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-recalls-mike-pence-comment-putin-stronge/	One of the themes of the vice presidential debate in Farmville, Va., involved Tim Kaine pressing Mike Pence on controversial statements made by either Pence or Donald Trump. Kaine, a Democratic U.S. senator from Virginia, tried particularly hard to pin his rival down on favorable statements about Russian leader Vladimir Putin. At one point, Kaine said, "Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not. Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. … Gov. Pence made the odd claim — he said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground. He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists. If you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class." Kaine hammered the point again later in the debate. "Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it. But Gov. Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama." Pence, the governor of Indiana, pounced, saying, "That is absolutely inaccurate. … He said he's stronger -- he's been stronger on the world stage." So who was right? A close look at the original comment suggests that both have a point, but neither is fully accurate. Understanding this claim requires going back to exchanges that occurred about a month earlier. On several occasions during the campaign, Trump had spoken admiringly of Putin. For instance, in NBC’s Commander in Chief Forum on Sept. 7, Trump said, "The man has very strong control over a country. It's a very different system and I don't happen to like the system, but certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader." The following day, Pence was asked about Trump’s remark in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Pence supported what his ticket-mate had said. "I think it's inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country," Pence said. "And that's going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president." So Kaine has a point that Pence did say something seemingly favorable to Putin’s leadership, saying he’d been "a stronger leader" than Obama. But Kaine related the remark inaccurately, saying Pence had said Putin was "a better leader than President Obama." Pence never used the term "better." As it turns out, Trump himself had used the word "better," at least twice. During a July 27 news conference in Florida, Trump said, "Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama, but who doesn't know that?" And on the July 28 edition of Fox & Friends, Trump did say Putin is "a better leader than Obama." But during the debate, Kaine didn’t say Trump said these things. He said Pence did. Meanwhile, Pence’s response to Kaine’s jab wasn’t airtight, either. First, Pence’s counterpunch seemed to conflate his own comments on Putin with Trump’s. And second, Trump was never explicit that he was referring to Putin's role on the "world stage." Our ruling In the debate, Kaine said that Pence had "said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama." Pence did say something very similar -- but not exactly as Kaine said. Pence had said that Putin "has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country." However, "stronger" is not identical to "better." We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-12382	"Rubio: ‘Rape victims should be in custody if there is suspicion that they’re planning abortion.’ "	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/01/uspoln/blogs-fabricate-marco-rubio-quote-about-putting-ra/	Bloggers revived an 18-month-old fake news story that greatly distorts Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s position on abortion. "Rubio: ‘Rape victims should be in custody if there is suspicion that they’re planning abortion,’ " reads the headline on USPOLN.com (short for U.S. political news). USPOLN.com, which describes itself as a "hybrid news/satire platform," published the article May 23, 2017. But the story talks about a statement the Florida senator allegedly made at a New Hampshire town hall during his presidential campaign, which ended more than a year ago. As its source, USPOLN.com links to a Nov. 8, 2015, story on politicono.com, also a regular purveyor of fake news. The article was flagged by Facebook users as potentially being fabricated. The article drastically veers away from Rubio’s real position on abortion. USPOLN.com made up this flippant, over-the-top quote and attributed it to Rubio: "I’m just totally against the whole shebang, I won’t deny it. I am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be. I mean, sure, okay, you were just violated in the most intimate way, and sure, you had to undergo a detailed physical examination afterwards, but that doesn’t mean you have the right to kill an innocent baby regardless of what it’s father has done to you, come on." Reporters and debate moderators asked Rubio about his position on abortion and rape victims on several occasions during his primary campaign. Rubio opposes rape and incest exemptions for abortion. He never said rape victims considering abortion should be jailed. In fact, Rubio has cosponsored legislation that bans abortions but includes exemptions for victims of rape and incest. He said he does not support these exemptions but recognizes that they are necessary to get more support for the legislation. "A rape is an act of violence," he told MSNBC’s Chuck Todd in August 2015. "It's a horrifying thing that happens. And fortunately the number of abortions in this country that are due to rape are very small, less than 1 percent of the cases in the world. But they happen and they're horrifying and they're tragic, and I recognize that." He added, "That being said, I recognize that in order to have a consensus on laws that limit the number of abortions, a lot of people want to see those exceptions and that's why I've supported those laws in the past, as has every pro-life group in America." USPOLN.com’s about page includes a disclaimer, warning readers that its articles "may not be reliable" and that they should consider "any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." Yet a perusal of the comments at the bottom of the article shows that at least some people fell for this explosive fake headline about Rubio. We rate this headline Pants on Fire!

pomt-09125	"Right now every single one of the (oil) companies here today and dozens of others are drilling for free in the Gulf of Mexico on leases that will cost American taxpayers more than $50 billion in lost royalties."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/16/edward-markey/markey-says-oil-companies-pay-nothing-gulf-drillin/	The ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has focused attention on a wide range of problems with the nation's regulation of how oil and other natural resources are extracted. One of those issues has to do with how much oil companies are paying the federal government for the right to drill offshore. At a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Environment on June 15, 2010, Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman, took aim at the oil companies whose executives were assembled as witnesses at the hearing. One of the claims Markey made was that "right now, every single one of the companies here today and dozens of others are drilling for free in the Gulf of Mexico on leases that will cost American taxpayers more than $50 billion in lost royalties." We decided to see if Markey was right. At first, we thought Markey was saying that no oil company pays anything for the right to drill in the Gulf. But we knew that was not true. In a previous item we noted that the Minerals Management Service -- the office in the Interior Department charged with regulating natural-resources extraction on federal lands as well as collecting the resulting royalties -- took in just under $10 billion in royalties and other revenues in 2009, placing it in the top 10 government offices for generating federal revenue. According to MMS, Gulf of Mexico revenues for oil alone for 2009 amounted to more than $61 million for Louisiana, $1.4 million for Mississippi and more than $285,000 for Alabama. But when we took a closer look at Markey's words, we realized that he was referring to a dispute over oil lease contracts from the Clinton era. These involve two related issues. One concerns drilling leases signed in 1998 and 1999. The other concerns drilling leases signed in 1996, 1997 and 2000. It gets complicated, so bear with us. In order to promote the extraction of certain kinds of natural resources, the Interior Secretary may exercise powers under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 to grant royalty relief to drillers. In the mid 1990s, when the latter law was passed, fossil fuel prices were low, so certain types of drilling projects seemed uneconomical without government assistance. The subsidies took the form of relieving companies from having to pay federal royalties on the resources they extracted. For 1996, 1997 and 2000, the lease contracts were written in such a way that the royalty relief disappeared once the market price of oil rose above a certain level. When the price reached that level, the companies would have to start paying a royalty. But the contracts for leases agreed to in 1998 and 1999 did not include any provisions for price triggers. So regardless of how high the market price rose, no company holding a lease that was signed in one of those two years would ever owe the government a dime in royalties. During the George W. Bush administration, MMS belatedly tried to persuade leaseholders to agree to pay royalties once a price trigger was reached, and the department had some success renegotiating the contracts. But many oil companies rejected MMS' proposals to insert a price trigger. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office -- the nonpartisan, investigative arm of Congress -- estimated that upwards of $1 billion in revenues had already been foregone from the 1998 and 1999 leases. It also cited a variety of scenarios that would suggest that the loss over 25 years from the 1998 and 1999 leases could total between $4.3 billion and $14.7 billion. But remember those accurately worded contracts from the 1996, 1997 and 1998 leases? Well, it turns out they're not locked down either. In 2006, Kerr-McGee, an energy company later purchased by Anadarko Petroleum Corp., sued the government, arguing that none of the price triggers from 1996, 1997 and 2000 were valid. In 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana sided with Kerr-McGee, and in 2009, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed. In September 2009, the federal government, in a brief written by Solicitor General Elena Kagan (now a Supreme Court nominee), asked the Supreme Court to take up the case. But it declined, effectively letting the lower court's decision in favor of Kerr-McGee stand. We should mention that it's possible that Congress could legislate a remedy that forces the oil companies to pay royalties despite what the contracts say and what the courts have ruled. In fact, efforts to do just that are under way, and they may get a boost from popular anger over the oil spill. But the chances of such a law being enacted are only speculative at this point, so, in addition to the lost royalties from 1998 and 1999, it seems reasonable for Markey to add in the lost royalties from all five years, as he seems to have done. And how big are those three additional years worth of royalties? When the GAO surveyed the data in 2008, the agency suggested that the government would have to refund more than $1 billion in royalties already collected, in addition to forgoing billions of dollars more that had been expected to materialize over the next 25 years. Reports by the GAO and the Congressional Research Service, Congress' nonpartisan research arm, offered wildly varying estimates, from a low of almost $16 billion to a high $60 billion. The fact is, forecasting the market price of energy -- not to mention the future production from drill sites -- as far as 25 years into the future means that even the best experts can make little more than educated guesses. Oil prices in particular are notoriously volatile even in the short term, much less on the scale of a quarter century. In the report, GAO itself urged the utmost of caution in assessing these various scenarios. The ranges for lost revenue "should not be viewed as probabilistic estimates of what actual forgone royalties will be, or even firm boundaries within which forgone royalties will fall. Rather, the scenarios reflect reasonable possibilities based on recent experience and possible future prices." So where does this leave Markey's comment? It's on the right track, but we do have some quibbles with it. First, he would have been better served if he'd chosen his words more carefully. We think a reasonable person hearing his statement -- but unaware of the controversy over the lease language -- would come away thinking that no oil company pays a dime for anything it pumps out of the Gulf. In reality, the companies pay tens of millions of dollars a year just to extract oil in the Gulf alone. Second, we believe Markey cites the $50 billion figure a little too blithely. He picked a number on the high end of an estimate range that will be subject to lots of cross-cutting influences over the next quarter-century -- first and foremost the volatile price of oil. If he'd said "leases that could cost American taxpayers more than $50 billion in lost royalties" -- rather than "will cost" -- he would have been on much safer ground. In an interview, Markey's office noted that the comment we fact-checked was an opening statement that summarized topics the hearing would address, and that lawmakers and witnesses proceeded to cover the topic of lost royalties in greater detail later in the hearing. They added that in Markey's view, the higher range of the estimate seems more likely based on their reading of oil price trends. But they acknowledged that the estimates are just that -- estimates and overall, we think many listeners would come away with the impression that the federal government was not getting any royalties when, in fact, the companies pay tens of millions of dollars a year just for drilling in the Gulf. In our view, Markey's comment, while broadly accurate, would have benefited from better specificity. So we find the claim Half True.

pomt-14950	Says John Kerry "is the first secretary of state to rely primarily on a government account."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/23/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-john-kerry-was-first-secretary-state-/	Members of the House Select Committee on Benghazi peppered Hillary Clinton with questions for about 11 hours on Oct. 22, 2015. As expected, Clinton’s use of a private email account and server was a topic of discussion. At one point, Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., pressed Clinton on whether she had told State Department officials about emails on her private server. Westmoreland: If they were gathering emails, you had to tell them that you had a private server when you were there. Clinton: Well, the -- the server is not the point, it's the account. And I made it a practice to send emails that were work-related to people on their government accounts. In fact, you know, Secretary Kerry is the first secretary of state to rely primarily on a government account. This is not the first time that Clinton, her staff or her supporters have talked about how other secretaries of state have used email. Of course, the historical comparison can’t go back very far because the country hasn’t had many secretaries since the advent of email. In fact, beyond Clinton herself -- and Kerry, who has to abide by a requirement to use departmental email -- we only have three secretaries of state to consider. They are Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright. Of those, Powell is the only one who used email very much at all. According to MSNBC, an aide for Albright said she "did not use email while she was in office" from 1997 to 2001. Similarly, Rice, head of the State Department from 2005 to 2009, was not a habitual emailer either, according to multiple reports. As Harf noted in a State Department briefing, "Secretary Rice has repeatedly said that she did not regularly use email," and a spokesperson for Rice told ABC, "She did not use personal email for official communication as secretary." Powell, on the other hand, took it as his personal mission to get the entire department on email. "I arrived at the State Department as secretary with a disastrous information system there," Powell said on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sept. 6, 2015. "And I had to fix it. And so what I had to do is bring the State Department to the 21st century." In his book It Worked for Me, Powell tells how he got Congress to pay for 44,000 new computers and put an Internet-connected machine on every desk in every embassy and every office in the department. "To complement the official State Department computer in my office, I installed a laptop computer on a private line," Powell wrote. "My personal email account on the laptop allowed me direct access to anyone online. I started shooting emails to my principal assistants, to individual ambassadors, and increasingly to my foreign-minister colleagues who like me were trying to bring their ministries in the 186,000 miles per second world." An aide to Powell confirmed his use of this personal email account in a statement to Politico. "He sent emails to his staff generally via their State Department email addresses," the statement said. "These emails should be on the State Department computers." So, Powell was on email, but it was through a private, not government email account. Our ruling Clinton said Kerry was the first secretary to rely mainly on a government email account. This statement is accurate, but it glosses over a bit of context -- that only one secretary before Clinton herself, Colin Powell, used email much at all while secretary of state. This undercuts the implication of Clinton’s claim, that there was a tradition of sorts of secretaries of state using private email accounts. It was a tradition of one. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-10047	"You and I know that in the history of mankind and womankind, government — federal, state, local, or otherwise — has never created one job."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/10/michael-steele/steele-government-never-created-job-opposite/	Michael Steele, the former lieutenant governor of Maryland, recently won a contest to lead the Republican National Committee. He also made history as the first African-American to lead the party. One of Steele's first appearances was before a retreat for House Republicans on Jan. 31, 2009. Steele praised the House Republicans for voting as a block against the stimulus package promoted by Democrats and President Barack Obama. Then he said that the stimulus was pointless, because government can't create jobs. "You and I know that in the history of mankind and womankind, government — federal, state, local, or otherwise — has never created one job. It's destroyed a lot of them. It's hampered a lot of them," Steele said. He went on to praise the diligence of the small business owners who "build prosperity, to realize the American dream." Listen to an audio recording of his remarks . This seemed a little strange to us: Many people work and retire from the federal government. The U.S. Postal Service rivals Wal-Mart as the nation's largest employer . Local governments tend to be the biggest employers in their communities when you count public school teachers and other school employees. A week after talking to the House Republicans, Steele appeared on This Week with George Stephanopoulos . Stephanopoulos showed Steele video of Republican Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida praising the stimulus bill. Steele didn't seem to back off the spirit of his previous comment. The exchange, which is a little long, went down like this : Crist (recorded earlier): "This program will help us with education, with health care, Medicaid specifically, infrastructure. These are the kinds of things that produce jobs. It could mean $13 billion to the Sunshine State. It comes at a time when we need it. People need jobs. It's about jobs, jobs, jobs." Stephanopolous (to Steele): "He suggests that you and Republican Party leaders here in Washington are on the wrong side of the biggest issue, jobs." Steele: "Well, no — you know, with all due respect to the governor, I understand where he's coming from. Having been a state official, I know what it means to get those dollars when you're in tight times. But you've got to look at the entire package. You've got to look at what's going to create sustainable jobs. What this administration is talking about is making work. It is creating work." Stephanopoulos: "But that's a job." Steele: "No, it's not a job. A job is something that a business owner creates. It's going to be long term." Stephanopoulos: "So a job doesn't count if it's a government job?" Steele: "Hold on. No, let me finish. That is a contract. It ends at a certain point, George. You know that. These road projects that we're talking about have an end point. As a small-business owner, I'm looking to grow my business, expand my business. I want to reach further. I want to be international. I want to be national. It's a whole different perspective on how you create a job versus how you create work." Stephanopoulos: "I guess I don't really understand that distinction." So we started looking for evidence that the government creates jobs. It wasn't hard to find. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that the federal government is the nation's largest employer, with more than 1.8 million employees, excluding the post office. "Competition is expected for many federal positions, especially during times of economic uncertainty, when workers seek the stability of federal employment," says a report posted on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site. "In general, federal employment is considered to be relatively stable because it is not affected by cyclical fluctuations in the economy, as are employment levels in many private sector industries." At USAJobs.com, you can look for a job with the federal government. On the day we looked, the Web site said, "There are 37,409 U.S. government job opportunities worldwide," and invited applicants to seek by job title, keyword, city, state or zip code. We looked at lists of largest employers published by local chambers of commerce and found many local government entities listed. We randomly selected Durham, N.C., for example, and found that the chamber in 2007 listed the public schools as the third largest employer with 5,489 workers. The city of Durham was seventh largest employer with 2,336 jobs. The Veterans Administration Medical Center as ninth with 2,162 jobs, and ... well, we'll stop there. Perhaps in his mind Steele was trying to make a point that private sector jobs are superior to public sector jobs. But that's not what he said. He said that "government — federal, state or local — has never created one job." Then, in the interview with Stephanopoulos, he implied that only businesses can create jobs, not government. Steele may not like government jobs, but he can't wish them away. For trying to pretend that government jobs don't exist, we rate his statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-12677	"Experts estimate that 40 percent of gun sales occur in no-questions-asked transactions that often take place at gun shows or on the Internet."	false	/florida/statements/2017/mar/16/hannah-willard/do-40-gun-sales-lack-background-checks-new-data-sa/	Sometimes even a zombie statistic faces its moment of reckoning. Today is one of those days. Several advocates of gun control addressed supporters and reporters at a Florida Capitol press conference to promote two bills that would tighten background checks for firearms (SB 1334 and HB 1113), including the Senate bill’s sponsor, Gary Farmer, D-Lighthouse Point. Several of the speakers offered statistics on gun violence and public opinion about gun-related policies. One of those was Hannah Willard, the public policy director of Equality Florida. She said, "Experts estimate that 40 percent of gun sales occur in no-questions-asked transactions that often take place at gun shows or on the Internet." Willard pointed us to her source -- a briefing page about background checks published by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The page offers essentially identical language to what Willard said at the news conference: To us, this was a familiar -- and imperfect -- talking point often raised by supporters of stricter gun laws. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe earned a Mostly False when he used it, as the statistic stems from survey data undertaken in 1994 and that included firearms given as gifts or inheritances, not just sold. When the authors of the study -- Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago and Philip Cook of Duke University -- adjusted the results to include only the guns sold, the number sold without background checks declined to between 14 percent and 22 percent. In 2015, Cook told PolitiFact that he and his co-author didn’t know whether their findings were relevant any longer, and added that no current national study had been published. We decided to check in again with the co-authors regarding Willard’s statement. Cook responded with some urgent news. "We finally have an up-to-date survey that provides a good answer to the question of what percentage of gun transactions do not involve a background check," Cook said. Researchers Matthew Miller, Lisa Hepburn, and Deborah Azrael published a study in the January 2017 edition of the journal Annals of Internal Medicine that was specifically undertaken to update the 1994 data. The researchers asked 1,613 adult gun owners where and when they acquired their last firearm, including whether it was purchased, and whether they had either a background check or were asked to show a firearm license or permit. The answer: 22 percent obtained their gun without a background check. That’s barely half of the 40 percent figure that has gained wide currency for more than two decades. The 22 percent figure "represents a smaller proportion of gun owners obtaining firearms without background checks than in the past," the authors wrote, though they emphasized that despite the smaller figure, "millions of U.S. adults continue to acquire guns without background checks, especially in states that do not regulate private firearm sales." When we asked Cook whether the new paper represented the definitive "stake in the heart" for this zombie statistic, he replied: "Exactly." In fact, Cook wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal, headlined, "At Last, a Good Estimate of the Magnitude of the Private-Sale Loophole for Firearms." In it, he wrote, "Even though I bear some credit (or blame) for the earlier estimate, I could not be more pleased to be done with it, given that it is based on data from a survey done more than 20 years ago and that, in any event, never directly asked participants about background checks." We will update with comment from the Brady Campaign if we get it. Our ruling Willard said, "Experts estimate that 40 percent of gun sales occur in no-questions asked transactions that often take place at gun shows or on the Internet." That statistic was already questionable, but by now it’s been definitively overtaken by a new study. The author of the old paper points to the paper published in January as the best estimate available, and it came up with a figure of 22 percent — just over half the percentage in the long-standing talking point. We rate the statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Hannah Willard	None	None	None	2017-03-16T18:45:59	2017-03-16	['None']

pomt-04616	Says U.S. Rep. John Barrow "left taxpayers on the hook for $950k study on genetic makeup of ants."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/18/national-republican-congressional-committee/barrow-gets-flak-vote-funded-study-ants/	Could Congressman John Barrow’s re-election chances come down to, of all things, ants? The Georgia Democrat recently released a television commercial portraying himself as a fighter against out-of-control spending in Washington. The National Republican Congressional Committee attempted to undercut Barrow’s efforts with a claim it says proves he’s no fiscal watchdog. "Barrow left taxpayers on the hook for $950k study on genetic makeup of ants," read the headline of an article on the NRCC’s website. The article claimed Barrow voted for legislation in 2009 that included sending $500,000 to Arizona State University to study the genetic makeup of ants to determine distinctive roles in ant colonies; $450,000 went to the University of Arizona to study the division of labor in ant colonies. "Georgia families know that in order to get rid of wasteful spending they need to get rid of John Barrow," NRCC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek wrote. The Republicans’ larger point about this is they want to link Barrow with President Barack Obama, who is portrayed by the GOP as a big-spending liberal. "Congressman John Barrow has supported [Obama’s] liberal spending agenda every step of the way," Bozek told PolitiFact Georgia. "His claims [otherwise] don’t pass the smell test." Republicans believe they have a good opportunity to defeat the four-term incumbent in November after the lines in the east Georgia congressional district he represents were redrawn. The new 12th Congressional District no longer includes Savannah, a traditional stronghold for Democrats. A 2011 Atlanta Journal-Constitution analysis found the district shifted from a 2 percent Democratic advantage to a 20-point Republican lean. Barrow is the only white Democrat in the House who represents a congressional district in the Deep South. Barrow has tried to portray himself as a moderate Democrat. His congressional website includes an email address for people to send ideas to "fix Washington," saying, for example, that the federal government spends billions of dollars on vehicles it doesn’t need. Barrow did not attend the recent Democratic National Convention. He claims to have voted 54 percent of the time with House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Republican from Virginia. In a recent TV ad, Barrow said he voted against funding for a lobster institute, holding one of the sea creatures for effect. So why would a congressman from Georgia vote to spend federal funds for researchers from Arizona to study ants? The answer lies in one of the largest government spending measures in U.S. history. Shortly after Obama became president in 2009, House Democrats took up legislation aimed at stabilizing the U.S. economy. The bill was called the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. It was commonly known as the economic stimulus. It entailed $787 billion in federal spending on infrastructure projects, unemployment benefits, expanded medical benefits and other government programs. The bill passed the then-Democratic-led House of Representatives by a 246-183 vote. Barrow voted in favor of the program. Not one Republican voted for the bill. Months later, Republicans began blasting the stimulus. U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who voted against the stimulus, complained about money funded for the ant research in his home state. "I had no idea that so much expertise concerning ants resided in the major universities of my state," McCain quipped at a news conference. "I must say, I say that with an element of pride -- but I'm not sure that it is deserving of these taxpayer dollars." Arizona State officials said the research helps further knowledge of evolution and societal behavior, which sheds light on understanding humans. A University of Arizona official said the research would help scientists learn more about how ants share scarce resources. "You don't think of it every day, but ants are really good at division of labor," Leslie Tolbert, the UA vice president for research, said in The Arizona Daily Star. Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo defended the congressman’s vote on the stimulus. He said the 407-page bill did not include references to ants or research to study the insects. The money came from $2.5 billion through the National Science Foundation to be spent on research that was unspecified in the bill. Carbo said it is disingenuous for the NRCC to say Barrow supported that amount of money for the research. "To say [Barrow] voted for it is inaccurate and false," Carbo told us. "If you look at the entire bill, there’s no mention of ants." Carbo said some Republicans from the Georgia Legislature have credited the package with helping the economy in this state. Bozek countered that Barrow’s support for the bill disappeared after the NRCC publicized the money for ant research. She cited a Sept. 11 report in The Savannah Morning News that Barrow recently removed a sentence from his campaign biography that he stood with Obama in support of the stimulus act. But is it fair to bash Barrow for voting in favor of the stimulus when it didn’t include any information that some funds would ultimately be spent on ant colony research? Bozek said the congressman should have known the stimulus would result in "wasteful spending." "John Barrow continues to try to and pass the buck for his failed leadership that cost Georgia taxpayers dearly," Bozek said. "While Barrow tries to hide the facts by deleting mentions of the failed stimulus from his website, Georgia taxpayers are left footing the bill for his wasteful stimulus plan." OK, so where does this leave us? Barrow did vote for the stimulus bill. It did not mention anything, however, about ant research, but some of the funds were used for such purposes. The NRCC headline is technically accurate, but it omits some important information to fully understand this issue. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-10143	McCain intervened on behalf of Charles Keating with federal regulators... that allowed Keating to continue his fraud at an incredible cost to taxpayers.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/06/barack-obama/obama-revives-an-80s-scandal/	Days after Sen. John McCain's campaign started attacking Sen. Barack Obama's past association with the 1970s radical William Ayers, Obama's campaign countered with a 13-minute Web video on McCain's history with convicted banker Charles Keating, Jr. The documentary burrows deep into the details of McCain's role in the Keating Five, a quintet of senators investigated for pressuring regulators on Keating's behalf prior to his notoriety as a villain in the late 1980's savings-and-loan crisis. This sentence, from a blurb introducing the video on a Web site set up by the Obama campaign on Oct. 6, 2008, best encapsulates their attack: "McCain intervened on behalf of Charles Keating with federal regulators tasked with preventing banking fraud, and championed legislation to delay regulation of the savings and loan industry – actions that allowed Keating to continue his fraud at an incredible cost to taxpayers." Let's check the evidence. Keating and McCain, both former Navy fliers, met at a Navy League dinner in 1981, and became friends and mutual supporters. Keating, a prominent Arizona banker, organized fundraisers for McCain's campaigns for the House and later the Senate, and donated $112,000 to McCain by 1987. He also hosted the McCain family at least nine times at his lavish vacation home in Cat Cay, Bahamas. "I genuinely liked him and enjoyed being around him, especially on those occasions when Cindy and I and our oldest child, Meghan, were invited to his family's vacation home in the Bahamas," McCain wrote in his 2002 book Worth the Fighting For: A Memoir . Keating complained frequently to McCain about regulations – and regulators – that he said threatened the success of the Lincoln Savings and Loan, a subsidiary of Keating's American Continental Corp. McCain was persuaded to act. On two occasions in 1987, he and fellow Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, Alan Cranston of California, John Glenn of Ohio and – in the second meeting – Don Riegle of Michigan, (all Democrats aside from McCain), met with federal regulators at Keating's request and asked them to back off Lincoln. During the second meeting, the regulators told the senators they suspected Lincoln of criminal misconduct, and intended to refer the matter to the Department of Justice. That took the senators aback – McCain, in particular, did nothing more on the matter after the regulators mentioned criminality, a Senate investigation later found. The regulators went on to recommend a criminal investigation of Lincoln, but little came of the recommendation until the government seized the failing institution in 1989. Different players in the drama have different interpretations of whether the senators' involvement delayed the investigation. But it is clear that indeed McCain "intervened on behalf of Charles Keating with federal regulators tasked with preventing banking fraud," as the Obama campaign claimed. In fact, McCain had intervened on Keating's behalf before. Having "heard frequently from Charlie" about a proposed savings-and-loan regulation called the "direct investment rule," Mcain tried to fight the regulation or get an exemption for Lincoln, he wrote in his book. "I sent or cosigned as many as five letters to (Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chair) Ed Gray and White House officials, and in January 1985, I cosponsored a House resolution calling for the promulgation of the regulation to be postponed," McCain wrote. "All such efforts came to naught, however. The rule was promulgated on schedule, and Lincoln's application for an exemption was rejected." So yes, McCain also "championed legislation to delay regulation of the savings and loan industry," the second component of the Obama campaign's claim. But here we have a quibble with the Obama campaign. It's hard to see how McCain's championing of the legislation "allowed Keating to continue his fraud," since the legislation failed. The Obama campaign did not respond to our requests to defend its claim. It's also important to note that the Senate Ethics Committee, after a 14-month investigation into the Keating Five, largely exonerated McCain, citing him only for "poor judgment." "The Committee concludes that Senator McCain exercised poor judgment in intervening with the regulators," the committee said in a statement at the conclusion of its investigation in 1991. "Senator McCain has violated no law of the United States or specific Rule of the United States Senate."' Nevertheless, revelations about his relationship to Keating tarred McCain. He did not reimburse Keating for $13,433 worth of airfare to Keating's home in the Bahamas until the trips were exposed years later by reporters in Arizona. And reporters also discovered that McCain's wife and her father had invested $359,100 in a shopping center with Keating in 1986. Keating was convicted in 1993 of 73 counts of wire and bankruptcy fraud, and served 50 months before the conviction was overturned because the jury had been told of his conviction in state court. In 1999 he pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud and was sentenced to time served. The government seizure of Lincoln cost taxpayers more than $2 billion, a sum that many would find "incredible," as the Obama campaign claimed. So it's clear that McCain did "intervene on behalf of Charles Keating with federal regulators" – language lifted almost directly from the Senate committee report. And McCain also "championed legislation to delay regulation of the savings and loan industry" – as he acknowledged in his own book. It's debatable whether the first of those actions "allowed Keating to continue his fraud," and the second certainly didn't, since the legislation didn't pass. But yes, Keating's fraud did exact a huge cost from taxpayers. We find this claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-06T00:00:00	2008-10-06	['Charles_Keating', 'John_McCain']
pomt-05976	"We have 25 million Americans out of work."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-there-are-25-million-americans-ou/	During the Jan. 23, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Fla., Mitt Romney said that "we have 25 million Americans out of work." But he’s not correct. Officially, there were about 13.1 million unemployed Americans in December 2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment statistics. This is the number that’s used to calculate the official unemployment rate, which during that month was 8.5 percent. But 13.1 million is only about half of what Romney claimed. What’s going on? Here’s the explanation. Some critics have long argued that the BLS definition of unemployment is too limiting, since it doesn’t count people who have stopped looking for work or who are working part time, even though they’d prefer a full-time job. So BLS also offers an alternative measure (known to economists as "U-6") that factors in both groups. Using this measure, BLS in December 2011 found an additional 2.6 million Americans who are "marginally attached" to the labor force, meaning they’d be ready to work if a job became available, and another 8.1 million Americans who are working part time but who would prefer a full-time job. Together, these three categories added up to 23.8 million people in September 2011, for a total "U-6" rate of 15.2 percent, or well above the official unemployment rate. So Romney is a little high for the broader statistic -- 25 million as opposed to 23.8 million -- but he’s in the ballpark. The question is whether it’s fair to describe these roughly 25 million people as "out of work." To make the definition work, you have to include the 8.1 million Americans who are "working only part-time for economic reasons." These people would certainly rather have a full-time job. However, we don’t think it’s accurate to describe them as "out of work." Our ruling While the U-6 measurement is not the official gauge of unemployment in the United States, it’s a valid statistic to consider in conjunction with others. However, Romney’s use of the term "out of work" seems to be a stretch when about one-third of the "25 million Americans out of work" are actually working part-time.

pomt-12559	"Here are some of the things that are more popular than Congress: hemorrhoids, Nickelback, traffic jams, cockroaches, root canals, colonoscopies, herpes. Even herpes, they couldn’t beat herpes in the polls."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/apr/14/arnold-schwarzenegger/congress-really-less-popular-hemorrhoids-and-herpe/	Do voters really have a higher opinion of hemorrhoids -- hemorrhoids! -- than Congress? Do they really prefer root canals, traffic jams and colonoscopies over this branch of government? Really? That’s Arnold Schwarzenegger’s colorful claim from a February 2017 video that went viral. He repeated the allegations in an April 12, 2017 post on Facebook. In the video, he points out the deep disdain for Congress but also notes that nearly all members are re-elected due to what Schwarzenegger calls a rigged political redistricting system, or gerrymandering. Here’s his claim in its raw form: "Here are some of the things that are more popular than Congress: hemorrhoids, Nickelback, traffic jams, cockroaches, root canals, colonoscopies, herpes. Even herpes, they couldn’t beat herpes in the polls." The former California governor and movie star has vowed to raise awareness about gerrymandering now that’s he’s finished as host of The New Celebrity Apprentice and squashed rumors he might run for U.S. Senate. While we know approval ratings for Congress are low, we wondered if they’re really as pathetic as Schwarzenegger wants us to believe. We set out on a fact check. Our research This isn’t the first time we’ve checked Schwarzenegger’s claims on Congress and gerrymandering. In February, we rated as True his assertion that, "The average margin of victory in the House of Representatives was 37%." He was referring to the average percentage point victory for both Democrats and Republicans in the 2016 election. We asked Schwarzenegger’s spokesman for evidence backing up his claim about Congress’ pitiful popularity. He pointed to results from surveys conducted by Public Policy Polling in January 2013 and October 2013. The polling company is known for conducting some tongue-in-cheek surveys and works with liberal clients. In the polls on Congress’ popularity, it asked hundreds of registered voters if they have a higher opinion of either Congress or a series of unpleasant or disliked things. Before we tackle those results, let’s look at Congress’ overall approval ratings in these recent PPP polls: -- January 2013: Congress’s overall favorability rating among voters was just 9 percent favorable and 85 percent unfavorable. -- October 2013: Congress’ overall favorability rating dipped slightly to 8 percent favorable with the same 85 percent unfavorable. -- March 2017: Congress’ overall favorability rating nudged up to 11 percent with only 68 percent of voters disapproving of it. Now, let’s tackle those head-to-head results: Hemorrhoids -- 53 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of hemorrhoids than Congress, which was favored by only 31 percent in this matchup, according to the October 2013 survey Nickelback -- 39 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of the rock band Nickelback than Congress, which was favored by only 32 percent Traffic jams -- 56 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of traffic jams, than Congress, which was favored by only 34 percent Root canals -- 56 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of this dental procedure than Congress, which was favored by only 32 percent Colonoscopies -- 58 percent of voters said they had a higher opinion of this invasive procedure than Congress, which was favored by only 31 percent Herpes The PPP surveys didn’t ask about herpes. It did ask, however, about gonorrhea. And Congress was still less popular than that venereal disease. A spokesman for the company that produced Schwarzenegger’s video pointed to a 2011 CNN op-ed where comedian and radio show host Dean Obeidallah claimed Congress was less popular than herpes, without citing evidence. Our ruling Arnold Schwarzenegger recently claimed: "Here are some of the things that are more popular than Congress: hemorrhoids, Nickelback, traffic jams, root canals, colonoscopies, herpes. Even herpes, they couldn’t beat herpes in the polls." Surveys by the Public Policy Polling mostly back-up Schwarzenegger’s dramatic claim. It should be noted, however, that the polls were conducted about four years ago and don’t include a comparison of Congress to herpes. Congress’ overall approval rating has remained in the dumps since that time, rising only slightly from 8 percent to 11 percent. It’s disapproval rating has, however, shrunk somewhat from 85 percent to 68 percent. We rate Schwarzenegger’s claim Mostly True.

Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus was on set to answer how the GOP, still waging an internal war, would come together to defeat Clinton in 2016, assuming she runs. Priebus, though, said Republicans have a much deeper bench of heavyweights, adding that Clinton’s star is fading. "We're now running with a lot of great people that have a vision for this country like Bobby Jindal, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rand Paul, and others, in my own state of Wisconsin, that are very dynamic," Priebus said. "And it looks like Hillary Clinton is getting ready. She went from a 70-percent approval rating down to ... 52 in 18 months." (Priebus stumbled slightly over the final approval number but corrected himself to say 52.) Has the shine really worn off that much since Clinton left office in January 2013? We asked Priebus to back up his numbers. GOP spokesman Sean Spicer pointed us to new data from a Bloomberg National Poll. In December 2012, Clinton received very high marks from Bloomberg’s respondents. At the time, 70 percent of those surveyed had either a very favorable or mostly favorable view of the Secretary of State. And how did she do in Bloomberg’s recent poll? On June 12, 2014, Clinton had a net favorable rating of just 52 percent, a drop of 18 points. So, Priebus is right, right? Not entirely. The Bloomberg poll released in 2012 is pretty far off the average for polls taken around that time, making it a bit of an outlier. While a couple of other polls in late 2012 and early 2013 put Clinton's favorability at 67 percent, other polls (like CBS) had it around 55 percent. The Huffington Post Pollster, which aggregates and averages most credible polls, put Clinton’s favorability rating at 58.2 percent on Dec. 9, 2012. Where is it at now? It’s at 52.6 percent. That’s definitely lower than where it was just 18 months ago, but it’s not nearly as drastic of a drop as Bloomberg found. It’s also up from where it was in December 2013, when Clinton bottomed out at 49.3 percent favorable, suggesting perhaps that Clinton is on the rebound, instead of a downward spiral. (The high point for Clinton since 2009 was actually January 2011, when about 62 percent viewed her favorably.) Here’s Clinton’s favorability over time. "If we look at individual polls, then one can find results close to those cited (by Priebus), but only by ignoring other polls," said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll. "The trend, which doesn’t cherry-pick polls but averages across all of them, finds a move from 56.1 (when she left office) to 52.6." For PolitiFact, Franklin analyzed polls that have asked Clinton-specific questions at multiple times and found an average decline in those polls of about 8 points in the last 12-20 months. This won’t weigh into our rating, but since Priebus singled out a few names, we thought it would be interesting to compare Clinton’s performance against them in a hypothetical election. We used Pollster’s average (which didn’t have enough data on Clinton vs. Jindal to for us include the Louisiana governor). Opponent January 2013 June 2014 Clinton vs. Jeb Bush 55.7 to 35.8 53.5 to 39.8 Clinton vs. Chris Christie 49.1 to 40.0 51.9 to 39.9 Clinton vs. Rand Paul 52.2 to 41.6* 52.9 to 40.3 Clinton vs. Paul Ryan 55.7 to 37.2 52.0 to 37.9 *Earliest polling data was March 2013 So, while Priebus makes the case that the GOP has a handful of candidates well suited to take on a diminishing Clinton brand, actually, despite a drop in favorability, she continues to do relatively well against the Republicans he mentioned. She would beat all four we looked at if the election were held today, and has only seen her lead shrink slightly against Bush and Ryan. (It’s gone up against Christie and Paul.) Our ruling Priebus said Clinton "went from a 70-percent approval rating" down to "about 52" in 18 months. Her favorability dropped 18 points in one poll from Bloomberg during that time. But Bloomberg’s poll from December 2012 had Clinton’s favorability 12 points higher than the average poll taken around the same period. It’s true Clinton’s numbers are down overall since the end of 2012, so we’ll give Priebus credit for identifying the trend and accurately citing one recent poll, but we’ll also knock him a few points for cherry-picking his findings to exaggerate her fall. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2014-06-15T18:11:08	2014-06-15	['None']
pomt-07023	U.S. Reps. John Barrow and Sanford Bishop and their fellow Democrats "went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/05/national-republican-congressional-committee/republicans-blame-blue-dog-democrats-federal-spend/	Members of Congress are bickering over the debt ceiling, which means they’re also arguing over who’s to blame for the national debt. Recently, nearly identical news releases from the National Republican Congressional Committee targeted two moderate Georgia Democrats. "John Barrow and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out," read one. "Sanford Bishop and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out," read the other. Are Congressmen Barrow, Bishop and their fellow Democrats really responsible for maxing out the federal credit card? Fortunately for Georgia’s Truth-O-Meter, our sister site PolitiFact Ohio has already looked into an NRCC news release about Democrat U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton. It was also sent May 18. "Betty Sutton and her fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out," it read. Sound familiar? The NRCC sent about five dozen news releases just like it May 18, each targeting a different member of Congress. Even though the U.S. House of Representatives voted to reject the debt ceiling increase May 31, the blame game is likely to continue. Lawmakers are trying to broker a deal before Aug. 2, when the U.S. Department of Treasury says it will be unable to pay the bills unless it borrows more money. Now back to the NRCC. PolitiFact Ohio decided its accusation against Sutton was Barely True. Republicans and Democrats share the blame. Tax cuts on higher-income earners passed under President George W. Bush and backed by Republicans played a substantial role in the nation’s annual deficits, according to the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan policy and legal analysis to Congress. Some argued the cuts can actually pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth. But PolitiFact has previously found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts led to revenue totals that are lower than they otherwise would have been -- even if they spur some economic growth. Extending all of them permanently, as many in the GOP would like, would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits. The recession hurt federal tax revenue as well. Add in the cost of the wars that began under Bush and continue under President Barack Obama, and you’ve got a good-sized debt, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues. Just two policies dating from the Bush administration -- tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- accounted for more than $500 billion of the deficit in 2009 "and will account for $7 trillion in deficits in 2009 through 2019, including the associated debt-service costs," the center said. A federal budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation begs to differ. He said the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities cherry-picked spending and tax policies that liberals dislike and blamed them for the entire problem. They could have easily scapegoated Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare or any number of other programs with bipartisan appeal. We think it’s safe to say that both Republicans and Democrats are cherry-picking their data. Expenditures backed by both parties have helped put the federal government in the red. And now we focus on Barrow, who hails from Savannah, and Bishop, who is from Albany. Both are congressional veterans. Both are Blue Dog Democrats, or a group of moderates in Congress who pride themselves on fiscal conservatism. Both faced tougher-than-expected re-election races in 2010. Both voted against raising the debt ceiling in the May 31 vote. And they both represent districts that Republicans think they can win. An NRCC spokeswoman cited various votes they made as evidence that Barrow and Bishop are spendthrifts. Both voted for the 2009 stimulus package, for instance. They also voted to raise the debt limit in December 2009 and February 2010. But as Blue Dog Democrats, Barrow and Bishop supported efforts to cut the deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years and eliminate programs that are out of date, inefficient or duplicate the efforts of another program, according to statements by the group. Barrow is chairman of the Blue Dog policy committee, which hammered out the group’s initiatives on balancing the budget and cutting spending. Barrow spokesman Christopher Cashman argued that the NRCC cherry-picked from the congressman’s record when it argued he was on a spending spree. Those votes are only a tiny portion of the ballots he has cast during his congressional career. Cashman brought up more than a dozen other votes and initiatives as proof that his boss is no big spender. They included three 2011 votes for spending cuts. Bishop voted with Barrow in all of them. Also, Barrow and Bishop co-sponsored a bill that calls for amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget. Barrow and Bishop have voted for spending bills, but members of Congress of all stripes vote to spend money. That’s part of their job. Once again, the NRCC is guilty of cherry-picking. Whether you agree with their individual votes, the records of these Blue Dog Democrats show it’s unfair to say they’re on a "spending spree." Since these Georgians are keeping an eye on the nation’s credit card statement, we rule the NRCC’s statement False.

pomt-10009	Obama nominee Dawn Johnsen "called motherhood 'involuntary servitude.'"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/24/house-republicans/Republicans-accuse-White-House-nominee-Johnsen-of-/	Republicans have made it clear they're opposed to the nomination of Dawn Johnsen to head the White House Office of Legal Counsel. They're unhappy with her support of abortion rights, but a recent blog posting made a surprising allegation: That she said motherhood was "involuntary servitude." We wondered if she was really was so impolitic as to attack motherhood. And if so, does she have it in for apple pie as well? The allegation came from the Web site of the House Republican Conference: "At least 45 House Republicans have co-signed a letter to President Barack Obama in opposition to his nomination of Dawn Johnson [sic] for the head of the Office of Legal Counsel," the site says in a blog post . The post continued: "Her brazen pro-abortion stances [include] a Supreme Court amicus brief where she called motherhood 'involuntary servitude.'" The Republicans are referring to a 1989 brief in Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, a case that tested whether states could prohibit abortions in public health institutions. Johnsen was then legal director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, one of 77 organizations to sign the brief. Footnote 23, part of the brief that Johnsen said in a Senate hearing that she wrote, said the following: "While a woman might choose to bear children gladly and voluntarily, statutes that curtail her abortion choice are disturbingly suggestive of involuntary servitude, prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment, in that forced pregnancy requires a woman to provide continuous physical service to the fetus in order to further the state's asserted interest. Indeed, the actual process of delivery demands work of the most intense and physical kind: labor of 12 or more grueling hours of contractions is not uncommon." So Johnsen compared "forced pregnancy" — not motherhood — to involuntary servitude. After we asked the Republican Conference about the claim, staffer Ericka Andersen acknowledged it was wrong. "You are correct that the post was written inaccurately," she told us in an e-mail. She corrected the post to say Johnsen "equated forced pregnancy with 'involuntary servitude.'" Kudos to the conference for acknowledging the error. But we still find the original claim False.

pomt-02690	The No. 2 owner of Fox News is Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who said, "A strong American Government is not good for us."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/06/facebook-posts/facebook-group-no-2-owner-fox-news-prince-alwaleed/	The Facebook post with the man in traditional Arab dress and a herd of camels purports to be a public service announcement. The meme identifies the man as "Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal" and quotes him as saying, "A strong American Government is not good for us." The twist: "#2 Owner of Fox News. Just thought you should know." The post by Americans Against the Republican Party was shared and liked thousands of times, generating a ton of discussion. A reader asked us to weigh in. The royal billionaire We reached out to the group, linked to liberal site Addicting Info, but did not hear back. We also had no luck reaching spokespeople for Fox News or the prince. A trail of public records and flashy news stories helped fill in some of the blanks. Not all. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Alsaud, 58, whose grandfather was the founding king of modern Saudi Arabia, is no stranger to the United States or Western media. He considers himself a "great friend" of America and the "world’s foremost value investor." He’s really rich: Like, flowers flown in from Holland on a weekly basis to his palace rich; Private zoo at his country estate rich; First person in the world to order an Airbus A380, a double-decker jet with space for luxury vehicles, horses and a pivoting prayer space that always points to Mecca, rich. The American-educated multibillionaire has made investments around the world, including many in Western entities such as CitiGroup, the George V hotel in Paris, the Plaza hotel in New York, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, Apple, TimeWarner, Saks, Twitter (here’s his account) and yes, News Corp. In July 2013, Bloomberg rated him the 16th richest man in the world, with a net worth of $26.6 billion. Forbes ranked him No. 26 earlier at $20 billion and followed up with a story about his wealth that infuriated Alwaleed, who threatened to sue for libel and said the magazine undervalued his net worth. Forbes defended its work. Best we can tell, the picture is of Prince Alwaleed. Fox financials Alwaleed’s interest in News Corp., the media conglomerate of Rupert Murdoch and once-parent company to Fox News, started in 1997 with a $400 million investment, according to a description of the investment on Alwaleed’s Kingdom Holding Co.’s website. That was 3 percent of News Corp.’s worth. In 2005, he increased his holding to 5.5 percent, the site states. The picture is a little different now because News Corp. split into two companies in June 2013 amid fallout from the company’s phone-hacking controversy with its British newspapers. The move spawned a new News Corp., housing publications such as the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and Vogue. A second company, 21st Century Fox, oversees movies and TV programming, including the Fox News Channel. Murdoch is chairman of both companies and controls just under 80 percent of the voting stock in each (between himself and his family trust). Who’s next in line? According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, it’s Alwaleed. Alwaleed owns 7 percent of Class B voting stock with 21st Century Fox, second only to Murdoch, as of Aug. 19. The filing notes, in compliance with federal securities law, 40 percent of Alwaleed’s voting rights are suspended because he is not an American citizen. He is the third largest stockholder in the new News Corp., trailing Murdoch and an investment firm, with a 6.6 percent stake. The relationship with Murdoch is reciprocal. News Corp. has a sizable stake in Rotana, a broadcasting company that airs Arabic and English programming in the Middle East. Alwaleed owns an 80 percent stake of Rotana, according to Bloomberg. So Alwaleed has a sizable interest in Fox News, second in one aspect only to Murdoch. Experts told us that translates to being the No. 2 owner of Fox News. It’s accurate to say he’s the No. 2 owner, but he’s more of a passive major shareholder, said Jay Ritter, University of Florida finance professor, pointing out Alwaleed does not have a seat on the company’s board of directors. His investment resembles other stocks held in major companies by mutual funds and investment firms, who invest big in public companies but do not intend to take over. What about the quote? In many ways, the crux of this fact-check is whether Alwaleed said, "A strong American Government is not good for us." Who the "us" is in the meme is not clear -- it could mean Fox News. Or it could mean Saudis or Muslims. We searched for the quote in the meme in full and in part using Lexis Nexis and Google, with the assistance of a news researcher. It did not come up. A Google search of the full quote reveals few results, mainly linking to message boards or Facebook comments about the meme. The closest thing to the supposed quote we found came from a June 2013 Wall Street Journal article about U.S. shale-oil production. Alwaleed was quoted in a letter saying the rise in U.S. oil production would be a threat to Saudi Arabia. "We see that rising North American shale gas production is an inevitable threat," he wrote. It’s possible the meme wildly conflated those comments. But even if so, the context is wildly misleading. Our ruling Internet memes sometimes make us laugh. This one is frustrating. The post is correct that Prince Alwaleed is the No. 2 owner of Fox News (technically, 21st Century Fox, the giant movie and TV corporation that owns the network). It’s one of his many Western investments. But we found no evidence the frequent guest of American media actually said, "A strong American government is bad for us." We especially could not find it uttered under the context in which the meme may intend for you to understand it: that a strong American government is bad for Fox News. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-01-06T10:44:36	2013-12-29	['Fox_News_Channel', 'Al-Waleed_bin_Talal']
pomt-06582	"At nearly 19 million people, the population of Florida is larger than all the earlier primary and caucus states combined."	true	/florida/statements/2011/sep/27/rick-scott/gov-rick-scotts-primary-math-florida-has-more-peop/	Gov. Rick Scott rallied Republican activists at Florida's Presidency 5 straw poll with an argument for the state's supremacy in choosing the party's presidential contender. "None will have a greater impact on the selection of the nominee than our own primary in the Sunshine State," Scott told a crowd of 3,500 on Sept. 24, 2011. While other primaries or caucuses might be earlier, he said, Florida's population and diversity set it apart. "At nearly 19 million people, the population of Florida is larger than all the earlier primary and caucus states combined," he said. The Republican National Committee allows just Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada to vote in February 2012 without penalty. Florida has yet to choose its primary date. But state lawmakers would like to see it as early as possible, saying it better reflects the country than the four "early" states and should play an agenda-setting role. As Scott made his plea, we wondered: Is the population of Florida larger than Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada combined? We turned to the U.S. Census Bureau: 2010 population Iowa: 3 million New Hampshire: 1.3 million South Carolina: 4.6 million Nevada: 2.7 million Total: 11.7 million Florida: 18.8 million So, Scott's right on. Florida's "nearly 19 million people" does eclipse the early states' nearly 12 million. (Now, that doesn't tell us who actually votes there — but he didn't say voters, so we won't quibble.) Meanwhile, in case you were interested, the state's diversity does indeed better track the nation than those states. Iowa and New Hampshire are more than 90 percent white, while the nation is closer to 70 percent. South Carolina and Nevada are less white than the rest of the country, around 66 percent, with a heavier black population in the South and Hispanic and Latino population in the West. Here's how Florida compares to the nation: Florida Nation White 75% 72.4% Black 16% 12.6% American Indian/Alaska native 0.4% 0.9% Asian 2.4% 4.8% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 0.1% 0.2% Reporting two or more races 2.5% 2.9% Hispanic/Latino 22.5% 16.3 Scott said "the population of Florida is larger than all the earlier primary and caucus states combined."

pomt-03962	"The 12 hottest years on record have come in the last 15 years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-12-hottest-years-record-have-com/	During his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama touted the country’s progress in reducing carbon pollution emissions but added that recent advances in fuel efficiency and renewable energy have not done enough to curb climate change. "For the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change," Obama said. "Now, it’s true that no single event makes a trend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods – all are now more frequent and more intense." In 2012, the country experienced severe weather threats including drought, a devastating Hurricane Sandy and severe thunderstorms. We decided to fact-check whether the 12 hottest years on record have all come since 1998. The White House directed us to NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which tracks global surface temperatures. The institute concluded that 2012 was the ninth-warmest year on record, with 2010 and 2005 being the all-time highs. For the contiguous United States, 2012 was the country’s warmest year yet. It beat the previous record by one degree Fahrenheit. (Science nerds can read more about how these temperatures are calculated here and here.) Reto Ruedy, a program manager at the Goddard Institute, told PolitiFact that the institute’s data produces the following ranking of hottest years. Items on the same line are statistically tied. 1-2: 2010, 2005 3-8: 2007, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2009 9-12: 2012, 2011, 2001, 2004 13: 2008 14: 1997 15: 1995 This analysis shows that 13 of the warmest years have occurred in the past 15 years. Alternately, one could say that 12 of the warmest years came in the last 13. We see a few other issues to note. • The NASA data set isn’t the only one available. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also analyzes global surface temperatures using its own methodology. The two measurements diverge somewhat -- NOAA considers 2012 the 10th-warmest year on record since records began in 1880, rather than the ninth. However, NOAA’s data for land and ocean temperature anomalies shows that 14 of the past 15 years were the hottest on record. • There are other ways one could measure "hottest years." Kevin Trenberth, a scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, agreed with the 13-of-15 calculation. But he added that the NASA and NOAA values refer to global mean surface temperature. "One could define ‘hottest’ in other ways, such as by how much Arctic sea ice there is," he said. Our ruling Obama said, "The 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15." Data from NASA shows 13 of the hottest years on record have come in the last 15, and by a different data set produced by NOAA, 14 of the hottest years on record have come in the last 15. Obama was actually over-cautious in his statement, so we rate his statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-02-15T11:25:23	2013-02-12	['None']

pomt-04054	Says Chris Christie "vetoed" a "jobs package" of "30 bills."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/27/stephen-sweeney/stephen-sweeney-says-chris-christie-vetoed-package/	The Democrat-led state Legislature handed 30 bills aimed at spurring job growth to Gov. Chris Christie, but the Republican governor took his veto pen to the entire package, according to Senate President Stephen Sweeney. Sweeney made that claim during a Jan. 8 interview on The Dom Giordano Show on Talk Radio 1210 WPHT. After Sweeney criticized the governor, Giordano asked him what he would do differently from an economic perspective. "We gave him a jobs package, Dom, that he vetoed, and because it was our package," said Sweeney (D-Gloucester). "You know, the funny thing is, you’ve got to do something. You just can’t do nothing." Sweeney quickly added, "We gave him 30 bills that, by the way, were bipartisan." But the senator’s claim is misleading for two main reasons: While Christie conditionally vetoed certain bills, the governor later signed them after the Legislature concurred with his recommendations. Secondly, Sweeney’s claim ignores the fact that the governor signed several other bills meant to assist businesses and create jobs. First, let’s discuss the conditional vetoes. To back up the senator’s claim, Sean Kennedy, associate executive director of the Senate Democrats, provided a list of 30 bills that Christie vetoed in different ways between 2010 and 2012. For the most part, those bills received absolute vetoes or conditional vetoes. An absolute veto means the governor rejected the legislation outright, while a conditional veto means Christie agreed to sign the bill if the Legislature made certain changes. But of the nine conditional vetoes cited by Kennedy, eight of them involve bills that Christie later signed after the Legislature approved his proposed changes. So, it’s disingenuous for Sweeney not to acknowledge how versions of those bills were ultimately signed into law. Now, we’ll talk about other jobs-related bills signed by Christie. The majority of the bills cited by Kennedy were originally part of what Sweeney and other Democrats called the "Back to Work NJ" legislative package. The Legislature approved that package of roughly 30 bills in early 2011. Christie issued absolute vetoes on at least 15 bills, all of which were considered to be part of that package, including ones cited by Kennedy. Democrats later tried to override some of those vetoes, but failed to secure enough votes. But here’s what Sweeney failed to mention: several other bills labeled by Democratic legislators as part of that package were ultimately signed by Christie. The governor signed at least 16 bills described in Democratic news releases as being part of the "Back to Work NJ" package. Those bills include 12 bills signed by Christie without any changes and four bills cited by Kennedy as first being conditionally vetoed. Christie conditionally vetoed at least one other bill within that package, but the Legislature did not accept his recommendations. In addition to the "Back to Work NJ" bills, the remaining bills cited by Kennedy include legislation vetoed in 2010 and early 2012. We told Kennedy that, taken as a whole, those 30 bills don’t constitute a "package," since they were sent to Christie at different times. In response to our findings, Kennedy said the following in an e-mail, and then declined further comment: "All of the jobs bills acted on by the Senate were part of our jobs package, regardless of the timeframe in which they were done. The fact remains the governor vetoed 30 bills sent to his desk that would have created jobs and improved the economic climate in this state. In addition, in the Senate, it is the Senate President who defines what constitutes our jobs package." Our ruling In a radio interview, Sweeney claimed that Christie "vetoed" a "jobs package" of "30 bills." It’s correct to say the governor vetoed numerous bills aimed at supporting businesses and job growth, and thus stopped them from becoming law. But of the bills cited by the senator’s representative, eight were ultimately signed into law after the Legislature concurred with the governor’s recommendations. Also, Sweeney’s claim ignores several other bills labeled by Democrats as part of the "Back to Work NJ" package and signed by the governor without any changes. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-02131	If you work 40 hours a week at the proposed minimum wage of $10.10 an hour, "you get out of poverty."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/08/charles-schumer/does-1010-minimum-wage-get-you-out-poverty/	During an appearance on MSNBC, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., touted one of President Barack Obama’s key agenda items -- raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 an hour. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10, Schumer said, "is important for one reason, and very important to us, which is, it's the bare minimum. You work 40 hours a week, you get out of poverty." The trouble with Schumer’s claim is that the accepted definition of poverty is actually a sliding scale that depends on the size of a family. We’ll walk you through the math. What raising the minimum wage means Earning $10.10 an hour for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, produces a yearly gross income of $21,008. But people earning that amount also have a good chance of getting money back from the government through the Earned Income Tax Credit -- a provision of tax law that encourages work by low-income Americans. If your income is low enough -- but if you have a paying job -- the government supplements your income through refundable tax credits. Using the calculator at the IRS website, we created some sample taxpaying households. Both have two parents, only one of whom worked, and no complicated tax quirks. One had two children and the other had three. When we input the new minimum-wage level annual income of $21,008, the calculator told us that the EITC would provide an additional $5,370 to the family with two children and $6,040 to the family with three children. (EITC benefits are capped at three children.) So, combined, a hypothetical family of four would get $26,378 in gross income, and a hypothetical family of five would get $27,048. (The size of the tax credit can vary a bit depending on the taxpayer’s situation, but this at least shows the scale we’re talking about.) Is this enough to "get out of poverty"? Would this be enough to escape poverty? As we noted earlier, the size of the family makes a big difference. The poverty level is not a single threshold, but rather a series of them scaled to the size of the household. (Caution for any statistical geeks reading this: There are actually two poverty federal levels, one calculated by the Census Bureau and one by the Department of Health and Human Services. They track each other pretty closely, but there are some small differences. We calculated our data both ways, and our overall conclusions held regardless of which measure we used. For simplicity, though, we’re only going to show our calculations for the HHS poverty line.) Using the HHS numbers for 2014, the poverty line is $11,670 for a one-person household, $15,730 for a two-person household, $19,790 for a three-person household, $23,850 for a four-person household, and up from there with the addition of each new person. Since the new $10.10 wage would be fully phased in by 2016 (if it’s passed by Congress) we estimated what these poverty guidelines would be in 2016. We did this by increasing the 2014 guidelines by the same percentage as the guidelines increased between 2012 and 2014, which is the most recent two-year period. This produced the following estimated poverty guidelines for 2016: Persons in household Poverty guideline 1 $12,193 2 $16,354 3 $20,516 4 $24,678 5 $28,839 6 $33,003 7 $37,165 8 $41,329 So if one breadwinner earns a total of $26,378, then the new $10.10 wage, plus an EITC refund, is indeed enough to lift households of one, two, three, and four people beyond the poverty level. But it would be too small to lift the households of five people or more. (The additional EITC refund for a third child isn’t large enough to make a difference.) In other words, while raising the wage to $10.10 does get a lot of households out of poverty, it isn’t quite the guarantee that Schumer suggests. In addition, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 doesn’t get any one-person households out of poverty, because even the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 does that. To measure how "right" or "wrong" Schumer’s claim is, we wanted to measure what proportion of minimum-wage-worker households included one person, two persons, and so on. But experts told us there is no readily available data on this point. So we used the next best data we could find -- the Census Bureau’s distribution of impoverished households by the size of household. The three household sizes that get boosted out of poverty due to a wage hike to $10.10 -- households of two, three and four people -- collectively account for 46 percent of all households in poverty, according to this Census data. The remaining 54 percent either are out of poverty already at the current minimum wage (one-person households) or wouldn’t exceed the poverty line even after getting a raise to $10.10 an hour (households of at least five people). By that measure, Schumer is right a little less than half the time. These are estimates, but experts said these estimates are reasonable given the available data. A spokesman for Schumer said the statistic came from calculations by the Council of Economic Advisers, an office within the White House. (You can see a chart on page 6 in the slide show here.) The White House chart hangs its poverty-lifting claim on data for a four-person family, which squares with what we found. The problem with Schumer’s claim is that he glossed over some caveats and made too sweeping a case for the power of a $10.10 wage increase to knock out poverty. Our ruling Schumer said a new minimum wage of "$10.10 is important for one reason … It's the bare minimum. You work 40 hours a week, you get out of poverty." Raising the wage to $10.10 an hour does indeed put two-, three- and four-person households with one working member above the poverty line for the first time. But it doesn’t achieve a similar feat for one-person households (which already exceed the poverty line under the old, $7.25 wage) or for households of five or more people (who still wouldn’t earn enough with the $10.10 wage to escape poverty). Since the households helped by the $10.10 wage account for 46 percent of all impoverished households, Schumer is right slightly less than half the time. We rate his claim Half True. UPDATE, May 8, 3:15 p.m.: This item has been updated to clarify what calculations we made when determining the percentage of minimum wage workers's households who would be lifted out of poverty due to a rise to $10.10.

pomt-03495	"New Jersey’s once-broken pension system is now solvent."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jun/09/13th-district-gop-slate/gop-mailer-claims-new-jerseys-pension-system-solve/	When it comes to reducing the size and scope of government, three New Jersey Republicans claim they’re on the right path to accomplishing that goal. Assembly members Declan O’Scanlon and Amy Handlin, and state Sen. Joe Kyrillos, representing the 13th District, touted those reforms and others in a campaign flyer sent out for last week’s primary election. The flyer highlighted less spending, less government, more prosperity and standing up to the Internal Revenue Service as evidence of their efforts. The trio won their primaries Tuesday. But one claim under the heading of less government intrigued us: "New Jersey’s once-broken pension system is now solvent." The underfunded pension system that set off a political firestorm two years ago when Gov. Chris Christie and the Legislature ordered higher employee contributions and suspended Cost Of Living Adjustments for beneficiaries is solvent? In pension terminology, the part of the claim is correct. But the state pension system was once broken? That’s debatable. Let’s explain, starting with solvency. Some dictionaries define solvency as the ability to pay debts – and O’Scanlon and others say New Jersey has enough money in its pension funds to cut checks every month for retirees and have those checks clear. New Jersey’s pension reforms also will help keep the system more sustainable, O’Scanlon said. In addition to the temporary suspension of COLAs and increased employee contributions, New Jersey has increased the pension eligibility requirement for new hires and increased the salary timeframe on which retirement benefits are based. An improving stock market, as well as the state ramping up annual payments into the system until reaching full contributions starting in 2018 will help, he said. Two pensions experts we spoke with agreed with O’Scanlon’s assessment of solvency and emphasis on the state’s pension reforms. "If you have enough money to pay benefits in the short term or in the foreseeable future, to the extent that plans have enough cash on hand to pay benefits for the next 10 or 13 years, it’s solvent," said Jean-Pierre Aubry, assistant director for State and Local Research at the Boston College Center for Retirement Research. "A pension fund is solvent if it is able to honor its obligations," said Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators in Washington, D.C. "If they can pay their pension liabilities they would be considered solvent." New Jersey is able to pay its pension obligations, so it’s solvent. But was it once broken, as the mailer claims? "We would define broken as unquestionably heading on the path to insolvency," O’Scanlon said. "You couldn’t continue on the path we were going and end up with a sustainable system," he added. Either we were going to have bankruptcy or we were going to have massive tax increases to cover the obligation. With the reforms we did we now brought it in to solvency. It’s on a completely different path since the reforms." But O’Scanlon also admitted that the state has always been able to pay its pension obligations. If that’s the case, the system was never broken. Now let’s look at pension funding levels. Each of the state’s five open pension accounts is funded well below 80 percent, which Aubry said is a threshold that has come to mean "adequate." The state's total underfunded liability was $47.2 billion as of July 1, 2012, according to an annual report on the state's pension fund. The state’s Public Employees Retirement System account was at 49.1 percent funding as of July 1, 2012; teachers, 59.3 percent; police and firefighters, 51.5 percent; state police, 71.2 percent; judiciary, 46 percent. Aubry and Brainard both said 80 percent funding is an oft-cited threshold of whether pension accounts are "healthy." "Eighty percent has come to be recognized by practitioners as an adequate funding level," Aubry said. "The notion may be that at 80 percent funded you do have enough money in the pension fund to pay benefits for the foreseeable future, but the underfundedness basically helps battle the push for increase of benefits." Brainard said looking at funding ratios is just one metric of determining the health of a pension fund, "but it’s not the be-all, end-all." "The objective should be to reach full funding but there’s nothing necessarily wrong with being underfunded," Brainard added. "The issue is whether funding the plan is causing fiscal stress for the plan sponsor -- making the contributions to ensure that the benefits can be paid." Bill Quinn, a state Treasury Department spokesman, said New Jersey’s underfunded liabilities will flatten out and stop growing as the state puts more money into the pension fund each year as required by the reforms. Our ruling A primary campaign flyer from Assembly members Declan O’Scanlon and Amy Handlin, and state Sen. Joe Kyrillos last week claimed, "New Jersey’s once-broken pension system is now solvent." O’Scanlon said ‘once broken’ refers to the state’s pension system being on a path to insolvency or bankruptcy without major reforms – but admits the state has always been able to pay its pension bills. If the system was once broken, those bills wouldn’t have been paid. Furthermore, O’Scanlon and experts told us that a pension system being able to pay its obligations means the system is solvent.

pomt-06733	Democrats in the Legislature in 2009 voted for various "pork projects" including "a $5 million scoreboard for the Milwaukee Bucks."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/29/club-growth/wisconsin-club-growth-says-democrats-legislature-2/	There was plenty of hot air expended during the unprecedented state Senate recall elections during the summer of 2011. An enormous amount of time and money was spent by political parties and third-party groups to protect or promote their candidates. And, of course, to attack their rivals’ record. The elections are over. But some of the claims lingered with us. One involved the Bradley Center, home of the Milwaukee Bucks, Marquette University Golden Eagles, Milwaukee Admirals and Milwaukee Mustangs. With the busy season of the downtown Milwaukee venue just around the corner, we thought we’d take a deeper look. The Bradley Center is a $90 million gift to the community from Jane Bradley Pettit in honor of her father, industrialist Harry Lynde Bradley. The facility is a state building but operates without state taxpayer support. For years, the Bradley Center board of directors and the Bucks have complained the facility, which opened in 1988, is obsolete for an NBA team. Most recently, the team sought $10 million in borrowing for renovations, a request that Gov. Scott Walker shot down. In recent years, a variety of smaller-scale renovations have been undertaken to generate more revenue for the team. That includes a new scoreboard that debuted in the fall of 2010 in an effort to increase advertising revenue. That scoreboard popped up in a string of television ads the conservative Wisconsin Club For Growth used to attack Democrats running in the recall elections. For instance, one spot targeted state Rep. Fred Clark (D-Baraboo), who lost to state Sen. Luther Olsen (R-Ripon) in his recall election. "Clark voted for $37 million in pork barrel projects, including a $5 million scoreboard for the Milwaukee Bucks," the narrator states in the ad. Did state taxpayers really buy the Bucks a new $5 million scoreboard? Let’s go to the replay. We asked the Club for Growth for backup, and they sent us to a Journal Sentinel story about items included in the budget, and the budget bill itself. So, we dug further. The Bradley Center board sought state assistance for the facility, arguing for the economic benefits that the facility provides to Milwaukee. The request was heard in 2009 by the state Building Commission, which handles requests for large-scale construction projects. The commission voted April 1, 2009, to recommended a $5 million grant for the Bradley Center, and the amount was included in the proposed 2009-’11 state budget. Among those voting to approve the borrowing was commission member Dean Kaufert, Republican member of the state Assembly from Neenah. Clark was not a member of the commission, nor were any of the Democrats targeted by the Club for Growth ads. The bonding for the Bradley Center was then included in the budget by then-Gov. Jim Doyle. Al Runde, an analyst at the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau, said there was no amendment made to remove the Bradley Center funding from the budget package. In other words, there was no separate vote on that item. (After this item was published, our attention was directed to a budget amendment that would have -- among other things -- cut the funding for the Bradley Center and nine other projects approved by the Building Commission. That amendment was tabled on a 51-47 vote with Clark voting in the majority.) The budget was approved by the Democratic-controlled Legislature with Clark among those voting in favor of it. We’ve seen this type of approach before, where a vote for an entire budget is used to hammer home a point on one relatively small item contained within it. This often distorts what really happens in the Legislative process. Beyond that, the Club for Growth’s claim is off base when it says the $5 million went for a scoreboard. "Nothing in the act says anything about the scoreboard, just general funding" for the Bradley Center, Runde said. The Bradley Center spent $1.29 million of the state money on the $3.2 million scoreboard, said Evan Zeppos, spokesman for the center’s board. The state funds also went to repair concrete, lighting, elevator and escalator maintenance, plumbing, flooring and a new hockey dasher-board system, he said. The Bradley Center has not yet spent the entire $5 million, and more than $580,000 remains on hand, Zeppos said. Zeppos noted the scoreboard isn’t just for the Bucks. Marquette, the Admirals and other tenants also use it. "It’s for everything we do there," Zeppos said. Let’s settle the score on this one. The Wisconsin Club for Growth said Clark and other Democrats voted for $5 million for a new scoreboard for the Bradley Center. There’s no evidence that Clark had an opportunity to vote yea or nay on that specific matter, although he did vote to table an amendment that included the Bradley Center funding and numerous other projects. And it’s a reach to make a specific charge against him for an item that was wrapped in a broader vote. What’s more -- and more importantly -- the group misstates how the state money was used. About a fourth of the money went to the scoreboard. And it’s not specific to the Bucks. So it’s wrong in multiple ways. We rate it False.

pomt-04445	On ending the war in Iraq, "Gov. Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 troops there."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/11/joe-biden/biden-romney-called-ending-iraq-war-tragic/	The vice presidential debate started off with questions about the Obama administration’s handling of the lethal attacks on the Libyan consulate in September 2012. Vice President Joe Biden sought to portray the commander-in-chief as ever-mindful of threats to the country as he answered questions from moderator Martha Raddatz. "When you're looking at a president, Martha, it seems to me that you should take a look at his most important responsibility. That's caring for the national security of the country. And the best way to do that is take a look at how he's handled the issues of the day. "On Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Gov. Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 -- he ended it. Gov. Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 troops there." Did Romney really say ending the Iraq war was "tragic" and that the U.S. should have left behind 30,000 troops? First, some background. Ending the war in Iraq was a big campaign promise for Obama. In October 2011 he announced all troops would be pulled from Iraq by the end of the year. By the end of 2011, his administration could not reach an agreement with the Iraqi government on the size of a residual force. Negotiations on that fell apart, according to a Reuters report, "over a Pentagon demand that Iraq provide U.S. troops with immunity against prosecution in Iraq for any crimes committed there. Iraq's government was unwilling to meet that demand, and its political elite were divided over a post-2011 U.S. military presence." Some troops remained in the country. In the days leading up to the withdrawal date, about 200 U.S. troops remained and operated within the American Embassy "to coordinate military relations between Washington and Baghdad, particularly arms sales," the New York Times reported. So what was Romney’s take? He addressed Obama’s actions during a roundtable discussion with veterans at a South Carolina barbecue restaurant on Veterans Day in 2011. A colonel asked Romney how he would handle soldiers returning to the country in need of jobs, according to a transcript of the event. Romney called Obama’s troop removal "an enormous mistake," "a failing," "precipitous" and -- here’s the buzz word -- "tragic." His complete response: "Yeah. A couple of things. One, you probably know that it is my view that the withdrawal of all of our troops from Iraq by the end of this year is an enormous mistake and a failing by the Obama administration. Secretary Panetta and others had indicated they were working to put in place a Status of Forces Agreement to maintain our presence there, so that we could most effectively transition to the Iraqi military and Iraqi security forces providing security for their country. "The precipitous withdrawal is unfortunate. It's more than unfortunate. I think it's tragic. It puts at risk many of the victories that were hard-won by the men and women who have served there. I hope the risk is not realized. I hope instead that the Iraqis are able to pick up the baton, and despite the fact that we will have walked away on a too-rapid basis." This wasn’t the first time Romney’s campaign reacted to Obama’s withdrawal plan. He expressed his disapproval in a biting statement a few weeks earlier, keying in on the lack of an "orderly transition." On the night of the vice presidential debate, the Romney campaign website still faults the Obama administration for not reaching a Status of Force Agreement, or SOFA, and emphasizes continued unrest there. "Despite the clear need for a SOFA and desire on both sides to conclude an agreement, President Obama fumbled the negotiation. It was a display of stunning diplomatic incompetence. The day after the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. troops at the end of last year, Iraq’s Prime Minister took worrying actions to consolidate power. He leveled terrorism charges against the Sunni Vice President, causing the Vice President to flee the capital and sparking a political crisis that continues to this day. Iraq still faces worrying insurgent attacks." In a December 2011 interview with Reuters, Romney criticized Obama's "failure to secure an agreement and maintain 10,000 to 30,000 troops in Iraq." Our ruling While talking about how Obama kept his promise to end the Iraq war, Biden said, "Romney said that was a tragic mistake, we should have left 30,000 troops there." It’s true that Romney characterized Obama’s 2011 deadline with the word "tragic." Romney did not say ending the war was tragic; he was talking about the speed at which Obama removed all troops. Romney’s preference was to leave a large residual force, and he has used an estimate of up to 30,000 in the past, as Biden said during the debate. We rate Biden’s claim Half True.

pomt-10937	"In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time can’t afford a 1-bedroom apartment."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/25/kamala-harris/housing-unaffordable-full-time-minimum-wage-worker/	Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has recently made it a point to support affordable housing, both in her social media posts and in the legislation she brings before Congress. On July 19, Harris introduced the Rent Relief Act to Congress, which would provide assistance in the form of a refundable tax credit to those who make under $100,000 a year and spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. To rally support for the bill, she tweeted, "In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time can’t afford a 1-bedroom apartment." She later posted a video that expressed a similar sentiment and repeated the statistic. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We decided to look into Harris’s statement. Aside from a few minor caveats, the statement is largely accurate. Out of reach? We began by reaching out to Harris’s press secretary, who directed us to a 2017 study published by the National Low Income Housing Coalition titled "Out of Reach." The study is updated yearly, and the 2018 edition is out. Harris’s press secretary pointed out a line from the latest study that reads, "In only 22 counties out of more than 3,000 counties nationwide can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom rental home at fair market rent." That statistic and the coalition’s report overall have been cited by various news outlets. Do the math, and you’ll see that 22 divided by 3,000 comes out to a figure slightly smaller than 1 percent. That small percentage refers to the counties where a one-bedroom home is affordable for minimum-wage workers. But there are two concepts in the sentence from the study that require further clarification: affordability and "fair market rent." The national coalition defines "affordability" as "consistent with the federal standard that no more than 30 percent of a household’s gross income should be spent on rent and utilities." That’s the same guideline used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and we found it’s a standard threshold within the field. The definition of "fair market rent" is slightly different. It also has its origins from HUD. The National Low Income Housing Coalition defines it as "typically the 40th percentile of gross rents for standard rental units." So that means that within any given metropolitan area, 40 percent of all rental properties are priced equal to or below the fair market rent threshold. That means not all units within the 99 percent of counties referred to in Harris’s tweet are unaffordable for full-time minimum-wage workers, but it does mean that a majority — 60 percent — are. Of the remaining 40 percent of one-bedroom housing, some units may be affordable for those workers, but that doesn’t mean they’ll be quality apartments — they might be in a high-crime area or low-performing school district, for example. (We previously cleared up the definition of "fair market rent" in a fact-check of a Facebook graphic.) As Vincent Reina, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, put it, "It does not mean there are 0 affordable units (in the 99% of counties that Harris is referring to), it means that there are none affordable at or above the 40th percentile of the rent distribution. There are likely some units that are affordable, just not even close to enough." The experts we reached out to pointed out that the conclusions reached by the National Low Income Housing Coalition are supported by other research, including a recent study published by the Joint Center of Housing Studies of Harvard University. "Not all the studies would support the exact claim that 99 percent of counties in the U.S. are unaffordable, but there’s a lot of evidence that the poorest families (say the bottom 20-25 percent) are financially stretched to afford unsubsidized housing," said Jenny Schuetz, a David M. Rubenstein Fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. Our ruling Harris recently tweeted, "In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time can’t afford a 1-bedroom apartment." She was referring to a recent study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which shows that "in only 22 counties out of more than 3,000 counties nationwide can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom rental home at fair market rent." Harris didn’t refer to the concept of "fair market rent," which is defined as the "40th percentile of gross rents for standard rental units." The underlying study she referenced doesn’t say that a minimum wage worker can’t afford any housing in almost all of the United States, but that a minimum wage worker can’t afford the average-priced housing unit. With that said, Harris’s claim is still a largely accurate characterization of the magnitude of the rent affordability problems that many people face. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09975	Cass Sunstein, President Obama's nominee for regulatory czar, "wants to give legal standing to animals so they can sue you for eating meat."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/05/wayne-lapierre/sunstein-has-said-people-ought-be-able-sue-behalf-/	At the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Feb. 27, 2009, the National Rifle Association's fiery Wayne LaPierre teed off on one of President Barack Obama's lesser-known appointees. The target: Cass Sunstein, a Harvard Law School professor who was tapped to head up the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a position better known as the administration's regulatory czar. LaPierre opened with a zinger: "Sunstein is a radical animal rights extremist who makes PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) look like cheerleaders with pooper-scoopers." How extreme? LaPierre said Sunstein is "a man who wants to give legal standing to animals so they can sue you for eating meat." LaPierre isn't alone in making similar claims. Go to the self-explanatory Web site StopSunstein.com, sponsored by the American Conservative Union, and you'll find this quote from one of Sunstein's books: "Animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives …" The quote comes from Sunstein's 2004 book Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions . We call your attention to Chapter 11, titled "Can Animals Sue?" Sunstein argues that there are already plenty of animal cruelty laws on the books that just aren't enforced. "My simplest suggestion is that private citizens should be given the right to bring suits to prevent animals from being treated in a way that violates current law. I offer a recommendation that is theoretically modest but that should do a lot of practical good: laws designed to protect animals against cruelty and abuse should be amended and interpreted to give a private cause of action against those who violate them, so as to allow private people to supplement the efforts of public prosecutors. Somewhat more broadly, I will suggest that animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives, to prevent violations of current law." In a speech at Harvard in 2007, Sunstein argued there is "a real gap" in the laws governing animal cruelty laws, essentially that prosecutors have a monopoly in making sure those laws are followed. "The law should be changed to give affected persons, interested persons, those who have some sort of connection with the animal, a right to sue either for damages or for an injunction to get that violation of what is standard already in law to stop." That Sunstein is an animal rights activist is undisputed. For a CNN interview in the late 1990s, he once insisted on being joined on-air by his dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Perry. And LaPierre is correct when he says that Sunstein has talked about allowing animals to sue — albeit through a human representative. But we think LaPierre has twisted Sunstein's words. Sunstein wasn't saying you — the meat eater — could be sued by Porky Pig for eating bacon. But he was saying that if the pig that winds up on your breakfast plate was raised or killed in a way that violates existing animal cruelty laws, then someone ought to be able to sue the processor on the pig's behalf. That's all, folks. We rate LaPierre's statement Half True.	None	Wayne LaPierre	None	None	None	2009-05-05T15:28:04	2009-02-27	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-10205	Sarah Palin was repeating "Abraham Lincoln's words" in discussing the war in Iraq.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/12/sarah-palin/not-far-from-lincolns-sentiment/	In her first major news interview since being named the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party, Sarah Palin answered questions about comments she had made about "God's plan" and Iraq. The questioner was ABC News' Charles Gibson. Gibson asked her, "You said recently in your old church, 'Our national leaders are sending U.S. soldiers on a task that is from God.' Are we fighting a Holy War?" Palin: "That's a repeat of Abraham Lincoln's words, when he said, first he suggested, never presume to know what God's will is, and I would never presume to know God's will or to speak God's words, but what Abraham Lincoln had said, and that's a repeat in my comments, was, let us not pray that God is on our side, in a war, or any other time. But let us pray that we are on God's side. That's what that comment was all about, Charlie." Gibson then followed up: "But you went on and said, 'There is a plan, and it is God's plan.'" Here's the rest of their exchange: Palin: "I believe that there is a plan for this world, and that plan for this world is for good. I believe that there is great hope and great potential for every country, to be able to live and be protected within inalienable rights that I believe are God-given, Charlie. And I believe those are the rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That in my worldview is the grand plan." Gibson: "Then, are you sending your son on a task from God?" Palin: "I don't know if the task is from God, Charlie. What I know is that my son has made a decision. I am so proud of his independent and strong decision. What he decided to do, in serving for the right reasons in serving something greater than self, and not choosing a real easy path, where he could be more comfortable and certainly safer." We decided to compare Palin's words and Lincoln's words side-by-side to see if Palin's words were a repeat of Abraham Lincoln's. Palin made the original comments in June 2007 to the Wasilla Assembly of God. Her visit there had been videotaped and posted to the church's Web site. The video has since been removed, but copies are available on the Internet. In the video, Palin is speaking informally to a group of students, talking about her family and discussing current events. She offers quotes from the Bible at times, and also makes enthusiastic, casual comments, at one point joking that the students are "a cool-looking bunch of Christians." "My oldest, my son Track, is a soldier in the United States Army now. ... Pray for our military. He's going to be deployed in September to Iraq. Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right. Also, for this country, that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending them out on a task that is from God. That's what we have to make sure that we're praying for, that there is a plan and that that plan is God's plan." We think it's important to note that Palin is asking the audience to "pray for" military men and women, and that national leaders are sending troops out "on a task that is from God." She even repeats "that's what we have to make sure that we're praying for." Gibson doesn't mention the words "pray for" when he questions her. Praying for something implies that you don't yet have it or that it there is some uncertainty, so it seems logical that Palin is expressing a hope that something is true, not a certainty. Meanwhile, we tracked down Abraham Lincoln's words on God's will. The original source appears to be a book titled Six Months in the White House with Abraham Lincoln , written by Francis B. Carpenter and published in 1867, not long after Lincoln's death. The following is from Page 282 of Carpenter's account: "No nobler reply ever fell from the lips of a ruler, than that uttered by President Lincoln in response to the clergyman who ventured to say, in his presence, that he hoped 'the Lord was on our side.' "'I am not at all concerned about that,' replied Mr. Lincoln, 'for I know that the Lord is always on the side of the right. But it is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation should be on the Lord's side.'" In fairness, Lincoln's words do seem to express a greater degree of anxiety about being on God's side than Palin's. Lincoln is also rebuking a clergyman's inflated sense of moral piety, while Palin appears to be expressing solidarity with fellow believers. But Gibson's truncation of her comments — omitting the crucial words "pray for" — change the meaning of her comments from a wish to a certainty. Palin's and Lincoln's words are similar in that they both express a hope that a plan meets with God's favor. Granted, some people find any mention of God's will and warfare to be disturbing. But we find similarities between the two sets of comments. We find Palin's statement Mostly True.

pomt-14354	"During the last five years, Iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-iran-responsible-terrorist-attac/	During a prepared speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington, Donald Trump took a hard line on Iran. "Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world," Trump said. "During the last five years, Iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They’ve got terror cells everywhere, including in the Western Hemisphere, very close to home. Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world. And we will work to dismantle that reach." We wondered whether Trump was correct that "during the last five years, Iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents," so we took a closer look. The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but we found a source for his comment -- the Israeli government, which has taken a hard-line stance against Iran’s theocratic government. The Israeli Embassy in Washington released an infographic on March 31, 2015, titled, "The Long Arm of Iran." It shows a map of the world superimposed with 27 headlines detailing overseas activity by Iran or its proxy groups groups. The countries affected span the globe, from North and South America to Europe to Africa and Asia. A November 2015 tweet from the embassy featuring the infographic included the explanatory text, "A look at Iran's global terror activity (last 4yrs): 5 continents, 25+ countries." In addition, during a speech to AIPAC a year earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu showed the audience a similar map with overlapping, though not identical, locations of alleged Iranian activity. So how well does this evidence support Trump’s statement? Imperfectly. Where Trump has a point Trump’s most salient point is that Iran is widely agreed to have significant overseas reach. Iran remains one of just three nations that the United States has labeled as a state sponsor of terrorism. The State Department notes that Iran has supported ongoing "terrorist-related activity" by groups in Gaza, Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East. Probably the most prominent of these proxies is Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based militant group. The rise of ISIS (which is part of the Sunni branch of Islam) in Iraq and Syria has led Iran (which is part of the Shia branch) to increase its assistance to Shia militias as a counterweight to ISIS. Meanwhile, Iran is looking beyond its immediate neighborhood, according to the State Department. "While its main effort focused on supporting goals in the Middle East, particularly in Syria, Iran and its proxies also continued subtle efforts at growing influence elsewhere including in Africa, Asia, and, to a lesser extent, Latin America," the State Department wrote. Ted Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told PolitiFact that no one outside of Tehran really knows the scale of Iran’s foreign involvement. But he added that Trump’s subsequent statement -- that "Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world" -- is almost certainly correct, at least among nations. The only potential challenger for that title, he said, would be ISIS, which isn’t a state. "The point of the Israeli infographic is that Iran is actively involved with terrorist groups with a very wide geographical range, and that it is a prolific smuggler of weapons, often in defiance of U.N. Security Council embargoes," Bromund said. Where Trump’s statement is misleading The problem with Trump’s statement -- that Iran "has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries" -- is that he conflates actual "terror attacks" with terrorist-related activity or, in many cases, suspicions of terrorist-related activity. Indeed, the wording of the Israeli embassy’s tweet is more restrained than Trump’s comment was. It referred to Iran’s "global terror activity," not terrorist "attacks." Netanyahu, in his 2015 AIPAC speech, also stayed away from the word "attacks" when referring to the map he offered as a visual aid. "Iran is the foremost state sponsor of terrorism in the world," he said. "Look at that graph. Look at that map. And you see on the wall, it shows Iran training, arming, dispatching terrorists on five continents." Indeed, when we looked into each of the 27 headlines on the "Long Arm of Iran" graphic, we found that actual attacks accounted for only a minority of the headlines. In five cases, the headlines on the infographic referred to actual attacks, some of them deadly, in which Iranian involvement was suspected. These include incidents in Bahrain, Bulgaria, India, Georgia and Thailand. Six other headlines referred to attacks that were thwarted before they could be carried out. Using an expansive definition that includes both actual attacks and thwarted attacks, less than half of the headlines on the infographic -- 11 -- support Trump’s statement. By contrast, 12 headlines refer to allegations of ties to Iran or Hezbollah in various countries, but ones well short of an actual attack, or even one thwarted at the last minute. Such headlines in this category include, "Hezbollah tied to organized crime in Canada, says spy agency," "Senegal cuts ties with Iran over weapons shipment," "Gambia severs all ties with Iran after arms seizure," and "British special forces seize Iranian rockets in Afghanistan." Four other headlines address Iranian military involvement or influence in another country’s government. These and other allegations in the infographic will surely be troubling to many, but they are not the same thing as having "perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents." So how many have there been? Netanyahu reportedly told senior ministers that over the period of about a year between 2011 and 2012, Israel had thwarted 20 terrorist attacks overseas in such countries as Azerbaijan, Kenya, Turkey, Thailand, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Turkey. But he provided too few details for us to be able to verify them. The only hard numbers we could find for actual attacks are the ones included in the Global Terrorism Database operated by the University of Maryland. Under Hezbollah -- the operational group most frequently referenced in the headlines associated with the infographic -- we found 27 terrorist attacks since 2009. Of these, all but one occurred in the Middle East -- eight in Lebanon, seven in Bahrain, six in Israel, and five in Syria. The one attack outside the region was a bombing of an Israeli tour bus in Bulgaria. That’s a much narrower spread of attacks than what Trump suggests. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, called Trump’s math "misleading." "There’s a difference between an attack and ‘activity,’ " he said. Our ruling Trump said that "during the last five years, Iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents." He has a point that Iran is widely believed to be supporting, or trying to support, armed or terrorist groups in many countries around the world, though the exact number is not known with any specificity outside Tehran. However, that’s not the same thing as actually perpetrating terrorist attacks, as Trump indicated, even though his apparent source material only referred to activity, not attacks. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-03-22T18:14:04	2016-03-21	['Iran']

pomt-09899	Rep. Adam Putnam was silent when Rush Limbaugh called Sonia Sotomayor a racist.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/14/presente/rush-limbaugh-sonia-sotomayor-adam-putnam/	UPDATE: We've updated this item after hearing back from Presente.org, but we haven't changed our ruling. A group called Presente.org is using some political sleight-of-hand to suggest that a Republican House member from Florida endorses Rush Limbaugh's comment that Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor is a racist. The sleight-of-hand is the tricky wording in a radio ad from the left-leaning Latino advocacy group's "Action" arm. Instead of directly saying that Putnam, who is running for Florida agriculture commissioner, endorses Limbaugh, the ad says that he "refused" to reply to the group's inquiry. A similar ad was used against Rep. John Mica, a Republican from the Orlando area. Here's a translation of the Spanish-language ad: (Spanish) "Sonia Sotomayor is set to be the first Latina, and the first Puerto Rican, to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. It is a proud moment for our community. Yet Republican leaders insist on attacking her. (English) "'She doesn't have any intellectual depth. She's got a — she's an angry woman, she's a bigot. She's a racist.' (Spanish) "That's Republican leader Rush Limbaugh calling Judge Sotomayor a racist and a bigot. It's insulting to all Latinos and Americans. We asked Republican Congressman Adam Putnam if he would denounce Limbaugh's words. He refused to reply. Let's put a stop to the hate. Call Congressman Putnam today at 863-534-3530 and tell him to condemn this language." The ad is unusual because House members don't have any say in the confirmation of Supreme Court nominees. That's up to the Senate. With its insinuation, the ad is incorrect. Most notably, Putnam has not "refused" to comment on this. He told the Orlando Sentinel very specifically that he thought Sotomayor was not a racist in response to Limbaugh's comments. His comments were published in a Sentinel column on May 31, 2009, by Scott Maxwell, about how Republicans were responding to the Sotomayor nomination and Limbaugh's controversial remarks. "I have not seen anything that would disqualify her," Putnam said. "And I certainly would not call her a racist based on anything we have seen so far." We also spoke with Putnam's communications director, Keith Rupp. Rupp said if Presente.org called Putnam's office looking for comment on Limbaugh, he couldn't find a record of it. He looked after they started getting calls off the radio ad. "The bottom line is we're not aware of them having contacted us," Rupp said. "When people call, we make a record of it, usually in writing." Presente.org, however, said they did call, and spokesperson Jennifer Fernandez Ancona provided us with a copy of their phone record that shows a 4-minute call to Putnam's Bartow office and a 1-minute call to his D.C. office on June 19. The group knew about Putnam's previous comments, she said, but felt it was important that Putnam and Mica denounce Limbaugh's remarks as the Sotomayor hearings began. She said it's not sufficient that Putnam said he didn't think Sotomayor was a racist, because of how influential Limbaugh is and how much attention his comments receive. "We were asking (Putnam) to specifically denounce Rush's comments," she said. "It's a different question." Rupp said that Putnam's statements to the Sentinel were his definitive comments on the matter. The phrasing of the ad is very artful, but the thrust of the message is that Putnam was silent when asked about Limbaugh's remarks. That's not the case. Presente.org said there's a difference between saying you disagree with someone's comments and specifically denouncing the person's comments. We don't think that's a meaningful distinction in the context of a 60-second radio ad. We rule Presente.org's statement False.

pomt-08018	The City of Milwaukee "uses the building inspection area as a revenue base."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/10/lee-holloway/acting-milwaukee-county-executive-lee-holloway-acc/	When Milwaukee County Board Chairman Lee Holloway took office as acting county executive Dec. 28, 2010, he laid out his vision for the county before a crowd of more than 250 people at a Courthouse swearing-in ceremony. Amid the vision, he made passing reference to his notoriety as a city landlord. Earlier in December, Holloway was ordered into court -- again -- for not correcting building code violations on five apartment buildings he owns with his wife, Lynda, on W. Atkinson Ave. Holloway had been cited for 116 violations ranging from rodent and roach infestations to loose window trim and moldy walls, according to city officials and inspection records. Some of the violations have been fixed. According to a Dec. 2, 2010 Journal Sentinel article only 63 of the 116 violations were part of the case sent to court. And inspection notes indicated some of the remaining 63 already had been addressed. The violations date back to 2009, and have been subject to monthly re-inspections -- many at a cost of $350 per visit. His problems with code violations stretch back years, according to city records and news reports. In his swearing-in speech, Holloway didn’t say much about his violations, but took this unscripted swipe at City Hall: "We know that the city uses the building inspection area as a revenue base." Is Holloway right on that point? Is the city raking in building inspection fees to help balance the budget? We called Holloway spokesman Harold Mester to ask what the acting executive -- and candidate for the full-time job in the April election -- was basing his statement on. Mester responded that Holloway might talk -- if we first made some calls. He said we should contact Crown Hardware, Door City and Home Depot and find out what their customers said about building inspection fees. We tried, but the responses led to unlisted phone numbers and shrugs as to why Holloway wanted a reporter to contact the business. Mester then told us Holloway was not willing to discuss his comments further. He did tell us Holloway received advice and data about the city’s building inspection department from another landlord -- and occasional political foe -- Orville Seymer, a founder of the Citizens for Responsible Government. After hearing about Holloway’s latest court date last month, Seymer said he called Holloway and "invited myself" to meet Holloway at the apartments for a visit from city inspectors. "I don’t think that Lee Holloway is the problem here," said Seymer. "I think it’s the Department of Neighborhood Services. They’re out to get Holloway and they’re out to get landlords in general." Seymer said he shared with Holloway budget data that he has collected that he argues shows building inspectors are padding city coffers. He prepared a spreadsheet showing the growth in recent years in "special charges" on the city tax rolls -- money added to property tax bills that is owed to the city for services provided. Those numbers are growing, according to the city. Those "special charges" were $6.9 million in 2010, compared with $4 million in 2006. But those charges take in much more than building inspection fees. They also include boarded-up buildings, abandoned cars, litter and snow and ice removal. What’s more, city officials say the increases have come as a tidal wave of foreclosed properties have hit the city -- and as the city has taken numerous steps to keep those buildings from falling into disrepair. Last year there were 6,427 foreclosures in Milwaukee County, and the vast majority of those were in the city of Milwaukee. For instance: Records show that last year the city had nearly four times as many properties that needed boarding up and spent about twice as much on litter removal compared with five years ago. So, what about the fees Holloway is being charged to cover inspections of his properties? In 2010, the city collected about $4 million in fees for re-inspections of 5,939 properties. That compares with $2.53 million for 6,091 properties in 2006. The amount taken in was up, officials said, because the city increased re-inspection fees for property owners who received repeated visits. The fees increase from $50 to $350 for the fourth visit -- viewed as an added incentive for landlords to make repairs in a timely fashion. City Budget Director Mark Nicolini said the fees help fund the operation of the city’s Department of Neighborhood Services. That department had a $14 million budget for 2010, with that amount being paid by various fees generated by department services. Under state law, the city cannot use fees to cover anything more than the service provided. "These aren’t additional revenues," said Nicolini. "We can’t use them to go fund garbage collection." Patrick Curley, chief of staff to Mayor Tom Barrett, was even stronger on this point. "Mr. Holloway does not have the facts on the city budget," Curley said. "Mr. Holloway is dead wrong." OK, we’ve finished our inspection of Holloway’s building inspection statement. No charge. Holloway, who is due in court Jan. 27, 2011, for the building inspection fees, said the city is using such charges to balance its budget. The city has had more re-inspections and other unpaid charges in recent years. But there’s no evidence that the city uses them as a revenue source or to otherwise pad the budget -- indeed, it’s against state law to use fees for anything beyond paying for the service provided. We’ll add this to that summation: False.	None	Lee Holloway	None	None	None	2011-01-10T09:00:00	2010-12-28	['None']

pomt-06031	Says up to a quarter of African Americans don’t have government photo ID.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/13/steny-hoyer/democratic-leaders-say-quarter-african-americans-d/	Two Democratic congressmen last month challenged the fairness of state voter identification laws like one in Texas, suggesting the mandates would target certain Americans. In an opinion piece published in the Austin American-Statesman on Dec. 13, 2011, U.S. Reps. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and John Lewis of Georgia said: "New measures introduced in several states would mandate government-issued, current photo identification for all wishing to vote. However, as many as one in four African Americans do not carry the necessary forms of identification to vote under these conditions and would be hit hard by these new laws." A reader asked us to check if indeed as many as 25 percent of African Americans do not carry a current government-issued photo ID, such as a driver’s license, passport or military ID. That statistic comes from a 2006 survey by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law. Hoyer spokesman Dan Reilly told us by email that the congressmen got their number from a Nov. 14, 2011 speech by the center’s Lawrence Norden. Norden cited the center’s 2006 survey of Americans’ ownership and access to citizenship documents and identification. The Brennan Center combines research and legal advocacy on public policy issues such as campaign finance reform and racial balance in criminal law, and it has said that state efforts to require photo IDs from voters at the polls could discourage millions from voting, especially minority and low-income Americans. In an October 2011 report, the center said that in five states where photo ID laws were scheduled to take effect in 2012, some 3.2 million Americans, accounting for about 10 percent of the states’ voting-age residents, lacked government-issued photo IDs. Two of those states -- Texas and South Carolina -- must have their laws cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice because of past failures to protect minority voting rights. The department rejected South Carolina’s law last month (saying that minority registered voters were more likely than whites to lack state IDs), and has asked Texas to supply more data about the impact of its law on minority voters. Specifically, federal officials asked Texas in September 2011 for the racial breakdown and counties of residence of registered voters who don’t have a state-issued license or ID -- about 600,000 people, Texas’ secretary of state estimated. Secretary of state spokesman Rich Parsons told us the office is preparing those numbers. Texas’ law, signed last year by Gov. Rick Perry, requires voters to show a valid government-issued photo ID, such as a Texas driver's license, Department of Public Safety identification card, state concealed handgun license, U.S. military ID or U.S. passport. Back to the nationwide data: The Brennan Center’s 2006 survey reached by telephone 987 U.S. citizens of voting age, asking them questions including, "Do you have a current, unexpired government-issued ID with your picture on it, like a driver’s license or a military ID?" As voter ID debates heated up in 2011, the conservative Heritage Foundation issued a critique of the survey, noting it was still frequently cited and questioning its decision not to focus on registered or actual voters. The center’s response said in part, "While it is true that citizens in those groups are more likely to vote in any given election, they are not the only citizens who have the right to vote." Overall, according to the survey, 11 percent of voting-age Americans did not have current government-issued photo ID. Among African Americans, 25 percent did not have such ID, compared to 8 percent of whites. Not enough Hispanics were surveyed to reach reliable conclusions about that subgroup, the center said. A December 2011 report by the NAACP on barriers to voting rights mentioned the 25-percent figure from the 2006 survey, going on to say that reasons for such a disparity can include the cost of getting a photo ID (because minorities are over-represented in the poor population) and the lack of documents they need to apply for the photo ID, such as birth certificates (not issued to many African Americans born before the Civil Rights Act passed), which can also cost money to obtain. The center has not surveyed voting-age Americans since 2006 about whether they have photo IDs, Keesha Gaskins, senior counsel for its Democracy Program, told us. Separately, we found no other national surveys by race of which U.S. citizens eligible to vote have government-issued photo IDs. Two national surveys taken in 2008, however, checked on registered voters. Before the 2008 presidential election, researchers from the University of Washington and other schools carried out a national telephone survey of 4,563 registered voters. In the survey, 10 percent of blacks, 11 percent of Hispanics and 5 percent of whites said they did not have a valid driver's license or an ID issued by their home state. Another survey, reaching 10,000 registered voters via phone and Internet after the 2008 election, included questions about driver’s license ownership by race. In an Aug. 30, 2011, blog post, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart III said responses showed that 19 percent of black respondents and 3 percent of whites did not have a driver’s license. In his blog post, Stewart did not break out results for Hispanic respondents. Of respondents who reported having a driver’s license, 16 percent of blacks and 9 percent of whites said the address on it was not current. In all, 32 percent of black respondents did not have a driver’s license bearing their current address, Stewart said, compared to 13 percent of whites. Among half a dozen other studies, ranging in scope from three counties to three states, several struck us as having limited applicability to the statement by Hoyer and Lewis: The NAACP report said a 2008 Pew Center study in Georgia showed 30 percent of African Americans said they voted absentee because they lacked a photo ID. However, this statistic reflects the responses of only 30 voters in three counties, and the Pew report warns against using it to draw conclusions. A 2005 Department of Justice summary of state data said that among registered voters who applied for Georgia driver’s licenses or state ID cards, African Americans had state ID at a "slightly higher" percentage than whites. A 2011 Associated Press analysis of South Carolina data showed the state’s photo ID law would fall harder on black populations in some areas and on whites in other areas. A 2005 University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study used U.S. census and state data to conclude that in Wisconsin, 45 percent of black men and 51 percent of black women had a valid driver’s license, compared with 54 percent of Hispanic men and 41 percent of Hispanic women. Two other surveys asked questions closest to matching the statement by Hoyer and Lewis. A 2007 survey of Indiana’s voting-age citizens found 26.6 percent of blacks and 13.6 percent of whites did not have a "current" government-issued or state university-issued photo ID. Lead researcher Matt Barreto of the University of Washington told us Hispanics composed too small a share of the population for their survey results to be analyzed separately. A 2008 survey of registered voters in Indiana, Mississippi and Maryland found 3.8 percent of blacks and 0.9 percent of whites did not have government-issued photo IDs. Results for Hispanic voters were not broken out. Our ruling Hoyer and Lewis stated that "as many as one in four African Americans do not carry the necessary forms of identification to vote" under conditions imposed by photo ID laws -- "government-issued, current photo identification." That figure came from a national survey taken about six years ago and, far as we could tell, mostly unchallenged since. While other collections of data do not touch on exactly the same point, most indicate that African Americans are less likely than whites to hold varied kinds of government-issued IDs, with percentages of blacks without such ID ranging from nearly 4 percent to more than 26 percent. We rate the Democrats’ "as many as" claim Mostly True.	None	Steny Hoyer	None	None	None	2012-01-13T20:22:31	2011-12-13	['None']

pomt-05082	A company with "20 employees" could go "out of business" because of health care law requirements to buy insurance.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/jul/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-small-business-health-care/	People who work in small businesses are fearful of being forced to provide health insurance to full-time employees. Gov. Rick Scott, who entered the political fray in 2009 on a strictly anti-"Obamacare" platform, says they’re confessing their fears to him. "I was in a business the other day, and they walked up to me and they said, 'Governor, is this really going to become the law?' " Scott told Fox News host Greta Van Susteren on June 29, 2012. " 'Because if it does, we’re out of business. We have 20 employees. We know we won’t be able to buy any health care for anybody.' " Scott’s story was similar to one he told in Tampa earlier that day and at the Reagan Day Dinner of Pasco County Republicans that night. Scott told attendees at the dinner he was stopping in for a Blizzard at Dairy Queen when he was asked about the law. A Tampa Bay Times reporter tracked down a Dairy Queen owner in Tallahassee who said he recently talked with Scott about how complying with the law would hurt his business. The owner, Jamshaid Mohyuddin, 47, said he told the governor that he couldn’t afford to provide health insurance to his 16 employees. "I'm a businessman myself, and I don’t even have health insurance," Mohyuddin said. "I can’t afford it." Scott encouraged him to link up with other business owners to support Mitt Romney's campaign for president, Mohyuddin said. Scott’s communications staff didn’t confirm that Scott was talking about Mohyuddin. Really, though, it’s not so important for the purposes of this fact-check. What’s important is this: They are mistaken. Businesses with fewer than 50 full-time employees are not required to offer coverage. (See sections 1513 and 4980H of the Affordable Care Act). For larger companies, those with 50 or more full-time employees, there are fines if they do not offer insurance and one of their employees qualifies for government-subsidized insurance. But again, small employers don’t face those fines. While there are no penalties for small businesses like the one Scott described, the law offers tax credits for these employers if they decide to offer coverage. Employers with fewer than 25 employees, whose average annual wages are below $50,000 and offer health insurance, qualify for a tax break of no more than 35 percent. That cap will be lifted to 50 percent in 2014. The law also creates a health insurance exchange for small businesses, with the idea being they can comparison shop for plans. Mohyuddin was elated when a reporter told him that the law exempts him from penalties for not offering health insurance. "That helps me a lot," Mohyuddin said. "I always thought I had to do this." Our ruling Scott repeated an anecdote about a business of about 20 employees that will go broke from having to offer health insurance under the law. But these employers would face no such penalty like the one described. They are exempt from requirements put on larger businesses. If he knew the basic facts about the health care law, he would know that. We rate Scott’s statement Pants on Fire.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2012-07-02T20:07:24	2012-06-29	['None']

pomt-05350	Democrats plan to keep student loan interest rates low "by raising taxes on small businesses, very small businesses … the kinds of small businesses that give jobs to graduates."	false	/florida/statements/2012/may/11/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-said-democrats-want-raises-taxes-small/	Everyone seems to agree they don’t want student loan interest rates going up this summer. President Barack Obama, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress -- all say the government should take action to keep the rates where they are. Yet for all that agreement, it’s still become a political fight. That because keeping interest rates low for student loans means increasing the deficit. Both parties in Congress say they want to find a way to offset that. As you might have guessed, Republicans want to cut spending, while Democrats favor raising taxes on the wealthy. Republicans in the Senate voted down a bill on the matter from the Democrats on May 8, 2012. To explain his vote, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., released a statement that day: "As someone with a student loan and with a state with so many people with student loans, I support a hundred percent making sure that the interest rates on student loans do not go up," Rubio said. "I cannot support the way the Democrats want to do it, however, because, they want to do it by raising taxes on small businesses, very small businesses. The kinds of small businesses that give jobs to graduates who not only need low interest rates but need jobs in order to pay their student loans." We decided to check out Rubio's claim that Democrats want to raise taxes on "small businesses, very small businesses … the kinds of small businesses that give jobs to graduates." To fact-check Rubio's statement, we read the text of the legislation the Democrats were proposing, examined a summary of the bill provided by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, and ran the proposal by the experts at the Tax Policy Center, a respected independent think tank that focuses on taxes. The Democratic proposal seeks to raise more tax revenues by changing rules on some S-corporations. This is pretty arcane tax law, but what we found was very different from Rubio’s description. What’s an S-corporation? Under Internal Revenue Service rules, S-corporations are companies with a limited number of shareholders. Profits can be paid out to owners or retained by the corporation; both are taxed as regular income. S-corporations are not always small businesses, but they often are. Democrats say their bill would crack down on a loophole that some professionals are using to avoid payroll taxes by paying themselves through S-corporations. Here’s the scenario: S-corporations are sometimes owned by the same people who do most of the work -- think of small law firms, accounting firms and the like. As employees, their earnings are subject to payroll taxes, which go to pay for Social Security and Medicare. But as owners, their profits are not subject to payroll taxes. So employee-owners decide to avoid the payroll taxes by giving themselves low pay and high dividends. "It is only when the owner and the employee are the same person, so that the wages come from the same person’s profit, that there is a problem," said Eric Toder of the Tax Policy Center. "Typically this will happen only if there are a very small number of owners who also do the work." The Democratic bill said that all income of partners of those types of S-corporations would now be subject to payroll taxes. And the bill includes several steps to make sure that only those types of people would be targeted. For one, the bill applies only on S-corporations where the owners are doing the work, and only on professional services firms in the fields of "health, law, lobbying, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, investment advice or management, or brokerage services." The bill also stipulates that the new taxes wouldn’t apply to individuals making less than $200,000 or couples making less than $250,000. In defending the bill, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said it was aimed at people who are avoiding taxes. "We want to pay for this with legislation that closes a long, long overdue tax loophole of people who are gaming the system," he said. "These are people who are usually accountants and lawyers who try to pay themselves through dividends and not ordinary income. It's wrong, it's not a tax increase, they're just being called upon to pay what they should pay." We asked Rubio's office for evidence that the Democratic proposal hits "small businesses, very small businesses … the kinds of small businesses that give jobs to graduates." His staff referred us to a U.S. Treasury Report analysis that found that some individuals report small business income in excess of $200,000. The Treasury report found that approximately 8 to 11 percent of all small businesses report income at that level or above. That report, though, counted small businesses as individuals who reported income from a sole proprietorship, partnership, farming operation, miscellaneous rental activity or S-corporation. The Democratic bill called for higher taxes only on a subset of S-corporations. Our ruling Rubio said he opposed the Democratic bill on student loan interest because it would raise taxes on "small businesses, very small businesses … the kinds of small businesses that give jobs to graduates." Actually, the bill changed tax rules only for S-corporations, and only on professionals like lawyers and accountants who could be taking advantage of the tax code to avoid paying payroll taxes. The Democrats took the additional step of saying the rule change would only apply to individuals who reported more than $200,000 in income. The bill's intent was to close a loophole on people who were avoiding payroll taxes, taxes that they're supposed to be paying anyway. Rubio's statement gives the impression that all kinds of mom-and-pop operations might be subject to new, additional taxes, when actually the bill is aimed squarely at high-income professionals who are taking advantage of a loophole.

pomt-10385	"George Bush, and a Republican Congress, have presided over a 55 percent increase in the size of domestic government spending in the last seven years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/18/john-mccain/right-on-the-number-just-a-year-off/	Some days, John McCain and his advisers sound like they are running as much against President Bush as against Sen. Barack Obama. And after using issues like climate change and nuclear disarmament to begin distancing themselves from the administration, McCain & Co. now are branding themselves as hard-nosed fiscal managers capable of putting the clamps on federal spending … unlike President Bush. McCain adviser Carly Fiorina, former chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard Corp., took aim at the president's economic stewardship during a June 17, 2008, appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe program, criticizing Bush and GOP leaders who ran Congress for much of his tenure for failing to cut spending to offset his tax cuts. "This Republican president, George Bush, and a Republican Congress, have presided over a 55 percent increase in the size of domestic government spending in the last seven years," Fiorina said. McCain's camp is eager to draw distinctions, aware that Obama and Democrats are intent on trying to tie the presumptive GOP nominee to Bush's positions to taxes and some spending priorities. Earlier this month, McCain's top adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, derided Bush's knowledge of the economy in an interview with Bloomberg Television, saying the president knows nothing about the economy except taxes. Holtz-Eakin later said he regretted personalizing the issue. While the definition of "domestic government spending" that Fiorina brought up is open to some interpretation, historical tables in the fiscal 2009 budget request that Bush issued in February 2008 demonstrate that all types of federal spending have surged during the Bush years. But domestic spending has not risen quite as fast as Fiorina suggests. Total nondefense domestic spending rose to $2.18-trillion in fiscal 2007 from $1.49-trillion in fiscal 2000 — a 46 percent increase. A good portion of that is attributable to the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill, which drove up entitlement costs. Throw in national security spending increases after 9/11, particularly the cost of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and cumulative spending for the same seven years rose 53 percent, from $1.79-trillion to $2.73-trillion. Because McCain supported many of Bush's national security priorities, and even pressed for sending more troops to Iraq, it would be disingenuous for him to portray Bush and Republican Congresses as profligate in these areas. But on the domestic front, McCain did join other fiscal conservatives in opposing the 2003 Medicare drug bill, preferring to target drug benefits to the needy in an effort to avoid broad new federal mandates. And he has consistently spoken about the need to offset tax cuts with spending reductions, including stamping out earmarks in spending bills. The budget documents show discretionary domestic spending — money not explicitly mandated by law and made available through annual spending bills in such amounts as Congress chooses — rose 54 percent over the seven-year timeframe Fiorina cited. Mandatory spending on Social Security, Medicare, other entitlements and interest payments on government debt rose 44 percent. Interestingly, Fiorina's claim is right on the money if you roll estimated spending for fiscal 2008 into the equation, which makes us wonder if she should tweak her talking points. Bush's budget request estimates nondefense domestic spending will total $2.32-trillion in 2008. That's precisely a 55 percent increase from the $1.49-trillion it totaled in 2000. Either way, Fiorina's point is generally backed up by the numbers. Domestic spending did surge during the Bush years, along with every other broad category of government outlays. We judge her claim Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-18T00:00:00	2008-06-17	['United_States_Congress', 'George_W._Bush']

He justified his agenda partly by saying American students are slipping compared to counterparts around the world. "We've let our grades slip, our schools crumble, our teacher quality fall short, and other nations outpace us," Obama said in the March 10 speech to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. "In eighth grade math, we've fallen to ninth place." Since Obama brought up math, we decided to check his. Turns out we had to pull out the red pen. We asked the White House to defend Obama's claim, and received no response. His claim that eighth grade math students in the United States are in ninth place internationally almost certainly comes from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, a periodic comparison of math and science achievement carried out since 1995 by research institutions and government agencies worldwide. The most recent study , published in 2007, did indeed show U.S. eighth graders in ninth place behind five East Asian countries and Hungary, England and Russia. But it was misleading to say they had "fallen" to ninth place. In 1995, they came in 28th . In 1999, they moved up to 19th . In 2003, they climbed to 15th . So rather than falling, U.S. students have actually improved in the past decade. We considered giving the president partial credit since American students did come in ninth. But the point of his statement was that they had "fallen" to that position and that mathematics performance in the United States is getting worse relative to other countries. And that's just plain False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-03-13T15:15:04	2009-03-10	['None']
pomt-12470	Says police officers smoke marijuana once a year as part of their jobs.	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/05/alex-jones/police-smoke-marijuana-yearly-test-potency-alex-jo/	Texas-based radio show host Alex Jones admitted during a child custody hearing that he has smoked cannabis, in violation of state law. But he only smoked it once per year, he reasoned — just like law enforcement does. Locked in a custody battle over his three children with his ex-wife, the conservative media personality made the admission during testimony in Austin, Texas, on April 20. That’s right, 4/20. Jones said that he tries marijuana annually to gauge its potency. He argued from the stand that he thought marijuana was too strong, a shortcoming he blamed on billionaire George Soros, a frequent scapegoat of conspiracy theorists. Why smoke cannabis annually? "That’s what police do," Jones said, according to the Austin American-Statesman. "They smoke it once a year, too." Jones has admitted to smoking marijuana before, and notably sparked up on Joe Rogan’s podcast earlier this year. While marijuana is illegal in Texas, it is decriminalized in California, where Rogan’s show was recorded. PolitiFact has checked claims about marijuana potency before, the gist being that cannabis is as much as 800 percent stronger now than it was four decades ago. We attempted to contact Jones through his InfoWars website to suss out the basis of his claim that cops rolled their own, but did not receive a response. Jones may have been speaking anecdotally, with or without firsthand knowledge of stoner cops. Law enforcement agencies, however, suggested that Jones was just blowing smoke. Where there’s smoke In general, when people talk about marijuana’s potency, they mean the levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. That’s the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, which contains hundreds of chemical compounds. There’s plenty of research that shows THC levels have increased over the years. A 2010 study by researchers at the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi, for example, found that the THC concentrations had risen by about 171 percent in just a 16-year time period. That study used 46,000 samples of marijuana seized during law enforcement raids. But there was no indication that cops smoked the ganja to find out how strong it was. That’s a job for a laboratory. There are a couple of methods for measuring the chemical compounds in cannabis, but all of them take a certain level of scientific proficiency and technical equipment. Many states that have medical or recreational marijuana have labs that test for these compounds; one company in California has even developed testers for business use outside of a lab. But it’s not like you can take a few hits and spit out a THC percentage, the way Jones implied. We don’t know how he concocted his theory, or which police department he believed was letting officers light up, but we checked with a few places. The Texas Department of Public Safety said they did not have any specifics about departmental drug testing, either for seized evidence or for employees. The state does operate several crime labs that test drugs seized as evidence. The Texas Police Association also did not tell us any particular procedure used by law enforcement agencies. They only said that each department in the state would have its own policies and methods. Since Jones is in Austin, we went to the local P.D. to ask them if it’s possible cops spark up the local dank to get an idea of how strong the weed is there. In a word, no. Jennifer Herber, a spokeswoman for the Austin police department, pointed out that the department’s policy manual prohibited marijuana use. The department does not test cannabis, she said. On a federal level, Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Russ Bayer said the DEA operates its own labs to gauge potency and purity of all kinds of drugs, including marijuana. Depending on the case, the labs may test evidence from federal cases or helping local authorities. But agents toking up to give drugs a personal test? "It’s laughable. Not plausible," Bayer said. "Frankly, it’s insulting. The DEA would never allow consumption of any controlled substance." Our ruling Defending his own use of marijuana, Jones said police officers "smoke it once a year, too." He didn’t offer any proof of his claim that cops light up joints annually to test the strength of cannabis, and we couldn’t find any. Perhaps Jones anecdotally knows or has heard of police officers who don't keep off the grass, but we didn't find a cop shop that said that was a policy. Law enforcement agencies generally test marijuana potency in a laboratory setting, and not by lighting up in the squad room (or elsewhere). For lack of evidence, we rate this statement False.

pomt-06477	"The (Florida) casino proposed by Malaysian gambling conglomerate Genting would be nearly double the size of the largest casino in the world."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/oct/17/no-casinos/no-casinos-group-says-genting-would-build-casino-d/	If we had to settle on one word to describe the $3 billion proposal for Genting's Resorts World Miami in downtown Miami at the current Miami Herald site, we might keep things simple and pick the word "big." Genting has proposed a 10-million-square-foot development including a casino, and the Herald has reported on the various elements of the largesse -- a 3.6-acre outdoor lagoon as large as 12 Olympic-size swimming pools, 5,200 hotel rooms, 1,000 condo units, more than 50 restaurants, lounges, bars and nightclubs, ranging from fine dining to buffets and a food court for a total of 700,000 square feet, about 60 luxury shops, plus a marketplace for a total of 250,000 square feet, and 750,000 square feet of convention and meeting space including a 200,000-square-foot ballroom. Big right? But what about the size of the casino space? A group opposing the expansion of gambling in South Florida, No Casinos, made a claim in an Oct. 11, 2011, "Myth vs. Facts" chart that a bill in the works by two South Florida legislators would pave the way for a record-breaking enormous casino. On the "myth" side of the group's ledge, they say: "The bill carefully limits the scale of casino gambling by requiring that the casino occupy no more than 10 percent of the entire development …" And now for the "fact": "The 'sleight of hand' is one of the casino promoter's best tricks. The fact is the bill would put the biggest casinos in the world right here in Florida. In fact, the casino proposed by Malaysian gambling conglomerate Genting would be nearly double the size of the largest casino in the world. In fact, even if Genting limits the casino size to 8 percent of their development, that Miami casino would be big enough to house six modern marquee casinos on the Las Vegas Strip –- with room to spare! The Genting casino alone would comfortably fit the casinos of the MGM Grand, the Wynn, the Mirage, the Bellagio, Caesar’s Palace and the Venetian. If 3 casinos of this size are built, Florida would have as much casino gambling as 20 or more casinos on the Las Vegas strip –- and all the money would be in the hands of just 3 companies." There are a lot of interesting numbers in that paragraph, but we wanted to find out if the proposed bill would mean that Genting's proposal would "nearly double the size of the largest casino in the world." First, a little background. Genting announced in May that it had purchased land owned by the Miami Herald (which partners on PolitiFact Florida with the St. Petersburg Times) for $236 million and later took over the $206 million mortgage on the neighboring Omni Center. Genting has now amassed about 30 acres. Part of the resort could open as early as 2012 months after it hopes to get approval from the state Legislature for a gambling license. The Genting Group has holdings in resorts and casinos among other industries and owns 50 percent of Miami-based Norwegian Cruise Line. On Oct. 6, 2011, an appeals court gave the go-ahead for legislators to expand gambling in South Florida. Specifically, the First District Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision that concluded that a law passed by the Legislature allowing Hialeah Racetrack to offer slot machines was constitutional and rejected the argument by other facilites that when voters approved slot machines in Miami-Dade and Broward that limited the number of permits to seven pari-mutuels. Two South Florida legislators -- State Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff (R-Fort Lauderdale) and Rep. Erik Fresen (R-Miami) -- are drafting a bill that would pave the way for three resort casinos in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. The bill would create a Florida Gaming Commission and companies could submit bids for casino licenses. The Legislature is expected to take it the legislation when it convenes in January. Bogdanoff and Fresen said the bill they will produce will restrict each resort to using no more than 10 percent of their total footprint for casino games. If state legislators approve the 10 percent limit and Genting builds a 10-million -square-foot resort -- as the company said it plans -- that would mean the casino area could be a maximum of 1 million square feet. (A note: Genting would still have to bid for the rights to build the casino.) China has the largest casino We asked John Sowinski, spokesman for No Casinos, to explain how the group determined that Genting's casino would be nearly double the largest casino in the world. (Kind of obvious, but No Casinos is a group that opposes the expansion of gambling. Sowinski said the group has fought gambling issues since the 1970s.) Sowinski pointed us to a 2009 article in BusinessWeek about the 20 biggest casinos in the world. The article listed the Venetian Macao in China as the biggest --- saying the casino measured 546,000 square feet and had 3,000 gaming or slot machines and 870 casino tables for various games. (This Las Vegas Sands website states that the Venetian Macao is 550,000 square feet.) Three gaming experts confirmed for us that Venetian Macao is the largest: David G. Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada and Holly Wetzel, a spokeswoman for the American Gaming Association, and Roger Gros, publisher of Global Gaming Business Magazine, a publication of the American Gaming Association and a trade publication for the gaming industry. So the largest casino in the world measures about 546,000 square feet and theoretically, the Genting Group could build a casino that's 1 million square feet. No Casinos took that into account to get to its claim that the Miami casino "would be nearly double the size of the largest casino in the world." The group also cited a lower figure -- Sowinski referred us to this article from the Beacon Council, Miami-Dade County's economic development partnership, that stated that Genting's casino size would be 800,000 square feet. A Genting spokeswoman in Miami, Kelly Penton, told us that the gaming floor at Resorts World Miami will measure no more than 8 percent of the total footprint putting the casino size at 800,000 square feet. At that size, four Super Targets would fit in the casino -- with room to spare. She said it's too early to tell on the number of machines. Sowinski says if Genting doesn't build up to full capacity initially for the casino they could over the time. "Why would they limit themselves if the Legislature gives them more than they ask for?" Our ruling The problem is we won't know for at least months, if not years, the size of Genting's casino in Miami. Gros, publisher of Global Gaming Business magazine, told us there's no way Genting's Miami project will be double size of the Venetian Macao. "The market isn’t that big and there will be several large competitors in Florida ... Genting will never build a 1 million square foot casino," he wrote. Schwartz also expressed some skepticism about whether Genting would build a 1-million-square-foot casino. "Hard to say -- all of Atlantic City has about 1.3 million square feet of casino space, and that's 11 casinos. If they populated their casino at the same density as Harrah's Atlantic City (the biggest in the market by floor space) they'd have 12,967 slot machines and 737 table games, which is huge -- far bigger, by positions, than the Venetian Macao," Schwartz wrote in an e-mail. "If they had a complete monopoly on the South Florida market, they might be able to support that kind of footprint, but I'm skeptical that,with any competition in the region, a casino that size could work. It's certainly far larger than anything that's ever been attempted, and we might start to see diseconomies of scale. Without seeing their blueprints it's hard to say for sure." We see their point, but for now all we have to go on is Genting's own words. They said they want to build a casino that is 800,000 square feet. That is significantly larger than the largest casino in the world, though we believe it falls a little shy of "nearly double." We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-12431	"Barack Obama arrested in a Japanese drug bust."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/17/blog-posting/conspiracy-theorists-concoct-fake-report-obama-arr/	A fake news story that said former President Barack Obama was busted for his links to a drug smuggling operation is part of an extensive and completely unsupported conspiracy theory popularized online. A May 2, 2017, headline on AmericanFlavor.news declared, "Just in: Barack Obama arrested in a Japanese drug bust." The story was flagged by Facebook users, as part of the social media site’s efforts to cut down on fake reports in its users’ news feeds. The post was exceptionally short, saying that Obama had "informed on his drug-dealing bosses," citing "Japanese military intelligence." It explained that "an airplane filled with Afghan Heroin and North Korean amphetamines was impounded at Argyle International Airport on St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean." Obama had been arrested for some unspecified connection to a ship that was carrying more than 4 tons of cocaine. The proceeds of the future drug sales were to fund ISIS, the post read. The story is nonsense, because obviously Obama had not been arrested. And he was too busy negotiating $400,000 for speaking appearances to smuggle cocaine. The AmericanFlavor.news post was the latest stop for a conspiracy theory that goes back a few weeks. The article linked to a YouTube video: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The video was created by Denise Stark, a conspiracy theorist who was citing an online radio show called Stillness in the Storm, a show its creators describe as "an ongoing conversation about world events, hidden truths, and empowering information." Stillness in the Storm’s website linked to a blog post written by Benjamin Fulford, who on March 31 had written the piece that later appeared on AmericanFlavor.news. Stillness in the Storm had warned on its site that "Fulford's claims should not be considered to be true without substantiation." Fulford, in turn, used his original post to link to a March 15 screed on WhatDoesItMean.com, a site rife with conspiratorial meanderings. The essay said that Obama had some nebulous link to a fishing boat called Lady Michelle, which had been busted in the Caribbean while smuggling cocaine. The post was written by Sorcha Faal, the pseudonym of a conspiracy theorist with a series of posts on WhatDoesItMean.com. Faal’s post makes some pretty big leaps in logic, including that George W. Bush and Obama operated cocaine-smuggling operations and that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had ordered their arrest. The photo that accompanied Faal’s post was of a ship called Lady Michelle, which had been stopped by the U.S. Coast Guard off the shore of Suriname on Feb. 16, 2017. Four Guyanese men were arrested for transporting 4.2 tons of cocaine worth about $125 million. There’s no mention of Japan, or any connection to Obama. Previously PunditFact had checked a claim that Obama was arrested at the Canadian border for wiretrapping Trump, which earned a Pants On Fire! rating. This post also is contrived, stemming from unfounded conspiracy theories that drew ridiculous conclusions and made provably untrue claims. We rate it Pants On Fire!

pomt-01036	Assault weapons and handguns are allowed in the state Capitol while bullhorns, trumpets, helium balloons and flags on poles are banned.	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/jan/26/virginia-house-democratic-caucus/dems-say-assault-guns-allowed-va-capitol-while-bal/	House Democrats in the General Assembly have launched a petition drive to show public support for a package of pending gun control bills. The online entreaty calls for "common sense gun laws" and, to foster the contention that Virginia’s firearm policies are awry, contains a white and blue graphic of some of the rules regarding public entrance to the state capitol. On the left side of the graphic is the headline "Banned in the Virginia State Capitol." Underneath are pictures of a bullhorn, a trumpet, a floating helium balloon and an American flag on a pole. The right side says, "Allowed in the Virginia State Capitol." Underneath are pictures of a handgun, a rifle, and two assault guns. "How does this make sense?" the bottom of the chart asks in capital letters. We wondered whether the petition accurately described the rules for entry into the Capitol. David Pourshoushtari, a spokesman for the House Democrats, pointed us to visitors’ rules posted on the General Assembly’s website. The House and the Senate have identical rules for general entry into the Capitol. The conditions vary slightly for entry into galleries in each chamber. Let’s take a look. Bullhorns, trumpets and balloons. The basic rules for entering the Capitol are spelled out in these words on the legislative website: "Possession or use of any device that may disrupt the conduct of business is prohibited, including, but not limited to: voice-amplification equipment; bullhorns; blow horns; sirens, or other noise-producing devices as well as signs on sticks, poles or stakes, or helium-filled balloons." That confirms two of four items Democrats said were banned. But what about trumpets? Susan Schaar, the Senate clerk, said they would generally not be allowed since they fall into the realm of "noise-producing devices." Schaar said exceptions can be made, such as for a memorial service. Paul Nardo, the House clerk, said flags are allowed to be brought into the building, but not if they’re hoisted on poles. The image on the Democrat’s petition shows a flag on a pole. Nardo explained that the rules apply to everyone, including members of the legislature as well as the general public. Firearms We couldn’t find any rules about bringing guns into the Capitol on the General Assembly’s website. But they do exist. Capt. Randy Howard of the Virginia Division of Capitol Police said firearms access into the Capitol is governed by rules passed in 2004 by a joint legislative committee. He told us possession is limited to three groups: General Assembly members, law enforcement officials and any holder of a valid concealed handgun permit. Could someone bring an assault rifle into the Capitol? If he is allowed to bring in a firearm, the answer is yes, Howard said. The 2004 rule "simply says ‘firearm’, so it’s fairly broad," Howard told us. "It doesn’t just say that the only thing they can bring in is a handgun even though that’s what’s covered by the (concealed) handgun permit." Del. Joseph Morrissey, I-Henrico, held aloft an unloaded AK-47 in the House chamber during a 2013 debate over a gun control measure he sponsored. Morrissey said then that the weapon had been inspected by the Capitol police prior to being brought into the chamber, according to an article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The Senate bans firearms in its public gallery looking over the chamber’s floor. There is no such restriction in the House gallery. Our ruling Calling for reform to Virginia’s gun laws, House Democrats noted that firearms -- including assault rifles -- are allowed to be brought in the state Capitol while helium balloons, flags on poles, trumpets and bullhorns are banned. The list of barred articles holds up. The firearms issue is a bit trickier. They can be brought into the Capitol, but only by lawmakers, valid concealed weapons permit holders and law enforcement. They are banned in the Senate gallery. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Virginia House Democratic Caucus	None	None	None	2015-01-26T13:00:00	2015-01-19	['None']

Nonetheless, in an interview on the Today Show on Sept. 27, 2010, that focused on education, President Barack Obama stuck to his long-held position, saying, "I think we should have longer school years." The following day, Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert took aim at Obama's plan, saying, "This has got to be Obama's worst legislative initiative since the 'You Forgot to Give Us Homework Act' of 2009." Whether summer vacation ought to be shortened is a matter of opinion. But what Obama said to back up his position is a checkable fact. "We now have our kids go to school about a month less than most other advanced countries," Obama said. "And that makes a difference." In the United States, kids go to school 180 days a year. We looked at statistics from 2008 provided by the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), a research group sponsored by most of the world's advanced industrialize nations. Among the 31 OECD countries that reported statistics, the average for primary grades of public school was 187 days. The average for countries in the European Union, which includes several countries which are not part of the OECD, was 184 days per year. So it's certainly accurate to say that kids in the United States go to school fewer days than most other advanced countries. But "about a month" less? Taking out weekends, we figured a generous figure for "about a month" was at least 15 days. According to the OECD, there were eight countries with 195 or more days of school a year. Again, that's out of 31, so it's not "most." Obama had it right when he raised this issue last year and cited a similar, but different statistic. "We can no longer afford an academic calendar designed when America was a nation of farmers who needed their children at home plowing the land at the end of each day," Obama said. "That calendar may have once made sense, but today, it puts us at a competitive disadvantage. Our children spend over a month less in school than children in South Korea. That is no way to prepare them for a 21st-century economy." With regard to South Korea, Obama was on the mark. American children spend over a month less in school than children in South Korea (220 days). The issue of longer school years has been debated intensely in academic circles for years. Some studies have made a case for longer school days, rather than more days of school, while others have shown longer schools years have been of particular benefit to poorly performing students. But our focus here is on Obama's claim about the length of the school year in the United States compared with other advanced countries around the world. We think Obama has a solid argument about American kids going to school fewer days than many other kids, but it's a stretch to say they go about a month less than students in most other advanced countries. Students in those countries on average go about a week and a half longer. Students in only about a quarter of those countries go to school close to a month longer than American kids. So we rate his comment Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-09-30T06:00:00	2010-09-27	['None']

pomt-04863	A United Nations arms treaty would "almost certainly force" the U.S. to "create an international gun registry, setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/aug/10/paul-broun/broun-un-treaty-likely-lead-international-gun-regi/	U.S. Rep. Paul Broun wants you to reach for your checkbook. A Second Amendment rights group needs money to keep the United Nations from coming for your guns. The Athens Republican made his pitch in a YouTube video posted by the National Association for Gun Rights. "If passed by the U.N. and ratified by the U.S. Senate, the U.N. Small Arms Treaty would almost certainly force the United States to … create an international gun registry, setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation," Broun said during the video posted July 10. Treaty negotiations fell apart in late July, but advocates are hopeful that a version will pass soon. We therefore took a closer look. PolitiFact Georgia asked Broun for more information, but his spokeswoman refused repeated requests for comment. We soldiered on. PolitiFact Georgia interviewed gun rights experts, especially those who, like Broun, are critical of gun control. We also consulted past PolitiFact coverage of the arms treaty. The U.N. has mulled over a treaty to regulate the global arms trade for years. Backers say it would curtail mass killings and terrorism, and keep dictators from killing their own people. (Small arms are not the treaty’s sole focus, as Broun’s description suggests. Conventional weapons, including guns, missiles and attack helicopters, are.) The George W. Bush administration rebuffed the effort, but the Obama administration said in 2009 that it is open to negotiations. In 2010, PolitiFact National evaluated a claim that under the treaty, "all U.S. citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments." In the unlikely event that the president and two-thirds of the Senate agreed to a treaty that bans guns and requires their confiscation, long-standing Supreme Court precedent would make it unenforceable, it said in ruling the claim False. In May, PolitiFact Texas tested a claim that "Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are negotiating with the United Nations about doing a treaty that will ban the use of firearms." It ruled Pants on Fire because an administration official recently said the U.S. will not back a treaty that infringes on the Second Amendment. So "full-scale gun confiscation" in the U.S. is out of the picture. What about an international gun registry? Gun control critics pointed us to a July 26 draft posted on the website of a pro-disarmament group. Article 2 states that each party "shall establish or update, as appropriate, and maintain a national control list" that would include battle tanks, attack helicopters and guns, among other things. "Even the most limited reading of the treaty suggests that, while it would not create an international registry of all guns, it seeks to create one of all imported guns," said Ted Bromund, a senior research fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank. But no treaty language establishes a worldwide registry of individuals who own guns or dealers who sell to customers in their own countries. In fact, the draft affirms the "sovereign right and responsibility of any State to regulate and control transfers of conventional arms that take place exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own legal or constitutional systems." Prior General Assembly resolutions contain similar language. Official U.N. statements emphasize that a treaty would regulate international import, export and transfers of conventional arms only. "Nobody wants to control the transfer of weapons inside a country," said Tom Collina, the research director of the Arms Control Association. Of course, this version of the treaty failed in U.N. negotiations. Even if it had succeeded, U.S. ratification would be unlikely, our anti-gun control experts agreed. Still, we opted to take Broun’s statement further. He posits an alternate political reality where leaders ratify a treaty that could lead the U.S. to create a registry to track -- and ultimately confiscate -- guns. PolitiFact Georgia asked legal experts whether one would be constitutional. They gave differing opinions. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue. Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, thinks registries would pass constitutional muster because they don’t "materially interfere with the ability to keep guns for self-defense." Dave Kopel, a legal expert with the pro-free market Independence Institute, called registration a "gray area, legally speaking." A future court could overturn Second Amendment precedent, Kopel said. "Like so much else in constitutional law, the answer is ‘it depends,’ " said Brannon P. Denning, a professor at Samford University’s Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham. How do we rule? A draft of the U.N. treaty would require the U.S. to report information on international arms sales only -- not domestic sales. But "full-scale gun confiscation" would not be constitutional. A domestic registry may not be. This means that even in the unlikely event that the U.N. creates a treaty that provides for domestic registries and the U.S. Senate ratifies it, it would not "almost certainly force" the U.S. to create one. Broun’s statement contains the tiniest sliver of truth. The treaty would track international gun sales. But his claim makes it sound like the U.N. will keep a registry of all gun owners across the world. That’s a bizarre distortion of the facts. His claim is False.

pomt-14693	The economy is "too weak to raise income levels."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/12/nikki-haley/economy-too-weak-raise-incomes-nikki-haley-state-u/	In her Republican response to the State of the Union address, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley expressed criticism of President Barack Obama’s stewardship of the economy. "The president's record has often fallen far short of his soaring words," Haley said. "As he enters his final year in office, many Americans are still feeling the squeeze of an economy too weak to raise income levels." We decided to check whether, six years into the economic recovery, income levels are still in the doldrums. Haley is basically correct if you look at Census Bureau data for median household income, adjusted for inflation. Here’s the trend line in recent years. Inflation-adjusted, median household income has fallen from $57,357 in 2009 to $53,657 in 2014, the most recent full year available. That’s a decline of 6.4 percent over a five-year period once inflation is taken into account. Obama himself seemed to acknowledge this trend when he spoke about "more and more wealth and income" concentrated at the top and "squeezed workers." The only silver lining for Obama is that median income has increased a bit since the first full year of the recovery -- 2010 -- and saw a tangible bump between 2012 and 2013. Still, at best, median income is moving sideways, a result strongly at odds with the much better record of job creation and unemployment reduction under Obama. There are alternative ways to measure income, such as earnings from work, but these show growth that’s tepid at best. For instance, median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers rose from $776 in 2013 to $791 in 2014, which is less than a 2 percent increase, or roughly in line with inflation. Our ruling Haley said the economy is "too weak to raise income levels." While the economy under Obama has made significant strides in such areas as job creation, income has not been an area of significant improvement. Median income is lower now compared to 2009. It is, however, slightly up from its low point in 2012. Haley’s claim is generally accurate but somewhat depends on your time frame and what you would consider a rise in income levels.

pomt-05798	"Today gasoline hit $6 a gallon in Florida."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/feb/23/ron-paul/gas-prices-are-6-gallon-florida-says-ron-paul/	There’s no doubt gas prices in Florida have been on the rise -- but have they really hit $6 a gallon? That was the surprising claim from Ron Paul at the Republican presidential debate in Arizona on Feb. 22, 2012. It started with CNN moderator John King asking candidates what should be done about Syria. Paul, a congressman from Texas, was making a point about the downside of U.S. intervention in foreign countries, which led to an aside about gas prices. "You know, I've tried the moral argument. I've tried the constitutional argument on these issues. And they don't go so well. But there's an economic argument, as well," Paul said. "As a matter of fact, al-Qaida has had a plan to bog us down in the Middle East and bankrupt this country. That's exactly what they're doing. We've spent $4 trillion of debt in the last 10 years being bogged down in the Middle East. The neoconservatives who now want us to be in Syria, want us to go to Iran, have another war, and we don't have the money -- today gasoline hit $6 a gallon in Florida -- and we don't have the money." International geopolitics is one thing, but $6 gas hits close to home. So we decided to check it out. We emailed the Paul campaign, but we didn’t hear back. Still, it didn’t take long to find some likely suspects for sources. The Drudge Report, for example, featured the headline "$6 gas" just a few hours before the debate’s start. The Drudge Report’s link sent readers to a Tampa television station's report that a couple of gas stations in Florida are charging close to $6 a gallon. The report’s source was GasBuddy.com, a website that tracks prices by gas station so consumers can find the cheapest prices and avoid the highest. Sure enough, when we checked GasBuddy the morning after the debate, we found one gas station that was charging $5.79 a gallon and another that was charging $5.69. (You can read user reviews on Yelp.com for the two gas stations here and here.) So that’s two gas stations out of the entire state. Every other gas station charged much less, with the next highest at $4.35. Most notably, those two gas stations are suspiciously close to the beating heart of Florida tourism -- the international airport that brings visitors to Walt Disney World. "Florida residents know better than to get gas there. It's entirely to clip the tourists," said Gregg Laskoski, an analyst with GasBuddy. Citing those two stations "totally exaggerates the gas prices situation here in Florida." Laskoski told us it’s not the first time a few stations have given the wrong impression about gas prices statewide. "Every year, these stories about a couple of gas stations in the Orlando area pop up, to represent extreme gas stations," he said. "This is not a new story; it's an old story with a new price." Statewide averages are high by historical standards but much lower than Paul's scary $6 figure. The day after the debate, GasBuddy was reporting the average Florida price as $3.70. AAA’s Fuel Gauge Report set the average Florida price similarly, at $3.70 for a gallon of regular unleaded. Jessica Brady, a spokesperson for AAA, said $6 a gallon was not accurate. And while average gas prices are going up, she said she didn’t expect them to hit $6, at least not anytime soon. "It is going up, and it's expected to continue to go up into the spring and the summer," Brady said. "It's possible by spring we could see prices at $4 a gallon." Brady blamed the rising gas prices on mounting tensions with Iran; economic instability in Europe; fluctuating expectations of economic growth in the United States; and seasonal refinery maintenance. We also spoke with Izzy Rommes, director of the division of standards at the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which regulates gasoline. He said he wasn’t familiar with the Orlando gas stations in question, but said the state generally only acts on complaints of price gouging during hurricanes or other natural disasters. "The market controls the price of gas absent a declaration of emergency," he said. "As long as the price is disclosed, there's nothing wrong with it." Finally, we spoke with "Bob," last name unknown, who answered the phone at Suncoast Energys, one of the gas stations in question. No one there wanted to answer our questions, he said. He added that the station hasn’t changed its prices since May of last year. Our ruling Florida drivers can take a small measure of gratitude in the fact that gas prices are not at $6 a gallon. Or $5 a gallon. Or $4 a gallon. The statewide average is $3.70. (One note of caution: If you need to fill up near the Orlando airport, shop around!) As for Paul, we suspect he read headlines that gave the wrong impression on Florida gas prices. In fact, we found only two of approximately 7,100 gas stations that even come close to the price he cites. We wouldn't bring a flaming Truth-O-Meter to a filling station, but that's what this one deserves. Pants on Fire!	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2012-02-23T16:27:44	2012-02-22	['None']

pomt-11784	Says Josh Hawley "broke his promise to create a Public Corruption Unit to crack down on the pay-to-play culture of Jefferson City."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2017/nov/24/claire-mccaskill/mccaskills-campaign-says-hawley-broke-his-promise-/	Editor's note, Dec. 7, 2017: The Missouri Democratic Party asked us to take another look at the evidence after this fact check ran in November. The party’s spokeswoman provided us with examples of other units that Josh Hawley created with dedicated staffs. She argued again that the attorney general’s reference to a public corruption "team," rather than "unit," showed Hawley had not fulfilled his promise. We have added those examples, as well as more information from Hawley’s camp. After further review, our rating remains the same. *** Democrats have accused Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley of breaking more than one promise. Now, incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill’s campaign says he has broken another. McCaskill campaign manager David Kirby released a statement in response to Hawley’s announcement for Senate, addressing a vow to prosecute public corruption. "He broke his promise to create a Public Corruption Unit to crack down on the pay-to-play culture of Jefferson City," Kirby said. You can see the full statement below. Download PDF But Hawley’s office says he has kept that promise. Who’s telling the truth? Let’s find out. Hawley’s campaign During his attorney general campaign, Hawley promised to create a public corruption unit that would "take a more aggressive role in aiding local and federal prosecutors investigating allegations of corruption." On the attorney general’s website, Hawley says he’s fulfilled his promise. The page defines the group as a team that "actively investigates and prosecutes official abuses of power and other corruption to keep Missouri government honest and clean." Hawley also referred to problems with "pay-to-play culture" in Jefferson City on the campaign trail. Pay-to-play is usually defined as money in exchange for services. What Democrats say When we reached out to McCaskill’s campaign for evidence, it pointed us to the Missouri Democratic Party. The party sent us language it said was from Hawley’s campaign website that specifically promised to use the public corruption unit to end pay-to-play in Jefferson City. "In addition to a public corruption unit, my ethics reform plan would prevent public officials from getting rich off the system, increase transparency, attack the pay-to-play politics of Jefferson City and ban lobbyist gifts to employees within the A.G.’s office — a ban that should be extended to the Missouri Legislature." We couldn’t verify that ourselves because that passage no longer exists on Hawley’s website, but the party also pointed us to a quote from a debate Hawley did on 93.9, the Eagle. "I have a plan to clean it up. I've announced that I would create a public corruption unit in the office of the Attorney General to coordinate local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, to prosecute, investigate and prosecute these public corruption crimes that have come to characterize Jefferson City and it's time that we took these measures," he said on May 17, 2016. Team vs. Unit Hawley’s website says he has a public corruption "team," not a "unit." Meira Bernstein, a party spokeswoman, pointed us to six other units in Hawley’s office that have dedicated staff. They are the Federalism Unit, the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit, and four units in the Public Safety Division. "There is absolutely no reason he would call the Public Corruption Team a ‘team’ rather than a ‘unit,’ other than the fact that it is different than a unit," Bernstein said. Here’s where we have to go back to the original promise. Hawley did not promise to create a public corruption unit "with dedicated staff." He promised to create a public corruption unit to "take a more aggressive role in aiding local and federal prosecutors investigating allegations of corruption." Whether he calls it a team or a unit, Hawley’s office provided substantial evidence proving he has done that. When asked about the team versus unit argument, Hawley’s deputy chief of staff Loree Anne Paradise said, "When you look up the word ‘team’ on Thesaurus.com, ‘unit’ is listed as a synonym." Does it matter? Though Hawley made some indications he would use the group to address pay-to-play in Jefferson City, it doesn’t necessarily prove what Democrats are claiming. Why? Because a public corruption team exists. The group is led by Deputy Attorney General Darrell Moore. Other lawyers working on the team include First Assistant John Sauer and Deputy Attorney General Michael Martinich-Sauter. Paradise said attorneys within the Public Safety Division also provide support, such as Greg Goodwin, Travis Lilly, Steven Kretzer and Locke Thompson. At the time of Kirby’s statement, the website page listed three cases the team has worked on. It now lists four cases, with the most recent press release dated December 1, 2017. Paradise said there are several other ongoing investigations that are not yet public. Hawley’s office said they find these public corruption cases in three primary ways. They receive tips from government officials and law enforcement, find cases themselves by actively looking for them and receive complaints issued by the Missouri Office of Constituent Services. After identifying a public corruption case, Hawley’s office said the investigation process requires complex analysis by a number of attorneys (depending on the case) and takes at least a couple of months. Democrats say the group didn’t exist until the Missouri Democratic Party started asking questions. Bernstein said the party made a Sunshine Request on July 12 for any emails regarding a public corruption unit. The next day, according to the Democratic Party’s timeline, Hawley sent a request that a page be created on his official website. Paradise did not specify when the webpage was created but said the team was in play months before Democrats’ accusations. The news release for the first case is dated April 5, 2017. The corruption team has prosecuted officials in Mississippi, Cooper and Cass counties. No state legislators or other Jefferson City officials have been prosecuted. Our ruling McCaskill’s campaign manager said Hawley "broke his promise to create a Public Corruption Unit to crack down on the pay-to-play culture of Jefferson City." Although Democrats contest when it was born and say he hasn’t used the team to crack down on "pay-to-play" in Jefferson City, the bottom lineis Hawley has prioritized prosecuting public corruption and created a team to make it happen. Regardless of whether the group is a team or unit, Hawley’s office still has a working group of lawyers who have already prosecuted four officials for public corruption.

pomt-07988	Under current U.S. immigration policy, "literally one person with a green card" can, in the extreme, bring in more than 270 of his relatives.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/18/phil-gingrey/marietta-republican-says-single-immigrant-can-lead/	U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey wants Georgians to know that even a trickle of immigration can lead to a deluge. The Marietta Republican explained just how bad he thinks it can get during a state legislative committee meeting on immigration. Speaking via a video conference transmission from Washington on Dec. 16, he put blame on the shoulders of national immigration policy. "And so now, under the policy, our immigration policy, literally one person with a green card can bring in, in the extreme ... 279 people." That sounds like a lot. Is this true? Immigration became a central issue during the election season when now-Gov. Nathan Deal and his Democratic foe, former Gov. Roy Barnes, both called for an Arizona-style immigration law. That state's decision to take a more active role enforcing federal laws prompted the U.S. Department of Justice to file suit against it. We called Gingrey's office for evidence. A staffer referred us to NumbersUSA, a nonprofit group that advocates for lower immigration levels. Roy Beck, the group's executive director, said he did not know of any cases where this happened, but he stressed it's possible through "chain migration." That's when immigrants take advantage of U.S. rules that allow them to bring their relatives here. Foreigners who obtain green cards can apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to bring their spouses and unmarried children. If they become citizens and are over age 21, they can also apply to bring in their married children, parents and siblings. We checked NumbersUSA's math. The group used immigration rules and fertility rates for less-developed countries to determine that 273 relatives of a legal immigrant can follow him during the next 15 years. (Gingrey said 279, but we won't count this slight difference against him.) Since Gingrey said such immigration was possible "in the extreme," we accepted the group's assumptions such as that in recent years, families in the less-developed world have, on average, three children, and that all of an immigrant's eligible family members would leave for the U.S. and become citizens as soon as they could legally do so. We also assumed there were absolutely no visa processing waits and that immigration backlogs do not exist. We found NumbersUSA's estimate was not based on "literally one person with a green card" entering the country, as Gingrey said. Their estimate assumes that the first immigrant comes here as a worker with his spouse and three children. This roughly doubles its estimate. We also found that immigration researchers generally agree that in the real world, such large-scale immigration is at least extremely unlikely if not impossible. Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels, is critical of chain migration, but she noted that administrative wait times and quotas can make such large-scale migration difficult. She had not heard of a case where this has happened. Karen Woodrow-Lafield, who studies immigration as a professor at the Maryland Population Research Center at the University of Maryland, noted those same problems. She said such numbers are "not possible under the current immigration system" because of visa application backlogs. Atlanta's USCIS field office now takes four or five months to process immigration documents. In California, the processing time for U.S. citizens to bring in siblings is more than four years. Crystal Williams, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, a national association of attorneys and law professors who practice and teach immigration law, said her group also determined that NumbersUSA's figures are not possible. Her group supports the U.S. Justice Department's suit against Arizona. "If people could bring in those numbers, they would have," Williams said. "But they didn't." U.S. law sets yearly quotas on legal permanent residents and caps the percentage of potential immigrants from a particular country to 7 percent. This means waits that can last for decades. For instance, Filipino siblings of U.S. residents who applied for visas before Jan. 1, 1988, are only just beginning to be interviewed for entry, according to the U.S. State Department. For countries without backlogs, the date is Jan. 1, 2002. In reality, chain-migration numbers are much lower, experts who study the subject told us. Over a span of 20 years, immigrants who came in on employment visas in 1971 brought in an average of one resident. More recently, one researcher found that on average, one foreign citizen brings in 2.1 others under family reunification rules. And another study shows only some 10 percent of immigrants who got their green cards in 2003 petitioned to bring a relative to the U.S. So what does this mean? Gingrey said that "literally one person with a green card" could bring in more than 270 others "in the extreme." But we found his figure was not based on one person. It's based on a family of five. We found this scenario is likely impossible under quotas established under current immigration policy. Quotas mean it can take years -- even decades. Merely processing immigration documents can take months, if not years. Given that recent data show that the average immigrant brings in 2.1 others in his lifetime, Gingrey could easily have remained within the bounds of accuracy by describing an "extreme" scenario as one where two or three dozen others followed the first immigrant within 15 years. Instead, he said "279" -- hundreds more than "extreme." We therefore rule Gingrey's statement False.	None	Phil Gingrey	None	None	None	2011-01-18T06:00:00	2010-12-16	['United_States']
pomt-05883	Says President Barack Obama "has an Environmental Protection Agency proposal that would raise the price of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/07/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-epa-plans-boost-gas-prices-25-c/	What better way to scare American voters than tell them the government wants them to pay 25 cents a gallon more for gas? In an appearance on Meet the Press on Feb. 5, 2012, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich argued that President Obama’s policies have "weakened the country." Prime example: "He has an Environmental Protection Agency proposal that would raise the price of gasoline by 25 cents a gallon. There are very few Americans who want to see the price of gasoline raised by government ... 25 cents a gallon." We think Gingrich is probably right about that second part. We decided to look further into the first. EPA and reducing tailpipe emissions Gingrich’s campaign spokesman, R.C. Hammond, directed us to recent news coverage of the EPA’s proposed "Tier 3" regulations on fuel emissions. The regulations are part of Obama’s multi-year plan to reduce tailpipe pollution. Initially, his administration created the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas requirements for trucks. Next the administration set such standards for cars, light trucks, and sport-utility vehicles, called "light-duty vehicles," for model years 2017- 2025, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. Now, the EPA is working to create a new set of emissions standards to reduce pollution from these light-duty vehicles. These would update standards that EPA set in 1999. But the potential costs of the new regulations have some politicians up in arms. Hammond pointed us to a letter signed by six U.S. senators to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson raising concerns about the proposed action. "With gasoline prices already high, and with so many Americans already struggling to make ends meet, we urge you to recognize that now is not the time for new regulations that will raise the price of fuel even further," the letter stated. It went on to cite a study by the consulting firm Baker & O’Brien, which estimated capital and annual costs of complying with the new regulations of $17 billion and $13 billion respectively and predicted oil refinery closures and an increase in gasoline prices of 12 to 25 cents per gallon. That’s where Gingrich’s 25-cent statement came from. But there are some important things to know about this study. First, it was conducted for the American Petroleum Institute, an oil industry trade group. "At the very least, industry-sponsored studies (and interest-group sponsored studies, for that matter) should always be taken with a grain of salt," said David Jenkins, vice president for government and political affairs for Republicans for Environmental Protection. "Candidates should not be reciting such studies as gospel, since they know, or should know, that a study can be engineered to produce whatever results the sponsor would like by tweaking the choice of assumptions." Second, the Baker & O’Brien study assumes two major changes in the standards: lowering the sulfur content in gasoline and adjusting something called Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), a measure of fuel volatility. But the study was initiated before the EPA made its intentions known, according to Michelle Robinson with the Union of Concerned Scientists. Now, the EPA has said it is only exploring changes in sulfur levels. Baker & O’Brien’s conclusions were based on four scenarios, all of which assumed lower RVP requirements. Robinson wrote in an email that "while the API study did not distinguish the costs of reducing the RVP from the costs of lowering sulfur content, a review of the report indicates that most of the costs are due to the RVP reduction." That means that the biggest chunk of the costs are expected from a change that EPA has said it isn’t seeking. Said Robinson: "The oil industry study is dramatically overstating the cleanup costs because it is based on a false premise." Other evidence We found another study examining the impacts of Tier 3, commissioned by the International Council for Clean Transportation, a nonprofit foundation that seeks to improve transportation efficiency in order to reduce climate change. This study specifically included a scenario which allowed the gasoline sulfur improvement to be isolated from the RVP improvement, Robinson told us. Conducted by the refinery consulting firm MathPro, this study concluded that the price of reducing the average gasoline sulfur content would be less than one cent per gallon. EPA did not respond to our inquiry, but in several published reports we found references to remarks by Margo Oge of EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality. She said Jan. 26, 2012, at the Washington Auto Show that the oil industry’s cost projections were based costs of a program that "EPA is not planning to propose." Our ruling Gingrich warned that under Obama, the EPA plans to raise gasoline prices by 25 cents a gallon. He drew that information from an industry-funded study considering the cost impacts of the EPA’s proposed Tier 3 fuel standards and went right for the high end of the estimate. "Surely he knows that API has a vested interest in presenting a high projection," said Jenkins, of Republicans for Environmental Protection. Even more importantly, the study concluded its cost estimates based on fuel-standard changes that EPA is not considering. When looking only at lowering the sulfur content of gasoline, the cost would be far lower -- even less than a penny per gallon, according to a study commissioned by an environmental group. Gingrich’s statement exaggerates and misleads, and we rate it False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/bc4d6c67-20d8-4f5c-b267-c8c971698e88	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-02-07T18:09:05	2012-02-05	['None']

pomt-00509	Says Barack Obama told the U.S. Coast Guard Academy "that the number one threat to the military and the world today is global warming."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/25/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-barack-obama-told-coast-guard-gl/	As he pursues a bid for the White House in 2016, Gov. Scott Walker has made it a point to call for more action against "radical Islamic terrorism." He did so again while speaking June 20, 2015, in Washington, D.C., at a conference of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, a group led by conservative political strategist Ralph Reed. Toward the end of his remarks, Walker turned to national security -- or what he prefers to call "safety." He criticized President Barack Obama and Obama’s former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner for president. And then he made a claim about Obama, national security and global warming. "You know, I think about how mixed up this Obama-Clinton doctrine is when it comes to foreign policy," Walker said. "We've got a president who, earlier this year -- at the graduation ceremony for the Coast Guard Academy -- stood up and actually told the graduates that the number one threat to the military and the world today is global warming. "Well, I've got a message for you, Mr. President: The number one threat to the military, the number one threat to America, the number one threat to the world, is radical Islamic terrorism and it's about time we do something about it." Extended applause followed. But Walker made a far-reaching claim. Did Obama tell graduates from a branch of the military that global warming is the number one threat to the military and the world? What was said Walker’s claim pertains to the commencement speech the president gave May 20, 2015, at the academy, which is located in New London, Conn. The official text shows Obama devoted the bulk of his speech to climate change (he used that term, not global warming), describing it as a serious threat to America’s national security and to global security. He did not go so far as to call it the top threat to the military or the world. Here’s a key portion of what Obama said: And this brings me to the challenge I want to focus on today -- one where our Coast Guardsmen are already on the front lines, and that, perhaps more than any other, will shape your entire careers -- and that’s the urgent need to combat and adapt to climate change. As a nation, we face many challenges, including the grave threat of terrorism. And as Americans, we will always do everything in our power to protect our country. Yet even as we meet threats like terrorism, we cannot, and we must not, ignore a peril that can affect generations …. Here at the Academy, climate change -- understanding the science and the consequences -- is part of the curriculum, and rightly so, because it will affect everything that you do in your careers ….As America’s Maritime Guardian, you’ve pledged to remain always ready -- Semper Paratus -- ready for all threats. And climate change is one of those most severe threats. And this is not just a problem for countries on the coasts, or for certain regions of the world. Climate change will impact every country on the planet. No nation is immune. So I’m here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security. And make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country. And so we need to act -- and we need to act now. So, Walker suggests Obama puts climate change ahead of terrorism as a threat, but in his speech, the president notes that the U.S. needs to confront both. We also checked five news accounts of the speech -- from the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, TIME and Fox News. They all emphasized that Obama described climate change as a threat or serious threat to national security. Other speeches Prior to the Coast Guard speech, Obama -- in a general context -- suggested climate change is the world’s number one threat. For instance, in his State of the Union speech in January 2015, Obama said: "No challenge  poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change." And in April 2015, a few days before Earth Day, he said: "Today, there's no greater threat to our planet than climate change." So, after having identified climate change as perhaps the world’s greatest threat overall, Obama did devote a speech, given to members of the military, to the threat climate change poses to national and global security. But he didn’t go as far as Walker claims. Our rating Walker said Obama told the Coast Guard Academy "that the number one threat to the military and the world today is global warming." Obama on various occasions, and in a general context, has said there is no greater threat to the world than climate change. But in the speech Walker cited, the president told Coast Guard graduates that climate change was a serious threat, not the number one threat to the military or the world. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we give Walker a Mostly False.

pomt-09457	On reconciliation	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/05/barack-obama/obama-hypocrite-reconciliation/	With President Barack Obama calling for Congress to move toward a reconciliation bill on health care (which would require only a simple majority of 51 votes in the Senate rather than the customary supermajority of 60), many conservative opponents have posted pre-presidential Obama quotes that they say expose his hypocrisy on the issue. We'll examine the context of some of the more popular quotes being cited, and then weigh in with our 2 cents on whether Obama has flipped on reconciliation. The quote that seems to be making the widest rounds is one Obama made during the presidential campaign in an interview with the Concord Monitor on Oct. 9, 2007. It has been featured in segments by pundits Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck. Here's how Beck presented it on his show March 3, 2010: Beck: "In fact, you know, one of the big people that was really outspoken on reconciliation, said it was a really big mistake, especially using it for health care, you can't use the 50-plus-one option and still govern. That person was Barack Obama." Beck then played a clip in which Obama said the following: "You've got to break out of what I call the sort of fifty-plus-one pattern of presidential politics. Maybe you eke out a victory of fifty plus one. Then you can't govern. You know, you get Air Force One, there are a lot of nice perks, but you can't deliver on health care. We are not going to pass universal health care with a fifty-plus-one strategy." This turns out to be a splice of Obama's comments. Obama actually said a good bit between the first sentence and the rest of the quote. That added context doesn't make this one as cut-and-dried as it may appear. Obama was talking about the differences between himself and his then-opponent in the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton. "I think it is legitimate at this point for me to explain very clearly to the American people why I think I will be a better president than Hillary Clinton, and to draw contrasts," Obama said. "But that's very different from this sort of slash-and-burn politics that I think we've become accustomed to. Look, part of the reason I'm running is not just to be president, it's to get things done. And what I believe that means is we've got to break out of what I call, sort of, the 50-plus-one pattern of presidential politics. Which is, you have nasty primaries where everybody's disheartened. Then you divide the country 45 percent on one side, 45 percent on the other, 10 percent in the middle -- all of them apparently live in Florida and Ohio -- and battle it out. And maybe you eke out a victory of 50-plus-one, but you can't govern. I mean, you get Air Force One, there are a lot of nice perks to being president, but you can't deliver on health care. We're not going to pass universal health care with a 50-plus-one strategy. We're not going to have a serious bold energy policy of the sort I proposed yesterday unless you build a working majority. And part of the task of building that working majority is to get people to believe in our government, that it can work, that it's based on common sense, that it's not just sort of scoring political points. The interviewer then asked, "So is your answer to 'Why I will be a better president than Hillary Clinton,' is your answer that she'll be a 50-plus-one president and you won't?" "Yes," Obama said. A bit of historical context is in order. During the campaign, one of the knocks on Hillary Clinton -- even among Democrats -- was that she was a politically polarizing figure, and that would make it hard for her to get things done. It was an image the Obama campaign played up, presenting Obama as someone better able to forge consensus on difficult issues. Asked about the quote in a press briefing on March 4, 2010, press secretary Robert Gibbs said Obama was talking about "electoral strategy, not vote counting in the House and the Senate." The same scenario unfolds with a quote Obama made when he was speaking a couple of weeks earlier at the Change to Win Convention on Sept. 25, 2007. Again, Obama was contrasting himself with Democratic primary opponents, this time both Hillary Clinton and John Edwards, and Obama suggested that he was better able to "excite and inspire the American people" and build a larger consensus (even with Republicans) on issues like health care, immigration and energy. "The bottom line is that our health care plans are similar," Obama said. "The question once again is, who can get it done? Who can build a movement for change? This is an area where we're going to have to have a 60 percent majority in the Senate and the House in order to actually get a bill to my desk. We're gonna have to have a majority to get a bill to my desk. That is not just a fifty plus one majority." Obama was right: short of a reconciliation bill (which wasn't even being discussed at the time), health care legislation would require a 60 percent majority to pass the Senate. Again, Obama was touting his ability to build consensus and was not saying specifically whether he was for or against reconciliation. There's one more quote we'd like to address. This one was made in a press conference at the National Press Club on April 26, 2005. At the time, Democrats and Republicans were jousting over controversial judicial nominations made by President George W. Bush. Republicans were threatening a so-called "nuclear option" in which they could use a simple majority to get the judges affirmed. Obama was asked to weigh in on the issue. "What I worry about would be that you essentially have still two chambers, the House and the Senate, but you have simply majoritarian absolute power on either side," Obama said. "And that's just not what the Founders intended. You know, the Founders designed this system, as frustrating it is, to make sure that there's a broad consensus before the country moves forward. "You know, and if we want to start getting into the frustrations of minority rights, you know, we could talk about the fact that (South Dakota Sen.) John Thune, with a population of 600,000, has the same vote as I do, with a population of 11 million. I mean, there are all sorts of counter-majoritarian impulses in our system of government, and that's why this government has worked so well. And I think that's why we should try to back off the brink on this one." We should note that while the issues are similar, this was a debate over judicial nominations, not a reconciliation bill. We think it's important to note that none of the quotes from Obama directly addresses reconciliation. So that makes his position less definitive. But he makes it clear that he doesn't believe a slim majority is enough for a major piece of legislation. Specifically, he talked about health care not being a 50-plus-one issue. And the fact is, he's now advocating a 50-plus-one strategy on health care. Obama may argue that he has tried to include Republicans, but that they have simply been unwilling to play ball. He also has noted that the first iteration of the health care bill passed the Senate with a supermajority. But the fact is, the health care bill is not getting any Republican support, and Obama is pressing forward with a plan to push through a health care plan without them, and without a 60-vote majority. And we think the last quote, from 2005, is even more on point. Yes, Obama was speaking about the "nuclear option" as it related to judicial nominees, and not a reconciliation bill. But the principles are largely the same, especially as Obama noted that having simple "majoritarian" power in the Senate is "just not what the Founders intended." And we think that's enough to warrant a Full Flop.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-03-05T11:23:50	2010-03-04	['None']

pomt-09644	"President Obama's proposal calls for serious cuts in our own long-term carbon emissions," but China and India will still be allowed to increase their emissions.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/11/sarah-palin/copenhagen-treaty-allows-emerging-economies-more-c/	On Day 2 of the climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin decided to weigh in. Her op-ed, published in the Dec. 9, 2009, edition of the Washington Post , enumerated her concerns about a series of e-mails that skeptics say show disagreement over the seriousness of climate change and President Barack Obama's plan to pledge to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels. We wrote a separate story on the e-mails . Here, we'll look at the emissions questions. Palin argues that developing countries, like India and China, should at least be equal partners in the effort to slow global warming; it's unfair for the United States to shoulder the burden. "Unlike the proposals China and India offered prior to Copenhagen -- which actually allow them to increase their emissions -- President Obama's proposal calls for serious cuts in our own long-term carbon emissions," she wrote. Is that really what is happening? On Nov. 27, 2009, China announced it will lower emissions 40 to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. That may sound like a lot, but it's important to read the fine print here. China is talking about lowering carbon intensity. It's a measurement of how much energy it takes to produce a given amount of economic output. Climate experts say this means emissions from China will likely continue to grow along with its economy, but not as quickly as they would have otherwise. "Let's say you commit to an intensity target of -6% per year in carbon/GDP," wrote climate scientist Jonathan Koomey, professor at Yale University’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. "If your GDP grows at 10% per year, that means your carbon emissions will still grow 4% per year. So you're improving your carbon efficiency but absolute emissions are still increasing." Indeed, China's GDP is growing rapidly. In the third quarter of this year, it grew 8.9 percent, likely bringing the total annual growth to 8 percent. On Dec. 4, India offered a similar proposal. Officials there say the country is prepared to cut carbon intensity from 20 to 25 percent by 2020. It's a landmark announcement for India; traditionally, the country has argued that it cannot afford to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But like China, India's economy is growing rapidly, and with it its carbon emissions. Obama, on the other hand, is arguing for a cut large enough that the United States would see an absolute reduction in emissions, explained Koomey. (Obama's plan to trim emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 is part of a cap-and-trade change bill pending in the House of Representatives. A Senate bill would require a 20 percent cut.) Koomey, like many climate scientists, say overall cuts -- even from developing countries -- are necessary to really slow down climate change. While the United States' proposed cuts are more stringent than those proposed by China or India, they're less aggressive than the 25 to 50 percent emissions reduction scientists say countries must adopt to hold global average temperature increases to about 2 degrees Celsius. So, where does that leave Palin's claim? She's correct that China and India's plans will allow them to increase emissions, while the United States would have to cut back. For this claim, Palin gets a True.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2009-12-11T18:51:03	2009-12-09	['China', 'India', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-11715	"UPDATE: ‘Thousands’ voted for Doug Jones in Alabama town with population of 2,256"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/15/blog-posting/fake-news-spreads-about-doug-jones-and-votes-ficti/	It’s not true that Democrat Doug Jones got more than 5,000 votes in a town of less than 3,000 people in the Alabama Senate race. Unofficial results from the Dec. 12 special election show that overall, Jones beat his Republican contender Roy Moore by 1.5 percentage points, or about 20,000 more votes. Moore’s election loss in deep-red Alabama prompted false stories of voter fraud, including a post from a website called Ladies of Liberty, headlined "UPDATE: ‘Thousands’ voted for Doug Jones in Alabama town with population of 2,256." Ladies of Liberty describes itself as "a whimsical playland of conservative satire." It’s About page says that everything on the website is fiction. "It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined," said the website’s About page. Yet, we’ve seen website’s claim, though not always attributed to Ladies of Liberty, spread around on Facebook, with some users thinking it’s true. Here’s what the post claims: "The State Election Board of Voting Integrity said early on that ‘more than a third’ of Jones’ votes up to 11 a.m. looked suspicious — and with good reason. Many of them came from the small town of Bordalama, a rural community about 20 miles outside Birmingham. According to official tallies, Roy Moore received 953 votes in the small town. Doug Jones received 5,327. If the disparity in numbers isn’t enough to give you reason to smell something fishy, the population of the town should. There are 2,256 residents there and only 1,867 registered voters. In other words, more people voted for Doug Jones than even live in Bordalama." The quick facts: The name of the purported board is a variation of the "State Election Integrity Board" named in other fake news items, which a spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State previously told PolitiFact does no exist. Bordalama? Doesn’t exist either. No mention of it in the U.S. Census’ list of places in Alabama. As of 2 p.m. Dec. 15, Moore had not conceded the race, arguing that military and provisional ballots had not been counted yet and that the Alabama secretary of state still hadn’t certified the race. (In a CNN interview, the Alabama secretary of state expressed skepticism that election outcome would be different.) Ladies of Liberty says its posts are not fake news because they are "not real."

pomt-12008	Says "Carnival Cruise Lines will now offer free cruises" to hurricane victims.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/21/breakingnews247net/carnival-isnt-giving-hurricane-victims-free-cruise/	A bogus online post that said Miami-based Carnival Cruise Line was providing cruises and cash to people affected by an unnamed hurricane was from a website that generates fake news articles. "Carnival Cruise Lines will now offer FREE Cruises," read the headline on a Sept. 20, 2017, post on BreakingNews247.net. The post featured an image of the vessel the Carnival Sunshine. "Carnival is now offering Free Cruises to those effected (sic) by the Hurricane," the post read. "Just call Carnival or Message John Heald and say you want a stress free cruise with ( hash tag) Carnivalfamily and they will have you set up on a 4-7 night cruise of your choice. Just pay taxes and port fees. You also will receive $100 per cabin OBC." There’s no mention of which 2017 hurricane sparked the offer, whether it be Harvey, which drenched Texas, or Irma, which blew through Florida (the "OBC" stands for on-board credit). But Carnival isn’t offering such a deal, because the story is fake. It’s not readily apparent, but BreakingNews247.net is one of a gaggle of websites that allow users to create their own stories, labeling them as "prank" articles. Below the text and some advertisements is a button that reads "Create a Prank." Clicking on it allows a user to build their own fake story. PolitiFact has written about similar sites before. A range of websites allowing people to generate these kinds of stories have been reported by Facebook users for all manner of faux stories, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. While some people may look at the sites as a way to create jokes, they open up the potential for a scam known as "like farming." That’s when users create posts to gain as many likes as possible. The scammers then use highly ranked links to spread malware, gain readers’ personal information or otherwise make money. This particular post first appeared sometime before Sept. 15, according to the Miami Herald. It drew Carnival’s attention after being posted on Facebook. The post suggested readers contact Heald, who is a real British Carnival cruise director. Heald addressed the hoax on his own Facebook profile, in which he engages Carnival customers. "It is a fake page and we have reported the author accordingly," Heald wrote in a Sept. 15 Facebook post. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Heald said on the post that he was aware which Facebook group was spreading the fake story but didn’t elaborate. He also called the original poster a "soulless, heartless wanker" and further talked about the issue in a video posted to his profile later that day. A Carnival spokeswoman confirmed that the story was false, although the company is making monetary donations and helping ferry supplies to storm-affected areas. Carnival reported the original Facebook post, which appeared to have been removed. But the fake story was still available at BreakingNews247.net. As of this writing, a counter on the article said it had been shared more than 83,000 times. Don’t pack your bags just yet, because there’s no free pleasure cruise for hurricane victims.

pomt-04146	"Individuals with mental illnesses die an average of 25 years earlier than those without a mental illness."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/02/terry-russell/nami-ohio-leader-terry-russell-says-people-mental-/	One of the questions about the state budget proposal that Gov. John Kasich is expected to announce in February is whether the state will follow through with the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid coverage. The federal health care law would expand coverage to people with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level -- a provision which was made optional under the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that otherwise upheld the law. A bipartisan group of 85 health coverage organizations has written to the governor saying anything less than the full 138 percent would cause people to drop or skip coverage, endangering their health. Terry Russell, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness of Ohio, told Gongwer News Service that mentally ill Ohioans struggle to stay employed, and that local mental health agencies have marginal resources to help. "The sad statistic that haunts us every day is that individuals with mental illnesses die an average of 25 years earlier than those without a mental illness," he said. "Sixty percent of these premature deaths are the result of preventable and treatable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer and infections." PolitiFact Ohio checked into his claim about 25 years, and quickly found his statement was right on the money. A study published in 2006 by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors that was the focus of wide attention and concern in the mental health community looked at data from 16 states, including Ohio. It found that, on average, people with severe mental illness die 25 years earlier than the general population. The figure for Ohio was actually worse. People with severe mental illness die 32 years earlier. Calling it "a serious public health problem for the people served by our state mental health systems," the study said about 60 percent of premature deaths are due to conditions such as cardiovascular, pulmonary and infectious diseases. A number of factors contribute to risk, the study said, including modifiable factors like obesity, poor nutrition and alcohol and tobacco use. People with severe mental illness have poorer access to appropriate health care, and may be additionally vulnerable because of higher rates of homelessness, victimization, unemployment and poverty. Among its recommendations, the report called for better access to physical health care for people with serious mental illnesses to fight what it called an "epidemic of premature death and its contributing causes." Russell said that people with mental illnesses, on average, die 25 years earlier than those without a mental illness. He accurately cited findings of a major study on the issue. And in Ohio, the average is actually greater than 25 years. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates True.	None	Terry Russell	None	None	None	2013-01-02T06:00:00	2012-12-06	['None']

pomt-08281	"The budget submitted by Obama will add more to the debt than the outstanding debt of the previous 43 presidents combined."	true	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/07/eric-cantor/cantor-says-obama-budget-adds-more-debt-totaled-43/	Rep. Eric Cantor, R-7th, recently had his pants set afire by PolitiFact Virginia for the following statement on Comedy Central's Daily Show with Jon Stewart: "What you've seen (in Washington)," he said, "is a crowd that has taken advantage of a crisis back in late '08, early '09 and spent more money than this country has spent in the last 200 years combined, in the two years since." In a Richmond Times-Dispatch letter to the editor days after the PolitiFact rating, Cantor owned up to misspeaking and clarified his remarks. "What I meant to say was that the budget submitted by Obama will add more to the debt than the outstanding debt of the previous 43 presidents combined," he wrote. Well, is that true? We decided to take a look. First, it bears mentioning that Cantor’s revised statement does two things: it changes the focus from spending to accumulated public debt and does away with the two-year timeline. That changes things considerably. Asked for a source for the adjusted claim, a spokeswoman for Cantor pointed to statistics on publicly held debt from the Office of Management and Budget. According to those figures, the debt from the nation's birth through the end of 2008 -- George Washington through George W. Bush -- was $5.8 trillion. Now, had Cantor stuck with the original timeline of two years, we would need to limit our look at the increase in public federal debt between the end of 2008 and the end of 2010, which has been almost $3.5 trillion. That would make the claim false by a long shot. But by leaving the date open ended, we are left to determine for ourselves when and if the Obama administration’s budget would double the $5.8 trillion in debt accumulated through the end of fiscal 2008. Well, according to the OMB’s fiscal year 2011 budget projections, that would occur at the end of fiscal 2012, when the debt is expected to reach $11.6 trillion. In fiscal 2013, the last budget assembled during President Barack Obama's first term, debt is expected to reach $12.5 trillion. So, let’s take a look back. Cantor’s clarifications altered the original claim in two ways: focusing on publicly held debt instead of spending and not limiting the timeline to two years from Obama taking office. As a result, the claim adds up since the $5.8 trillion of debt accumulated in the U.S. to date is projected to double by 2012, or three years after Obama took office. Of course, whether this will happen is another matter entirely, as new budgets with new projections are adopted each year. Nonetheless, Cantor’s claim works based on the most recent numbers available and we therefore find it to be True.	None	Eric Cantor	None	None	None	2010-11-07T10:00:00	2010-10-30	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-02878	Says the Obama administration is handing out a pamphlet titled, "What To Do When The Veteran In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/12/mr-conservative/obama-admin-pamphlet-veteran-mass-shooting/	On Nov. 12, 2013, a blog called Mr. Conservative posted an alarming headline -- especially so given that it was just one day after the Veterans’ Day holiday. The story, which was forwarded to us by a reader, was headlined: "Obama Admin. Hands Out Pamphlet: 'What To Do When The Veteran In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting.'" The story went on to say that "veterans all across the country are upset" with the Education Department-issued pamphlet. Veterans, the site said, "are taking the stance that this makes it look like ‘all veterans are PTSD-crazed cauldrons of rage.’ " The Education Department’s defense, according to the post, was that there were already other pamphlets "like ‘What To Do When The Hispanic In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting,’ ‘What To Do When The Gay Student In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting,’ and ‘What To Do When The Special-Needs Child In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting.’" The article quoted an unnamed representative of the Veterans of Foreign Wars calling the pamphlets "incredibly frustrating" and saying they offered "several asinine recommendations." Was the story true? A lot of people seemed to think so. A number of blogs and other social media sites referenced or reposted it, and commenters on Mr. Conservative appeared to take it seriously. "I am ashamed that we are demeaning my fellow veterans in this manner. It seems to be part of Obama's grand scheme to diminish the military," said one. Said another, "What is it going to take to get this guy impeached??? If he doesn't get impeached, nobody will." Other commenters called Obama a "disgusting pig" or worse. But a few Mr. Conservative commenters wondered whether it was a spoof, and it turns out that they were on to something. It was actually a piece of satire -- one that Mr. Conservative posted without labeling it as such. Though Mr. Conservative didn’t cite the original source or link to it, some quick Googling enabled us to find the source easily -- a website called the Duffel Blog, which is a satire site aimed at members of the military. Here’s the disclaimer posted on the Duffel Blog’s "About" page: "We are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet. Everything on this website is satirical and the content of this site is a parody of a news organization. No composition should be regarded as truthful, and no reference of an individual, company, or military unit seeks to inflict malice or emotional harm. All characters, groups, and military units appearing in these works are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, or actual military units and companies is purely coincidental." Indeed, a cursory glance at the Duffel Blog front page on Nov. 12 suggests that a visitor probably would have been able to figure that out on their own. The headlines included, "Pentagon Proposes New Antarctica Command," "Applebee’s Declares Bankruptcy After Offering Free Alcohol For Veterans Day," and "Paperwork Error Sends Marines To Guard Streets Of Hell" (the last one was datelined, "The Pearly Gates of Heaven"). Just to be sure, we also asked the Education Department, and a spokesman said the pamphlet "is obviously not ours." An inquiry sent through Mr. Conservative’s website was not answered, and as of publication time, the site had neither taken down the story nor labeled it as satire. The Duffel Blog’s founder, former Marine Sgt. Paul Szoldra, did not respond to a request, but in 2012, he told Columbia Journalism Review, "I think you have to have a dark sense of humor just to survive. "It’s a way of coping with things beyond your control. Telling jokes or laughing about things you wouldn’t normally laugh at, especially in a combat situation, helps you cope with that kind of stress." Our ruling The website Mr. Conservative posted an article that claimed the Obama administration was handing out a pamphlet titled, "What To Do When The Veteran In Your Classroom Attempts A Mass Shooting." The story originated on a satire site and was in no way real -- a truth that could have been easily discovered through a few clicks on the Internet. We rate the claim Pants on Fire. Editor's note: A few hours after our initial publication, Mr. Conservative appended an update to its post: "Since the original posting of this article, we learned that the original news source that posted this story was not an actual news site but a satirical site. However, the fact that this story is believable, on its face, says something about our government and the society in which we now live."

At a campaign stop in Alexandria, Va., on Feb. 10, 2008, he brought up the negative opinions some people have of Clinton, who is well known to most voters from her time as first lady. "I think Sen. Clinton starts off with 47 percent of the country against her. That's a hard place to start if you want to win the election," he said. Pollsters regularly ask voters whether they rate candidates positively or negatively. Indeed, Clinton's negatives are consistently higher than Obama's, but different polls show her at different levels. We looked at the times the USA Today /Gallup Poll asked voters whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Hillary Clinton, going back to January 2007. Her negative percentage fluctuated between 40 and 52, but the average of 21 polls came out to 47. ABC News and the Washington Post have asked the question at least four times since January 2007. Her unfavorable ratings on that poll came in between 48 and 40, with an average of 44.5. CNN polled four times and found unfavorables between 39 and 44, with an average of 41.5. Obama's unfavorable ratings tend to be well under 40 percent. In several polls, his unfavorable ratings are in the 20s. Not every poll rates her unfavorables consistently as high as 47 percent, and poll numbers are always a little bit squishy. But, the USA Today /Gallup Poll has polled often on Clinton's unfavorables, and the average of 21 polls puts her negatives at 47 percent. We find that to be about as solid a poll figure as you can have, so we find Obama's statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-02-11T00:00:00	2008-02-10	['None']
pomt-08322	"Decorated Marine, two-tour Iraq war vet."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/29/josh-mandel/ohio-treasurer-candidate-josh-mandel-decorated-mar/	Any voter who has seen TV commercials for Republican Ohio treasurer candidate Josh Mandel know he has a military background. Part of Mandel’s campaign strategy is to weave his military service into his candidacy, and the military images prevalent in the commercials work toward that goal. In the commercials, Mandel is described as a "Decorated Marine." "Decorated Marine, two-tour Iraq war vet – Josh Mandel’s led a life of integrity and results," says the narrator for the commercial titled, "Tested and Trusted." Since Mandel has attached his candidacy to his military service, we decided to check what it means to be a decorated Marine, and if Mandel fits the bill. Mandel, a state representative from Lyndhurst, provided a list of nine medals earned during his service, including two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals he earned for his tours of Iraq. "When you earn decorations, you’re a decorated Marine," he said. "It’s pretty cut and dried." The U.S. Marines Corps agreed. Major Shawn Haney, a public affairs officer for the Marine Corps’ manpower and reserve affairs department, which maintains personnel files, confirmed Mandel had received medals that qualified him as a decorated Marine. "He has awards that he would wear," Haney said. "If he calls himself a decorated Marine, he’s not incorrect." A decorated Marine is "a Marine who receives an award during his or her service," Lt. Gregory Wolf, another media officer for the Marine Corps, told PolitiFact in an e-mail. Wolf said Mandel’s medals put him in that category. Mandel, 33, enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves in 2000, shortly before he graduated from Ohio State University. He served two tours in Iraq – one in 2004, the other in 2007-08 – for a combined 15 months. Mandel served as an intelligence specialist both times, working with other Marines to build relations with local Iraqis and figure out who among the civilians could pose a threat to troops trying to maintain peace. Mandel’s Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals are known as personal medals, meaning they were awarded for individual acts Mandel performed. The criteria for earning the achievement medal, according the Marine Corps, is for "meritorious service or achievement in a combat or noncombat situation based on sustained performance or specific achievement of a superlative nature, and shall be of such merit as to warrant more tangible recognition than is possible by a fitness report or evaluation sheet, but which does not warrant a Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal or higher." Haney, of the manpower and reserve affairs department, pointed out that Mandel’s achievement medals, while earned in Iraq, do not include the valor device, which denotes performance in combat. Other medals he earned, such as the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, are known as unit medals, given to soldiers who participated in specific operations defined by the military. Given the list of medals Mandel has earned and the Marine Corps’ inclusive definition of the term "decorated Marine," Mandel certainly qualifies. We find the statement True.

pomt-07907	Says his state budget will "provide an increase in state funding for the 2011-12 school year."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/feb/02/john-kitzhaber/john-kitzhaber-says-proposed-budget-represents-inc/	Before Gov. John Kitzhaber released his budget proposal for the next two-year cycle, he gave a few hints at how he’d budget some of the biggest pieces of state government. In an e-mail sent out before the Feb. 1, 2011, budget announcement, he says he’ll allocate some $5.56 billion for the state’s K-12 public school system. But that’s not all. He gets even more specific. Kitzhaber plans to make 52 percent of the total (about $2.89 billion) available in the first year of the cycle. This, he says, is the "equivalent to a $5.78 billion budget for school funding. The effect is to provide an increase in state funding for the 2011-12 school year." That, naturally, piqued our curiosity given that most of what you hear down in Salem is worrying comments about how education will have to take a cut going forward. And yet, here’s Kitzhaber talking about increased spending. Could he really be offering the schools more money next year? We decided to find out. To start off, it’s helpful to have a clear understanding of where funding is currently. The thing is, the budget for public education has fluctuated several times over the past couple of years. The state revenue forecast is consistently down, which has led to reductions in the budget. Meanwhile, there’s been movement on the federal level to kick funds to states, which have helped balance, in part, some of those earlier cuts. But not all of them. To get the most recent number, we called Oregon's Legislative Fiscal Office. According to the office’s most recent calculations, K-12 education is operating on a budget of $5.756 billion. Thatincludes the promise of $35.5 million from a state education stability fund, which may or may not come through. But, for the purpose of this article, we’ll keep it in the total. Of that $5.75 billion, $342 million has come from the federal government in various forms and $5.41 billion has come from the state. To parse it even more (who doesn’t love lots of numbers?), $2.94 billion went to schools during the 2009-10 school year, while the remaining $2.82 billion went to schools for the current year. So, let’s compare these numbers to what Kitzhaber is proposing. According to the e-mail statement, Kitzhaber is suggesting a K-12 budget of $5.56 billion for the next two-year period. But for next year in particular, he is suggesting $2.89 billion go to schools. That’s a clear increase in funding (not just state funding, but overall funding) this year over next, by about $70 million. Still, it’s important to note here, that funding, overall, will take a hit. Sure, the state is throwing in more cash for the upcoming biennium than it did the current -- about an extra $150 million. And yes, the school system will have more cash to work with next year than it did this year. But overall the biennium’s budget is down, $5.756 billion to $5.56 billion. That’s because the state’s increase in funding still doesn't offset lost federal dollars. What’s more, under Kitzhaber’s proposal, that reduction will be felt strongest come the 2012-13 school year. Whereas there will be a $70 million more to work with next year, as compared to the current school year, there will be a $150 million decrease the following year, if you use the current year as the baseline. By front-loading 2012, you necessarily leave 2013 with a smaller slice of the funds. Kitzhaber explains his logic in the e-mail: "Front-loading the funding also provides a year to find cost savings through consolidation and other efficiencies to maintain this level of classroom support during the 2012-13 school year." Whether those cost savings will be realized, nobody can say, so we’ll stick the initial statement, which is that this proposed budget represents an increase in state funding for the upcoming 2011-12 school year. Kitzhaber is right, it does. That said, it’s important to recognize that even with the increase in state funds, the school system will have to make do with less sooner or later. Kitzhaber seems to have chosen later. Since we think that bit of context is important, we rate this claim Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-03009	The White House had a live video feed of the Benghazi attacks as they occurred.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/oct/15/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-suggesting-obamas-impeachment-airs-ridicu/	David Dewhurst told a group that President Barack Obama ought to be impeached, saying later that his reasons include Obama standing by while the White House fielded live video of the fatal Benghazi attacks, the Texas Observer reported. Dewhurst, the third-term lieutenant governor faced with three challengers for the 2014 Republican nomination, suggested Obama’s impeachment while speaking Oct. 14, 2013, to the Northeast Tarrant County Tea Party, which also heard from the other GOP candidates. "This election is about protecting you and your freedoms, which are given to you by God, but which are being trampled on by Barack Obama right now. I don’t know about you, but Barack Obama ought to be impeached," Dewhurst said, according to the Observer. "Not only for trampling on our liberties, but what he did in Benghazi is just a crime." Afterward, Dewhurst elaborated on his criticism of the administration’s handling of the September 2012 attack in Benghazi, which killed Americans including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stephens. "I’m very concerned about Benghazi, in which all of the national news reporting indicated that live video was streaming into the White House," Dewhurst told Observer reporter Christopher Hooks. "That means that there was an overhead platform, probably a drone in the area. At least that’s what it tells me," he said. "And for not mobilizing some response to protect the ambassador and those three Americans is just outrageous to me. Just outrageous." We asked Dewhurst for the basis of his reference to a live video feed of the attacks reaching the White House and didn’t hear back. It didn’t take us long to find that the "Benghazi live stream" claim has already been debunked by the Snopes.com "urban legends" website. That Snopes post, last updated Nov. 1, 2012, traces the claim to an Oct. 24, 2012, Forbes magazine op-ed article, which opened: "Just one hour after the seven-hour-long terrorist attacks upon the U.S. consulate in Benghazi began, our commander-in-chief, vice president, secretary of defense and their national security team gathered together in the Oval Office listening to phone calls from American defenders desperately under siege and watching real-time video of developments from a drone circling over the site. Yet they sent no military aid that might have intervened in time to save lives." The Forbes article did not provide a source for writer Larry Bell’s reference to real-time video. In its article, Snopes noted that a CBS News story also posted Oct. 24, 2012, stated that the FBI and State Department had reviewed video from security cameras that captured the attack on the consulate. The CBS News report continued: "The audio feed of the attack was being monitored in real time in Washington by diplomatic security official Charlene Lamb. CBS News has learned that video of the assault was recovered 20 days later from the more than 10 security cameras at the compound. The government security camera footage of the attack was in the possession of local Libyans until the week of Oct. 1," CBS News said. Earlier, on Oct. 12, 2012, the Daily Beast quoted two unidentified U.S. intelligence officials as saying that video taken the night of the attacks, showing a military-style assault took place, had been recovered the week before from the site of the attacks. "The Obama administration has been studying the videos, taken from closed-circuit cameras throughout the Benghazi consulate’s four-building compound, for clues about who was responsible for the attack and how it played out," the story said. The story did not mention any live stream into the White House, though it said that in "addition to the footage from the consulate cameras, the U.S. government is also poring over video taken from an overhead U.S. surveillance drone that arrived for the final hour of the night battle at the consulate compound and nearby annex." Our search for news stories on such a live stream, using the Nexis database, led us to an Oct. 29, 2012, Slate news story noting a claim by Charles Woods, whose son, Tyrone, died in the attacks, that the White House watched the attacks on a live stream over seven hours. The story also notes the CBS News report of a drone flying over the fatal scene hours after the attacks began. Slate quoted a White House spokesman, Tommy Vietor, as saying: "No one watched video of the attack at the White House as it happened." Separately, as documented by Erik Wemple, who writes a "reported opinion blog" on the news media for The Washington Post, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity repeatedly incorrectly stated that the State Department watched live video as the attacks occurred. In a Jan. 23, 2013, news story, Wemple said that earlier that day, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was asked before a House committee about live video feeds to the agency and replied: "There was no monitor, there was no real time." Earlier, on Oct. 26, 2012, Fox News said it had learned that "there were two military surveillance drones redirected to Benghazi shortly after the attack on the consulate began. They were already in the vicinity. The second surveillance craft was sent to relieve the first drone, perhaps due to fuel issues. Both were capable of sending real-time visuals back to U.S. officials in Washington, D.C. Any U.S. official or agency with the proper clearance, including the White House Situation Room, State Department, CIA, Pentagon and others, could call up that video in real time on their computers." The story did not say any video was watched inside the agencies. Our ruling Dewhurst said live video of the Benghazi attacks reached the White House as the attacks occurred. That’s not confirmed by news reports we found, while the White House said in October 2012 that no one there watched a live video feed. Given that this claim has been debunked for about a year, we see it as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-02535	Says Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is responsible for the roughly $7,800 "I pay in property taxes per year."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/07/david-clarke-jr/sheriff-david-clarke-blames-milwaukee-mayor-tom-ba/	When some politicians speak, it’s like a whisper in the wind. For Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., it’s often more like heavy-metal thunder. In a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article Jan. 31, 2014, Clarke revealed plans to explore a possible run for mayor of Milwaukee in 2016. The sheriff called three-term Mayor Tom Barrett politically vulnerable and lacking vision. Then he lowered the boom. "I have 7,800 reasons to be critical of Mayor Barrett," Clarke contended. "That's about what I pay in property taxes per year." As every Wisconsin property taxpayer knows, when property tax bills show up each December, they show dollar-signs from a handful of governmental bodies. So, how is it that Barrett is responsible for the entire amount of Clarke’s property tax bill? That would be some heavy-metal power. Property tax breakdown We plugged Clarke’s home address, on Milwaukee’s far northwest side, into the city property tax database to see his latest property tax bill, for 2013. (Clarke’s spokeswoman confirmed the sheriff was referring to the total amount of his bill. She said he didn't have any other evidence for us to consider.) The record shows Clarke paid $7,728 in property taxes, a bit less than the $7,800 he said in the interview. Before about $200 in credits, Clarke's bill broke down this way: Governmental body Amount of property tax levied City of Milwaukee $2,745 Milwaukee Public Schools $2,728 Milwaukee County $1,387 Milwaukee Area Technical College $575 Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District $460 State of Wisconsin $46 Bottom line: The city’s levy accounts for only about one-third of Clarke’s property tax bill. Even at that, responsibility for the city’s portion can’t be put entirely on Barrett. In Wisconsin, the governing body of each town, village, city, county and school district, as well as the state, levies the total amount of property tax to be raised. The amount is based on the size of each entity’s budget and how much in property taxes, in addition to other revenue, will be needed to fund the budget. (The total levy for Milwaukee County, by the way, is $279.3 million. Nearly one-fourth, $66.7 million, is for the Sheriff’s Office.) As mayor, Barrett plays a pivotal role in how much Milwaukee collects in property taxes. He proposes the city budget and can veto changes made by the Common Council, although ultimately aldermen could override his vetoes. The Milwaukee mayor also appoints seven of the 11 commissioners for the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District. But MMSD sets its own property tax levy. Meanwhile, Milwaukee Area Technical College District board members, who are appointed by county officials, set MATC’s levy. And levies for Milwaukee County, Milwaukee Public Schools and the state are set by elected representatives of those bodies. Which is to say, Barrett has little or nothing to do with the lion’s share of Clarke’s property tax bill. Our rating Clarke said Barrett is responsible for the roughly $7,800 "I pay in property taxes per year." Barrett has significant influence over how much Clarke pays in property taxes to the city, but that amounts to only about one-third of Clarke’s tax bill. We rate Clarke’s claim False.

pomt-07906	Says that over the last decade, the state's population grew three times faster than the Texas state tax system.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/02/mike-villarreal/mike-villarreal-says-texas-population-grew-three-t/	State Rep. Mike Villarreal maintains the state tax system, untended by ruling Republicans, needs a full review. In a Jan. 7 op-ed column in the San Antonio Express-News, the San Antonio Democrat wrote that "Republicans have ignored the fact that over the last decade our population has been growing three times faster than our state tax system." We’re not gauging what Republicans notice, but wondered if Villarreal correctly compared population growth and state taxes. In an interview, Villarreal told us he drew his population counts from the state demographer, Lloyd Potter, and fiscal information from annual cash reports by the state comptroller’s office, adjusting figures for inflation to reflect 2009 dollars. Villarreal said he considered all state taxes including sales and franchise taxes and taxes on motor fuels, vehicle sales, tobacco and alcohol products, insurance and oil and natural gas production. He said he prepared a spreadsheet in consultation with experts including Dale Craymer, president of the business-oriented Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, and Eva De Luna Castro, senior budget analyst for the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities, which has made a case for Texas to create a state personal income tax. According to Villarreal, the state’s population increased 19 percent from 1999 to 2009, from 20.9 million to 24.8 million. In 2000, according to Villarreal, inflation-adjusted state taxes generated $35.8 billion. In 2009, the comparable total was $37.8 billion, up 6 percent. So, Villarreal said, population increased three times faster than annual state tax revenue. What we noticed: Villarreal’s spreadsheet also showed that money from non-tax revenue such as state fees went up 13 percent, trailing population growth, while federal aid surged 47 percent, more than double the rate of population growth. State income from all sources, including federal aid, increased 26 percent. Next, Villarreal shared a revised spreadsheet indicating that revenue from all sources increased 19 percent--not 26 percent. In an e-mail, Villarreal said he fixed an error "that had me over-counting non-tax revenue and as a result over-counting" total revenue from all sources. He said he’d inadvertently double-counted the federal aid, but stressed the error did not bear on his comparison of state taxes to population growth. Even in the revised version, we noted, all revenue to state government increased at about the same pace as population growth. Villarreal agreed, but said that the bulk of money from all sources--which broke down in 2009 to 45 percent from state taxes, 18.5 percent from state non-tax revenue and 37 percent from federal funds--consists of dollars dedicated to specific purposes. His point: Lawmakers can’t easily tap such sources, which include public college tuition, to support general needs such as public education and health care. We sought outside perspective. Craymer of TTARA, which represents businesses and trade associations, said Villarreal’s work leads to a flawed conclusion--that the state’s main revenue source, the sales tax, is undependable. "If there is a systemic problem with the tax system," Craymer said, "it’s probably that it reflects the economy," which was rocked by two recessions in the decade. "So it’s not surprising to me that sales taxes would not have kept pace with population." Craymer said too that any analysis varies due to the time period it covers. For instance, he said, sales tax revenues steadily rose from 2005 through 2007. Lobbyist James LeBas, formerly the state’s chief revenue estimator, offered a per-person breakdown of Texas taxes over the decade, adjusted for inflation, which also took into account property taxes levied by local governmental units. LeBas, who said his figures came from the comptroller’s office, said in an e-mail that from 2000 to 2010, taxes per person grew slightly faster than inflation--by 37 percent compared to the 27 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index. In 2000, he said, Texas taxes per person, adjusted for inflation, amounted to $2,180; the 2010 figure was $2,195. LeBas, summing up, said the tax system "has produced a stable, if unremarkable, amount of revenue per capita, even adjusted for inflation." We asked De Luna of the CPPP for her perspective on per-capita state plus local taxes. She suggested that combining state taxes and locally levied property taxes obscures the fact state taxes have dropped. Drawing on figures published by the comptroller in January 2011, she said 3.6 percent of personal income in Texas went to state taxes in 2010--down from the 4.4-percent level of 2001. Next, we asked LeBas to focus on state taxes alone. He reported that inflation-adjusted per-capita state taxes were $1,210 in 2000 but $1,145 in 2009. The 5-percent decrease reflected slower growth in state taxes than population. DeLuna floated another way to pit changes in taxes and population. She said average annual rates of change can be more meaningful than comparing a recent year to an earlier year. The year-by-year average "helps put numbers in a better context for the average person," she said. From 1999 to 2009, she said, the state’s average annual population growth, 2 percent, compared to inflation-adjusted growth in state revenue of .8 percent and inflation-adjusted growth in all funds of 1.7 percent. Finally, we asked DeLuna the question we’d asked Villarreal: If revenue to the state from all sources pretty much kept pace with population growth, should there be a beef? DeLuna replied that revenue from all sources soared mainly because of federal aid, which the comptroller expects to drop in 2012-13. Also, she said, lawmakers perpetually added to the state’s funding burdens in 2006 by cutting local school property tax rates and committing the state to cover the difference going forward. Phew. What a seminar. Our take: Villarreal’s analysis disregards that state revenue from all sources, in part due to increased federal aid, about matched population growth from 2000 through 2009. He also disregards property taxes, which are affected by legislative decisions. That said, his statement accurately compares population to state taxes, which are, as he said, the taxes lawmakers directly set. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-09914	The Free Flow of Information Act of 2009 "would guarantee Barack Obama will never be held accountable for producing forged birth documents."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/01/chain-email/e-mail-claims-free-flow-information-act-would-prot/	Who knows where some political ideas originate. Any anonymous person can post a statement on the Internet. It can be passed around, repeated, added to and commented on in blog after blog. It can be circulated in chain e-mails. And pretty soon it gathers such steam, its very reach seems to add credibility. Here, we deal with just such an idea. It's the claim that the Free Flow of Information Act of 2009 passed by the House in March is actually a "stealth" law aimed at protecting President Barack Obama from having to produce his "actual" birth certificate. That's why some conservative bloggers derisively call it the "Obama Birth Certificate Protection Act." Readers sent us an e-mail that claimed the bill "would guarantee Barack Obama will never be held accountable for producing forged birth documents." Most versions call for readers to contact their local legislator to oppose the bill, which has been introduced in the Senate. As for the claim that Obama produced "forged" birth documents, that's a matter we have been following for quite some time, and we direct your attention here . In this item, we wanted to set the record straight about the Free Flow of Information Act. Passed by the House in March, the bill is designed to protect journalists from having to reveal confidential sources in federal court. Here's what the bill says: "A federal entity may not compel a covered person to provide testimony or produce any document related to information obtained or created by such covered person as part of engaging in journalism, unless a court determines by a preponderance of the evidence." You can read the bill in its entirety here . Many bloggers insist it would also protect federal employees of the executive branch from being compelled to release documents. But the key words are "covered person." And this is how it's defined later in the bill: "The term 'covered person' means a person who regularly gathers, prepares, collects, photographs, records, writes, edits, reports, or publishes news or information that concerns local, national, or international events or other matters of public interest for dissemination to the public for a substantial portion of the person's livelihood or for substantial financial gain and includes a supervisor, employer, parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of such covered person." In other words, "a covered person is simply a journalist," said Sophia Cope, legislative counsel for the Newspaper Association of America, which has lobbied hard for the bill. "The White House would not fall under that." This bill has been kicking around Congress for four years, long before Obama announced his candidacy for president. The idea that it is a covert attempt to block Obama from producing his birth certificate is absurd. We also note that the bill has enjoyed widespread bipartisan support. It was so noncontroversial it passed the House on March 31 with a voice vote rather than a roll call. Last Congress, it passed by a vote of 398-21. A Senate version of the bill is under consideration. Cope isn't quite sure how the intent of the law has been so grossly distorted. "The bill's intent is to protect reporters and their confidential sources from being subpoenaed to testify, or from having to disclose the identity of those sources," Cope said. "I don't see how it would relate to Obama's birth certificate." One could argue that this law has simply been misread by some well-intentioned government watchdogs. But this is just the latest conspiracy theory from the fringe of a conservative group convinced that Obama hasn't provided sufficient documentation to prove he was born in the United States, and therefore cannot serve as president. Even among these folks, the claim about the Free Flow of Information Act is more than a stretch. We give it a Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2009-07-01T19:41:18	2009-05-24	['None']
pomt-00129	The migration of Hondurans toward the United States "was funded by Democrat activists."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/26/blog-posting/bloggers-trump-gaetz-offer-no-evidence-caravan-was/	The 7,000 people trying to make their way to the United States-Mexican border, a trek that originated with a smaller group from Honduras, continues to be the source of misinformation. A key theme being promoted by conservative pundits and websites is that is is being financed by the Democratic Party as an attempt to influence the November elections and undermine President Donald Trump. That concept is summed up by an Oct. 21, 2018 post on the Facebook site Conservative World Daily that has received more than 34,000 shares. It reads, "Over 7000 Hondurans are now headed to our border, with camera crews and support vehicles, two weeks before the midterm elections. If you don't know that this was funded by Democrat activists, then you're not paying attention." Here at PolitiFact, we do pay attention. So far, we haven't seen any hard facts to back up the assertion that the migration "was funded by Democrat activists." We're not alone.This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Some of the argument in favor of the migrant march being funded by Democrats seems to be completely made up, while some is based on video footage that falls short of qualifying as evidence. The video was posted in a tweet from Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., on Oct. 17. 2018. It shows a man handing out individual slips of currency-sized paper to women and girls. Gaetz characterized it as "Footage in Honduras giving cash 2 women & children 2 join the caravan & srom the US border @ election time. Soros? US-back NGOs? Time to investigate the source!" Trump later retweeted the video with the message, "Can you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?" The footage is from Chiquimula, Guatemala, not Honduras, and shot outside a store that sells auto parts. On his Twitter feed, Guatemalan journalist Luis Assardo reported, "I managed to talk to locals and they told me that among merchants in the sector they collected money and gave it to people from #CaravanaDeMigrantes." "Some have asked me about the money and it is important to say that we do not know its denomination," Assardo said. "But in Guatemala the tickets with the highest denomination are Q200 ($ 25 approx) and Q100 ($ 12.5). That is, the most they could have received (if that were the case) are between $ 12 and $ 25." Gaetz later acknowledged on his Twitter feed that he got the location wrong. He has offered no evidence that the handout was being coordinated by a non-government organization (NGO) or Soros, a reference to George Soros, the billionaire hedge fund manager and philanthropist widely reviled in conservative circles for supporting Democrats and promoting progressive causes. (For example, during the Supreme Court confirmation hearing for Brett Kavanaugh, Trump accused Soros, without evidence, of paying protesters to oppose the nomination.) No NGO -- Democratic or not -- has acknowledged financing creation of the caravan, and bloggers have not specifically named any group. Soros' philanthropic Open Society Foundations released a statement Oct. 18 saying, "Neither Mr. Soros nor Open Society are funding this effort." And bloggers have offered no evidence to the contrary. Thus, the claim that the Honduran exodus "was funded by Democrat activists" is all talk and no walk. We rate it False.

pomt-11711	Says Marco Rubio tweeted a verse from the New Testament to shame "his own constituents for flocking to Trump rally."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/18/verified-politics/no-proof-rubios-religious-tweet-was-related-trump-/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s tweet about a New Testament verse was an attack on Floridians who support President Donald Trump, according to an article on Facebook that lacked evidence. "Marco Rubio just publicly shamed his own constituents for flocking to Trump rally," stated a Dec. 9 headline on verifiedpolitics.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that this article jumped to a conclusion about what prompted Rubio’s tweet. Trump held a rally in Pensacola the night of Dec. 8, when he called on Alabama residents to vote for Republican Roy Moore. A few days later, Moore lost the U.S. Senate election to Democrat Doug Jones. The Washington Post reported in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper. Verifiedpolitics.com wrote that the crowd in Pensacola, composed largely of Floridians, cheered for Trump. "It was this display that moved the normally mild mannered Senator from Miami to lash out on Twitter and throw Republicans from his own state under the bus," the website stated. The article then cited Rubio’s tweet on the morning of Dec. 9: "At the sight of the crowds his heart was moved with pity 4 them b/c they were troubled & abandoned like sheep without a shepherd.Matthew 9:36." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The tweet drew hundreds of replies. While some on Twitter replied with a photo of Trump’s Pensacola rally, a correspondent for the Eternal World Television Network replied that the verse was part of the Roman Catholic daily Mass. "Once again, @marcorubio quotes the daily Gospel for Mass, and Twitter can’t handle it," Jason Calvi tweeted. In his autobiography An American Son, Rubio wrote that he attends services at Christ Fellowship, his wife’s evangelical church, on most Saturday nights and then mass at St. Louis Catholic Church on Sundays. We sent emails to Rubio’s spokeswoman to ask if his tweet related to Trump’s speech or Moore and did not get a reply. Rubio had no tweets Dec. 8 or 9 that mentioned Trump or Moore. He tweeted about tax reform, Army vs. Navy football and Venezuela. But Rubio had made previous statements critical of Moore. In November, Rubio said on Fox & Friends that Moore’s accusers are "very credible" and that the charges are "very serious" and could be problematic for Moore if elected. However, the implication of the verifiedpolitics.com article is that Rubio used his tweet to shame his own Florida constituents for attending the Trump rally. Rubio’s criticism of Moore had been directed at Moore himself -- not Floridians who support Trump. And while Rubio at times has appeared critical of Trump or his administration, on other issues, such as Cuba policy, the two politicians have partnered together. Rubio regularly tweets verses For several months, Rubio has regularly tweeted lines from the Bible, drawing attention from the media, religious experts and others In an October interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Rubio defended his practice of tweeting out verses most mornings. "I'll continue to do it," he told the network. "If they don't like it, they don't have to follow me." We interviewed two experts about the religious meaning of the verse that Rubio quoted: Candida Moss, a theology professor at the University of Birmingham, and Christopher R. Matthews, Research Professor of New Testament at Boston College. "The surface meaning of the verse is rather clear: sheep do not organize themselves (they're not the brightest), so in the absence of a shepherd/leader there is the potential for confusion and chaos," Matthews said. The verse comes within the context of several stories about Jesus healing the sick, teaching people in the synagogues and proclaiming the good news, Moss said. "In its immediate context this verse is quite clearly about the people needing spiritual leadership and practical assistance (in the form of what we would call health care)," she said. "Taken out of context, however, that meaning is expanded so that it becomes a broader statement about people lacking moral and spiritual guidance, and how this state of affairs is distressing to God. Founded in 2017, Verified Politics describes itself as a political news website that it is for readers who are tired of fake news. We emailed the website and asked if they had any evidence that Rubio tweeted a New Testament verse to shame his own constituents for flocking to a Trump rally, and we did not get a response. Rubio, a regular at Sunday mass, provided no explanation for his tweet so it’s merely speculation to conclude that his point was commentary on Trump’s Pensacola rally the previous night. The verse from Matthew that Rubio tweeted was part of the daily Mass for that Sunday. We rate this claim False.

pomt-11340	This year’s state budget "continues to direct millions in taxpayer dollars in advertising to the failing Start-Up NY program"	false	/new-york/statements/2018/apr/09/brian-kolb/did-year-state-budget-start-up-ny/	Republican Assembly Leader Brian Kolb says the newly passed New York state budget earmarks millions of dollars for an economic development program that he says is not creating jobs. Start-Up NY will continue to receive money for advertising, Kolb said. "The 2018-2019 state budget ... continues to direct millions in taxpayer dollars in advertising to the failing Start-Up NY program," Kolb said in a statement. Many Republicans in the New York State Legislature oppose the program, which carved out tax-free zones around public college or university campuses for new businesses. Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan, a Republican, said earlier this year that his conference wants to "get rid of" the program. Lawmakers were especially critical of Start-Up NY after the state spent $53 million in advertising to promote it between 2013 and 2015. The program created 408 net new jobs by the end of 2015 after launching in January 2014. Is Kolb right that this year’s budget also includes money to advertise Start-Up NY? Budget language The part of the budget Kolb referred to funds more than advertising for Start-Up NY. The bill sets aside $44.5 million to support the state’s economic development initiatives, including Start-Up NY, primarily through marketing and promotion. It also pays for the state's effort to promote New York state as a tourism destination and is also available to bolster some of the state’s other economic development programs. The Global NY program, for example, connects businesses in New York state to international companies. Empire State Development, the state’s economic development agency, has not spent money to advertise Start-Up NY for three years and has no plans to do so, said Jason Conwall, an agency spokesman. The funding line is a holdover from the 2014 budget, the first to earmark advertising money for the program. The same line has been included, almost verbatim, in each budget since. That’s not uncommon in the state budget. The document spans thousands of pages and includes 10 bills that allocate more than $160 billion. It’s routine for staff who write the bills to copy and paste language from the year before. Kolb’s view During budget votes, bills are delivered in the middle of the night with emergency "messages of necessity" from the governor. Members of the Assembly and Senate have to vote on the bills that are in front of them, said Michael Fraser, who’s Kolb’s director of communications. Kolb’s claim about Start-Up NY came immediately after the final budget passed, near 4 a.m., Fraser said. "We don’t have the luxury of getting promises from agencies about what they may or may not do," Fraser said. "Frankly, what’s actually in the law far outweighs what’s said after the fact. "What we do know is that the bill clearly mentions Start-Up NY by name," he said. "It presents a very specific percentage of funds that would be used outside New York." That is specifically written into the bill, Fraser said. He made a comparison to school district funding. Most district are not listed by name. "School aid is presented as a lump-sum of money that we know will flow to every school district in the state, but that’s not explicitly spelled out," he said. Our ruling Kolb said the state budget directs millions of dollars to advertise the Start-Up NY program. It’s true that a line in the budget allows the state to use money to advertise Start-Up NY. But state officials use the same pot of money to promote tourism and other programs in the state. While the bill may include language about where advertising money can be spent, if the agency chooses to advertise the program, nothing in the budget bill requires the Cuomo administration to spend money on Start-Up NY advertising. The agency that would create and run ads for Start-Up NY says it has no plans to use the money for that purpose. Kolb’s statement that the budget directs millions of dollars to be spent advertising the program is not accurate. We rate it False.

pomt-10603	Barack Obama's church gave a lifetime achievement award to Louis Farrakhan.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/23/chain-email/related-magazine-not-church-gave-award/	An attack e-mail says the church Barack Obama attends, Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, gave a lifetime award to Louis Farrakhan. Did it? It may be a small distinction, but the award Farrakhan received came from a magazine connected to the church, not the church itself. Trumpet Newsmagazine was founded by the church's senior pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., as a church newsletter. Now it's a nationally distributed lifestyle magazine aimed at socially conscious African-Americans. The magazine gave Farrakhan its Lifetime Achievement "Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr. Trumpeter" Award for those who work to "save the lives of Africans on the continent and in the Diaspora." The magazine interviewed Farrakhan and quoted Wright in the introduction. Here is the entirety of Wright's remarks on Farrakhan: "When Minister Farrakhan speaks, Black America listens," Wright said. "Everybody may not agree with him, but they listen…His depth on analysis when it comes to the racial ills of this nation is astounding and eye opening. He brings a perspective that is helpful and honest. "Minister Farrakhan will be remembered as one of the 20th and 21st century giants of the African- American religious experience," Wright said. "His integrity and honesty have secured him a place in history as one of the nation's most powerful critics. His love for Africa and African-American people has made him an unforgettable force, a catalyst for change and a religious leader who is sincere about his faith and his purpose." It's worth noting that Wright appears to be applauding Farrakhan for his message of black empowerment, a philosophy Wright espouses as well. But the two men have different religions: Farrakhan is a Muslim and Wright is a Christian. Obama said he did not agree with the award; for more on that, see a related statement here . The magazine award became a campaign issue when Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen wrote about the award. To most Americans, Cohen wrote, Farrakhan is racist with a history of making anti-Semitic remarks. Though the church didn't give the award, the magazine was founded by the church's senior pastor and is closely related. For that reason, we find the statement Mostly True.

pomt-10703	"I saved the taxpayers $2-billion on a bogus Air Force Boeing tanker deal where people went to jail."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/29/john-mccain/he-uncovered-a-wasteful-mess/	At the CNN/YouTube debate on Nov. 28, 2007, the Republican candidates were asked how they would tackle the national debt and control spending. CNN's Anderson Cooper called on Sen. John McCain, who said: "I have the record of fighting against wasteful spending. I have a clear record of winning. I saved the taxpayers $2-billion on a bogus Air Force Boeing tanker deal where people went to jail." Indeed, McCain was front and center in a well-publicized effort that killed an Air Force plan to lease 100 Boeing 767s and use them for refueling tankers. The plan eventually led to one of the more notable Washington scandals in years, resulting in prison terms for Mike Sears, a top Boeing official, and Darleen Druyun, the Air Force's No. 2 weapons buyer. Druyun admitted to giving Boeing preferential treatment and negotiating a $250,000-a-year job with the company while overseeing the deal. It is well-documented in media and government reports that McCain was quick to identify the $23.5-billion deal as a bad one for taxpayers. He found it in December 2001, tucked into a little-noticed amendment to the 2002 defense budget. Earlier that year, shortly after the 9/11 attacks, Boeing had convinced the Air Force that it could start replacing its aging fleet of refueling tankers more quickly by leasing the aircraft rather than purchasing them. Air Force officials acknowledged that leasing would be more expensive, but they said the estimated extra cost — $150-million — was worth it. There were two problems. One, the Air Force previously expressed no great urgency to replace its tanker fleet. Two, government investigations prompted by McCain's public outrage found that the Air Force vastly underestimated the extra cost of leasing. In 2003, the Congressional Budget Office put the extra cost at $1.3-billion to $2-billion, which is where McCain gets his number. Other senators and watchdog groups took up the fight against the deal, but only after McCain and his staff revealed the makings of a scandal. A 2005 report by the Defense Department's Inspector General found that the Air Force circumvented normal procedures, conducted no analysis of the alternatives to leasing and collected no pricing data to justify the deal. "If it wasn't for Sen. McCain, the scrutiny that occurred about this deal would never have happened," said Keith Ashdown of the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. "It was probably the best example of oversight in the 108th Congress." Boeing paid a record $615-million to settle the civil and criminal allegations that arose in the scandal. Since the tanker deal never went through, it's hard to say McCain saved taxpayers $2-billion. It might be more accurate to say he kept the government from entering into a deal that would have caused it to overspend by as much as $2-billion. Despite that quibble, we find his statement True.

pomt-15352	"Jasper County in Texas raised property taxes by 7 percent in order to pay for one death penalty case."	true	/texas/statements/2015/jul/09/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-death-penalty-trial-fueled-texas-tax/	More than a decade ago, three men were prosecuted by an East Texas county for the racist 1998 dragging death of James Byrd Jr. One drew a life sentence, two were sentenced to death. Now comes Ron Paul of Texas, the former Republican U.S. House member and presidential candidate, hammering the fiscal impact of that case. Paul, whose senator-son, Rand, seeks the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, wrote in a June 2015 opinion column: "It is hard to find a more wasteful and inefficient government program than the death penalty." By way of example, he offered: "Jasper County in Texas raised property taxes by 7 percent in order to pay for one death penalty case!" A reader asked us to check on whether such a case had that tax impact. News stories mention tax hikes We didn’t hear back from Paul about how he reached his conclusion. But searches starting from the Nexis news database led us to a couple news stories suggesting the county bore the costs of three Byrd-related prosecutions and legal appeals by raising its property tax rate. In March 1999, correspondent John Burnett of National Public Radio reported the county, which had then finished one Byrd-related trial, "has had to raise property taxes 8 percent to pay for the three prosecutions, which are expected to surpass half a million dollars" in costs, Burnett said. His report included comments from Johnetta Nash, then the Jasper County auditor, saying the county had put off priorities including computer upgrades and a jail addition. A 2002 Wall Street Journal news story presented a percentage tax increase like the one Paul declared. The story said the county’s costs of prosecuting Byrd’s murder had exceeded $1 million with more expenses expected, straining its $10 million annual budget and "forcing a 6.7% increase in property taxes over two years to pay for the trial." Generally, the Journal story said, death penalty cases are expensive because sentencing someone to death requires two proceedings; the first determines the accused person’s guilt, the second whether the convicted individual deserves the death penalty. "A death sentence," the story said, "is typically followed by years of appeals, and sometimes the entire case is retried." Jasper County official provides costs document Next, we queried officials in Jasper County, including Renee Weaver, the current county auditor, who emailed us an undated document she said she found in her files. The one-page document, titled "Capital Murder Costs - Jasper County," noted the county had six capital murder trials from 1998 to 2000 without more specifics. So we couldn’t tell exactly which trials were covered by the figures. From 1998 through 2000, according to the document, the county spent $873,669 on capital murder costs across 20 itemized categories including salaries, court-appointed attorneys, investigation expenses, courtroom security and telephone charges. The document shows $118,863 in additional costs in 2000 and nearly $124,300 in costs accrued from 2001 through May 2003. Subtracting $298,916 in grants provided by outside agencies to help cover costs leaves the declared unreimbursed county spending over five years at more than $817,000. Uncertain impact on tax rate? Unfortunately for our purposes, the document presented no information on whether changes in the county’s tax rate were influenced by the Byrd-related trial costs. Hoping for illumination on that front, we reached out to current and former county officials. Joe Folk, who was the county’s top elected official as Jasper County judge from 1995 through 2006, said he didn’t recall any tax hike driven by the county’s prosecutorial and appellate costs, though it’s possible. "It cost us a pretty good sum," Folk said. "We probably had to raise the rates some. But it wasn’t a great amount." Folk guided us to Nash, the former official who spoke to NPR. She told us she wasn’t sure about any specific hike due to the trials and urged us to consult David Luther, who has long been the chief appraiser of the Jasper County Appraisal District. To our inquiry, Luther provided a chart showing the county’s tax rate changes in those years and, separately, the degree to which each adopted rate exceeded the rate needed to bring in the revenue the county raised from taxes the year before. Taxes did go up. A few months after Byrd’s death, according to the chart, the county increased its general tax rate nearly 12 percent from the year before--from 31.72 cents per $100 valuation to 35.405 cents per $100 valuation. Significantly, Luther elaborated, that rate was about 7.25 percent higher than the rate of 33.012 cents per $100 valuation that would have generated the revenue the county gathered the year before--with the county’s budgeted costs for the Byrd matter, he said, accounting for more than 80 percent of this difference. Luther said he knows how one of the Byrd cases played into the tax rate that first year thanks to his January 1999 letter to a Jasper County prosecutor about how much the judge overseeing that Byrd-related trial was going to have to pay in additional county property taxes on his home due to the county’s trial expenses. At issue, he recalled, was a motion to have the judge recused from the case because of potential bias caused by the tax increase on his homestead. Luther’s letter said the county budgeted about $292,000 for the costs of the trial during 1999 which, he wrote, translates to about two cents per $100 valuation of the tax rate. For an average local homeowner, county property taxes for the year attributable to those budgeted costs, Luther wrote, broke out to $5.10. "So," Luther told us by email, "you could say that taxes were increased due to the trial costs by 6.05%." He acknowledged by phone that this calculation reflected just the first part of the county’s spending on prosecutions and appeals, which extended over several years. Our ruling Paul said Jasper County "raised property taxes by 7 percent in order to pay for one death penalty case." The chief appraiser’s research and letter demonstrates there was nearly a 7 percent first-year increase in taxes attributed to the costs of a death penalty trial. We rate Paul’s claim True.

pomt-07253	Under Gov. Bob McDonnell, more jobs have been lost than created in Southside and Southwest Virginia.	false	/virginia/statements/2011/may/28/ward-armstrong/armstrong-says-jobs-are-down-southside-and-southwe/	News that StarTek is closing its Henry County call center has reignited the debate over Gov. Bob McDonnell’s economic record. Shortly after the county’s biggest private employer announced it will shutter the facility with 631 jobs, House Minority Leader Ward Armstrong, D-Henry, criticized the Republican governor’s efforts to boost employment in depressed rural regions. "The McDonnell-Bolling administration has been touting the creation of jobs throughout Southside and Southwest Virginia," Armstrong said in a May 23 news release. "But the administration has not been able to create more jobs than have been lost. Unless that trend is changed we will continue to go backwards." No doubt, the economic picture in some parts of the state has been bleak, particularly in the Martinsville-Henry County area that Armstrong represents. In Martinsville alone, the March unemployment rate was a 17.8 percent. That was than more double the national unemployment rate of 8.8 percent that month. Virginia’s unemployment rate, meanwhile, was 6.2 percent in March. Still we wondered if the situation has worsened under McDonnell’s watch. We asked Claire Wilker, Armstrong’s chief of staff, where he got the information for his statement. She cited a number of eliminations announced by a number of companies over the last year. "But the reality is all you need to do is spend some time down in Henry County or anywhere in Southside to realize that more people are being laid off than there are jobs being created to be filled," Wilker said in an e-mail. Outside StarTek, the biggest cut was Stanley Furniture’s announcement in May 2010 that it was cutting 530 jobs at its Henry County factory. She included announcements dating back to April 2009, but we only counted the ones that occurred after McDonnell was sworn in on Jan. 16, 2010. We came up with announcements of 1,386 jobs cut and 1,159 positions created. But data from the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, a public-private organization that recruits businesses for Virginia, paints a rosier picture of Southside and Southwest. It lists new and expanding business deals that promised 3,117 new jobs in the two regions since February 2010, McDonnell’s first full month in office. That’s almost three times the number Armstrong’s aide offered. We could not find a similar data base listing businesses closings or layoffs. Not every job loss or job gain makes it into a headline or a news release. So we started digging for data that would better establish the employment trend in Southside and Southwestern Virginia during the McDonnell administration. We turned to the state government’s Virginia Performs website to get a list of localities in each region. Southside Virginia includes the cities of Danville, Martinsville and Emporia as well as a dozen counties in the south-central part of the state. The Southwest region includes the cities of Bristol, Galax and Norton as well as 14 counties down by the borders of Tennessee and North Carolina. We looked to the Virginia Employment Commission’s website for figures showing the number of jobs in each county and city in those two regions. Economists typically measure that by counting the number of jobs reported in a survey of businesses in an area. The problem is that at the county level, those jobs numbers are only available through September 2010. That takes us only about halfway into the McDonnell administration. So we can’t find a net number on how many jobs were gained or lost since the governor took office. But we can look at the results of another survey that reports how many people in each city or county in those two regions report having a job. The VEC website has compiled data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing the total number of people employed in each county and city in Southside and Southwestern Virginia. Those raw numbers are not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, such as spikes in summer hiring. To make up for that, we looked at the how the number of employed people in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2011 in each region. We compared the first three months of each year because those months most closely align with the start of McDonnell’s term and with the latest figures that are available. In Southwestern Virginia, an average of 180,306 people were employed each month from January through March of 2011. That was 3,673 people more than the average number of workers employed during the first quarter of 2010. We found a similar situation in Southside, where a monthly average of 157,018 people had jobs in the first quarter of 2011, compared with 153,813 employed residents in the first quarter of 2010. So the number of people working in each region went up between the first quarter of each year. Unemployment rates went down in 30 of the 32 localities in Southside and Southwest Virginia, according to figures from the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011. Bucking the trend were Southampton County and Galax. Let’s look at the employment picture the way a job seeker would -- by the number of positions open. In the Southside, the average monthly number of job postings was 9,132 in the first quarter of 2011, according to VEC statistics. In the first quarter of 2010, it was 5,904. In Southwest, job listings also markedly rose. The average number of postings each month in the first quarter of 2010 was 3,997. In the first quarter of 2011, there was an average 7,489 each month. A final note: We don’t suggest McDonnell deserves credit or blame for employment trends in Southside, Southwest or anywhere else in Virginia. As we have noted many times, economists have repeatedly told us governors have a limited impact on their state economies and get too much credit when things go well and too much grief when they don’t. To sum up: Armstrong said that there has been a net loss in jobs in the Southwestern and Southside parts of Virginia. There is no comprehensive data on which to base such a sweeping claim about the regions’ job losses under McDonnell. The only data available at the county level covers nine months of McDonnell’s 16-month term. But there are other statistics showing that under McDonnell, more people in those regions are employed and the number of job postings have increased. We rate his Armstrong’s claim False. Correction: An earlier version of this story said McDonnell was sworn in as governor in January 2011. He actually took office in January 2010.

pomt-08049	Says Texas Railroad Commissioner Michael Williams has attended more than 150 tea party gatherings.	false	/texas/statements/2011/jan/03/dean-wright/austin-activist-says-michael-williams-has-attended/	In a Nov. 30 article about the 2012 U.S. Senate race in Texas, a Capitol Hill newspaper quotes a conservative activist rating Texas Railroad Commissioner Michael Williams an early favorite of the tea party movement for the GOP nomination. The Hill story further quotes Dean Wright of Austin saying that Williams has appeared at more than 150 tea party gatherings across Texas. That's a whole lot of tea-sipping -- and a worthy claim to stir the Truth-O-Meter pot. Right fast, we found ample evidence Williams has embraced the tea party movement. In December 2009, The Weekly Standard noted that Williams had recently come to Washington to accept the endorsement of U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint's Senate Conservatives Fund. The magazine quoted DeMint telling reporters: "Millions of people who've spoken out at town halls and tea parties .  .  . are looking for common sense mainstream leaders who believe in the principles of our Constitution. He's one of the most inspiring people I've heard talk about those principles in a long time." And in an April 2010 interview with Neil Cavuto of the Fox News Channel, Williams said he'd spoken at about a dozen tea party events, attended by as few as 100 and as many as 5,000 people. According to a transcript, Williams said, "That energy, that fervor you see at the tea party movement, that fight for -- for constitutional limits on the national... government, all of that, I agree with. And, so, I would like to think that I was a tea party candidate." Williams added that he doesn't think most tea partiers are looking to create a third political party. "But I think what they`re looking to is to inform the two dominant parties and to have us about be respectful of the notions of limited government, small government, controlling spending," Williams told Cavuto. "And they want us to return to a constitutional form of government. They don`t want the national government reaching into what should be the responsibility of the states and local governments, and even the private and civic communities." A dozen events is a small fraction of 150, though. We contacted Wright, founder and president of New Revolution Now, which describes itself as a party-agnostic organization created to harness the "core conservative values of mainstream Americans to elect the state and U.S. congressional representatives who will return the country to its founding values of limited government, low taxation, states rights and constitutional constructionism." Wright told us that he'd told The Hill that Williams had "probably" attended 150 tea party events, but he conceded that the real number was less than that. "I'm just trying to get the point out that he's really engaging with the tea parties," Wright said. "Just in the Central Texas region, I've been to five or six events where (Williams) has spoken at a tea party function." He suggested we check with Williams. Done: Williams' campaign consultant, Corbin Casteel, told us that Williams' past stump schedules are incomplete due to a computer glitch, but those that remain indicate that Williams spoke at eight tea party events from April 2009 through June 2010. Casteel said Williams estimates he's attended eight to 10 more. The events reflected in Williams' records were in Travis County (April 15, 2009); Weatherford (July 4, 2009); Granbury (Aug. 29, 2009); Waco (Sept. 3, 2009); Collin County (Sept. 7); Rowlett (Sept. 12, 2009); Wichita Falls (April 15); and Bastrop County (June 26, 2010). Finally, Williams told us in an interview he's been to 12 to 15 tea party events in Texas, and he expects more rallies to occur. "I'll have to see if I still get invitations; it's their party," Williams said. He said he was pleased by Wright's count. "He thinks I'm spreading more than I am," Williams said. The commissioner's got that right. We rate Wright's statement False.	None	Dean Wright	None	None	None	2011-01-03T06:00:00	2010-11-30	['None']
pomt-01779	"(Mary) Burke’s company," Trek Bicycles, "makes 99% of their bikes overseas."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/28/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-trek-makes-99-its-bicycles-overs/	With his popularity among conservatives still high, and a poll showing his support dropping among independents, Gov. Scott Walker is working to dampen liberals’ enthusiasm for his main Democratic rival in the November 2014 election. Here’s part of his second campaign TV ad hitting Mary Burke’s former employer, Wisconsin’s Trek Bicycles, for building products overseas: "Mary Burke is trying to sell us on her experience at her family business, but she forgot to mention they make 99% of their bikes overseas, in places like China, where her company has outsourced jobs for years," a narrator says. The spot adds that "Burke’s company makes almost all their bikes overseas." In her campaign, Burke has highlighted her former role as a manager at Trek, the company founded in 1976 by her father, Richard, in Waterloo. She has said that Trek, as a company trying to compete globally, does what it can to manufacture bikes in the United States and makes more bikes in America than any other manufacturer. The latest Walker ad cites an OnMilwaukee.com piece from Jan. 9, 2011, flashing what looks like a headline that reads: "Over 99.5% Of The Bicycles That Burke’s Company Produces, Are Made Overseas." So that’s where we’ll start. The piece, a question-and-answer feature with a Trek spokesman, does not mention either Mary Burke or a figure of more than 99.5%. It ran under the headline "Trek Corporation Committed To Wisconsin" and highlighted Trek’s employment of nearly 1,000 people in the state at three facilities and another 800 around the world at the time. The story does not call Trek Mary Burke’s company, as Walker’s ad characterizes it. In one of her own campaign videos, Burke calls Trek "my family’s business" and one she says she helped grow into a worldwide force. But Burke left Trek’s employment in 2004, and its board in 2005, though she still owns stock in the private company. So the Walker ad seemingly is off to a rough start. But that OnMilwaukee piece did contain two numbers that allow a reader get a feeling for the balance of overseas versus domestic production at Trek, at least as of 2011. In the piece, Trek official Eric Bjorling is quoted as saying that Trek makes roughly 10,000 bikes a year in Wisconsin. Later in the story, in response to a separate question, he said that Trek sells about 1.5 million bikes a year around the world. We should note that Bjorling characterized the 10,000 figure as a rough estimate, saying it’s "almost impossible to give a number" because production is seasonal and demand-based. Nevertheless, doing the math yields an answer of 99.33 percent built overseas. So that works in Walker’s favor. We asked Trek company spokeswoman Marina Marich to comment on the ad and the number it presents, and she responded in part, "As a privately held company, Trek doesn’t disclose specific production data." A Burke campaign spokesman simply referred us to Trek. Industry observers say that broadly speaking, the 99 percent figure makes sense. "The bottom line is there is no major bicycle production in the U.S.," said Marc Sani, writer and former publisher of Bicycle Retailer & Industry News. "It left when Schwinn went to China in the 1980s. That was the beginning of the end." Trek and other U.S.-based bicycle companies have little or no choice but to build product in cheaper venues overseas in order to compete globally, Sani said. Trek has two manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin -- one in Waterloo and one in Whitewater. Overseas, it builds in Germany, Holland and China. In 2011, CEO John Burke said Trek’s sales were more than $800 million. Trek contends, without providing numbers to back it up, that it manufactures more bikes the United States than any other bicycle company and is the only "major" bicycle company that stills manufactures product in the United States. As PolitiFact Wisconsin reported in January, Burke and Trek also have declined to document her claim that while at Trek the European division she oversaw went from $3 million to over $50 million in sales." Jay Townley, a bicycle industry consultant based in Wisconsin, noted that because U.S. production is so low, the numbers are volatile. But even if it was 30,000 instead of 10,000, the overseas production share would be 98 percent, which still sounds a lot like the Walker ad’s phrasing that "almost all" of Trek’s bikes are made outside the United States. Our rating Walkers’ ad says that Trek Bicycle "makes 99% of their bikes overseas," and it puts Mary Burke at the center of responsibility by saying Trek is "Burke’s company." The best available numbers, from Trek’s own mouth, lend credence to the 99 percent claim, as do the best educated guesses by industry analysts. So the ad’s main thrust is correct. Calling Trek "Burke’s company" is somewhat problematic, though. She held a management position there and still owns stock, but she left a decade ago and seven years before the 2011 story that yielded the 99 percent figure. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2014-07-28T05:00:00	2014-07-22	['None']

pomt-03018	On responding to chemical weapon use in Syria	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/13/paul-ryan/did-paul-ryan-change-his-position-red-line-and-che/	In the 2012 campaign, Paul Ryan repeatedly criticized President Barack Obama’s foreign policy but agreed with Obama that use of chemical weapons by the regime in Syria was a "red line" that would prompt U.S. action. A year later, after Obama asserted the line had been crossed, it was Ryan who came in for criticism when he opposed the president’s call for a military strike aimed at weakening Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces. Did Ryan reverse his position on the "red line," as some commentators and news reports said? Let’s test this on the Flip-O-Meter. First, our standard disclaimer: The Flip-O-Meter does not measure whether any change in position is good politics or good policy, but simply whether a political figure has changed his or her position. Our research starts with 2011 comments by Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman and 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee who is widely considered a potential 2016 presidential candidate. In a 2011 speech at the Hamilton Society, Ryan endorsed a larger military and a more activist role in the world for the United States. He decried "brutal crackdowns" by various regimes, saying, "We have a responsibility to speak boldly for those whose voices are denied by the jackbooted thugs of the tired tyrants of Syria and Iran." So in 2011 Ryan used tough language, but was vague what actions were appropriate and when they should be taken. Comments in 2012 We found little else from Ryan regarding Syria until the fall 2012 campaign, when Ryan had been added to the GOP ticket by presidential candidate Mitt Romney. As could be expected, Ryan echoed his running mate’s criticisms of Obama’s approach in Syria. Amid reports that Assad might be preparing to use chemical weapons, Obama was asked at an Aug. 19, 2012 news conference "whether you envision using U.S. military, if simply for nothing else, the safekeeping of the chemical weapons." Obama responded: "We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus." He added: "We cannot have a situation where chemical or biological weapons are falling into the hands of the wrong people." Major media outlets generally agreed that Obama was, directly or indirectly, warning Syria it could face American military intervention. In the October 2012 vice-presidential debate with Joe Biden, Ryan bought into Obama’s "red line" rhetoric. But first, he complained fiercely that Obama had dallied while Assad slaughtered tens of thousands of Syrians and al-Qaida had entered the fight. Ryan said Obama had failed to aid moderate dissident elements in the country, wrongly gave Russian leader Vladimir Putin veto power over U.S. efforts to deal with Syria, and neglected relationships with allies in the region. Pressed on what Romney-Ryan would do if elected, Ryan said they agreed with Obama’s "red line" on chemical weapons. And Ryan, echoing Romney’s call for a tougher line, put some meat on the bone, endorsing American ground troops in Syria for the limited purpose of securing chemical weapons in the context of a "red line." Ryan emphasized that was the only scenario for U.S. boots on the ground. Ryan’s comments didn’t tell us much about the nature of any military action in case of a red line violation. But he made clear he was willing to use U.S. troops in Syria to secure chemical weapons. Comments in 2013 Fast forward to Aug. 21, 2013, almost exactly one year after Obama’s "red line" remark. On that day, international chemical weapons inspectors now say, a deadly attack on opposition-held suburbs of Damascus included the use of the nerve agent sarin. The Associated Press reported that the United States and its allies alleged the Syrian government was responsible. After the attack, Obama threatened missile strikes against Assad, then unexpectedly sought congressional approval for them, and then stepped back when Russian-led diplomatic efforts led to an ongoing United Nations-backed mission to scrap Syria’s capacity to make chemical weapons and destroy its stockpile. Critics said Obama’s twists and turns on a military strike undermined the notion of a tough response, and in Syria the delays angered residents and disappointed opposition leaders. Notably, Obama did not propose American troops on the ground. Next came Obama’s announcement on Aug. 31, 2012 that he would seek congressional approval for a military strike. Ryan briefly commented, saying, "The President has some work to do to recover from his grave missteps in Syria. He needs to clearly demonstrate that the use of military force would strengthen America's security. I want to hear his case to Congress and to the American people." Then, on Sept. 11, 2013, a day after Obama addressed the nation and with Obama still seeking congressional approval for a strike, Ryan announced his opposition, while the House’s two top GOP leaders backed a strike. Ryan’s lengthy statement said a lot about why Obama was off track but left us wondering about Ryan’s own views on military intervention. At various points he seemed clearly to suggest Obama’s proposed military strike was too small, calling it a "feeble" deterrent and too "limited" to degrade chemical-weapons capabilities when a "firm response" was needed. Ryan also repeated his 2012 criticisms that Obama had failed to aid rebels and had deferred to Russia. But at points he appeared to question the wisdom of any strike, saying, "A military strike could kill innocent civilians and earn the ire of everyone involved" and "drop America's standing in the Middle East even further." Ryan didn’t rule anything out, saying America must "carefully weigh all options." His statement ended with a proposal for action that did not mention military intervention: "Instead of the proposals put forth by the President, we should tighten sanctions on Assad's regime and give aid to the moderate elements of the opposition. " Asked to clarify Ryan’s position on military intervention, aide Kevin Seifert told us: "Paul Ryan’s concerns aren’t limited to ‘size,’ they are about the strategy." He continued: "It’s the mismatch between the president’s stated objective and the proposed strategy to achieve it." Seifert would not say how Ryan would view another proposal for military intervention came before Congress. More comments Four days after Ryan put out his September 2013 statement, the "UpFront with Mike Gousha" show aired an interview with Ryan in which he expressed deep pessimism about using inspections to get the chemical weapons out. Gousha cited Ryan’s debate position that agreed with Obama on a "red line" and asked him why he had now changed his position. Ryan said he had not changed his position; he just found Obama’s specific proposal to be incoherent. Gousha followed up: "Bottom line, do you think we should take military action because Syria used chemical weapons on its people?" Ryan, shaking his head from side to side, responded strictly in the context of Obama’s plan: "No. No, I do not believe he should do this because I don’t think this administration has any game plan for any of the contingencies surrounding it." For additional perspective on Ryan, we spoke to Michael O’Hanlon, director of research for the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution, and UCLA history professor and Middle East scholar James Gelvin. They offered differing interpretations of Ryan’s comments, but neither saw a full reversal by the congressman. O’Hanlon saw an inconsistency in Ryan rejecting Obama’s plan as too meek while Ryan himself earlier had specifically endorsed nothing more muscular for taking on Assad. Gelvin sees Ryan’s position as opportunistic politically but fairly consistent from a policy standpoint. He believes Ryan is in the foreign-policy camp that says, if we’re going to use force, do it big. Our rating Ryan has said all along he wanted more aggressive help for moderate groups fighting Assad. But here we’re testing whether his position has changed regarding a U.S. military response to Syrian use of chemical weapons. We know that after Obama drew the red line suggesting some sort of military intervention, Ryan endorsed that general idea, then 11 months later rejected Obama’s plan for it. But we don’t see a major reversal of position here -- in part because Ryan’s views on what to do about chemical weapons were ill-defined in 2012 and remain so now. It’s true Ryan rejected Obama’s proposed limited strike once chemical weapon use became reality, but he says he did so because of objections to Obama’s timing, strategy and execution. We found no evidence Ryan had previously backed -- or rejected -- this kind of limited strike. And he still says military intervention remains an option. His statements contain some inconsistencies, however. In 2012, Ryan said American ground troops would be an appropriate response if a red line was crossed, but his position on that is now unclear because he won’t answer questions about it. And the September 2013 statement he issued is a model of confusion as opposed to his feisty debate comments. In it, he strongly implied Obama’s strike was too small and not forceful enough, but then threw water on a limited strike because it could kill civilians. For those inconsistencies, we rate this a Half Flip.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2013-10-13T05:00:00	2013-09-11	['None']
pomt-05279	Says Democratic legislators this year "don't want to cut your taxes under any circumstances."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/25/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-democrats-dont-want-cut-your/	Sometimes Gov. Chris Christie’s comments simply don’t jibe with reality. Take, for instance, his claim at a transportation conference Wednesday that Democrats are opposed to any tax cuts this year. As Christie continues pushing for an income tax cut, the Republican governor and Democratic legislators have been battling this week over differing state revenue projections. The Christie administration is estimating a shortfall of $676 million through the end of the next fiscal year, while David Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, has estimated a shortfall of $1.3 billion. After blasting Rosen as the "Dr. Kevorkian of the numbers," Christie in a speech Wednesday claimed that Democratic legislators "don't want to cut your taxes under any circumstances." "This year, when they don’t want to cut your taxes under any circumstances, they have their handmaiden walk over across the street in front of the Assembly Budget Committee today and say...’I was wrong. I was $1.6 billion wrong for this year, but trust me for next year. You’re another $660 billion short for next year.’ Why would anybody with a functioning brain believe this guy?" Well, PolitiFact New Jersey has a question of its own: Why would anybody with a functioning brain believe Democrats don’t want tax cuts when they released their own tax cut proposals a few months ago? The debate over their proposals and the governor's has gripped Trenton since Christie’s State of the State address in January, when the governor unveiled his plan for an across-the-board 10 percent cut in the state income tax. Democrats immediately pounced on the proposal for disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest residents. But in early March, Democrats in the State Senate and the State Assembly each laid out their own tax cut proposals. After pointing out the Senate Democrats’ plan during a town hall meeting in March, Christie offered this promise: "Looks like we got some place to work here. Here’s the one thing I know for sure: You’re gonna get tax relief in 2012, because we’re now agreeing on cutting taxes in Trenton." Both Democratic proposals only would benefit households earning up to $250,000 by providing a tax credit based on their property taxes. The tax credits would be applied against their income taxes. Senate Democrats have proposed a 10 percent tax credit, while Assembly Democrats are pushing what they refer to as a 20 percent credit. According to Assembly Democrats, seniors and the disabled would receive a 25 percent credit. Unlike the Senate plan, the Assembly proposal includes increasing taxes on income exceeding $1 million. Despite the poor revenue projections, Senate President Stephen Sweeney has stood by the need to provide property tax relief, according to published reports. Citing recent revenue projections, Assembly Democrats have criticized Christie's tax cut proposal, claiming their plan is the better solution. According to the Associated Press, one Assembly Democratic leader has left open the possibility that there may be no tax cut at all in the upcoming state budget. In response to our findings, Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts provided this statement: "Assembly Democrats specifically put forward a tax plan that raises taxes on some people. Theirs can be defined as much as a ‘tax cut’ as by a ‘tax increase.’ You guys are extraordinarily rigid on the use of language so I hope you make that note. Secondly, the Assembly plan is dead on arrival. It has zero chance of becoming law, which they know. Now, since the April revenue figures came out, Democrats have used those figures as an excuse to abandon a tax cut. Their statements indicate as much and we put out a release earlier today highlighting this fact." Our ruling In a speech Wednesday, Christie claimed that Democratic legislators this year "don't want to cut your taxes under any circumstances." That claim is pure nonsense. The main topic in Trenton has been competing tax cut proposals made by Christie and the Democrats. Christie may disagree with them on how to cut taxes, but there’s no doubt that many Democrats are willing to do just that. For Christie to suggest otherwise is just ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-03866	A proposed ban on hollow-point bullets and bullets that expand upon impact "essentially bans deer hunting."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/mar/10/vicki-mckenna/talk-show-host-vicki-mckenna-proposed-rules-bullet/	In the months following the Sandy Hook school massacre, Wisconsin Democrats moved to restrict access to firearms and ammunition. Those efforts included the drafting of a bill in the state Assembly by Reps. Frederick Kessler, Evan Goyke and Mandela Barnes, all Milwaukee Democrats. Among other things, the bill would restrict sales and possession of hollow-point bullets, a type of ammunition that expands on impact and creates even larger wounds. Authorities said Adam Lanza, the Sandy Hook killer, used bullets designed to inflict maximum damage by breaking up in a victim’s body. Kessler argued banning such bullets would give the victims of a mass shooting at least a chance of survival. But that bill would have a far greater impact, said conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna on Feb. 18, 2013. It would end deer hunting, a key part of the state’s culture, said McKenna, whose show is aired in Milwaukee, Madison and LaCrosse. "Democrats in Wisconsin want to fight crime by banning deer hunting," McKenna said. She explained that the bill "proposed taking hollow-pointed ammunition off the shelves. Which essentially bans deer hunting because you can only use an expanding bullet to deer hunt." That caught our attention. After all, the state sold more than 614,000 licenses as of the start of the gun deer season in November 2012. That’s equivalent to a little more than 10 percent of the state’s population. So is McKenna right? Would Kessler’s bill blow away the gun deer hunt? (We’ll avoid picking nits and assume the bow hunting season would remain.) We turned to the experts to learn more about bullets and Bambi. The proposed legislation According to the Legislative Reference Bureau: "This bill prohibits a person, with certain exceptions such as for law enforcement, from selling, transporting, manufacturing, or possessing any hollowpoint bullet, any bullet that expands or flattens easily in the human body, or any bullet with a hard envelope that does not entirely cover the core of the bullet." That bans a lot of bullets. But what does this have to do with deer hunting? We asked Tim Lawhern, the state Department of Natural Resource’s top official on such matters. For years, state law required hunters of deer and others species to use hollow-point bullets, said Lawhern, administrator of the DNR’s enforcement and science division. The law was modified a couple years ago because more and more hunters were hunting with a different sort of ammunition -- often made of solid copper -- that also changed shape on impact, but was not a hollow point. State law now says it’s illegal to hunt deer with "non-expanding bullets." Said Lawhern: "It must be the expanding type of ammunition." The idea is that bullets that expand on impact do more damage, cause greater hemorrhaging, and the animal dies in a swifter, more humane manner, Lawhern explained. So Kessler and company want to ban the very kind of bullets that hunters are required to use. What ammo would that leave hunters with? "Nothing," said Lawhern. "Archery. You could use archery equipment." Banning hollow-point bullets "would have a negative impact on deer hunting," said George Meyer, former DNR secretary and executive director of Wisconsin Wildlife Federation. "If they don’t have any ammunition they could use, it certainly doesn’t sound good if you’re a hunter," Lawhern said. Legions of hunters would have the same reaction about an expanding-bullet ban, he added. "You’ll have the largest army in the world saying, ‘What, are you nuts?’" A change in plans Apparently they won’t have to worry. Shortly after word got out -- including on McKenna’s show -- Kessler admitted he and the other lawmakers had shot themselves in the foot. They’re rewriting the bill to "remove any conflicts of law and provide exemptions that honor our state’s great sporting heritage," Kessler said in a Feb. 19, 2013, statement, a day after McKenna’s show on the subject. The bill "was never intended to conflict with current laws or codes related to Wisconsin’s rich hunting tradition and those who annually participate in it," Kessler said, adding that the draft bills "contained unintended oversights." He added: "We will be working with the Legislative Reference Bureau, Legislative Council and the Department of Natural Resources to ensure that any future bill drafts are consistent with current sporting and hunting regulations." Kessler said in an interview that he still wants to limit sales of hollow-point bullets, but with an exemption for hunters. Such ammunition would be available "only to people who have licenses to hunt, who are on their way to hunt and it’s hunting season, " Kessler said. So let’s bag this one. McKenna said a proposal to restrict sale and possession of hollow-point and flattening or expanding bullets "essentially bans deer hunting." McKenna’s right on an important front. Deer hunters are required to use bullets that expand on impact -- including hollow points. And Kessler wanted to ban those very bullets. So it would leave gun hunters without bullets. But she’s wrong by suggesting that the Democrats were seeking to ban hunting. Kessler admitted hunting never crossed his mind when the bill was drafted in an effort to protect mass shooting victims. The city slickers came up with a bill with a problem that stood out like a white tail between the cross hairs. As it stood, the law would have banned the bullets. But it didn’t ban hunting.

pomt-13203	"Ford is moving all of their small-car production to Mexico."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-ford-moving-all-small-car-produc/	One of Donald Trump’s signature issues in his 2016 presidential bid has been stopping the outflow of American jobs to other countries. During a visit to Delaware, Ohio, he cited a recent example of a major American company moving some of its work out of the United States. "Companies like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico," Trump said. "Ford is moving all of their small-car production to Mexico. When I'm president, if a company wants to fire their workers and leave for Mexico or other countries, then we will charge them a 35 percent tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States." Is it really true that "Ford is moving all of their small car production to Mexico"? We’ll take a closer look. On Sept. 14, 2016, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced at an event with Wall Street analysts that "we will have migrated all of our small-car production to Mexico and out of the United States" over the next two to three years, according to Reuters. Ford had already announced that it would be investing $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production starting in 2018. "During contract talks in 2015, Ford confirmed that it would move Focus and C-Max production out of its Wayne, Mich., plant in 2018. The United Auto Workers Union said at the time that Ford planned to build the next Focus in Mexico," Reuters reported. The Focus and the C-Max are considered small cars. The company cited declining interest among U.S. consumers for smaller cars and growing sales for bigger vehicles in an era of low gasoline prices. It also cited Mexican labor costs that are about 40 percent lower than than in the United States. "That's what it takes to compete in that (small car) segment," Fields told CNN. So Trump is right that the company is moving all small-car production in North America to Mexico. However, he overlooked a salient point -- that both the company and the United Auto Workers do not expect any jobs to be lost at the Wayne plant. Instead of building small cars, the Wayne facility will transition into producing SUVs and pickup trucks that are more popular in the United States. "Our U.S. workforce at that plant will be making those new vehicles," said Ford spokeswoman Christin Tinsworth Baker. In the past five years, Ford has invested $12 billion in U.S. plants and created nearly 28,000 U.S. jobs, Baker said. In all, the company has 85,000 U.S. employees. In a September interview with Fox News, Trump mischaracterized the changes at Ford, saying the company planned to "fire all their employees in the United States and … move to Mexico." The company aggressively countered that allegation. In an interview with CNN, Fields was asked whether the company would cut any U.S. jobs as part of the relocation of work to Mexico. He said, "Absolutely not. Zero. Not one job will be lost. Most of our investment is here in the U.S. And that's the way it will continue to be." In his speech in Ohio, however, Trump stuck closer to the facts. Our ruling Trump said that "Ford is moving all of their small-car production to Mexico." That’s correct as far as it goes, but framing it that way ignores an important qualifier -- that no U.S. jobs will be lost in the transition. The company says that workers at the Ford plant in question will instead make SUVs and pickups.

pomt-02896	Charlie Crist stopped "layoffs of some 20,000 school teachers during the global economic meltdown."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/nov/07/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-he-stopped-layoffs-20000-teache/	Former Gov. Charlie Crist wants voters to see a stark contrast between himself and Republican Gov. Rick Scott on public education. In his announcement speech in St. Petersburg on Nov. 4, 2013, Crist took credit for protecting teachers’ jobs when he was the Republican-elected governor from 2007 to 2010. (He switched to independent while running for U.S. Senate in 2010 and now he is running as a Democrat.) "I am proud of my record as the governor investing in public education, and stopping the layoffs of some 20,000 school teachers during the global economic meltdown." We will tackle this fact-check in two parts: Were 20,000 layoffs of Florida school teachers prevented during the recession, and does Crist get credit for that? Stimulus act The Crist campaign told us the basis of his claim was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the $787 billion federal stimulus bill pushed by President Barack Obama and passed by Congress in 2009. The Florida Department of Education published information in 2010 about how many "instructional personnel" the Recovery Act affected. The department identified 19,166 full-time equivalent jobs affecting a total 31,003 employees for the quarter ending June 30, 2010. Instructional personnel included elementary and secondary classroom teachers as well as guidance counselors, librarians and audio-visual workers, to name just a few. Many news reports stated that without the stimulus funds, the state would have had to make massive cuts including to education. Crist’s campaign cited a 2009 Miami Herald article which paraphrased the state’s education commissioner at the time, Eric Smith, saying that the stimulus dollars saved 26,000 teacher jobs. (Smith was appointed by Crist.) The stimulus money was paid out over two years: In 2009-10, nearly $908 million went to K-12 education, and another $873 million the year after, said Ruth Melton, director of government relations for the Florida School Boards Association. "The infusion of this federal cash was tremendously important in keeping school districts solvent during the recession," Melton said. We can’t say with certainty that without the stimulus dollars, 20,000 teachers would have been laid off, because each district could have made different decisions about how to make their budgets work. "It could have meant actually more teachers than reported," Melton said. At the other extreme, some districts could have laid off more expensive teachers who were close to retirement -- so that could have lowered the number. "A lot depended on the financial condition of the district before the recession hit – some districts had healthier reserve balances than others," Melton said. Crist’s role in the stimulus act Crist didn’t get to vote on passing the stimulus bill -- that was up to Congress. But Crist skipped a Florida Cabinet meeting to campaign with Obama for the stimulus in Fort Myers, and he went on national talk shows and across the state selling the plan. He lobbied members of Florida’s congressional delegation from both parties to pass the stimulus. "We know that it's important that we pass a stimulus package," Crist said on Feb. 10, 2009, amid "Yes, we can!" cheers as he introduced the Democratic president in Fort Myers, the Tampa Bay Times reported. "This is not about partisan politics. This is about rising above that, helping America and reigniting our economy." Crist and Obama exchanged a friendly hug, an image that came back to haunt Crist when he ran for Senate in 2010. While many governors accepted the stimulus money, Crist was one of the few prominent Republicans to actively and publicly support the stimulus, a choice that won him accolades from Obama. Crist defended his choice to accept stimulus dollars when he faced heat from his own Republican Party. Still, in accepting the money, Crist did the same thing as many governors across the country, including those who weren't cheerleading the stimulus. Nationwide, the stimulus doled out more than $93 billion in education funds, including $50.9 in money for elementary and secondary schools to close gaps in state funding. A map on recovery.gov shows all the states taking these dollars. Overall, the stimulus funded about 368,000 school employees’ jobs nationwide during the 2009-10 school year, according to a February 2011 article the Hechinger Report, a respected publication about education. States didn’t go on a hiring spree, but used the money to prevent mass layoffs and backfill other funding losses. It wasn’t a cure-all, though: Some teachers were still laid off, depending on the individual school district. Our ruling Charlie Crist said that he stopped "layoffs of some 20,000 school teachers during the global economic meltdown." Crist was referring to the 2009 federal stimulus, which included education money to keep teachers and other education workers on the job. Without stimulus dollars, there could have been massive layoffs, though it’s difficult to pinpoint the precise number of teachers. Crist was a big-time cheerleader for the stimulus, urging members of Florida’s congressional delegation to support it. There was also that manhug with Obama that was used against him in his race for Senate. But Crist didn't have much of a role in getting the actual stimulus passed; that credit goes to Congress and Obama. And, many governors took the stimulus money to save teaching jobs. In all likelihood, Florida would have gotten the money without Crist's high-profile support. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08004	The White House "branded" the memorial service for the Tucson shootings with a "Together We Thrive" logo and slogan.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/13/michelle-malkin/did-white-house-brand-arizona-memorial-service-log/	The University of Arizona memorial service for the victims of the Tucson, Ariz. shootings was called "Together We Thrive." But Michelle Malkin claimed the slogan was cooked up by the White House In an opinion piece about the Jan. 12, 2011, memorial event, Malkin, a conservative pundit, accused the White House of "branding" the memorial service with the slogan, complete with its own logo. Malkin noted that all 13,000 people who attended the "Together We Thrive" event were given blue and white T-shirts with the logo. "Can't the Democrat political stage managers give it a break just once?" Malkin wrote in her column. The Drudge Report subsequently ran a headline atop its web page, "Political Theme, T-Shirts at Memorial?" It linked to an AP photo of "Together We Thrive" T-shirts draped over the back of chairs before the memorial service at McKale Memorial Center on the University of Arizona campus. But officials at the University of Arizona said the White House had nothing to do with the name or the logo. "The name of the event and the logo for the event were done entirely by the university," said Johnny Cruz, a spokesman for the University of Arizona. "Branding of the event was not done in consultation with the White House, or any elected officials or political organization." The T-shirts were also the university's doing, Cruz said. "That was the university's idea," he said. "We wanted to give people something to remember, to symbolize the community spirit." The university bought the shirts without the use of taxpayer dollars, although he wasn't sure if the cost was borne by donations. "Almost everything was done by the university," Cruz said, including selection of the location for the event and planning the agenda. Once the president accepted an invitation, he said, the White House helped coordinate some logistics, such as security, but that was the extent of the White House involvement. And "Together We Thrive" was conceived by a University of Arizona student, he said. White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs said during his briefing that the university was responsible for logistics. "I think it’s important to understand we were invited to and accepted quite happily the invitation of the university," he said. We should note that Malkin later added an update to her blog posting that stated, "As noted above, the University of Arizona announced the Together We Thrive event — and a few readers wrote in to say that the campus initiated the logo/campaign. Given U of A president Robert Shelton's embarrassing, thinly-veiled partisan cheerleading for Obama tonight, it may indeed be a 100 percent-campus-initiated campaign. Given the Obama White House's meticulous attention to stage prop details, however, I would say the odds of involvement by Axelrod/Plouffe & Co. are high." But university spokesman Cruz said all of the "stage prop details," as Malkin called them, were entirely conceived by and arranged by the college. The burden of proof is on Malkin and she has failed to prove any White House involvement. She may believe she sees the handiwork of the White House at play, but there's no evidence to back that up. Certainly not enough to justify her claim the White House used the shooting tragedy as an opportunity to orchestrate a "branded" political event. We rate Malkin's claim False.

pomt-11012	"83% of Trump tax breaks go to the wealthiest 1%."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/10/tax-march/nevada-tv-ad-cherry-picks-tax-cut-benefits-top-1/	A new ad on the air in Nevada against the Republican tax law features a cheerful grandmother doling out brightly wrapped candy to her grandchildren. To the girl, she gives heaping handfuls. To the boy, a few pieces. When he complains how that’s unfair, the grandmother explains, "Some people start off with more than others, and so, we’re going to be giving them even more." On the screen appear the words "83 percent of Trump tax breaks go to the wealthiest 1 percent," with a reference to a Dec. 18, 2017, article on Vox. The ad from the group Tax March rehashes a Democratic talking point that we’ve addressed before. The number is roughly correct, but it leaves out a lot of important information. The tax cuts are a dividing line in the Nevada Senate race between the Republican incumbent Dean Heller, who voted for the law, and his Democratic challenger Rep. Jacky Rosen, who has said she would change it. A December 2017 analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, is the underlying source for the 83 percent. The center modeled the impact of the tax law and looked at how different income groups fared in three years: 2018, 2025 and 2027. Only in one year, 2027, did 82.8 percent of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent of tax filers. In 2018, the number was 20.5 percent, and in 2025, it was 25.3 percent. Both are a far cry from the big number in the ad. Why the large shift? In order to stay within the Senate rules that shaped the bill, most of the individual tax cuts end after 2025. That leaves the corporate tax cuts, which do more to help upper income earners. Also, the law changed the calculation for factoring in inflation and those adjustments become less favorable to taxpayers over time. As this chart shows, the lopsided benefits come in the final year. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "How much of the benefit of the tax bill goes to the top 1 percent income group greatly depends on what year you are looking at," Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center, told us in January. We asked Rosenberg if the center’s work allows any way to figure out the cumulative gains and losses over the 10 years of the tax law. He said there was not. "We only published single year results, and only for three years," Rosenberg said. It is worth noting that not everyone inside each income group does equally well. For example, among the top 1 percent in the final year, about a quarter of the group sees a small tax increase of $1,250 on average. Finally, the statement talks about the "wealthiest" 1 percent. The study looked at annual income, which is how much money a person takes in. Wealth is the assets someone has accumulated over time. Our ruling The Tax March ad says 83 percent of the Trump tax breaks go to the wealthiest 1 percent. The number is about right, but only for the last year of the tax law. In the two earlier years estimated by the Tax Policy Center, the share going to the highest income group was between 20 and 25 percent. The law does favor the well-to-do, but not by nearly as much as the ad says. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-11548	"Heitkamp has voted against Trump 68 percent of time."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/09/national-republican-senatorial-committee/misleading-nrsc-ad-heitkamp-trump-contrarian/	A North Dakota National Republican Senate Committee ad portrays Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., as a contrarian to President Donald Trump. "North Dakota voted for President Trump," the voiceover says. "But Sen. Heidi Heitkamp doesn’t care. She’s joined Washington liberals in their partisan obstruction and is taking orders from party boss Chuck Schumer, the architect of the Schumer Shutdown." "Heitkamp has voted against Trump 68 percent of time," the graphic reads. The statistic was shared during State of the Union and Super Bowl digital ad campaigns. Given North Dakota's Republican leanings, Heitkamp is a top GOP target. However, the party's top potential recruit, U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer, chose not to run, leaving state Sen. Tom Campbell the leading Republican challenger so far. We wondered whether Heitkamp had indeed opposed Trump’s agenda almost seven times out of 10. That depends on how you define opposition. The NRSC cited a FiveThirtyEight "legislative voting analysis" of Heitkamp’s votes. They pointed us to Heitkamp’s Trump Score on the news site, which tracks how many times each member of Congress votes with or against the president. FiveThirtyEight found that Heitkamp had voted with Trump 53.2 percent of the time and 46.8 percent of the time against him. The tally at the time the NRSC accessed the database (Jan. 26, 2018), was 53.33 percent with Trump, 46.7 percent against. That’s a much more moderate record than the ad suggests. When we asked how they arrived at a different number using the same source, the NRSC explained they had only looked at policy votes, excluding nomination votes. Heitkamp voted with Trump on 11 of 34 policy votes, and against Trump on 23 policy votes. That checks out, using the same simple arithmetic FiveThirtyEight used: 67.6, or 68, percent. But that leaves out 26 Cabinet and Supreme Court nomination-related votes. There were 21 votes with Trump, five against; That represents 80 percent agreement with Trump. Is it fair to include only policy votes? FiveThirtyEight didn’t think so. "Our goal is to track how often members vote in support of the president’s agenda, and we believe that including Cabinet-level and Supreme Court nominations is an important aspect of that," said Aaron Bycoffe, the article’s author. "Excluding votes on presidential nominations must be explained and it is not," said Steven Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. "That is misleading, particularly when the source does not separate nominations from legislation and report separate scores. Most standard ‘presidential support’ analyses, including Congressional Quarterly’s studies, which date back to the 1960s, include significant nominations, like Supreme Court nominations and controversial Cabinet nominations." Smith said that Heitkamp had supported the president’s position more than all but one other Democrat who has been in office throughout the term. Jeffrey Bumgarner, Criminal Justice and Political Science department head at the University of North Dakota, said that while the number sums up her legislative disagreement with Trump, favorable nomination votes should count as support for the president's agenda. That’s because "the president has included his judicial and executive branch appointments among his accomplishments (so he sees these votes as important) and, in this hyper-partisan environment, votes for the opposing party's nominees are not a given; hence, it is particularly remarkable when a senator crosses party lines on a vote--even for nominees," Bumgarner said. Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist who specializes in legislative politics, said some voting studies ignore consensus votes, where 98 to 100 senators vote the same way, which may inflate presidential support scores. But that’s not the case here. Matthew Hitt, an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at Colorado State University, said it’s standard for advocacy groups to use a selected subset of key votes, but has a misleading effect here. "Sen. Heitkamp voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch, a signature achievement of President Trump’s first year," Hitt said. "So, excluding that vote from the scoring, as one example, does paint an incomplete and slightly unfairly negative view of her overall support for the key objectives of the Trump administration." Heitkamp was one of three Democrats who voted to confirm Gorsuch. Our ruling A North Dakota NRSC ad said, "Heitkamp has voted against Trump 68 percent of the time." That’s if you’re only looking at policy votes. When Cabinet and Supreme Court nominations are added to the mix, which is how both the source of the NRSC’s claim and traditional legislative trackers score presidential support, Hetikamp supports Trump about half the time. Experts described excluding nominations, like Neil Gorsuch’s, as misleading, as they play a key role in furthering Trump’s legislative agenda. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-09078	"My opponent here has accepted money from Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae (and) hosted subprime mortgage seminars."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/25/jeff-greene/greene-attacks-meek-role-subprime-market-mess/	When the Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate debated June 22, 2010, in West Palm Beach, Jeff Greene didn’t go more than 60 seconds into his opening statement before launching his first attack on Rep. Kendrick Meek. "My opponent here has accepted money from Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, hosted subprime mortgage seminars and failed to regulate the banks, causing the worst housing crisis in our nation’s history and causing Florida to be at the forefront of these foreclosures." Is Greene right about Meek getting money from these two government lenders and putting on seminars on how to get a subprime mortgage? Well, yes and no. Public records show Meek accepted campaign contributions in 2006 and 2008 from the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Political Action Committee, aka Freddie Mac PAC, and Federal National Mortgage Association Political Action Committee, aka Fannie Mae PAC (see here www.opensecrets.org). The Fannie Mae PAC, for example, contributed $2,000 to Meek’s campaign in 2006. The Freddie Mac PAC donated $1,000 in 2006 and 2008. In fact, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac PACs donated to many other candidates in those election years -- Republican and Democrat alike. Altogether, the Fannie Mae PAC shelled out more than $1.45 million in those two election cycles, and Freddie Mac handed out $542,000 more, according to OpenSecrets.org, a website affiliated with Center for Responsive Politics, a research group that tracks money in U.S. politics and elections. So what about the seminars? As the U.S. housing market peaked in mid-2006 and later collapsed -- the Miami-Dade Clerk of Courts registered 64,001 foreclosure filings in 2009, compared to 9,814 in 2006 -- Meek organized a handful of public forums that aimed to secure houses for first-time homeowners (see foreclosure statistics here www.miami-dadeclerk.com/property_mortgage_foreclosures.asp). According to a flier for one March 2007 conference, the event focused on how to steer aspiring buyers to homeownership. Other topics looked at how to repair credit, identify the right mortgage, and budget expenses. Eager to learn more about homeownership opportunities from representatives with different banks and mortgage companies, "hundreds" poured into Florida Memorial University’s Athletic Center in Miami Gardens on March 17, 2007, according to the Miami Times, a family-owned weekly newspaper that serves Miami-Dade’s African-American community. Dubbed the "Ten Weeks to Homeownership Conference," the Meek event brought not only the Miami congressman but other elected officials, including Miami-Dade County Commissioner Barbara Jordan and then-Miami Gardens Vice Mayor Oscar Braynon II, a onetime Meek intern. Also lending their names to the event were the Rotary Club of Opa-locka and the Dade County Alumnae Chapter, Delta Sigma Sorority. The March 2007 event, typical of similar homeowner forums Meek has organized, was held in conjunction with W.O.W. (With Ownership Wealth), a group the Congressional Black Caucus formed in 2001 with the aim of increasing homeownership rates among minorities. On a website for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are listed among the group’s "national sponsors." Calling the sessions "subprime mortgage seminars" is a stretch, we think. The subprime market targeted prospective home owners who had poor credit ratings or limited credit histories. But the forums also covered the areas of credit counseling and financial literacy. Furthermore, these forums are a mainstay in Meek’s district, which is northern Miami-Dade and southern Broward. Well before the subprime market existed, Meek held fairs on homeownership and credit repair. So did his mother, Carrie Meek, during the decade she served in Congress. "All the information you need to buy a home will be available to you at the fair, such as how to get the best financing, how to find a good house to buy, or if you just don't understand the home-buying process and don't want to get ripped off," Meek was quoted as saying in Miami Times. So while it’s true that Meek accepted money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, it’s not fair to call the forums "subprime mortgage seminars." The agenda wasn’t just homeownership. Moreover, these forums have long been the norm in Meek’s district -- regardless of what was happening in the housing market. So we rate Greene’s statement Half True.

pomt-11638	"A case before Washington’s Supreme Court seeks to effectively end public labor unions."	false	/new-york/statements/2018/jan/17/andrew-cuomo/unions-would-suffer-not-end-because-supreme-court-/	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in his State of the State address that a Supreme Court decision could end public labor unions. Cuomo said the case would be a blow to workers in New York state, which is home to the highest percentage of union workers in the country. "A case before Washington’s Supreme Court seeks to effectively end public labor unions," Cuomo said. "We will await the decision in the Janus case, but we must do all in our power to protect collective bargaining, the right to organize, and preserve workers’ rights." Cuomo did not say what actions the state would take to protect unions if the Supreme Court rules against them. The case he referred to will be heard by the court next month and decided later this year. It involves a state employee in Illinois and the union that represents him. Is Cuomo right that the court’s decision on the case would end public labor unions? Details on the case The case involves Mark Janus, an Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services employee, and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees. AFSCME represents workers at the agency where Janus works. He is not a member of the union, but money is still taken out of his paycheck to support it. He believes forcing non-members like him to pay union fees violates their constitutional right to free speech. "I’m forced to pay money to a union that then supports political causes I don’t agree with," Janus said in an interview with Illinois Policy, a conservative think tank. If the court sides with Janus, non-members would no longer have to pay those fees. The decision would only apply to public sector unions. Unions are allowed to charge non-members a fee less than the amount of full dues because of a different Supreme Court decision in 1977. The court ruled in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education that non-members can still be required to make some payments to unions because the union negotiates for all workers, not just those who pay dues. Money from non-members may not be used for any of the union’s political campaigns. AFSCME spends millions of dollars each election cycle supporting Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. The union also lobbies lawmakers on issues it believes important to workers, like paid family leave. Analysis by experts Unions would suffer financially from the decision, but not end altogether, experts said. "No, it doesn't mean the end of unions, and I certainly disagree with the governor about it," said Lee Adler, a senior extension associate at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "It’s a very serious challenge to unions, there’s no question about it." Public unions would have to do the same amount of work with fewer resources. Non-members would no longer have to pay fees, but unions would still have to represent them in contract negotiations and grievances. "Unions are no different than any other organization," said Celine McNicholas, labor counsel at the Economic Policy Institute, an economic research organization. "It’s very difficult for an organization to be required to provide services to people who do not provide payment for those services." That may limit the power of what unions can accomplish, but the decision would not end collective bargaining or worker representation. It would just make those services harder to provide. "There is that core of truth to what Cuomo is saying," said Vin Bonventre, professor of law at Albany Law School. "Claiming that it is going to destroy unions is far too broad a statement." Some states have already passed laws to prevent unions from collecting payments from non-members. Public employees still organize in those states. Florida, for example, has had such a law for more than 70 years, but AFSCME still has more than 60 locals in the state. Our ruling Cuomo said "a case before Washington’s Supreme Court seeks to effectively end public labor unions." The case presents a challenge for public labor unions that have been able to collect revenue from non-members. If the court sides with Janus, non-members of public unions would not have to pay union fees. But his claim that it would end those unions is an exaggeration, experts said. Cuomo's office did not respond to our inquiry about his claim. The statement is not accurate. We rate it False.

pomt-01245	Austin mayoral candidate "Steve Adler admitted his law firm worked with Koch Industries for nearly a decade."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/nov/14/mike-martinez/mike-martinez-says-steve-adler-admitted-his-law-fi/	Austin mayoral hopeful Mike Martinez says his opponent in a December 2014 runoff conceded his law firm helped out Koch Industries, the Kansas-based conglomerate owned by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch whose backing of conservative causes probably doesn’t play well among the city’s preponderance of Democratic voters. Martinez told reporters Nov. 12, 2014: "Last night, Steve Adler admitted his law firm worked with Koch Industries for nearly a decade. But Steve Adler still hasn’t come clean about what work his law firm did for the Koch Brothers, and how much money they made from it." By email, Martinez campaign spokesman Nick Hudson said Martinez was referring to Adler telling KVUE-TV, Channel 24 in Austin, for a news story aired Nov. 11, 2014: "My understanding from talking to my law partner is that back in the ‘70s and into the ‘80s, he did some work advising Koch on some cases; I was not involved in any of those." Martinez told KVUE: "If his law firm benefited from working with the Koch brothers, then he benefited from working with the Koch brothers." Web pages There’s no Koch mention on the website for Barron & Adler LLP, where Adler is described as a co-founding partner. The firm, which focuses on eminent domain and condemnation issues, came to be in 1983, which would have been the year after Adler graduated from law school. Martinez pointed out a description of Adler’s firm that listed Koch Industries among the firm’s "representative clients" until it was amended shortly before the Nov. 4, 2014, election that launched Adler and Martinez toward their runoff. Martinez said his campaign’s copy of the FindLaw.com entry listing Koch Industries was downloaded in October 2014. We spotted a similar Koch notation in a FindLaw.com web page for Adler’s firm downloaded by the online Wayback Machine in December 2003. Aside from Koch Industries, proclaimed clients at the time included: May Department Stores, Inc.; McDonald's Corp.; Nations Bank; Sears, Roebuck & Co.; Southland Corp.; Trammell Crow, and Weingarten Realty Investors. And separately at our request, researchers at the Texas State Law Library checked legal directories from the 1980s and emailed us a 1989 Martindale-Hubble Law Directory entry listing Koch Industries among a dozen representative clients of the Austin law firm Barron, Graham & Adler. So, Adler’s firm previously wanted it known it did work for Koch Industries. Attorney interviews Seeking detail about the firm’s Koch work, we spoke by phone with Adler; attorney Mike Barron, described like Adler as a founding partner of the firm; and lawyer/mediator Sam Graham, formerly with the firm. Adler reaffirmed he personally never worked with a Koch company, though he said he believes Barron and possibly another lawyer helped a Koch entity in the 1970s and, he thinks, early-to-mid 1980s. Adler said that after he graduated from law school, he worked for another firm for a year and then did work for the firm which he joined in 1984 or 1985. Generally, Adler told us, his understanding is Koch was asking for the firm’s advice on acquiring pipeline easements in Texas off and on over about a decade. Barron and Graham said in separate interviews Koch enlisted the firm for a spell in the mid-1980s because it wanted to build a private pipeline to carry jet fuel from the Gulf coast near Corpus Christi to San Antonio, Austin, Waco and Dallas/Fort Worth. Koch, Barron said, "hired us to shepherd them through" buying rights-of-way from landowners along the desired route. Graham said the firm also was committed to filing eminent-domain lawsuits for Koch if needed to access the desired land. But, Graham said, Koch succeeded in negotiating the rights-of-way without having to go to court. Barron said Koch paid the firm a retainer of about $2,500 or $5,000 and the firm billed monthly against the retainer for its services. He said its advisory work started in 1984 and ended in 1985 or started in 1985 and ended in 1986. Graham said the firm probably made less than $10,000 from the work, which he said took place in 1985 or 1987. Adler might not have been employed by the firm when the Koch work started, Barron and Graham each said, and he was not involved in the Koch work. "Steve never touched the file," which no longer exists, Barron said. "I did it all." Koch spokesman singles out Barron To our queries, a Washington, D.C.-based Koch spokesman, Rob Tappan, said by email Barron was the only person at the firm that Koch worked with as it acquired the rights-of-way. Tappan said the pipeline, built in the late 1980s, carries gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from Corpus Christi to the Dallas/Fort Worth area with terminals in San Antonio, Austin and Waco. Our ruling Martinez said Adler admitted his law firm worked with Koch Industries for nearly a decade. We’re not judging here whether the firm’s work means anything about Adler vis a vis the Koch brothers and their views. But Adler did say his firm did work for Koch for a number of years, though other lawyers and Koch say the advisory work occurred over a few years. Also, like Adler, they say Adler had no role. We rate Martinez's claim -- which relies on Adler perhaps overstating the Koch activities -- Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-06525	"We have the highest corporate tax rate in the world. It’s 35 percent."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/09/jim-sensenbrenner/gop-rep-jim-sensenbrenner-says-us-has-highest-corp/	With unemployment remaining stubbornly high, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., was asked what the federal government could do to create jobs. The suburban Milwaukee congressman, who was first elected to the House in 1979, didn’t hesitate in replying. "We’ve got to address the fact that we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world," Sensenbrenner told the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Sept. 29, 2011. "It’s 35 percent." Sensenbrenner argued that if corporate taxes in the U.S. were lower than they are in other parts of the world, more U.S.-based multinational companies would "repatriate" their profits back to America, creating more jobs here. It’s Sensenbrenner’s opinion that lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate would create jobs. We can’t check an opinion. But we can check whether the rate is 35 percent and if it is the highest in the world. Sensenbrenner’s district director, Loni Hagerup, pointed to a 2011 report from the Organization for Economic Corporation and Development, a Paris-based group of 34 large, industrialized democracies. The widely quoted report says the U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent, tops among the member countries. Next in line were France and Belgium (both 34 percent), and then Australia, Japan, Spain and Mexico (each 30 percent). Seems pretty straightforward. Sensenbrenner is right, right? Let’s first look at two points: 1. "Combined" corporate tax rate Some analysts, when comparing countries, use the Paris group’s report but cite a different figure -- the combined corporate tax rate, rather than merely the corporate tax rate. The combined rate includes not only federal but also state tax rates for corporations. The combined corporate tax rate in the U.S. is 39.2 percent, which ranks second behind Japan’s 39.5 percent. But Sensenbrenner was asked what the federal government could do to create jobs, so the corporate tax rate -- not the combined rate -- is relevant here. 2. Limitations of the corporate rate We consulted experts at two Washington, D.C. research organizations -- Tax Foundation president Scott Hodge and Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. Both said Sensenbrenner is correct in stating that the U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent and that the rate is the highest in the world, but they added some context to the discussion. Williams said the corporate tax rate "is not a good measure of the taxes that corporations actually pay." While some corporations might pay the full 35 percent rate, many pay considerably less, depending on the types of investments they make, depreciation they take and other factors that reduce taxable income, he said. Hodge agreed. He added, however, that the "effective" federal tax rate (after deductions) that corporations pay is about 26 percent -- and that also is among the highest rates of all industrialized nations. Our conclusion Asked what the federal government could do to create jobs, Sensenbrenner said lower the "corporate tax rate," which he said was 35 percent and the highest in the world. A widely quoted annual report says the U.S. corporate tax rate is 35 percent and is highest among 34 large, industrialized countries. Two experts agreed with the rate and the ranking.

pomt-07532	Three courts have found the new health care law constitutional and two have found it unconstitutional.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/apr/06/james-roosevelt/tufts-health-plan-ceo-says-judges-have-split-3-2-c/	While Republicans have been trying to repeal last year's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in Congress, critics have challenged the new health care law in court, mostly asserting that the provision that requires individuals to buy health insurance or pay a penalty is unconstitutional. According to The Heritage Foundation, 27 states have sued or are planning to sue to block the law. On the WPRI interview program Newsmakers, aired April 3 and taped April 1, James Roosevelt Jr., chief executive officer of Tufts Health Plan, who is helping Rhode Island prepare for implementation of the law, was asked whether the effort should be delayed until the law's constitutionality has been resolved. "Two courts have found it's unconstitutional to have the individual mandate, the one that makes people take personal responsibility to have insurance. Three courts have found that it is constitutional," said Roosevelt. "It will also go through three different courts of appeal. So the Supreme Court will get it with different points of view. I think that preparing for the bill is really important." We were curious whether Roosevelt's scorecard was correct, especially in light of assertions of some critics that the law is unconstitutional based on a ruling in Florida. PolitiFact National last looked at the issue on Feb. 6 after President Obama, in an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, was asked about the Florida decision. Obama said 12 judges had rejected "the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional." PolitiFact ruled that Mr. Obama's statement was False. Although a dozen court cases had been dismissed for procedural reasons, two federal judges -- both appointed by Democrats -- had ruled that the individual mandate was legal and two others -- both appointed by Republicans -- had ruled that the mandate was unconstitutional. When a check of the White House's health care blog turned up no reference to a fifth case, Roosevelt's office called our attention to Margaret Peggy Lee Mead et al. versus Eric H. Holder Jr. et al, which was decided in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Feb. 22. The five plaintiffs argued that the requirement to buy insurance required them to purchase something they would never use. Three had also objected to the mandate on religious grounds, saying that God would provide for them. Two objected because the health plan would not cover their holistic treatments. Judge Gladys Kessler, a Clinton appointee, upheld the law after ruling that Congress has clear authority under the federal Commerce Clause to regulate insurance markets. In her ruling, she declared that most of the millions of Americans without health insurance "consume medical services they cannot pay for," and "those who choose not to purchase health insurance will ultimately get a 'free ride' on the backs of those Americans who have made responsible choices to provide for the illness we all must face at some point in our lives." The new law, she said, was a constitutionally acceptable way to stabilize the price of health insurance. Kessler, in granting the government's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, rejected the religious arguments, saying the purchase requirement would be an insignificant affront to their religious beliefs. So the score is three rulings upholding the law, two finding it unconstitutional. For now. We rate Roosevelt's claim True.	None	James Roosevelt	None	None	None	2011-04-06T00:01:00	2011-04-01	['None']

pomt-09549	Uses headlines to portray Gov. Rick Perry as beholden to special interests.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/04/kay-bailey-hutchison/kay-bailey-hutchison-ad-pours-out-headlnes-casting/	U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, seeking the Republican nomination for governor, unleashed a TV commercial Feb. 4 casting Gov. Rick Perry as beholden to special interests and lobbyists, including two who served as his top gubernatorial assistants. The ad flashes what look like seven ominous newspaper headlines about Perry before a narrator says: "There are two ways to get things done in Austin. Hire a lobbyist and donate to this governor. Or elect a new one." We wondered if Hutchison’s "New One" ad accurately reflected original headlines and news stories. (For this Truth-O-Meter item, we are focusing on Hutchison's use of the headlines — a common campaign technique. We are not assessing the accuracy of those articles or her overall Perry critique.) Hutchison spokesman Joe Pounder initially said every headline in the ad matched original published headlines. He later said the ad presents "pull quotes," meaning excerpts from articles and not necessarily the original headlines. Using Nexis, an electronic news retrieval service, we found that four of the quotations presented in Hutchison’s ad were identical to published headlines on news stories. Hutchison’s campaign showed that a fifth also was correct. The correctly quoted headlines are: "Perry to Name Lobbyist As New Chief of Staff;" "Lobbyists Revolving In, Out of Perry Staff Positions;" "Perry Shakes Down Special Interests, Lobbyists;" "Companies That Gave to Perry Got Road Contract;" and "Perry’s Top Donors Get Business." We noticed, though, that the headline about Perry shaking down special interests topped an editorial—not a news story—published in The Houston Chronicle about Perry in July 2000. At the time, Perry was lieutenant governor. He succeeded George W. Bush as governor in late 2000. The Chronicle editorial questioned a Perry letter asking lobbyists to buy $1,000 tickets to an upcoming political fund-raiser. Perry, the newspaper opined, "has just made it abundantly clear that he knows no bounds when it comes to shaking down special interests with business before the Texas Legislature." According to the editorial, Perry's letter asked lobbyists to specify how much money each of their corporate and group clients would be sending the lieutenant governor's way—potentially fostering illegal corporate donations or encouraging lobbyists to see links between donations and state business, the newspaper said. "With his latest fund-raising letter holding legislative lobbyists responsible for money contributed by their clients, Perry explicitly links campaign money to business before the Legislature," the editorial states. Two of the headline-like quotations in Hutchison’s ad were not previously published headlines on news articles: "Perry’s Former Chief of Staff is A Lobbyist for Merck" and "A Shroud of Secrecy Has Descended on the Governor’s Office." (The published headlines for those articles: "Reluctant governor yields on HPV shots; Calling a veto useless, Perry chides legislators for reversing his vaccination order" and "Perry refusal to release memo nothing new, He cites attorney-client privilege, this time in the execution controversy.") We confirmed, though, that the two quotations presented to look like headlines accurately reflected portions of the related news articles. It’s not unusual for campaign ads to present excerpts from newspaper stories as a stream of headlines. It’s also not rare for a candidate to quote an editorial as news reportage, even though editorials are opinion pieces. Still, a voter could conclude that Hutchison’s ad consists entirely of genuine clear-cut news headlines. That’s not so. We give her use of the headlines a rating of Mostly True.

pomt-10073	Bush's tax cuts for high earners "have been the biggest contributor to the budget deficit."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/16/nancy-pelosi/tax-cuts-rich-deficit/	At a news conference on Jan. 8, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was asked about the U.S. budget deficit. The reporter noted that the Congressional Budget Office projected a relatively small deficit in 2012 if the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire at the end of 2010 and tax rates go back to what they were during the Clinton administration. "You face a major decision next year on tax rates, since the rates do expire at the end of 2010," the reporter said. "Isn't it inevitable that many taxpayers will face a significant tax increase in 2011?" "Let me just say that the tax cuts at the high end that you were referencing have been the biggest contributor to the budget deficit," Pelosi said. "Don't take my word for it, that's the word of the Congressional Budget Office when the Republicans had control of the Congress." She continued, "Put me down as clearly as you possibly can as one who wants to have those tax cuts for the wealthiest in America repealed," adding that it should happen "as soon as possible." She cited the same cutoff point that Barack Obama used during the campaign: Taxes should go up for people making about $250,000 or more. Pelosi was clear about her position, but we wondered about her assertion that the Bush tax cuts "at the high end" were indeed "the biggest contributor to the budget deficit." When we started this item, we thought it would be relatively straightforward. How wrong we were. We should start off with the easy stuff: First, there is no CBO report that says tax cuts for the wealthiest are the biggest contributor to the deficit. We asked Speaker Pelosi's office about her statement, and they pointed us to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "Congressional Budget Office data show that the tax cuts have been the single largest contributor to the re-emergence of substantial budget deficits in recent years," said the center's analysis. It also created a handy pie chart that shows tax cuts are responsible for 48 percent of the costs of new legislation between 2001 and 2007. This is second to military spending, the Iraq war and homeland security spending, which together contributed to 35 percent of legislative costs. But that didn't satisfy us, because that 48 percent number included all tax cuts, not just for the wealthy. It also shows only the costs of new legislation, not the overall deficit. So we went asking around: For what part of the deficit are tax cuts at the "high end" responsible? "The real problem is that the deficit is a composite of revenues and spending. You can't say where we would be if we hadn't had any part of that," said Bob Williams, the principal research associate of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. (He also worked for the Congressional Budget Office from 1984 to 2006.) Having said that, Williams said it's very unlikely that overall tax cuts for the wealthy outpaced the tax cuts for everybody else. So what is "the high end"? During the campaign, Barack Obama called for repealing the tax cuts on singles making $200,000 or more and couples making $250,000 or more. This is roughly the top 3 percent of taxpayers. The Tax Policy Center analyzed that plan and found that if Obama raised the rates on that group, it would generate roughly $350 billion over 10 years. Conversely, leaving in place the Bush tax cuts for everyone else would come to $850 billion over 10 years. Another way to look at it: The Tax Policy Center calculated what share of the federal tax changes each income bracket gained from the Bush tax cuts. The top 5 percent of earners (those making about $225,000 or more) received 30.5 percent of the tax benefits in 2008, according to their analysis. But conversely, the bottom 95 percent of tax payers got 70 percent. Zoom out from the top 5 percent to the top 20 percent, and their share is 47.8 percent. Critics of the Bush tax cuts can call that disproportionate, but it's still less than half and therefore not "the biggest." All of this indicates that Pelosi is mistaken. Although the wealthy did get big benefits from the Bush tax cuts, their benefits did not outweigh those of everyone else put together. Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan nonprofit group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said there are three major contributors to the worsening budget picture presented by the Congressional Budget Office: tax cuts, the Iraq war and the economic downturn. "Within the tax cuts, the largest numbers went to the middle class, and those are the tax cuts that are most likely to be extended," she said. "I don't see how you could read the numbers to say otherwise." Certainly tax cuts for high earners have increased the deficit. Pelosi might have made a more convincing case if she had said high earners received a disproportionate benefit from the Bush tax cuts. But Pelosi said tax cuts for "the high end" were the "biggest" contributor to the federal deficit. We looked at the numbers from a bunch of different angles and found no evidence that tax cuts for the wealthy are larger than those of everyone else combined. In fact, all the numbers we looked at showed that tax cuts for middle and lower incomes represent a bigger slice of the overall revenue pie. We think that evidence directly contradicts her, so we rate her statement False.	None	Nancy Pelosi	None	None	None	2009-01-16T12:21:54	2009-01-08	['None']

Key funds for Social Security are likely to be depleted by 2034, according to a June 2016 report, and Medicare’s hospital insurance trust fund may be insolvent by 2028. President-Elect Donald Trump has repeatedly said he would "save" Social Security, a program that will provide $900 billion in benefits to more than 60 million people in 2016 alone. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress — notably House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Janesville) — have their own plans, which could largely privatize Medicare. In light of those challenges and policy differences, we returned to a statement about Social Security that struck us during the 2016 election. It’s from Russ Feingold, who said in an October television interview during his U.S. Senate race that the idea for Social Security "was basically invented up on Bascom Hill, my alma mater here; that's where Franklin Roosevelt got the idea." Is Feingold correct? Social Security’s history When we asked Feingold spokesman Josh Orton for backup, he pointed to several Wisconsinites and people tied to the University of Wisconsin-Madison — where Feingold graduated in 1975 — who were influential in developing Social Security. Among them: Edwin Witte, a graduate of UW-Madison and economics professor there from 1933-1957. Roosevelt appointed Witte chairman of the Presidential Committee on Economic Security, which essentially crafted the plan for Social Security in 1935. Arthur Altmeyer, a UW-Madison graduate and professor who also sat on the committee. Altmeyer later served on the federal Social Security Board and was the first Social Security commissioner. Roosevelt called Altmeyer "Mr. Social Security," according to the Social Security Administration. UW-Madison professor John Commons, under whom Witte and Altmeyer studied. Commons was a labor economist at UW from 1904-1933 where he helped develop the state’s employee compensation program and civil service law. He was known as the "spiritual father of Social Security," according to the Wisconsin Historical Society. Wilbur Cohen, who served as a research assistant to Witte after graduating from UW-Madison in 1934. Cohen sat on the Committee on Public Administration of the Social Science Research Council and also advised the Social Security Board. Current UW-Madison professor Pamela Herd agreed that Wisconsinites tied to the university were key figures in the development of Social Security. "There were a lot of people involved in the creation of this program, but some of the most important players were from Wisconsin," said Herd, an expert on Social Security. Our rating Feingold said that the idea for Social Security "was basically invented up on Bascom Hill, my alma mater here; that's where Franklin Roosevelt got the idea." Historical accounts show, and an expert agrees, that officials who helped propose and initially operate Social Security had deep ties to UW-Madison.

pomt-08296	Says that under Gov. Rick Perry, Texas Department of Public Safety troopers have had "standing orders" not to inquire into the immigration status of people unless they're under arrest.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/nov/01/bill-white/bill-white-says-under-rick-perry-state-troopers-ha/	Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White recently tromped into touchy territory -- whether state law officers enforce federal immigration law. White, interviewed Oct. 15 by the Texas Tribune's Evan Smith, started down that road by saying Houston, where he was mayor, is not a "sanctuary city." The term "sanctuary city" is rooted in the 1980s when some American churches provided sanctuary to thousands of unauthorized Central American migrants fleeing civil war in their homelands. In a March article, we rated False a statement by the then-chairwoman of the Republican Party of Texas that as mayor, White "offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants." A congressional report once listed Houston among localities with sanctuary policies, but the only overt action on White's watch was the decision, at the end of his six years in office, to join the Secure Communities program -- a federal initiative intended to make it harder, not easier, for illegal immigrants to remain in this country. In the Tribune interview, White said: "You don't have sanctuary cities by and large in the state of Texas — that's a myth, a complete myth and fabrication. We arrest people every day. (The Houston Police Department) arrests people every week who are non-citizens who commit crimes. The (Texas) Department of Public Safety, under Rick Perry, for the last 9-and-a-half years, has had standing orders that it would not do routine civil immigration work — would not inquire about immigration status for people unless they arrested people for crimes." We wondered if White's right that state troopers have standing orders not to ask anyone's immigration status unless they're under arrest. We asked White's campaign for back-up. In an e-mail, spokeswoman Katy Bacon stressed a May 2010 Tribune article and what the publication described as a relevant state document, "Enforcement of Federal Immigration Statutes." That document opens with a 1978 policy statement by then-U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell, suggesting that local police forces "do not stop and question, detain, arrest, or place 'an immigration hold' on any persons not suspected of crimes, solely on the grounds that they may be deportable aliens." The document says, in part: "As enforcement of U.S. immigration law is not the primary responsibility of the (DPS), the following policy is adopted to guide department members." It goes on: "Members of this department will not engage in the enforcement of federal Immigration statutes by conducting road checks or business and residence searches unless assisting appropriate federal officers who have properly requested such assistance." The next section states: "Members may arrest aliens under the following situations: 1. When serving a valid warrant after checking to see that the warrant is current. 2. For violation of state laws the same as any U. S. citizen." The next section states: "Members will not arrest without a warrant an alien solely on the suspicion that he has entered the country illegally." Next, we asked DPS to confirm the authenticity of the policy. In the meantime, we found similar text posted online by the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission in 2008. On what looks like two web pages from the DPS's internal website, guidance identical to what the Tribune published is presented under: "General Manual, Chapter 5." In addition, we found a "statewide agreement" on the Sunset site prefaced by an April 1, 1990, interoffice memo from Joe E. Milner, then the agency's director, stating that a lawsuit against DPS regarding arrests of illegal aliens "has been settled. As part of that settlement, we are to provide all commissioned officers of the department with this attached statewide agreement, which enunciates our agreement and policy with regard to· the handling of illegal aliens." Dated February 1990, the 16-point agreement says DPS shall not enforce federal civil statutes and regulations regarding immigration or question any person, including those stopped on traffic or criminal charges, "about their right to be in or to remain in the United States" or "about their nationality, national origin or place of birth for the purpose of enforcing the civil immigration laws." Talk about clear-cut orders! We wanted DPS's perspective on the document, in part because it appears to be more than 20 years old. What did it settle? Does it still apply? DPS spokesman Tom Vinger declined to comment on this front. Earlier, he said the policy published by the Tribune is "outdated." His e-mail continues: "All of our law enforcement policies are undergoing legal and best practices review, and will be updated as needed." We didn't land any document from DPS spelling out its policy. Instead, Vinger quoted DPS Director Steve McCraw saying that under DPS's "operational policy," if an officer has "reasonable suspicion that a person is in violation of a federal immigration law the department will refer that person" to the U.S. Border Patrol or the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement "for immediate action." "Can DPS troopers ask someone if they are here illegally when they pull someone over?" McCraw said via Vinger. "A trooper does not ask someone whether they are here legally or illegally when they are stopped; however, once a trooper has a reasonable suspicion that a federal violation has occurred, including immigration, the appropriate federal agency is contacted immediately to take appropriate action." How long has this "operational" policy been in place? "Several years," said Vinger. "I don’t have a specific time frame." To recap, White didn't show us evidence of so-called standing orders forbidding officers to ask into anyone's immigration status unless they're under arrest. And DPS didn't cough up a document spelling out a different policy. However, the agency does say its officers do not ask into the legality of anyone's presence here. That seems to hint at standing orders. Without those orders in hand, though, we rate White's statement Half True.

pomt-11478	"Legendary actor Kirk Douglas dead, 4 days before his 101st birthday."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/05/your-action-news-3/fake-news-circulates-death-hoax-about-kirk-douglas/	A death hoax has been circulating for months that actor Kirk Douglas died. "Legendary actor Kirk Douglas dead, 4 days before his 101st birthday," stated a headline by Your Action News 3 which has circulated since December. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that the famous movie star had died. The fake story said that Douglas died of natural causes and that his family released a statement saying he "went comfortably and was in no pain" and "lived a long and prosperous life that people only dream of." In 2014, People magazine accidentally published the actor’s obituary on its website. "DO NOT PUB Kirk Douglas Dies" the headline read. The magazine removed the obit from it's website after reports about the premature obit circulated on social media. Many news organizations pre-write obits of famous people. We searched for mainstream news reports about Douglas and found no reports that he had died. When Douglas turned 101 in December, the Daily Gazette in Schenectady, N.Y., where the actor’s sister lives quoted the actor’s niece Marilyn Gordon. "Uncle Kirk is doing great," Gordon said. "They're going to have a big party for him (Saturday)." Douglas survived a helicopter crash in 1991 and a stroke in 1996. "I never, ever thought I would live to be 100. That’s shocked me, really. And it’s sad, too," he said in a 2017 interview. We sent an email to Your Action News 3 and did not get a reply. Our fact-checking friends at Snopes have debunked other death hoaxes by the same website about Morgan Freeman, Bob Barker, and George Zimmerman. Douglas is still alive, despite a fake story that said he was dead. We rate this story Pants on Fire.

pomt-10604	Obama "remains silent" and "is never asked how he feels about his church honoring Farrakhan."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/23/chain-email/obama-decried-farrakhans-racism/	An attack e-mail says the church Barack Obama attends, Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, gave a lifetime award to Louis Farrakhan, and that Obama "remained silent" and wasn't even asked about. We checked out the award claim and found it to be Mostly True. A magazine closely related to the church gave Farrakhan an award for lifetime achievement. For more on this, see the statement here . But Barack Obama definitely did not remain silent about it. The award received widespread attention after Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen wrote about it on Jan. 15, 2008. Later that day, the campaign released a statement in which Obama himself said: "I decry racism and anti-Semitism in every form and strongly condemn the anti-Semitic statements made by Minister Farrakhan. I assume that Trumpet Magazine made its own decision to honor Farrakhan based on his efforts to rehabilitate ex-offenders, but it is not a decision with which I agree." Cohen said in his column that he had asked the campaign about the award and received a response from a spokesperson saying Obama did not agree with the award. The blog "Talking Points Memo" said it too asked Obama about Farrakhan and received the statement from Obama rejecting the award. After the statement was released, it was reported in other news outlets as well. For these reasons, we find the e-mail's claims about Obama's response to the award to be False. UPDATE: Barack Obama resigned from Trinity United Church of Christ on May 31, 2008, after church pastor Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. made controversial remarks about U.S. foreign policy and other matters. Obama said he intends to join another church after the election.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-01-23T00:00:00	2008-01-18	['Barack_Obama', 'Louis_Farrakhan']
pomt-01941	"The United States is the only developed country in the world without paid maternity leave."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-differs-developed-world-paid-/	President Barack Obama convened the first Working Families Summit in Washington this week to unite his administration, labor organizations and progressive groups around his domestic agenda. Ahead of the conference (and a visit to Chipotle), Obama published an op-ed in the Huffington Post on June 23, 2014, to make a push for what he called "family-friendly workplace policies." Among the issues he hopes to pursue is a paid maternity leave for mothers. In his piece, Obama claimed, "The United States is the only developed country in the world without paid maternity leave." That’s quite the statement. But is it true? The Family Medical Leave Act requires employers with 50 or more workers to allow parents 12 weeks of job-protected leave annually to care for a newborn. While this means those individuals can take the time off without fear of losing their job, in most cases the leave is unpaid. Three states — California, New Jersey and Rhode Island — offer paid family leave through employee-paid payroll taxes. And some employers offer the perk even though it’s not required. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 12 percent of private industry workers had access to some kind of paid family leave. How does that compare to the rest of the world? We asked the White House for the source of Obama’s claim. They pointed us to a report by the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations. The report looked at 170 countries where maternity benefit information was available. It found that only two don’t provide some kind of cash benefit to women during maternity leave: Papua New Guinea and the United States. That seems pretty convincing in its own right, but as the report notes, not all benefits are equal. Some countries cap the payments at low levels or exclude large portions of the population from eligibility. Obama specified in his statement that he was comparing the United States to developed countries, so that’s what we’ll focus on. For its part, the report labeled 41 countries and territories "developed economies." It’s pretty clear that the United States provides the fewest benefits to the smallest percentage of its people. Of the developed countries, not only is it the only one that does not offer or require paid maternity leave, it is also mandates the shortest period of time off. The United Kingdom and Australia provide the most time off, with both countries allowing a full year of leave, though not all of it is paid. At 13 weeks of maternity leave (all paid), Iceland has the second shortest leave, behind the U.S. at 12 weeks. The International Labor Organization also categorizes each country by what percentage of the population actually receives cash benefits for maternity leave. Of the developed countries, the United States is in the bracket with the smallest percentages, with an estimated 10 to 32 percent of the population eligible for paid leave. No other developed country is below 33 percent. Of the 41 developed countries, 17 provide paid time off for between 90 and 100 percent of their populations, including many Western European countries like Sweden, Switzerland and the U.K., but also Estonia and Czech Republic. But some countries exclude certain portions of their populations from eligibility, making it far from a universal benefit. Temporary workers do not receive cash benefits in Canada, home workers don’t receive maternity leave in Norway and Switzerland, and some civil servants don’t get any in Japan. Canada also excludes migrant workers and individuals that own more than 40 percent of their business, and it requires women to have at least 600 hours of insurable employment to be eligible. The result is that in some countries, large portions of the population don’t end up actually being covered. In Spain and Japan, between 33 and 65 percent of workers are covered, the fewest other than the United States. The International Labor Organization also sets a standard for what countries should provide in a benefits package: 1) women should receive at least 14 weeks off; 2) they should be reimbursed at least two-thirds of their previous earnings and 3) the benefit should be paid almost entirely by the state through public funds or social security. The United States is the only developed country to meet none of the benchmarks (and one of just 14 studied worldwide). But six other countries fall short of at least one goal. Canada — Provides payments less than two-thirds of woman’s previous earnings (55 percent) Denmark — Doesn’t pay for benefit entirely through public funds (mix of public and employer contribution) Germany — Doesn’t pay for benefit entirely through public funds (mix of public and employer contribution) Iceland — Maternity leave is less than 14 weeks (13 weeks) Malta — Doesn’t pay for benefit entirely through public funds (mix of public and employer contribution) Slovakia — Provides payments less than two-thirds of woman’s previous earnings (65 percent i.e. very, very close) Our ruling Obama said, "The United States is the only developed country in the world without paid maternity leave." The United States does not mandate cash benefits for workers on maternity leave at the federal level, and just a small fraction of its citizens live in states that require it or work for companies that provide it. In that regard, the United States is very different than the rest of the developed world, where at least some paid benefits exist in every country. It's worth noting, however, that paid maternity leave is far from a universal benefit in many developed countries. In some, as many as one-third of workers aren't actually covered for cash benefits, and six countries don't meet all of the International Labor Organizations guidelines for providing benefits.

pomt-09009	The state Legislature attempted to "outlaw stem cell research, passes bills about microchips in the brain, and talks about seceding from the Union."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/11/roy-barnes/former-governor-roy-barnes-said-georgia-passed-lau/	Georgians, the rest of the country is laughing at you, former Gov. Roy Barnes says. And that means corporations are reluctant to relocate here and give you jobs. It's because your state Legislature has done some wacky things, according to the Democrat's latest campaign commercial, "Travel for Jobs." In this bid to win his old job back, Barnes took us on a trip down memory lane to recall some of the Legislature's stranger moments. "[I]t's hard for industry to take us seriously when the Legislature attempts to outlaw stem cell research, passes bills about microchips in the brain and talks about seceding from the union," an announcer said in the ad. Wait. Microchips? In the brain? And secession? Recently? The Barnes campaign sent us information on all three legislative attempts. All passed the Senate, then withered in the House. On stem cell research: The campaign cited 2009's Senate Bill 169, the Ethical Treatment of Human Embryos Act, sponsored by state Sen. Ralph Hudgens of Hull. Typically, when people discuss the stem cell research controversy, they're talking about "embryonic" stem cell research, which can destroy the embryo. This poses ethical problems for people who regard a human embryo as a human life. The legislation stated that the creation of all embryos "shall be solely for the purposes of initiating a human pregnancy." This means it would have barred scientists from creating human embryos for research. The bill does not ban embryonic stem cell research involving already-existing stem cell lines or lines from out of state. This was by design, Hudgens told PolitiFact Georgia. It passed the state Senate March 12, 2009. So state legislators did try to "outlaw" an important element of embryonic stem cell research, but not all of it. On microchips in the brain: Barnes cited SB 235, the Microchip Consent Act of 2010, sponsored by state Sen. Chip Pearson, a Republican from Dawsonville. It would have made it a misdemeanor to require a person to be implanted with the device beneath or in the skin. This includes the brain. Proponents had no evidence of large-scale abuses of the technology. "This is proactive," state Rep. Ed Setzler, who pushed the bill in the House, said at the time. It passed the Senate on Feb. 4. Therefore, while the state Senate did not pass "bills" on "microchips in the brain," it did pass one of them. And that one only cleared one chamber of the Legislature. On seceding from the Union: The Barnes camp pointed PolitiFact Georgia to Senate Resolution 632, which was also sponsored by Pearson. He could not be reached to clarify the bill's intent, so we analyzed the language ourselves and read an op-ed he wrote that was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The six-page resolution does not specifically mention "secession," but it does lay out how and when states would do it. If the federal government creates laws that states think overstep its constitutional authority, they can "nullify" those laws, or declare them void. Here's where the possibility of secession comes into play. The bill lists six types of laws that, if enacted, would prompt the dissolution of the United States. Some, such as the declaration of martial law, are remote possibilities. Others are not, such as laws that limit the right to bear arms, "including prohibitions of type or quantity of arms or ammunition." If such laws are passed, the federal government's powers would revert to the states, according to the resolution. States that want to form a new United States can do so. The rest can go off on their own. The resolution passed the state Senate April 1, 2009. In Pearson's op-ed, he disagreed with critics who said that the bill "will likely lead Georgia to secede from and disband the United States." It is an "extreme view" and "loose interpretation of the measure's language." That may be true, but whether the bill makes secession "likely" is a separate issue. The bill opens the door to it. Or as Barnes' commercial said, it "talks about seceding from the Union." We find that Barnes' ad is not entirely correct but does say many accurate things. Georgia's state Senate did try to outlaw types of embryonic stem cell research, though not all of it, as the ad suggests. It passed a law -- not "laws" -- on "microchips in the brain." And while a bill didn't use the word "secession," it raised the possibility and outlined what would trigger it. Barnes earns a Mostly True.

pomt-08348	"Many of the companies bankrolling the ad campaign against Amendment 4 are recipients of a congressional bailout, in the form of humongous tax refunds earlier this year."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/27/chain-email/chain-e-mail-attacks-vote-no-4-backers-bulked-bail/	Fact-checking chain e-mails doesn’t often carry twists like a Carl Hiaasen novel. You could say PolitiFact Florida just got lucky. We recently got our hands on an anonymous chain letter that landed in the in-box of Bill Adair, editor of PolitiFact and Washington bureau chief for the St. Petersburg Times. It delved into the often dense worlds of campaign finance, congressional bailouts and tax policy — then beseeched voters to visit the campaign website of Florida Hometown Democracy. That’s one of two of main political action committees wielding millions of dollars in their battle over Amendment 4, a Florida constitutional proposal on the Nov. 2, 2010, ballot that would put certain land use decisions directly before voters. Most of those millions — $10.5 million, in fact — have been raised by the main "Vote No on 4" effort. This e-mail purported to lift the veil on just whose cash had been flowing to "Vote No on 4." The biggest donor, it said, was the Florida Association of Realtors, followed by big home builders. Then came this claim, in all its bolded and underlined glory: "Here’s the killer: Many of the companies bankrolling the ad campaign against Amendment 4 are recipients of a congressional bailout, in the form of humongous tax refunds earlier this year." It later added: "So, when you see all those dire-sounding, fright-filled TV commercials, remember whose paying for them. You are." E-mail forwards are a notoriously unreliable form of campaign rhetoric, so with a big choice looming Nov. 2, we decided to run the "humongous tax refunds" claim through the Truth-O-Meter. First we were curious about the source of the e-mail, since we want to give the person behind a claim the chance to support it. We asked Wayne Garcia, communications director for Florida Hometown Democracy, if it originated with the campaign. It wasn’t a campaign e-mail, he said — he’d never seen it before. However, the idea was nothing new, and he pointed us to some evidence. The Hometown Democracy campaign made similar claims in a news release on Aug. 12, 2010. It listed major "Vote No on 4" campaign contributors such as Pulte Homes, Lennar Homes and KB Home that it said benefited from "billions in federal bailout money." Garcia also pointed us to news articles by the New York Times, Reuters and Builder Magazine that explained the tax refunds. We got to work with a few key questions: Did companies actually get a "bailout" in the form of "humongous tax refunds"? And did evidence about a handful of home builders support the claim that "many of the companies" behind "Vote No on 4" got a bailout? A bailout by any other name First, the bailout question. Any "rescue from financial distress" qualifies as a bailout to us. And last year, the National Association of Home Builders did indeed lobby Congress for — and win — a change in tax law that it argued was a "critical stimulus measure for the U.S. economy" that would provide "an infusion of monetary resources for firms struggling to retain workers and undertake economic activity." Technically — skip forward a few sentences if this word makes your eyes glaze over — it supported an expansion of the net operating loss carryback period, allowing businesses with losses to carry back deductions for five years instead of just two. As a National Association of Home Builders report explained, "The carryback option allows businesses to offset prior taxes paid, thereby generating tax refunds to finance ongoing expenses." A two-year carryback was simply too short for builders, it argued, since many had suffered since late 2005. In a two-year period, it claimed, there wouldn’t necessarily be enough taxable income to offset builders’ financial trauma. Small businesses had scored this benefit in the stimulus bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. But big companies wanted to get in the game. The home builders’ association projected the change was potentially worth billions. President Barack Obama handed it to them Nov. 6, 2009, when he signed the Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act. A New York Times column proclaimed days later "Home Builders (You Heard That Right) Get a Gift." Builder Magazine added up the lucre in February 2010: Nearly $2 billion in total tax refunds for the last three months of 2009. Not content to rely on secondhand sources, we spot-checked records ourselves, finding references to the new tax benefits in public filings. The general story held up. PulteGroup did indeed report an $800 million boost in fourth quarter 2009. KB Home reported an income tax benefit of $191.7 million, as reported in the Builder Magazine and Hometown Democracy charts. Meanwhile, the fourth-quarter Lennar Corp. number wasn't as easy to come by. While the charts said $251.1 million, Builder Magazine editor John Caulfield told us Oct. 27 that he was looking at the wrong report as he prepared his story. Lennar did say it expected a tax refund for the year of $320 million, though didn't appear to break out a fourth-quarter tax benefit. We also confirmed "Vote No on 4" campaign contributions from builders named in the Florida Hometown Democracy news release. Many were heavy hitters: A query to a Florida Division of Elections database for contributors who’ve handed over more than $100,000 each to fight the direct democracy initiative shows Pulte Homes Corp., Lennar Family of Builders, KB Home and more. (PulteGroup, for the record, said its commitment to oppose Amendment 4 "was made in 2009 prior to the receipt of any tax refund.") Beyond the builders Florida Hometown Democracy’s August press release broke out just 12 builders as specific examples of companies that benefited from the tax change and contributed to "Vote No on 4." It pointed out that private companies wouldn’t have to reveal their tax records. So we wondered: Would the word "many" in the claim hold up under scrutiny? Well, here’s twist No. 1. It wasn’t just builders that benefited from the 2009 tax change. We called Steven Friedman, national director of home building services for Ernst & Young, who explained that the carryback provision applied to nearly everyone, companies and individuals alike. Other than industries with special rules such as finance or insurance — and companies that already benefited from TARP funds — anyone with the appropriate losses and prior taxable income could benefit, he said. "The point is, this was a very broad-based change in the law," he said. "This was not a rifle shot targeted to Wall Street, to home builders, take your pick." We had crunched the campaign contributor data, which showed more than 1,000 contributions to the main "Vote No on 4" political action committee, Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy. When we pulled out individuals and industry and lobbying groups, such as leading donor Florida Association of Realtors Advocacy Fund, about 430 contributions were left, primarily from companies. The most common self-identified occupations included construction, development and real estate. Did "many" of those companies benefit from the tax refund "bailout?" We would have to know whether they had suffered the appropriate losses in 2008 or 2009 and previously had taxable income to offset. We could make an educated guess that it was likely for builders, developers and real estate companies, given the recession, but without intensive research — and likely stonewalls in the case of private companies — we couldn’t know for sure. The final twist If we could only talk with the originator of the chain e-mail claim, perhaps we would discover a powerful act of database journalism that cross-linked every business that contributed to "Vote No on 4" with any refunds supercharged by the 2009 tax law change. As it was, we were making some leaps — names weren’t usually an identical match. PulteGroup, for example, recorded the $800 million tax benefit. Pulte Homes Group made the $567,000 political donation. Then we found the author. Well, sort of. An Internet search on "humongous tax refunds" turned up the source, all right: novelist and Miami Herald columnist Carl Hiaasen. But he had nothing to do with the chain e-mail. Instead, someone had borrowed liberally from his Oct. 9, 2010, column, "Running scared over Amendment 4." Hiaasen, who takes shady Florida developers to task in his novels, used this column to shake a finger at special interests for their attacks on Amendment 4. He connected big-builder contributors to those tax refunds. He told his readers: "These guys are using your money to keep your voice, and your vote, out of the neighborhood planning process." PolitiFact Florida got Hiaasen on the phone. "The tax refunds these companies got were well documented," he said. True. But could he confirm that "many" companies that contributed got the bailouts? "It depends on your definition of many," he said. It would be great if someone would cross-check those contributors with data on tax refunds, he offered. He could do it, just not immediately. But he had been struck that builders, who contributed to the over-development that brought on the real estate collapse in the first place, had benefited from an act of Congress — and now opposed a measure that would give voters a say in their work. "When you start taking handouts from the government and then suddenly have enough money to get politically involved at this level, with this much cash going in, I think you need to be accountable, and I think the public needs to know where their bailout dollars are going," he said. But he didn’t have that dreamy database we’d been hoping for. So what does the Truth-O-Meter make of all this? First, what we can confirm: Some companies bankrolling the ad campaign against Amendment 4 are recipients of a congressional bailout in the form of tax refunds. What no one has yet proved, though it seems likely: "Many." What we won’t rule on: "Humongous." While hundreds of millions of dollars sounds large to us, that’s a value judgment best reserved for opinion columns and novels. The statement we’re ruling on relies on finding companies that both got and gave, not on establishing a link between the cash flows. We don’t define "many" but we confirmed at least "some" — just 12 builders represent nearly $2 million for "Vote No on 4," about 18 percent of the money raised. We find it valuable context that companies far beyond home builders, Realtors and developers also benefited from this tax change — even, say, newspaper companies. We rule this claim Half True. Though if Mr. Hiaasen comes up with that magical database, we’d be happy to reconsider. UPDATE: John Caulfield, who graciously acknowledged his mistake on a Lennar number, later showed us one of our own errors. Our original post of this item used a year-end tax figure, not a fourth-quarter one, for KB Home. That has now been corrected.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-10-27T16:09:37	2010-10-12	['None']

pomt-04894	Says that President Obama said that "Small Businesses Succeed Because of Government."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/aug/06/chuck-fleischmann/gop-congressman-chuck-fleischmann-claims-obama-was/	Republicans have been pounding President Barack Obama relentlessly ever since he made remarks about the intersection of business and government during a campaign appearance in Roanoke, Va., on July 13, 2012. Critics pointed to two lines in the speech to make the case that Obama holds a general disdain for people who create and build businesses. U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, who represents Tennessee’s 3rd Congressional District, offered his own critique of the president’s remarks a few days after Obama set off the firestorm. "Obama: Small Businesses Succeed Because of Government," screamed the headline from a blog entry that Fleischmann posted on his campaign website on July 17, 2012. "Having no experience in running a business, President Obama just doesn’t get it," Fleischmann wrote. "In fact, he fights against it. Just recently, he said: ‘If you’ve got a business – you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.’ " "If you are like me," Fleischmann continued, "you were speechless at the President’s latest arrogant attack on the foundation of the American economy. The President insists on pushing his view of successful businesses in America – that we owe the government for our success." Asked to explain Fleischmann’s comments, his campaign spokesman, Jordan Powell, said the blog item was built around Obama’s remarks in Roanoke. "The president seems to think that the government is the engine of success, and Chuck thinks it’s not so – it’s the private sector and hard-working small business owners," Powell said. Obama’s Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, has made pretty much the same claim about the president at public events and in several ads. The Republican National Committee and the National Federation of Independent Businesses are among the groups that have released their own videos and statements claiming Obama is out of touch. The criticism has become so big a threat that Obama’s re-election campaign felt the need to address the issue in a web video titled "Tampered" that quoted media accounts saying the quote had been taken out of context. We won’t delve into the broader question of what President Obama thinks about businesses. Here, we will simply examine Fleischmann’s claim that, in his campaign speech, Obama was saying "small businesses succeed because of government." Our colleagues at PolitiFact national have examined similar claims made by Romney and others and given them False rulings. Many of their points are repeated here. Let’s begin by looking at the full context of Obama’s speech. Here’s what he said: "There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me -- because they want to give something back. They know they didn’t -- look, if you’ve been successful, you didn’t get there on your own. You didn’t get there on your own. I’m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. "If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you’ve got a business -- you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn’t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet. "The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together. There are some things, just like fighting fires, we don’t do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had their own fire service. That would be a hard way to organize fighting fires. "So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this country, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That’s how we funded the G.I. Bill. That’s how we created the middle class. That’s how we built the Golden Gate Bridge or the Hoover Dam. That’s how we invented the Internet. That’s how we sent a man to the moon. We rise or fall together as one nation and as one people, and that’s the reason I’m running for President -- because I still believe in that idea. You’re not on your own, we’re in this together." When placed in context, it is obvious Obama was making the point that success comes from the combination of "individual initiative" and the fact that "we do things together." Fleischmann and others who have criticized Obama’s remarks omitted the lead-up to his statement -- that "if you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges." These words indicate Obama was referring to infrastructure and educational opportunities that were paid for by taxpayers through the government -- things that the President argues establishes a necessary foundation for making private businesses successful. We think his meaning is clear -- that both business people and government play a role in the American enterprise system, not purely one or the other. Our ruling Rep. Fleischmann cherry-picks a quote from President Obama’s remarks to make it appear Obama was being dismissive of businesses and was saying in essence that "small businesses succeed because of government." But the preceding sentences in Obama’s remarks make clear that he was talking about the importance of government-provided infrastructure and education to the success of private businesses. Fleischmann also ignores Obama's clear summary of his message, that "the point is ... that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together." By leaving out the "individual initiative" reference, Fleischmann has given a false impression. We rate his statement False.

pomt-03072	"I would be the first Republican senator elected in New Jersey in 41 years."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/sep/29/steve-lonegan/steve-lonegan-claims-he-could-be-first-republican-/	Steve Lonegan is well aware of the potential to make history in the Oct. 16 special election for a U.S. Senate seat. If elected, the Republican would be the first senator from his party to be elected to the upper house of Congress in at least two generations, Lonegan noted during a radio interview Monday on the John Gambling show, during which he discussed his campaign. "I would be the first Republican senator elected in New Jersey in 41 years," said Lonegan, who is vying with Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democrat, for the seat left vacant after Sen. Frank Lautenberg died in early June. Lonegan is correct. Other than an eight-month period in 1982 when a Republican was appointed to a Senate seat from New Jersey, and this summer's appointment of Republican Jeff Chiesa to temporarily fill Lautenberg's seat until the special election, Democrats have had a stronghold on the state’s two Senate seats for more than 30 years. This statistic is not a new claim. Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, referenced it in May 2012 during a speech he gave at an event held by the libertarian Cato Institute. Let’s first review some history about New Jersey’s senators. Clifford P. Case was the last Republican that New Jerseyans elected to the Senate, in 1972. Case served four terms before losing a re-election bid in the 1978 Republican primary to Jeffrey Bell. The Democratic lock on New Jersey’s Senate seats began in 1978 with the election of Bill Bradley. Republicans from the Garden State had served in the Senate for the 40 years leading up to Bradley’s election, but Democrats have dominated every Senate race since Bradley’s election. That changed briefly in 1982, when Republican Nicholas Brady was appointed to fill in for Democrat Harrison Williams Jr., who left office after convictions on bribery and conspiracy charges as part of the federal ABSCAM probe. ABSCAM was an investigation by the FBI in which several public officials were offered money or other items in exchange for special favors. Brady left the Senate after Lautenberg won the 1982 general election, defeating Republican Millicent Fenwick. Kean appointed Lautenberg to complete the final days of the term. Lautenberg started his first full term in January 1983 and served three six-year terms before deciding not to seek re-election in 2001. His retirement was short-lived, however. Lautenberg returned to the Senate in 2003 to replace fellow Democrat Robert Torricelli on the ballot. Torricelli, who had served one term, quit his re-election bid in 2002 over an ethics probe. Democrat domination continued until Christie appointed Chiesa, the state's former attorney general, to Lautenberg's seat on June 6. Chiesa was sworn in four days later. Our ruling Lonegan said during a radio interview, "I would be the first Republican senator elected in New Jersey in 41 years." In 1972, New Jersey sent Republican Clifford Case to the U.S. Senate to serve a fourth term, but he lost a Republican primary re-election bid in 1978, to Jeffrey Bell. Since then, New Jersey voters have not elected another GOP candidate to the Senate. Republicans from New Jersey served in the Senate for eight months during 1982, and since mid-June, but both were appointed, not elected. We rate Lonegan's claim True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com. Editor's Note: The 'Our Ruling' section of this story has been corrected to reflect that Clifford Case lost the Republican primary in 1978 to Jeffrey Bell, not Bill Bradley.

pomt-13484	Says Dick Cheney "supported gay marriage sooner" than Hillary Clinton.	true	/colorado/statements/2016/sep/08/alternativepac/pac-backing-gary-johnson-says-dick-cheney-supporte/	A viral online ad by a group supporting Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson features Abe Lincoln urging Americans to dump Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and vote for Johnson. The funny, five-minute video by AlternativePAC begins with the Lincoln impersonator standing outside a log cabin. "Oh, hey America, it’s me, dead Abe Lincoln, and you just got screwed," he says, "because you have to choose between a corrupt president or a crazy president." "Here’s Hillary, who’s like a Monopoly player using her get out of jail free card, then a rig an election card, and make millions on political favors card," Abe says. "And Trump, who’s like if your racist uncle got drunk and ran for president, and then the nation got drunk and said, ‘That guy should have nuclear bombs.'" Abe's pitch: Consider Gary Johnson, the former New Mexico governor, as a sensible third-party option. Since AlternativePAC posted the ad Aug. 25 on its website BalancedRebellion.com it has been viewed 18.3 million times on the group’s Facebook page. Among fake Abe’s many zingers, this one caught our attention: "Hillary’s policies are the same as Dick Cheney’s, except Cheney supported gay marriage sooner!" We did not fact-check the line that Hillary’s policies are the same as Dick Cheney's" -- because their positions aren't identical, and it smacks of humorous hyperbole. Instead we focused on the claim that "Cheney supported gay marriage sooner" than Clinton. Same-sex marriage is a personal issue for Cheney, who served as vice president to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2009. His second-oldest daughter, Mary Cheney, is openly gay and she married her longtime partner, Heather Poe, in 2012. She also served as a senior campaign advisor to her father during the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. Cheney broke with conservative orthodoxy on same-sex marriage during his Oct. 5, 2000, vice presidential debate against Sen. Joe Lieberman. Debate moderator Bernie Bernard Shaw of CNN asked the candidates if gay couples should "have all the constitutional rights enjoyed by every American citizen?" "The fact of the matter is we live in a free society, and freedom means freedom for everybody," Cheney replied. "We don't get to choose, and shouldn't be able to choose and say, 'You get to live free, but you don't.' I think that means that people should be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to enter into." (Watch the debate; Cheney discusses gay marriage at 1:17) Cheney said the question of whether there should be an "official sanction" of same-sex relationships should be left to states -- which have traditionally overseen marriage laws. "I don't think there should necessarily be a federal policy in this area," he added. Cheney’s stand drew criticism from conservatives and praise from gay groups, the New York Times reported. In his 2011 memoir, In My Time, Cheney wrote of his debate comments: "I had given the issue a lot of thought and answered it from the heart. ...Of course, I had my daughter Mary and her partner, Heather Poe, in my mind, but I was also thinking about what's right for all of us as Americans if we truly believe in freedom." During the Bush-Cheney 2004 re-election race, the vice president spelled out his differences on gay marriage with President Bush, who had endorsed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, the Washington Post reported. For the first time, Cheney discussed the sexual orientation of his daughter, Mary. Asked his position on the issue at an Iowa town hall meeting, Cheney said: "Lynne and I have a gay daughter, so it's an issue that our family is very familiar with. ... With respect to the question of relationships, my general view is that freedom means freedom for everyone. People ought to be able to free -- ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to." He again said that same-sex marriage should be left to the states to decide, while noting Bush’s endorsement of the amendment to prevent states from recognizing gay marriages. "At this point ... my own preference is as I've stated," Cheney said. "But the president makes basic policy for the administration. And he's made it. " At a June 2009 National Press Club event, a journalist asked Cheney, given the Iowa Supreme Court's ruling legalizing game marriage at the time, "is some form of legalized gay marriage inevitable in the United States?" The former vice president repeated his mantra on the issue, saying, "Freedom means freedom for everyone. And as many of you know, one of my daughters is gay, and something that we’ve lived with for a long time in our family. I think people ought to be free to enter into any kind of union they wish, any kind of arrangement they wish." He appeared to positively view the movement by some states to legalize gay marriage. "I think people ought to get a shot at that. And they do at present." (Watch a video of Cheney's remarks.) Clinton's flip-flop As for Hillary Clinton, PolitiFact has reported that the Democratic presidential nominee opposed gay marriage for more than a decade before she came out in support of it in 2013. We found that as public opinion shifted toward support for same-sex marriage, so did Clinton. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that defined federal marriage as a union between one man and one woman. It also denied same-sex couples access to federal benefits, including Social Security survivor benefits and health care benefits along with barring gay couples from filing joint federal tax returns and receiving income and estate tax benefits for spouses. Hillary Clinton began facing questions about same-sex marriage during her 2000 campaign for the U.S. Senate. In December 1999, Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson said she supported the Defense of Marriage Act, but added that "same-sex unions should be recognized and that same-sex unions should be entitled to all the rights and privileges that every other American gets," the New York Times reported. In July 2004, Clinton spoke on the Senate floor saying she -- like Cheney -- opposed a proposed federal amendment to ban same-sex marriage. (The amendment ultimately failed.) Though she opposed it, she said that she believed that marriage was "a sacred bond between a man and a woman." But her opposition continued to soften as popular support for same-sex marriage increased. In October 2006, Clinton told a private gathering of gay elected officials that she would support same-sex marriage in New York if a future governor and Legislature chose to enact such a law. During her 2008 run for president, Clinton backed away from the Defense of Marriage Act in a May 2007 questionnaire for the Human Rights Campaign: "I support repealing the provision of DOMA that may prohibit the federal government from providing benefits to people in states that recognize same-sex marriage." However, the New York Times reported that presidential candidate Clinton in 2008 continued to explicitly opposed same-sex marriage, saying that she favored civil unions but that decisions about the legality of marriage should be left to the states. As Clinton prepared for her second presidential bid, she announced her support for same-sex marriage in a video with the Human Rights Campaign on March 18, 2013. "LGBT Americans are our colleagues, our teachers, our soldiers, our friends, our loved ones. And they are full and equal citizens, and they deserve the rights of citizenship. That includes marriage. That’s why I support marriage for lesbian and gay couples," she said. "I support it personally and as a matter of policy and law, embedded in a broader effort to advance equality and opportunity for LGBT Americans and all Americans." Our ruling AlternativePAC says "(Dick) Cheney supported gay marriage sooner" than Hillary Clinton. The historical record is clear. Cheney spoke out in favor of gay marriage during the 2000 vice presidential debate, saying, "freedom means freedom for everybody… I think we ought to do everything we can to tolerate and accommodate whatever kind of relationships people want to enter into." He said any "official sanction" of same-sex relationships should be left to states -- not the federal government. In the 2004 presidential election, Cheney broke with Bush, who supported a congressional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Clinton opposed same-sex marriage as a candidate for the Senate, while in office as a senator, and while running for president in 2008. She expressed her support for civil unions starting in 2000, opposed the proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in 2004 and voiced support for the rights of states to set their own laws in favor of gay marriage in 2006. She came out in support of same-sex marriage in 2013.

pomt-00404	Says "I have been through the gauntlet, when we had riots in that Capitol."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/04/leah-vukmir/gop-us-senate-candidate-vukmir-refreshes-claim-abo/	In her battle against U.S. Sen Tammy Baldwin, Republican Leah Vukmir is presenting herself as a tried, true and tested conservative. That approach was evident in the primary battle, in which Vukmir, a state senator from Brookfield, defeated U.S. Marine veteran and businessman Kevin Nicholson. During a July 26, 2018 primary debate, Vukmir stressed that Wisconsin Republicans have "moved the conservative ball down the field. We are not establishment Republicans in Wisconsin; we are activist Republicans." Vukmir then pitched herself as "a strong leader with a track record who’s not going to buckle" and cited the 2011 battle over Act 10 declaring: "I have been through the gauntlet, when we had riots in that Capitol." Erm? What? The background The 2011 protests against what would become Act 10 turned into a round-the-clock occupation of the Capitol, with demonstrators camping out in the rotunda. It was the largest series of protests at the Capitol since the Vietnam War, with crowds reaching an estimated 100,000 in early March, after the bill had been signed by newly-elected Gov. Scott Walker. The protests were over a push by Walker and Republicans in the Legislature to dramatically curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. The move allowed the state and other units of government to require a higher share of pension and health care costs be paid by workers, which Walker and the GOP said was needed to close a state budget gap. The protests -- and the fact Senate Democrats fled to Illinois to delay a vote -- drew major news coverage for weeks. The tumult even attracted international attention, with Piotr Duda, president of the 700,000-member Polish trade union Solidarity, releasing a statement in support of the Wisconsin protesters. Meanwhile, Ian’s Pizza shops delivered hundreds of free pizzas to the Capitol, with the cost picked up by contributions from all 50 states — as well as Bosnia, China, Egypt, France and 20 other countries. But pizza deliveries in a riot zone? A similar claim Mattias Gugel, communications director for Vukmir’s Senate campaign, did not respond to our requests for back up for Vukmir’s claim. This is not the first time we heard, and evaluated, a "riot" claim. Appearing on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" program the morning of Feb. 17, 2011, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., defended Walker’s efforts. "It's not asking a lot, it's still about half of what private sector pensions do and health care packages do," Ryan said. "So (Walker’s) basically saying, I want you public workers to pay half of what our private sector counterparts (pay) and he's getting riots -- it's like Cairo has moved to Madison these days." At the time, protests had also swept through the Middle East. In Egypt, 18 days of protests led to the Feb. 11, 2011, resignation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Our rating of Ryan’s riot claim: Pants on Fire. Numerous law enforcement agencies handled the protests, including the Dane County Sheriff’s Department, Madison police, state Department of Natural Resources and Capitol police. But only a handful of arrests were reported. "For the most part, people have been very respectful and very orderly," a public information officer for the Dane County Sheriff’s Department told us at the time. "It certainly has been a very peaceful protest." To be sure, there were threats made against Walker and GOP lawmakers. In his book "Unintimidated," Walker wrote that he received letters targeting his family and faced death threats and frightening encounters with protesters. There were also reports of threats being made against several lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald. But that’s different than riots. At the time, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said of Ryan’s "riot" statement: "It’s astounding that he would say that. It’s so spectacularly wrong." Ryan himself admitted: "It was an inaccurate comparison." Our rating During a campaign debate, Vukmir said: "I have been through the gauntlet, when we had riots in that Capitol." That vastly overstates what happened, in an effort to burnish her own stand-tough persona for voters. The claim of "riots" in the Capitol was debunked in 2011 and rarely, if ever, has come up since. That is, until Vukmir put herself on the hot seat by recycling the claim. We still rate it Pants on Fire.

It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/09/donald-trump/under-donald-trump-us-nuclear-arsenal-far-stronger/	One day after threatening North Korea with "fire and fury like the world has never seen" if it menaces the United States, President Donald Trump tweeted about the strength of U.S. nuclear weapons and improvements made on his watch. Trump wrote at 4:56 a.m: "My first order as president was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com This tweet is not accurate. A week after taking office, Trump issued a presidential memorandum on "rebuilding the U.S. Armed Forces." One sentence in this memo directs the defense secretary to "initiate a new Nuclear Posture Review to ensure that the United States nuclear deterrent is modern, robust, flexible, resilient, ready, and appropriately tailored to deter 21st-century threats and reassure our allies." The review effort kicked off in April 2017, according to news reports. However, this wasn’t Trump’s first order as president — more than a dozen earlier executive orders and memoranda are listed on the White House website. More importantly, asking for a Nuclear Posture Review is not unusual; it’s expected. The Defense Department’s web page for the Nuclear Posture Review describes it as "legislatively mandated." HELP KEEP POLITIFACT GOING! MAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO SUPPORT INDEPENDENT FACT-CHECKING Indeed, it’s common for new presidents to put their stamp on the nation’s nuclear capabilities by issuing a new review within two years after entering office. Bill Clinton produced one in 1994. George W. Bush produced one in 2002. And Barack Obama produced one in 2010. (Apparently, the Trump administration hasn’t updated its Pentagon web page on the Nuclear Posture Review. When we accessed it on Aug. 9, it still had a photo and "notable quote" by Hillary Clinton on it.) A larger issue with Trump’s assurance: Experts unanimously said the U.S. nuclear arsenal could not have improved to the extent Trump described in just over 200 days. There have been incremental improvements, but they have been trickling out under a plan begun under Trump’s predecessor, Obama. The United States is engaged in a multiyear program to modernize the nation’s nuclear arsenal, including the rebuilding of the Minuteman III system, which launches intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the Trident II submarine-launched missile systems, as well as the refurbishment of nuclear warheads and construction of new and upgraded facilities, such as a uranium processing facility in Oak Ridge, Tenn. (Here’s an updated rundown of the modernization plan published by the Arms Control Association.) The modernization effort was estimated to cost roughly $35 billion a year over a decade, or 5 percent to 6 percent of planned national defense spending, according to Congressional Budget Office reports released in December 2013 and January 2015. Its most recent estimate, released in February 2017, CBO said the modernization effort would cost $400 billion between 2017 and 2026, or $52 billion more than CBO’s 2015 estimate, "largely because modernization programs will be ramping up." Cumulatively, total costs could reach $1 trillion over the next 30 years. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Experts panned Trump's boast of rapid improvements. "It would be a pretty fantastic claim under even Cold War standards given the size and scope of the arsenal," said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy and a former State Department official under Obama. But given the restrictions under the New START treaty that went into force in 2011, it would be "pretty difficult, if not impossible, to achieve except in a crash, well-publicized effort." Matthew Bunn, a nuclear-policy specialist who teaches at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, called Trump’s claim "simply false." "There is a total of nothing that has changed substantially about the U.S. nuclear arsenal over the few months that Trump has been in office," Bunn said. "We have the same missiles and bombers, with the same nuclear weapons, that we had before." Bottom line: In the scale of decades, six months is a blink of the eye, experts said. This is not the first time Trump has sought to paint a picture of weak stewardship of the U.S. nuclear arsenal under Obama. As early as June 2015, Trump said, "Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked." We rated that False. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said, "My first order as president was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before." What Trump did shortly after taking office was neither his first order nor a unique action; every new president in recent years has requested a Nuclear Posture Review. In addition, the ongoing nuclear modernization plan -- which dates back to the Obama administration and will take decades to complete -- would not have notched achievements in six months sufficient to be characterized as "far stronger and more powerful than ever before." We rate the statement False. EDITOR'S NOTE, Aug. 9, 2017, 4:30 p.m.: This article has been updated to include CBO's 2017 cost estimate.

pomt-05786	"There are more atheists in the country right now than Jews, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists combined and doubled."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/feb/26/david-silverman/american-atheists-president-david-silverman-says-t/	David Silverman, president of American Atheists, was interviewed recently by a Washington, D.C., television station about plans for a March 24 Reason Rally on the Washington Mall. "There are more atheists in the country right now than Jews, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists combined and doubled," said Silverman. "That's a lot of people." The statement piqued our interest in light of the rancorous debate over the prayer banner at Cranston High School West. In January, a federal judge ordered the school to remove the banner, which begins "our Heavenly Father," ruling that it violated Cranston West student Jessica Ahlquist’s constitutional rights and made her feel "excluded and ostracized" because she is an atheist. (Ahlquist is scheduled to speak at the Reason Rally.) At a time when atheists are often reviled -- as witnessed by the crowd reaction in Cranston when some testified on the prayer banner issue -- we wondered whether the percentage of atheists is really as high as Silverman said it is. To find out, we focused on two major national surveys. The first was conducted in 2007 by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. Among the 35,556 U.S. adults asked to identify their religious affiliation, 1.7 percent characterized themselves as Jews, 0.7 percent were Buddhist, 0.6 percent were Muslim and 0.4 percent were Hindu. That’s a total of 3.4 percent. If you double that sum, as Silverman proposed in his claim, that's 6.8 percent. And what percentage of the population identified itself as atheist? Just 1.6 percent. The second was the American Religious Identification Survey from 2008, conducted by the Program on Public Values at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn. The survey of 54,461 people asked participants to identify their "religious tradition." A total of 1.2 percent said Jewish, 0.6 percent said Muslim and 0.9 percent said Eastern Religions, which includes Hindus, Buddhists and others. Those percentages are rounded off. When you look at the actual numbers and do the math, you get an upper limit of 2.6 percent. Doubling that gives you 5.2 percent. What percent of respondents in that poll call themselves atheists? Just 0.7 percent. That's so far off, we're starting to smell a little hellfire and brimstone. So we called Silverman. He said he's counting as atheists all people who fall into the "None" or "Unaffiliated" category when asked to state their religious preference. His rationale: They don't believe in God. They just don't say they're atheists, either because they don't know the word or don't use it. By his definition, that would be an inclusive group. In the Pew survey, 16.1 percent are listed as unaffiliated. In the American Religious Survey, 15.0 percent are listed as having no religion. "And that doesn't includes the atheists who call themselves Jews, Christians and Muslims," he said. Silverman also wants to count agnostics as atheists. (Our American Heritage dictionary defines an agnostic as someone "who believes there can be no proof of the existence of God but does not deny the possibility that God exists.") "An agnostic is an atheist," Silverman insisted. "If you don't have a belief in God, you're an atheist. It doesn't matter what you call yourself. It doesn't matter whether they like it or not, they're atheists." Similarly, Silverman wants the atheist category to include people who are listed as "secular unaffiliated" in the Pew study. We disagree with Silverman’s reasoning. The agnostics we know call themselves that because they don't want to be lumped into one group or another when it goes to the question of the existence of God. And the Pew report defines the "secular unaffiliated" as people who say that religion is not important in their lives. That doesn't automatically mean they don't believe in a god, so we don’t think they should be lumped into the atheist category either. Other questions in the survey, however, complicate matters somewhat. When the American Religious survey asked people what they thought of the existence of God, 2.3 percent said "There is no such thing." If you agree to add in the 4.3 percent who say, "There is no way to know," the ratio rises to 6.6 percent. When Pew asked a broader question -- "Do you believe in God or a universal spirit?" -- 5 percent said "No." Barry Kosmin of Trinity College in Connecticut and coauthor of the ARIS said there's an interesting distinction between people who say they are atheists and those who really don't believe in God. "There's a difference between belonging and belief," he said. "A truck driver may say God doesn't exist, but he's unlikely to give you Greek names like agnostic or atheist. That's why you see different numbers." "You're dealing here with a Jell-o. You see everything from 1 percent to 10 percent because a lot of them fall into the 'None' category and terms like secular, atheist, non-religious, areligious are used interchangeably," said Kosmin. "In terms of atheists who have come out, [Silverman] is wrong. In terms of the number of people who have that belief, if you ask them, he's correct." Our ruling Atheist David Silverman claimed that "There are more atheists in the country right now than Jews, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists combined and doubled." He wants to include not only people who define themselves as atheists, but others, such as agnostics, who have serious doubts about the existence of God. But just as atheists don't want someone else's religious beliefs and practices foisted upon them, we believe that those who doubt the existence of a supreme power shouldn’t be lumped into the "atheist" category. If Silverman had claimed that the number of Americans who don't believe in God is larger than the number of Jews, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists in the U.S., he’d be on more solid ground. But he didn’t. Instead, he said you could double the number of people in those religions and atheists would still outnumber them. The only way to achieve that number is to include people who may not desire -- or deserve -- to be in that category, so we rate his statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-00045	Cesar Sayoc is a Democrat posing as a Republican.	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/05/blog-posting/pipe-bomb-suspects-florida-voting-records-show-onl/	False flag theories persist as the man suspected of sending explosives to critics of President Donald Trump faces federal charges. News reports have described the 56-year-old as a registered Republican. But bloggers peddling a narrative that suggests liberals are behind the pipe bomb plot argue that until recently, Sayoc belonged to the Democratic Party. "A lifelong Democrat recently registered as a Republican, covered his van with Trump stickers and began sending bombs that didn’t explode to Democrats," reads a post that appeared on Facebook on Oct. 26. "And you have to ask why Americans find that suspicious?" This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to the Florida Department of State, Sayoc registered with the Republican Party of Florida on March 4, 2016, less than two weeks before Trump won the Florida Republican presidential primary. But records from the Miami-Dade County Elections Department show that on two occasions in October 2012 — Oct. 9 and Oct. 26 — Sayoc initiated, but didn’t complete, new voter registration applications. Both times, he checked the box next to "Republican Party" as his party affiliation. On Oct. 9, 2012, he checked the box that said his was a "new registration," but it appears he left blank the answer to a question about whether he’d ever been "adjudicated mentally incapacitated with respect to voting." On Oct. 26, 2012, he didn’t check any of the boxes indicating the reason behind his registration application (i.e. new registration, address change, name change, party change, etc.) Near the top of that form, someone scribbled, "INCOMP," indicating it was incomplete. As provided to PolitiFact in response to a public records request, copies of both Sayoc’s 2012 applications show blank space in the section that asks for a Florida driver’s license, identification number or the last four digits of the applicant’s Social Security number. Florida election code states that if any of these pieces of information are not included in a voter registration application, the registration is considered incomplete. Sayoc’s application to vote remained incomplete until March 4, 2016, according to the department, when he provided his information in full, updated his mailing address and once again reported that his party affiliation was Republican. Also on the 2016 form, the box next to "new registration" is checked as the reason behind the application. The box next to "party change" is blank. Though Sayoc successfully registered to vote before Trump won the March 15 Florida presidential primary, his application still apparently came too late to be eligible to vote in that election. In Florida, the deadline to register in order to participate in an upcoming election is 29 days before the election. But Sayoc’s voting record seems to indicate that, after that, he was motivated to get his vote out: He went on to cast a ballot early three times — in the 2016 August primary, the 2016 general election and the August 2018 primary. Friends and other people who know Sayoc have said that he never showed an interest in politics until Trump came on the political scene, The Washington Post reported on Oct. 27. He started sharing pictures of himself at campaign events on Facebook. Ronald Lowy, a lawyer who represented Sayoc in a fraud case, told the paper Sayoc had "no interest in politics… and along came the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, who welcomed all extremists, all outsiders, all outliers, and he felt that somebody was finally talking to him." "He registered as a Republican to vote in Florida — Lowy said he believes it was for the first time in Sayoc’s life — in 2016," the story says. Our ruling An Oct 26 post on Facebook states that, "A lifelong Democrat recently registered as a Republican, covered his van with Trump stickers and began sending bombs that didn’t explode to Democrats. And you have to ask why Americans find that suspicious?" We found no evidence that Sayoc was a "lifelong Democrat." And while it’s true that state records show that Sayoc registered to vote relatively recently, in 2016, an application from 2012 shows that Sayoc then considered himself a member of the Republican Party. We rate this claim False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-11-05T11:01:33	2018-10-26	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-07610	Says the state’s budget shortfall is "not that much different" than it was in 2003.	false	/texas/statements/2011/mar/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-2011-budget-shortfall-isnt-much-di/	After urging GOP Texas House members to cut the state budget before dipping into the state’s "rainy day" fund, Gov. Rick Perry told reporters outside the closed-door meeting that he’d compared the situation to what lawmakers faced in the 2003 session. "So we talked about the difference between 2003 and 2011," Perry said. "And the percentage of the budget shortfall versus the budget is really not that much different than it was in 2003." We asked Perry’s office to elaborate, then hunted comparisons of the state’s current fiscal situation to 2003 when lawmakers resolved a $9.9 billion projected revenue shortfall with funding cuts, fee increases, federal aid and other strategies. Missing from that mix: state tax increases. In a Feb. 20 political commentary, reporter Peggy Fikac of Hearst Newspapers quoted an expert saying today’s budget crunch is most comparable to 1987 when lawmakers and GOP Gov. Bill Clements agreed to a record tax increase. Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, told Fikac the operating state deficit then was just under $1 billion, or 4.1 percent of discretionary state revenue -- that is, income that’s not constitutionally dedicated to specific purposes. In 2003, Craymer advised, lawmakers faced an operating deficit of $1.8 billion, 2.9 percent of discretionary state general revenue. The column quotes Craymer saying the current budget year’s $4.3 billion operating deficit -- 4.6 percent of discretionary revenue --"beats both of those . . . It’s a tougher challenge than either 2003 or 1987." Recently, two former Democratic elected officials pressed a similar point. A Feb. 1 letter to business leaders from former Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby and Scott McCown, a former state district judge who directs the Center for Public Policy Priorities, states: "Texas faces its largest revenue shortfall in decades... a far larger shortfall than we faced in 2003 and even larger than we faced in 1987, until now the biggest shortfall in recent times." Budgetary refresher: A deficit means that the state is running short of money to cover current spending. Shortfall usually refers to a projected gap between expected revenue and future spending needs. Fikac’s column touched on the projected $10 billion revenue shortfall faced by lawmakers in 2003, but did not compare it to the $15 billion to $27 billion shortfall that’s currently projected if the state either maintains current spending or the current level of government services through 2012-13. However, the taxpayers association did. In a January presentation at the Capitol, the group said that in 2003, the money that had been needed to maintain current spending was equal to 12.4 percent of expected discretionary general revenue, and the money needed to maintain current government services amounted to 15.6 percent of expected revenue. According to the presentation, comparable percentages now are 17.2 percent and 26.2 percent, respectively. Upshot: The current-spending shortfall is 40 percent larger than in 2003 while the shortfall to maintain current services is nearly 63 percent larger. The presentation also says that in 2003, lawmakers budgeted $1.3 billion in federal fiscal relief funds while the 2011 Legislature has no expectations of similar aid. Also, the 2003 Legislature reduced eligibility for some health and human services programs while federal law now may prohibit cuts to services and eligibility, absent federal approval of waiver requests. Finally, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us Perry’s position is that "the situation we face today is very similar to the situation we faced in 2003." As then, lawmakers "don’t have as much money as we did last budget cycle. But we are going to work with what we have" without raising taxes, Frazier said. Our read: If it’s reasonable to make the comparisons we’ve laid out--and we think it is--then Texas faces a significantly greater shortfall now than in 2003. And that’s without taking into account the unlikelihood of a federal aid rescue and potentially greater difficulties reducing health and human services. Whether the budget can be written without new taxes, as Perry advocates, is not the issue. His statement is False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-03-22T09:46:42	2011-03-07	['None']

pomt-07601	Says Allen West helped thwart a terrorist plot by shooting a gun in the direction of an Iraqi detainee, then reported the incident to his superior and said it was wrong.	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/mar/23/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-allen-west-modern-day-ronin/	During a recent discussion about the ongoing tragedy in Japan, radio host and Fox News personality Glenn Beck somehow worked in a comparison to former Army lieutenant colonel and now Florida U.S. Rep. Allen West. The discussion, on Beck's March 18, 2011, Fox News show, started with how U.S. Surgeon General Regina Benjamin had said people in America should buy iodine tablets (not exactly what she said), then morphed into why there is no looting in Japan and onto a parable about Japanese honor. Norio Nishi, whom Beck described as a Japanese national living in America, explained a concept of the samurai lifestyle to Beck known as Nin Tai. "Nin Tai means endurance, perseverance, steadfastness," Nishi said. "You do not -- when you confront with danger, when you confront with the calamity, you don't shout, yell and move your head. You just take the pain. You just go forward and that is the kind of attitude or lifestyle that Samurai people built. That (feeling) permeates every single aspect of the Japanese society." Michael Auslin, the director of Japanese studies at the American Enterprise Institute, then explained to Beck a second part of the Japanese culture, a tension between duty and obligation. "There's another side of it, too, that I think is equally important that developed," Auslin said. "The Samurai ruled Japan for about 700 years and this other side is this tension between what they call duty and obligation. Duty is what you had to do legally. It's -- you know, if you were Samurai, you had certain things you had to do and the law bound you. Obligations were your relations with your fellow man, and they were often in tension. "And the most famous story in Japan is something probably everyone here has heard of. 'The 47 Ronin, The 47th Samurai,' where they wanted to avenge what they thought was the unlawful death of their lord. But they weren't allowed to do it, according to duty. It was illegal. So they had to choose what to do. They chose obligation. But they didn't run away from the duty, meaning they chose it, knowing that if they were successful in repaying the honor of their lord, upholding his honor, they would go to their deaths by the legal system. And they chose to do that. They had to somehow bring the two together. But what they didn't do was attempt, for example, to say, well, it wasn't -- we weren't doing that, it wasn't our fault. And this -- this idea of duty and obligation, I think, has helped." Beck said the story of "The 47 Ronin" -- which is being made into a movie starring Keanu Reaves -- reminded him of West, a former Army officer who was elected to Congress in 2010. "It is kind of like Allen West when he went (to Iraq) -- Congressman Allen West -- he was questioning a terrorist, knew that this terrorist had information that was going to get all of his troops killed," Beck said. "So he went in and he threatened the guy and he (the terrorist) said, 'I know you, you Americans, you'll never do it.' He fired a shot right by the guy's head, scared him to death, knew that it was wrong and got the information. "Then went right directly to his commanding officer, put his gun down, and said, what I did was wrong, I did it and I'd do it again, but I want you to know. That's the duty and the honor," he said. Did Beck get West's back-story right? The facts behind West's Iraq interrogation Beck's claim is from 2003, when West was serving in Iraq as a lieutenant colonel overseeing an artillery battalion of about 650 soldiers and officers. In early August, soldiers received a tip that West and one of his subordinate battery commanders were to be the subject of an assassination attempt. The same informant returned with the names of three people involved in the planning of the assassination, including an Iraqi policeman, Yehiya Kadoori Hamoodi. Hamoodi was apprehended and brought in for questioning. What happened next comes from accounts provided by West and the other soldiers involved in the interrogation through sworn statements they gave during a subsequent military investigation. West joined the interrogation in progress after soldiers were unable to get useful information from Hamoodi. West said soldiers told him Hamoodi was being evasive and belligerent. That's when the interrogation got more physical. Soldiers punched and shoved Hamoodi when he wouldn't answer interrogators' questions. At some point, West sat down across from Hamoodi, took out his 9mm pistol and placed it on his thigh pointing in Hamoodi's direction. "I'm here for a reason," West said, according to a solider. "You are going to tell me who wants to kill me, or I am going to kill you." Then they took Hamoodi outside and placed his head over a clearing barrel -- a barrel filled with sand where people can unload firearms safely. West showed Hamoodi the gun and told him he had five seconds to talk. "I brought his head down toward the barrel using my left hand to shield him away from any sand or blast," West told investigators. Then West fired into the sand, at least once, maybe three times, inches from Hamoodi's head. Then West fired into the sky. Some soldiers thought West had shot Hamoodi. But Hamoodi was alive, and though stiff from shock, was ready to talk. West headed back to the operations center, and let the interrogation conclude. The fallout from the incident During a subsequent military hearing, Hamoodi said he was not sure what he told the interrogators, but that the information was meaningless and induced by fear and pain, the New York Times reported. The Times reported that at least one man named was taken into custody and his home was searched. No plans for attacks on Americans or weapons were found. West testified at his hearing that he did not know whether ''any corroboration'' of a plot was ever found. ''At the time, I had to base my decision on the intelligence I received," West said. "It's possible that I was wrong about Mr. Hamoodi.'' Yet he also notes that no attacks occurred after the interrogation. Hamoodi was detained another 45 days after the incident, then released without being charged. The military did not pursue a court martial against West, who was fined $5,000. News accounts say West decided to resign and retire during the investigation. "I know the method I used was not right, but I wanted to take care of my soldiers," West said at his hearing. "If it's about the lives of my soldiers at stake, I'd go through hell with a gasoline can." Breaking down Beck's story That's pretty much the story. Our job here is to see how Beck's version stands up. In general, it's close. But on the specifics, Beck is writing his own history, or at least a subjective version of it. Let's break it down. "It is kind of like Allen West when he went (to Iraq) -- Congressman Allen West -- he was questioning a terrorist, knew that this terrorist had information that was going to get all of his troops killed." Beck says Hamoodi was a terrorist, which was never really proven. His name was offered up by an informant as someone who knew something about a plot to assassinate West. Hamoodi was never charged. Secondly, the alleged plot was to kill West and one of his subordinates. West said he was trying to protect troops who might have been jeopardized as a result of the insurgents' plot. "So he went in and he threatened the guy and he (Hamoodi) said, 'I know you, you Americans, you'll never do it.' He fired a shot right by the guy's head, scared him to death, knew that it was wrong and got the information." There's no record that we could find of Hamoodi essentially taunting West. Not in the media accounts of West's military hearing, not in the records of the investigation and interviews of the soldiers involved. Not in West's public comments on the matter. The rest of this portion of the statement is largely accurate, though it's unclear if the information was at all useful. "Then went right directly to his commanding officer, put his gun down, and said, what I did was wrong, I did it and I'd do it again but I want you to know that's the duty and the honor," he said. This line is in many ways the crux of Beck's comparison to the Ronin legend, the point of which was to say West knew he was acting improperly, chose to do so, then turned himself in to face the consequences. It's not clear, however, that is what happened. West did wake up his superior officer after the interrogation to recount what had occurred. But the superior officer testified that he did not remember West offering specifics, beyond saying that he had discharged his weapon during an interrogation and that no one was hurt, the Times reported. In fact, the Times said that the investigation into West's actions began only after a sergeant in another battalion wrote a letter of complaint about the ''command climate'' under West's superior officer. In that letter, the sergeant mentioned almost as an aside, according to West's lawyer, that West had interrogated a detainee using a pistol. A soldier also told investigators that West originally told him and others to keep the details of the interrogation silent. "This night stays within 2-20 and 2-20 only (the number of field artillery battalion)," the soldier, whose name was not released, told investigators. "We all gave a hooah and continued to walk to our rooms as (West) returned to the operations center." West never addressed that allegation in the records we could find. "In my anger, I do not know if I fired two shots into the barrel and one into the air and another into the barrel," he told investigators at one point. "The night of this action I informed COL (name withheld) what I had personally done firing my weapon. "The following day at my battalion update brief, I informed by (sic) battery commanders. This was not to boast but rather personally accepting responsibility and to not attempt to conceal my actions. I did embellish some points for emphasis." Our ruling During a recent discussion of the crisis in Japan, Beck used a parable about the Japanese people as a way to bring up the story of West's time as a military officer in Iraq. To be clear, we're not judging whether West should have done what he did, or whether it was honorable. We're simply seeing if Beck got the story right. In particular, we're focusing on Beck's assertion that West helped thwart a terrorist plot by shooting a gun in the direction of an Iraqi detainee, then reported the incident to his superior and said it was wrong. Beck embellishes on some of the points of the record. West did report the incident to his superior, though it's unclear how much he said. And the investigation into the shooting occurred after another solider complained. The "terrorist," Hamoodi, was a person offered up by an informant who was never charged with wrongdoing and ultimately released. And even West admits that Hamoodi may have had nothing to do with an assassination plot. No plot was ever uncovered. It's an interesting story about West, so we think it's important to keep it as close to the facts as possible. So we rate Beck's claim Half True.

pomt-00152	Says that U.S. Rep. Andy Barr was "even dismissing the importance of military service" by saying, "We both served our country. I’ve served in a position where ideas matter."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/24/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/did-andy-barr-dismiss-military-service-and-while-b/	There are few things worse than belittling military service, and an ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee accuses U.S. Rep. Andy Barr of doing just that. The Republican is running for re-election in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District against Marine veteran Amy McGrath. The DCCC launched the ad "Doing Right" on Oct. 8, and it accuses Barr of brushing off the significance of military service. The ad ran from Oct. 9 to Oct. 15. After criticizing Barr for allegedly giving tax breaks to corporations, the ad says Barr was "even dismissing the importance of military service" while onscreen text displays a quote from him that reads: "We both served our country. I’ve served in a position where ideas matter." So did Barr actually dismiss military service when compared with serving in political office? Not exactly. What Barr said in context The DCCC’s ad cites an article from the Louisville Courier Journal, which references an interview Barr gave to the New York Times. At one point, Barr seems to compare his political experience in government with McGrath’s military service. The DCCC ad ends his quote with Barr saying that he’s "served in a position where ideas matter." But, it isn’t the complete quote: "We both served our country. I’ve served in a position where ideas matter. My opponent has served her country in the military, where execution matters." The ad stops short of finishing Barr’s quote and makes it look like he said something more damning – that political office experience is more important than serving in the military. Barr didn’t say that, but he did compare the two. The Barr campaign says that the charge is a lie and pointed to his work on behalf of veterans. "A member of Congress serves his / her constituents," spokeswoman Jodi Whitaker said. "They get people their Social Security checks, Medicare payments, veteran benefits." Our ruling A DCCC ad says Barr is belittling military service while emphasizing the role of holding political office. Barr did compare military service with being a politician. But the ad doesn’t present the full quote, making what Barr said appear to be much worse than it was. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09110	U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett is “the most liberal man in the United States Congress.”	false	/texas/statements/2010/jun/20/donna-campbell/gop-nominee-says-lloyd-doggett-austin-no-1-liberal/	Rousing delegates to the Republican Party of Texas’s state convention, physician Donna Campbell of Columbus lit into her November foe, calling U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, “the most liberal man in the United States Congress.” Campbell’s characterization June 12 touched off a supportive outburst from the partisans gathered in Dallas. No doubt, Doggett, elected to the House in 1994 after stints as a state senator and Texas Supreme Court justice, has long been a liberal—proudly so. We wondered, though, if he’s among the nation’s most liberal members compared, say, to solons from other left-leaning districts. When we reached Campbell to seek the basis for her statement, she couldn’t immediately visit; she was on duty in a hospital. Next, we endeavored to gauge Doggett's liberal lean following a methodology forged by PolitiFact in Washington when it explored a similar charge. In June 2008, the expected GOP presidential nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain, said then-Sen. Barack Obama had accumulated the Senate’s most liberal voting record. PolitiFact found that Barely True. Also, we presumed that despite her wording, Campbell was comparing Doggett to all his colleagues, male and female, in the House and Senate. But for our analysis, we limited ourselves to the 435-member House; that seemed both reasonable and more doable than trying to compare Doggett's record to every other member of the House and Senate. We started our check by clicking to online ratings compiled by the National Journal, a nonpartisan political magazine. According to the Journal, Doggett’s 2009 voting record made him the House’s 163rd most liberal member, more so on social issues than economic or foreign policy, according to its tabulation of 92 House votes. From Texas alone, seven other Democrats had more liberal records, the Journal said. We also looked at the two preceding years. According to the Journal, Doggett’s votes in 2007 and 2008 made him the House’s 119th most liberal member and 97th most liberal member, respectively, in those years—not No. 1. Congressional Quarterly doesn’t rate members on a conservative-liberal teeter-totter. Instead it gauges whether members vote in step with the president or their party. In 2009, CQ says, Doggett voted with President Obama 89 percent of the time and with his party 95 percent of the time. According to an online chart, Doggett’s votes land landed him among members most likely to support their party and president, which does not put him in centrist company. Still, about 200 members, all Democrats, voted more often than Doggett in accord with Obama and about 175 members were more likely to vote the Democratic Party’s way, CQ charts suggest. For another comparison, we turned to voteview.com, a site overseen by Keith Poole, a political scientist at the University of Georgia. According to voteview’s latest review of the House, Doggett is about the 117th most liberal member. Poole told us in an e-mail there is “no denying that Doggett is a conventional liberal but he is not an ‘extreme’ liberal.” After we alerted Campbell to how Doggett was rated by the outside measures, she replied in an e-mail: “It absolutely would have been more accurate (for me) to include the phrase ‘one of the most’” instead of saying Doggett was the most liberal man in Congress. “I’m not a practiced or polished politician and public speaking, like for many of us, is a skill I’m still honing,” Campbell said. “Before hundreds, or thousands of eyes, I sometimes speed too quickly through what I’d like to say. The point I was making is that Mr. Doggett’s ideology is considerably more liberal than mine, and considerably more liberal than what many, many Central Texans are telling me they want to see in their U.S. representative.” So, how does the doctor’s convention charge stick? Like melting butter. Doggett is liberal, but he’s by no measure the most liberal member of Congress, voting analyses show. Campbell owned up after we followed up. Her statement is False.

pomt-12661	Under "Trumpcare," the Republican replacement for Obamacare, "$600 billion worth of tax breaks will go to the wealthiest in this country."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/21/mark-pocan/americas-wealthiest-get-600-billion-tax-breaks-rep/	U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who helped put himself through college by working as a magician, has continued his performing since joining Congress. In the March 20, 2017 episode of "Magic Mondays," his regular video feature, the Wisconsin Democrat appeared to make part of a playing card move from his closed hand into an assistant’s hand. The purpose of the trick was to attack the Republican replacement for Obamacare, which is championed by U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, supported by President Donald Trump and up for a House vote on March 23, 2017. Under "Trumpcare," as Pocan calls the proposal, "$600 billion worth of tax breaks will go to the wealthiest in this country." That figure has made headlines. But Pocan’s claim, while partially on target, suffers from saying that all the money would go to "the wealthiest." Previous claims Recent claims about what is formally known as the American Health Care Act -- including two portraying it as a sop to the rich -- have gotten mixed reviews on the Truth-O-Meter. Mostly False: A claim from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat who previously held Pocan’s seat, that "TrumpCare" would let insurance executives "personally make millions off your health care." One provision pegged at $400 million over 10 years is a tax break for corporations, not executives, and there’s no way to know how much of it would be turned into compensation for executives. Mostly True: A claim by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that the GOP legislation gives "$275 billion in tax breaks for the top 2 percent, people earning $250,000 a year or more." The savings over 10 years is projected to benefit the top 4.4 percent. Half True: Ryan’s claim that the legislation "will lower premiums." For people who buy health insurance on their own, premiums are expected to be higher than Obamacare in 2018 and 2019, but lower than Obamacare after that. The $600 billion It’s important to remember that the claims in those fact checks, along with the one by Pocan, were made about the original GOP replacement proposal -- prior to tweaks made in the days leading up to the expected House vote. The widely reported $600 billion in tax breaks comes from a solid source: estimates made by Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, which is staffed by independent professionals. That’s the value over 10 years (2017 through 2026) of repealing nearly all the taxes contained in Obamacare and making other tax changes. To evaluate Pocan’s characterization of the $600 billion, we relied on analyses done by two expert nonprofit organizations -- the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Tax Policy Center. Here’s our breakdown: $275 billion to high-income earners by repealing two taxes: $158 billion: A 3.8 percent tax applied to capital gains, dividend and interest income for families with $250,000 or more in income ($200,000 for singles). $117 billion: Medicare surtax -- a 0.9 percent tax hike on wage income in excess of $250,000 a year for couples ($200,000 for singles). It’s arguable whether households earning $250,000 per year are "the wealthiest," but they are clearly on the high end of the income scale. According to the Tax Policy Center: About 90 percent of the benefit from repealing the investment tax would go to the top 1 percent of earners, who make $700,000 or more. And more than 99 percent of people would get no benefit from repeal of the Medicare surtax, while those in the top 1 percent would get three-quarters of the benefit—an average tax cut of $7,300. The rest of the $600 billion can be broken into two categories. $190 billion to businesses by repealing three taxes: $145 billion: A tax on health insurance companies based on their market share. $25 billion: Annual fee paid by prescription drugmakers and importers. $20 billion: A 2.3 percent excise tax on medical device makers and importers. Both Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center and Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget told us these are a mixed bag. Repealing the taxes helps shareholders of those corporations, who tend to be wealthier; but they would also help a broad swath of people through lower prices. $122 billion to a variety of individuals through tax changes: $49 billion: Postponing the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost health plans actually helps middle-income taxpayers, the Tax Policy Center says. $35 billion: Allowing more tax deductions for medical expenses -- starting at 7.5 percent of income, rather than 10 percent. This tends to help middle- and upper-income people, given that the rich are well insured and the poor don’t pay income taxes. $19 billion: Repealing a cap of $2,500 on the pre-tax dollars workers could put into flexible spending accounts annually. Poorer people can’t afford to put more than $2,500 aside for medical expenses, but this change benefits middle-income folks as well as the wealthiest. $19 billion: Increasing, to $6,550 for an individual and $13,100 for couples, the amount that could be put annually into a Health Savings Account. Similar impact as the pre-tax change. Our rating Pocan says that under "Trumpcare," the Republican replacement for Obamacare, "$600 billion worth of tax breaks will go to the wealthiest in this country." Not all of the $600 billion in tax breaks (over 10 years) would go to the wealthiest Americans. But nearly half -- $275 billion -- would almost exclusively benefit only people on the highest end of the income scale. And the wealthiest, along with middle- and lower-income Americans, would benefit from the remainder of the tax breaks. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.

pomt-04083	"In total, we have added nearly 75,000 private sector jobs in New Jersey since we took office in January 2010."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/20/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-states-gained-75000-private-se/	New Jersey’s unemployment rate continues to hover above the rest of the nation but jobs are growing in the Garden State, according to Gov. Chris Christie. The growth is so good that Christie highlighted job gains during his State of the State address on Jan. 8. "In total, we have added nearly 75,000 private sector jobs in New Jersey since we took office in January 2010," he told lawmakers in Trenton. Christie has had a mixed bag of results from the Truth-O-Meter when it comes to claims about jobs. This time, however, he’s on target. Let’s review the facts. Christie became governor on Jan. 19, 2010, so we’ll measure private-sector job growth from that month, as well as February 2010 – his first full month in office. Also, since Christie gave his State of the State address on Jan. 8, we’re looking at job growth through November 2012. The December jobs numbers didn’t come out until Thursday, but we’ll note those figures later. New Jersey had 3,203,200 jobs in January 2010 and 3,269,900 jobs in November 2012, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s a net gain of 66,700 jobs. But Christie’s figure is on the mark if we start the jobs clock a month later. New Jersey had 3,197,600 private-sector jobs in February 2010 and 3,269,900 jobs in November 2012, according to BLS data. That net gain is 72,300 jobs. But 75,000 isn’t the highest private-sector jobs number that New Jersey has seen during Christie’s tenure. In a July 2, 2012 speech to the state Legislature, where he presented his case for a tax cut, Christie said the state had added "nearly 85,000 private-sector jobs" since Feburary 2010. Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor with the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said New Jersey’s jobs losses from June through October 2012 was at odds with national job growth. October’s Hurricane Sandy resulted in more significant job losses in November, but employment started to realign in December, he said. And seasonal hires were only part of the story for a major upswing in job growth announced Thursday: employers added 30,200 workers from across all major labor sectors to their payrolls. Factoring in those numbers, New Jersey’s private-sector job growth from February 2010 through December 2012 is 103,200, Seneca said. "Moving into 2013, New Jersey’s economy is poised to continue to grow," Seneca said. "There are still question marks out there with the federal fiscal debt and potential government shutdown and all the drama in Washington being played out again, but the December numbers are a big relief and catch up from what had been a pretty weak prior six months, but it’s much more consistent now with what’s been happening nationally." Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak and Kevin Roberts did not return a request for comment. Our ruling Christie said during his State of the State address, "In total, we have added nearly 75,000 private sector jobs in New Jersey since we took office in January 2010." If measured from January 2010, New Jersey’s job growth through November 2012 (December jobs figures didn’t come out until Thursday) was 66,700 jobs. Measured from February 2010 – Christie’s first full month in office – the net private-sector gains are 72,300 jobs. The numbers only get better. After the release of December’s job figures, New Jersey’s net private-sector job growth since January 2010 is 97,600 jobs. From February 2010, it’s 103,200 jobs. We rate the governor’s statement True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2013-01-20T07:30:00	2013-01-08	['New_Jersey']
pomt-05773	A Dallas proof-of-insurance ordinance resulted in area tow lots mostly filling with the cars of illegal residents.	false	/texas/statements/2012/feb/28/chain-email/chain-email-says-dallas-ordinance-led-towing-many-/	This just in from a chain email: An action by the Dallas City Council led to many local vehicles getting impounded, 80-plus percent of them belonging to illegal immigrants. Really? We scoped this out with Dallas authorities, who told us the claim, making the rounds for years on the Internet, reflects a council decision but is not accurate about related impoundments and couldn’t possibly be rooted in solid sources. More on cars piling up soon, but first, let’s air the email’s particulars, which were passed to us by a reader. "Has Dallas, Texas Got a Good Idea or What?" reads the email’s subject line, which concludes with an enthusiastic "GO Dallas!" The email itself says a Dallas ordinance passed in 2008 requires that drivers who are pulled over by law enforcement provide proof of insurance. If they can’t do that, the email says, their car is towed -- and proof of insurance is required to retrieve the car. And, the email continues: "Shortly after the "No Insurance" ordinance was passed, the Dallas impound lots began to fill up and (they) were full after only nine days. 80"-plus percent "of the impounded cars were driven by illegal’s," an indecorous (and ungrammatical) reference to undocumented residents. The chain email’s claims have been posted at least 50 times since Sept. 2010. We saw it on websites like Sodahead.com, Truthorfiction.com and in myriad online forums. None of the posts offered backup information. We checked, and found Dallas indeed has such an ordinance. According to an online city summary, the ordinance says that "drivers stopped for a traffic violation who cannot show proof of auto insurance meeting state requirements will be issued a citation and will have his or her vehicle towed at the owner’s expense." However, The Dallas Morning News reported in a Dec. 30, 2008 news article that police officers may use discretion in deciding whether the car will be impounded. In a telephone interview, Mitchell Rasansky, a former Dallas City Council member and a champion of the 2008 ordinance, said that he offered the change because "the people who are really being hurt by (uninsured motorists) are the middle- and lower-income people who get hit, and somebody who hit them doesn’t have insurance." Rasanky said he was unaware of how many cars have since been impounded or if affected drivers included many illegal immigrants. Scott Walton, spokesman for the Dallas Police Department, separately told us: "If you’ve ever been in an accident and found that the other person is not insured, it really does put a financial burden on you.The city really wants to make sure that anyone traveling through Dallas meets state requirements and don’t get put in that situation." Since 1982, it’s been against Texas law to drive without being able to pay for accidents one causes, a requirement most residents meet by having auto insurance, according to John Greeley, a public information officer at the Texas Department of Insurance. Austin police issue tickets to such drivers, according to Austin Police Department spokeswoman Veneza Aguinaga, but vehicles aren’t impounded. Cars that are towed by law enforcement are taken to the Dallas Police Department’s auto pound. Walton took issue with the email’s claim that those impound lots were full after nine days. "It never reached even close to capacity after this was implemented," he said. And has the Dallas ordinance disproportionately affected residents who are in the country illegally? Walton told us there’s no way to prove the figure the email offers because police officers don’t usually ask whether individuals are citizens in these situations. "We (also) do not check citizenship or the status of immigration when people come to claim their car," he said. "I don’t know where that (percentage) came from." Next, we explored another angle that might help independently evaluate the email: If illegal immigrants cannot obtain auto insurance, then perhaps they couldn’t be recovering their cars. Greeley of the TDI advised, though, that Texas residents do not have to show they are legally in the country before purchasing vehicle insurance. Finally, we ran the chain email by Steve Blow, a news columnist for the Dallas Morning News who has written about the city’s impoundment of vehicles. In his opinion, Blow said, the email has a grain of truth and a lot of fiction. "I know the line about the impound lot filling up is wrong," Blow said in an email. "That was one of the predictions that never happened. I have no idea where the 80 percent illegals figure comes from. Cops don’t inquire about citizenship. And I have heard nothing about accident rates plunging 47 percent. If that were true, I think police officials would have been eager to make that known." Our ruling Dallas has an ordinance that has led to cars getting impounded. Yet we found no evidence supporting the email’s linchpin claim that about 80 percent of the cars initially impounded belonged to illegal residents. There’s not even a factual way to reach that figure; Dallas authorities don’t usually check the legal residency status of motorists. We rate this chain email False.

pomt-14154	"Bernie Sanders voted with Republicans to protect the Minutemen, a hate group that used military tactics against our community."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/apr/30/julian-castro/julian-castro-claims-bernie-sanders-voted-republic/	Housing Secretary Julián Castro, a surrogate for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, took aim at Bernie Sanders’ record on immigration during the senator’s former elected capacity as an Independent member of the U.S. House from 1991 to 2007. Sanders "voted with Republicans to protect the Minutemen, a hate group that used military tactics against our community," Castro, a former San Antonio mayor, said in a statement rolled out by the Clinton camp March 8, 2016, the day that Sen. Sanders of Vermont won an upset victory in the party’s Michigan presidential primary. Clinton leveled a similar claim about Sanders and the Minutemen at a Democratic debate in Miami the next day; PolitiFact found her statement Mostly True. Unlike Castro, she did not call the Minuteman Project a hate group. Democrats tend to support comprehensive immigration reform including possible citizenship for residents living in the country without legal permission. Sanders, an Independent, caucused with Democrats in the House and later in the Senate. So it’s arguably not helpful at the polls for him to be seen as supporting the Minuteman Project, which came into the spotlight in 2005 when its founders organized a volunteer stakeout of parts of the Arizona-Mexico border for the month of April. One of the co-founders of the Minuteman Project, Chris Simcox, parted ways with the project and established the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps in 2005. The remaining founder, Jim Gilchrist, was fired from the Minuteman Project in 2007, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. The groups spawned a network of chapters over the years, driven by a combination of growth and internal conflict over finances and other issues. Some chapters were not close to the border and focused on anti-immigration advocacy, while others voluntarily patrolled the U.S.-side of the border with Mexico. Those patrols and confrontation with undocumented immigrants prompted then-President George W. Bush to disparage them as "vigilantes" and a former Mexican president to call them "immigrant hunters," the Washington Post reported in 2005. But the Minuteman Project and Minuteman Civil Defense Corps websites in 2005 and 2006 explicitly described their cause as "peaceful" and urged members to follow the letter of the law while patrolling the border, or risk discrediting their cause. In the claim, Castro, like Clinton, was referencing a vote on an amendment to a 2006 appropriations bill. The amendment was proposed by Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia in response to rumors that the U.S. Border Patrol had been telling the Mexican government where vigilante civilian border groups were stationed. The 2006 CQ Almanac described it as follows: "Kingston, R-Ga., amendment that would bar the use of funds in the bill to provide a foreign government with information that relates to the operations or location of the Minutemen or other private volunteer border patrol groups along the U.S.-Mexican border, unless the information sharing is required by an international treaty." On the House floor, Kingston explained, "What this amendment does is it clarifies Congress' position on a Border Patrol practice or a practice of the U.S. Government that tips off illegal immigrants as to where citizen patrols may be located. ... What my amendment does is simply says that the U.S. Government cannot tip off the Mexican officials as to where these folks are located." At the time, Rep. Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn., said he didn’t oppose it because it essentially restated existing Customs and Border Patrol policy. PolitiFact found that Clinton got Sanders’ vote right — he did vote with the GOP for the amendment, House records show — but downplayed what had been a bipartisan vote where 76 Democrats joined 216 Republicans in support. But unlike Clinton, Castro described the Minuteman Project as "a hate group." So, is the Minuteman Project a hate group — and did Sanders’ vote really protect them? Requests for clarification from Castro led to Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, reaching out via email and directing us to the Southern Poverty Law Center’s list of nativist extremist groups. The SPLC was established in 1971 and is listed as an outreach partner by the FBI, according to the agency’s website. The SPLC list doesn’t designate the Minuteman Project a hate group, unlike some other groups on their list of nativist extremists, which are marked with an asterisk to denote that they are both nativist extremist and hate groups. We wondered what moves a group into hate-group territory. By phone, Mark Potok, a center expert, told us "the nativist extremist groups are a step towards the center." "Basically, those are the groups which go beyond merely disagreeing with immigration policy and confront, personally, suspected illegal immigrants, or people who would help or hire them," he said, adding: "We don't list a group just for saying they think immigration levels ought to be lower." Potok continued, "the thing to understand about our hate group listing is it's not based on criminality or violence. It’s based on the ideology expressed by the group, on its website or by its leaders. We ask, does it demonize an entire group? Those are the hardest line groups we cover." The SPLC’s website defines hate groups as those that "have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics." Potok said that in 2006, the year the vote Castro referenced took place, nativist extremist groups were on the rise after beginning to emerge around 2005. Activity peaked in 2010, he said, when the center tallied 319 groups. In 2015, the SPLC counted only 17 such groups. "A lot of these [extremist nativist groups] were spinoffs of the Minutemen groups," Potok said, "but not all." Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, said in a phone interview that Jim Gilchrist, one of the co-founders of the Minuteman Project, was receptive when Levin approached him to deal with neo-Nazi elements in the organization, and that differences of opinion on how to handle that issue contributed to the fissure creating the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps. "Certainly there were entities in the border movement that were clearly racist hate groups, and certainly there were people who were in the Minuteman Project at the time who were, but I can tell you that [Jim] Gilchrist wanted those people excluded, and after I informed him, he took measures to do," he said. In our research, we found that coverage of the project’s offshoots has been dominated by several high-profile criminal cases that happened in the years between 2006 and today. In 2009, a former member of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps murdered a Latino man and his 9-year-old daughter after breaking into their home, CNN reported. In 2013, Minuteman Project and Minuteman Civil Defense Corps co-founder Chris Simcox was arrested for child sexual molestation, according to Univision. These incidents have taken a toll on the reputation of the groups (for instance, in 2010, the NAACP referred to the Minuteman Project as "a nativist organization that has in the past been associated with the murder of migrant Mexican workers as part of its vigilante "border operations"). But it doesn't make sense to judge Sanders’ House vote on incidents that came after it occurred. So what information on the project was available at the time of the vote? A report from the Congressional Research Service, dated April 7, 2006, cited many potential problems that could arise with civilian border patrols, but also said that "apart from the widely reported incident involving Ranch Rescue [an extremist anti-immigration group that dressed in military gear and went looking for armed drug smugglers in 2002], there have been no credible reports of civilian border patrol organizations engaging in violence against migrants." Some scholars of the Minuteman Project, like Leo Chavez, an anthropologist at UC Irvine who has written about the group, have suggested that press coverage and creating a spectacle were central to the group’s purpose ("Although monitoring the U.S.- Mexico border was Gilchrist’s immediate objective, the larger goal was to use the "citizen patrols" on the border to draw attention to Gilchrist’s larger aim of influencing public opinion and federal immigration policy," he wrote). Christopher J. Walker, an associate professor of law at Ohio State’s Moritz College of Law, echoed this view in an article in the Harvard Latino Law Review, writing, "More than anything else, the Minutemen seek media attention." Todd Gutnick, communications director for the Anti-Defamation League, told us by email, "We have always referred to the Minutemen Project (of that period) as anti-immigrant extremists, who had racists/haters in their rank and file, but not specifically a hate group," when asked about the ADL’s view of the Project circa 2006. Sanders campaign policy director Warren Gunnels told us by email that Sanders "did not vote to protect the minuteman. This amendment simply stated what was already law at that time. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has never shared information with the Mexican government except when required by treaty." Although Sabo said it didn’t reflect a change in existing law, 106 out of 201 Democrats at the time still voted against it; 19 did not vote. We reached out to Kingston for his perspective on the amendment. "It wasn’t an extremist group, they weren’t violent, they weren’t making threats, it wasn’t anything like that at all," he said by phone. "It passed overwhelmingly. I may have spoken to Bernie about it at the time, I don’t remember, but it wasn’t an extremist position. To me, it was common sense." "It was a minor vote. I’ve gotten calls from a few other reporters that started a few months ago. I didn’t even remember the thing itself until they started asking me about it," he said. Our attempts to reach the Minuteman Project by phone and via its website proved unsuccessful. Our ruling Castro, a surrogate for the Clinton campaign, said: "Bernie Sanders voted with Republicans to protect the Minutemen, a hate group that used military tactics against our community." Sanders, then an Independent in the House, voted with 75 Democrats to restrict the U.S. from alerting Mexico to Minutemen operations on the border. However, we didn’t see any evidence that this since-weakened extremist group was designated a "hate group." On balance, we rate this claim as Half True.

pomt-09857	"If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/11/barack-obama/barack-obama-promises-you-can-keep-your-health-ins/	At a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Aug. 11, 2009, President Barack Obama repeated a line he's used many times in describing his health care proposal: "If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan." On one level, Obama is correct. His plan seeks to build on the system we have now, where most people get health insurance through their employers. The plan also aims to cover the uninsured and reduce costs for everyone. Back during the campaign, we rated a similar statement True , based on the fact that his plan does seek to build on the existing system, where about 60 percent of Americans get health insurance through work. Now, close to a year later, we finally have detailed bills to examine. They closely mirror what Obama promised during the campaign. But the plans also introduce new ways of regulating health insurance companies that will surely change the current health care system. That could prompt employers to change their health plans, and we find Obama's statement less clear-cut now than it once seemed. At a news conference on June 23, 2009, Jake Tapper of ABC News asked Obama about the possibility of changes in coverage. Tapper's question centered on the public option on the health care exchange. Before we go any further, we want to explain in the plainest terms possible what the exchange is and what the public option is. The health insurance exchange is a virtual marketplace where individuals and small businesses can go to buy health insurance. Employer-provided insurance offered by large companies, on the other hand, will continue as is, though Democrats have ideas on lowering costs that they hope will end up benefiting these plans, too. (In the interests of brevity, we're not going to go into all the cost-saving aspects here.) The government would regulate the exchange so that insurance companies can't discriminate against people who have pre-existing conditions, or charge wildly different amounts for similar coverage. One of the options on the exchange will be a public option that offers basic coverage. Obama has said the public option will keep private insurers honest by competing with them and not allowing them to charge unfair rates for the basics. Many experts believe that the public option will be the least expensive option on the exchange. Jake Tapper's hypothetical Back to Tapper's question: If the public option is cheapest, Tapper said, "then lots of employers will want to have their employees covered by that cheaper plan, which will not have to be for-profit, unlike private plans, and may, possibly, benefit from some government subsidies, who knows. And then their employees would be signed up for this public plan, which would violate what you're promising the American people, that they will not have to change health care plans if they like the plan they have." So Tapper is suggesting that many employers will be allowed onto the exchange and will pick the public option, which would clearly change some people's health plans. Here is the core of Obama's somewhat lengthy answer: "When I say if you have your plan and you like it, or you have a doctor and you like your doctor, that you don't have to change plans, what I'm saying is the government is not going to make you change plans under health reform. ... Let's say that we take the advice of some folks who are out there and say, 'Oh, this is not the time to do health care. We can't afford it. It's too complicated. Let's take our time,' et cetera. So let's assume that nothing happened. I can guarantee you that there's the possibility for a whole lot of Americans out there that they're not going to end up having the same health care they have. Because what's going to happen is, as costs keep on going up, employers are going to start making decisions: 'We've got to raise premiums on our employees. In some cases, we can't provide health insurance at all.' And so there are going to be a whole set of changes out there. That's exactly why health reform is so important." So Obama's saying that the government will not force employers to change their health plans. Fair enough. But Tapper's hypothetical isn't wrong either, and we want to explain it in more detail. As we've already noted, the health insurance exchange is where individuals and small businesses go to shop for health insurance. The government intends to regulate it, and the exchange will have a public option that includes basic coverage. But there are many things about the exchange and the public option that have yet to be finalized in Congress. For starters, it's not clear whether the public option will be subsidized by the government or if it will have to finance itself with only patient premiums. (Note that Tapper said it would "possibly benefit from some government subsidies, who knows.") Obama has said that the public option should be self-sustaining, but this is not settled. In the House, fiscally conservative Democrats known as Blue Dogs won a concession from other Democrats that the public option will have to negotiate payments to doctors. This would tend to put the public option on more equal footing with private health insurance companies. Another implication of Tapper's question is that "lots" of employers would be able to have access to the exchange. But we don't know if this is so. Pending legislation in the House says that only individuals and small businesses of fewer than 10 employees would be able to use the exchange during the first year, and only individuals and small businesses with fewer than 20 employees in the second year. In the third year, businesses are allowed in "based on the number of full-time employees of an employer and such other considerations as the Commissioner deems appropriate." This sounds like employers will gradually be allowed into the exchange based on size, as well as "other considerations as the (health exchange) Commissioner deems appropriate." This obviously gives tremendous leeway to the commissioner, who is presidential appointee in charge of the health exchange. So year three becomes a question mark as to how many businesses will be allowed into the exchange. Questions about the public option Conservative critics of the Democratic plans believe these questions surrounding the public option and the exchange are critical to determining whether people will indeed keep their coverage. "The two most important factors are who is eligible for the public plan, and what are premiums in the public plan, compared with private insurers," said Greg D'Angelo, a policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation. The foundation believes that the reform package will encourage employers to change or drop their health insurance and send their employees into the exchange to buy their own insurance. "Any change in policy will change the incentives in the system, and you have to understand what is likely to happen," D'Angelo said. "Employers will change or drop coverage, and individuals will have little to no say in the matter." If you accept the premise that employers will opt for the least expensive plan available, then millions of people should expect that their employers will change plans under the reform bill, he said. The main response to this objection from supporters of reform is just what Obama said during the press conference: Employers can change health care plans right now, and they often do. Still, the legislative details that have emerged on health care reform indicate that if reform passes, we're headed for some significant changes in how health care operates. Obama certainly intends to leave the current system intact. But at this point, it seems too pat to say, "If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan." It seems likely that at least some people will have employers who decide to change plans when different plans become available, most likely any small businesses that currently offer health insurance. They will be allowed into the exchange right away, and it seems likely some might find a better deal there and change plans. Until the legislation gets closer to a final stage, it's difficult to say how many employers will likely opt to change coverage. But clearly some change is coming. It's not realistic for Obama to make blanket statements that "you" will be able to "keep your health care plan." It seems like rhetoric intended to soothe people that health care reform will not be overly disruptive. But one of the points of reform is to change the way health care works right now. So we rate Obama's statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-08-11T18:05:34	2009-08-11	['None']

pomt-06466	"When we got the income tax in 1913, the top rate was 7 percent. By 1980, the top rate was 70 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/18/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-top-income-tax-rate-rose-7-p/	During the Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., said, "When we got the income tax in 1913, the top rate was 7 percent. By 1980, the top rate was 70 percent." Is she correct? We turned to the website of the Tax Foundation, which has a document that lists every tax bracket since the imposition of the federal income tax in 1913. It turns out Bachmann is right. In 1913, the federal tax code levied income taxes ranging from 1 percent to 7 percent, with the top rate of 7 percent levied on incomes of $500,000 and above (or the current equivalent of $11,332,304). At that time, there were no distinctions in filing status, such as individuals or married filing jointly. By 1980 -- just before Ronald Reagan ascended to the presidency -- the top rate was 70 percent for all filing categories. The top rate kicked in at $108,300 for individuals and $215,400 for married couples filing jointly, or $294,907 and $586,546, respectively, in today’s money. For comparison’s sake, the top rate today for all categories is 35 percent. And the top rate was actually higher before the 1980 level of 70 percent that Bachmann cited. For every year between1944 to 1963, the top tax rate exceeded 90 percent. Our ruling Bachmann has accurately presented the historical tax rates for the two years she cited. We rate her statement True.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-10-18T23:31:30	2011-10-18	['None']
pomt-02846	Says Thomas Jefferson said, "You might be able to fool the people for awhile, and they may go astray, but sooner or later the American people are going to wake up and they will correct the course."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/19/herman-cain/herman-cain-changes-jefferson-quotation/	We’ve noticed that pundits like to quote the words of leaders from the past. The practice is so common, that PunditFact has decided, from time to time, to check for accuracy. There seems to be a cottage industry in misquoting Thomas Jefferson. He didn’t say, "The price of liberty is eternal vigilance." Nor, "My reading of history convinces me that most bad government has grown out of too much government," nor any variations of those or dozens of other pithy phrases wrongly attributed to our illustrious third president. But one-time Republican presidential candidate and former pizza franchise executive Herman Cain was at least in the ballpark when he cited Jefferson recently. Cain was explaining the reasons Obamacare was failing on a recent Web video broadcast. "As Thomas Jefferson said, 'You might be able to fool the people for a while, and they may go astray, but sooner or later the American people are going to wake up and they will correct the course’," Cain said. Peter Onuf, historian at the University of Virginia and author of Jefferson’s Empire: The Language of American Nationhood, recognizes Jefferson's spirit in Cain’s rendition. But not Jefferson's words. "It's a Jeffersonian sentiment, but I can pretty confidently say those are not his words," Onuf said. Other Jefferson historians, Jan Ellen Lewis at Rutgers and Annette Gordon-Reed at Harvard, also drew a blank on Cain’s’ paraphrasing. Jefferson is misquoted so often, the Jefferson Foundation at Monticello has assembled a page called Spurious Quotations. We emailed Cain TV and they told us that the original line from Jefferson was, "The good sense of the people will always be found to be the best army. They may be led astray for a moment, but will soon correct themselves." We will sort out in a moment the differences between what Jefferson said and what Cain said that he said, but first we should confirm the accuracy of the original text Cain provided us. At Princeton University, the Papers of Thomas Jefferson has been compiling and cataloguing Jefferson’s words for 70 years. Editorial assistant Linda Monaco searched the digital files of the project’s "Main Series," "Retirement Series," "the Jeffersonian Cyclopedia" and the unpublished documents of Jefferson’s presidential years. Result? The quote Cain provided us (not the one he said in his Web video) is indeed Jefferson. "This is a Thomas Jefferson quote," Monaco said. "It is from Jefferson to Edward Carrington, 16 January 1787." So the question is, if Cain did not quote Jefferson word for word, how close did he come? Well, he captured the key words 'the people,' 'astray' and 'correct.' He tacked on the part about fooling the people; that might have come from Lincoln’s line about fooling all of the people some of the time. He also added a phrase about waking up. In sum, he captured Jefferson’s meaning and some of the key words but embellished freely. It is telling that none of the experts recognized Cain’s version, nor could the researchers at the Letters of Thomas Jefferson find the source based on what he originally said. Our ruling Cain said that Thomas Jefferson said, "You might be able to fool the people for a while, and they may go astray, but sooner or later the American people are going to wake up and they will correct the course." Jefferson did write a line that resembles that in some important ways, but Cain put a fair number of words into Jefferson’s mouth. At PunditFact, we believe quotations should be relatively word-for-word accurate. If someone went to the trouble to leave their thoughts for posterity, the least we should do is honor what they actually said. We rate the claim Half True.

The original fact-check and rating remain unchanged. In one of the most heated moments of the final presidential debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed over Russia’s interference in the current election. Speaking of the WikiLeaks’ release of tens of thousands of emails from the Clinton campaign and, earlier, the Democratic National Committee, Trump said Clinton had no idea who hacked and released the emails — "Russia, China or anybody else." Clinton responded by asking Trump if he really doesn’t believe the 17 federal intelligence agencies that have said Russia is behind the cyberattack. "We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election," Clinton said. "I find that deeply disturbing." Back in July, when WikiLeaks released the DNC emails, the government hadn’t yet named a culprit. On Oct. 7, however — the same day WikiLeaks released the emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta — the Homeland Security Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a joint statement that said, "The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations." The statement added that the recent hacks "are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process." The statement also said the intelligence community believes these attacks are directed from top levels of the Russian government, as Clinton said. "We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities," the statement said. The U.S. Intelligence Community is made up of 17 agencies, forming the basis of Clinton’s claim. The 17 agencies are: Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The 17 separate agencies did not independently declare Russia the perpetrator behind the hacks. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said that this cuts against Clinton’s point, saying, "It is unlikely that all 16 of the agencies had looked independently at the Russian connection, which is what Clinton seemed to indicate." (Cheung said 16 agencies because he omitted the Office of the Director of National Intelligence from his count.) However, as the head of the 17-agency intelligence community, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, headed by James Clapper, speaks on behalf of the group. Our ruling Clinton said, "We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election." We don’t know how many separate investigations into the attacks they were. But the Director of National Intelligence, which speaks for the country’s 17 federal intelligence agencies, released a joint statement saying the intelligence community at large is confident that Russia is behind recent hacks into political organizations’ emails. The statement sourced the attacks to the highest levels of the Russian government and said they are designed to interfere with the current election. We rate Clinton’s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/542ece9a-ae39-433c-8215-4a41906b75c9 Update, June 6, 2017: Clapper's May testimony was about a newer report, not October assessment The now former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made a comment when speaking before Congress May 8, 2017, that some readers interpreted as going against our findings in this article. Here’s why we disagree with that interpretation. We wrote this article Oct. 19, 2016, responding to an Oct. 7, 2016, joint statement from Clapper’s former office, which oversees the entire intelligence community, and Homeland Security. Clapper’s May 2017 congressional testimony, on the other hand, was about the much more comprehensive January 2017 report produced by the CIA, FBI and NSA. The process of putting that report together didn’t start until months after we published this article, in December 2016, at which point the intelligence community decided to restrict the investigation to those three agencies. Here’s what Clapper said, according to Congressional Quarterly. ("ICA" refers to the January 2017 "intelligence community assessment.") "Additionally, I'll briefly address four related topics that have emerged since the ICA was produced. Because of both classification and some executive privilege strictures requested by the White House, there are limits to what I can discuss. And of course my direct official knowledge of any of this stopped on 20 January when my term of office was happily over. "As you know, the (ICA) was a coordinated product from three agencies; CIA, NSA, and the FBI not all 17 components of the intelligence community. Those three under the aegis of my former office. Following an extensive intelligence reporting about many Russian efforts to collect on and influence the outcome of the presidential election, President Obama asked us to do this in early December and have it completed before the end of his term." The January report presented its findings by saying "we assess," with "we" meaning "an assessment by all three agencies." The October statement, on the other hand, said "The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident" in its assessment. As we noted in the article, the 17 separate agencies did not independently come to this conclusion, but as the head of the intelligence community, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence speaks on behalf of the group. We stand by our rating.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-10-19T23:15:20	2016-10-19	['None']
pomt-03434	"There are over 2,000 crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the U.K.," compared to "466 violent crimes per 100,000" in the United States.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/24/blog-posting/social-media-post-says-uk-has-far-higher-violent-c/	The debate over gun policy has inspired a blizzard of messages on social media, from both supporters and opponents of gun control. We’ve checked some of these posts (often called "memes") in the past, but a reader recently sent us one we hadn’t seen, so we decided to take a look. The meme said: "There are over 2,000 crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the U.K., making it the most violent place in Europe. Austria is second, with a rate of 1,677 per 100,000 people, followed by Sweden, Belgium, Finland and Holland. By comparison, America has an estimated rate of 466 violent crimes per 100,000. … So hey, Europe, how ‘bout you shut the #%$@ up about gun control?" The meme includes a lot of figures, so we started out by looking at the United Kingdom and the United States. As we were conducting our research, we stumbled across a thoughtful critique of this claim on a blog called the Skeptical Libertarian that was written by Daniel Bier, a master’s degree candidate in economics at Rutgers University. (Bier fact-checked a claim that’s similar, though with slightly different wording than the meme we’re checking.) Bier’s primary concern about comparing crime rates in the United Kingdom and the United States is that the definitions of crimes in each country are significantly different. This was not reflected in news coverage in British newspapers that appear to have been the source of the meme. This oversight produced a misleading comparison. As Bier put it, "The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports defines a ‘violent crime’ as one of four specific offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault." By contrast, "the British definition includes all ‘crimes against the person,’ including simple assaults, all robberies, and all ‘sexual offenses,’ as opposed to the FBI, which only counts aggravated assaults and ‘forcible rapes.’ " Once you know this, Bier wrote, "it becomes clear how misleading it is to compare rates of violent crime in the U.S. and the U.K. You’re simply comparing two different sets of crimes." We thought Bier’s points were reasonable, so we tried to replicate his approach. We looked at the raw violent crime numbers for each country, using statistics for England and Wales for 2012 and for the United States for 2011, in a way that sought to compare apples to apples. (We should note that the United Kingdom includes Scotland and Northern Ireland, but the numbers in the meme appear to be based only on crime in England and Wales, which are calculated separately.) For England and Wales, we added together three crime categories: "violence against the person, with injury," "most serious sexual crime," and "robbery." This produced a rate of 775 violent crimes per 100,000 people. For the United States, we used the FBI’s four standard categories for violent crime that Bier cited. We came up with a rate of 383 violent crimes per 100,000 people. This calculation suggests that there is a higher rate of crime in England and Wales, but the discrepancy is not anywhere near as wide as the one cited in the meme. However, before we put too much credibility on these calculations, we should note that criminologists say there is actually no good way to compare violent crime rates in these two countries. Our rough effort to equalize the definitions improved the quality of the comparison, but what we did is not enough to fix the comparison entirely, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. "Once you get away from clearly defined terms like homicides, all kinds of problems come in," Fox said. "You have to take comparisons not just with a grain of salt but with the entire shaker." For instance, the vast majority of violent crimes are aggravated assaults, and this is a category that isn’t as well defined as homicides, rapes and robberies. Many aggravated assaults don’t result in an injury, Fox said, and even police in the same country don’t always use the same standard in counting this particular crime. Another problem is that aggravated assaults, rapes and robberies are victim-reported crimes, so whether the crime gets reported varies widely, depending on such factors as the victim’s trust in the police. This difference shows up in comparisons of FBI crime data, which consists of crimes reported to police, and the far higher rates of crime victimization found in a survey of Americans by the Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics. The survey counts all crimes that respondents say they have experienced, not just those they reported to police. The International Crime Victims Survey, conducted by an arm of the United Nations most recently in 2005, shows the difference between reported crime and all crimes committed by conducting polls that ask people if they've been victims of specific crimes. Polling data showed that England and Wales had 2,600 cases of robbery per 100,000 population and 8,100 cases of "assaults and threats" per 100,000. While those figures are even higher than the meme suggested, the U.S levels are also much higher -- 1,100 cases of robbery and 8,300 cases of assaults and threats per 100,000. And the rate of sexual assault is actually about 50 percent higher in the United States than it is in England and Wales. So this data set doesn’t support the thrust of the meme, either. "Recorded crime data are problematic due to definitional issues, reporting rates and other concerns," said Shane D. Johnson, a professor in the University College of London Department of Security and Crime Science. "There may also be considerable variation across counties, or states." When we presented the Skeptical Libertarian blog post and our own research to the source of the meme -- Adam Kokesh, a libertarian activist -- an aide to Kokesh sent us the original link from the Daily Telegraph and said, "We appreciate the close eye on that post and all the research." Our ruling The meme said "there are over 2,000 crimes recorded per 100,000 population in the U.K.," compared to "466 violent crimes per 100,000" in the United States. Our preliminary attempt to make an apples-to-apples comparison shows a much smaller difference in violent crime rates between the two countries, but criminologists say differences in how the statistics are collected make it impossible to produce a truly valid comparison. We rate the claim False.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2013-06-24T13:58:39	2013-06-21	['United_States', 'United_Kingdom']
pomt-06663	The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Assembly approved "only one out of 376 amendments offered by Assembly Democrats" in 2011.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/11/brett-hulsey/wisconsin-rep-brett-hulsey-says-only-one-376-bill-/	In early August 2011, after surveys tagged him as possibly the nation’s most polarizing governor, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker pledged a renewed focus on bi-partisanship and jobs. Later that month, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, R-Horicon, echoed the call. He said some jobs-related bills proposed by Democrats were good and would take them up by the Assembly after it returns from its summer recess on Sept. 13, 2011. Rep. Brett Hulsey, D-Madison, professed doubts about the sincerity of the GOP calls for bi-partisanship. On Aug. 27, 2011, the day Fitzgerald’s comments were posted online, Hulsey said in an opinion column in The Capital Times of Madison: "On the floor of the Legislature, Assembly Republicans have rubber-stamped Walker’s corporate agenda while rejecting hundreds of Democratic amendments, even though many were common-sense measures that emphasized accountability or saved money. So far, Republicans have accepted only one out of 376 amendments offered by Assembly Democrats." Bi-partisanship, of course, can be measured in many ways. But the one-out-of-376 statistic caught our attention, so we decided to check it out. We started by asking Hulsey to clarify his statement. Hulsey said that of all the bills adopted by the Assembly in 2011 before it adjourned for the summer, only one of 376 amendments proposed by a Democrat was adopted. Some amendments were proposed on the Assembly floor and others in Assembly committees, he said. The single Democrat-sponsored amendment that was approved, according to Hulsey, was to Assembly Bill 94. That bill made administrative changes to the Milwaukee school choice program, which uses taxpayer dollars to send children to private schools. The amendment was introduced by Rep. Jason Fields, D-Milwaukee, a school choice supporter. It specifies that a pupil currently participating in the choice program may continue to attend a private school if their family’s income increases above current income eligibility requirements and that the pupil’s siblings are not subject to current income eligibility requirements, according to the Wisconsin Legislative Council, which provides legal and other services to legislative committees. To check Hulsey’s numbers, we contacted the Assembly chief clerk’s office, which referred us to the Wisconsin Legislative Technology Services Bureau. Hulsey contacted the bureau, as well. The bureau determined there were even more Democratic amendments than Hulsey had claimed -- 399 -- and that only the Fields amendment was adopted. We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie and Fitzgerald spokesman John Jagler about the numbers. Neither disputed them. Jagler said many of the Democratic amendments were voted down because they were politically motivated. He also said that for the 2009-2011 state budget -- adopted when Democrats controlled the governor’s office and both chambers of the Legislature -- Republicans offered more than 120 amendments and none were adopted. That suggests Hulsey’s statement is just a measure of the reality of what happens when one party has outright control in Madison. Is the number of opposition amendments adopted a good measure of bi-partisanship? We put that question to two former state lawmakers, one from each party, who served in both the Assembly and the Senate. Mordecai Lee, a Democrat who represented Milwaukee and now teaches governmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said the sheer volume of Democratic amendments rejected by the Republican-controlled Assembly is evidence "that these people despise each other." Brian Rude, a lobbyist and a Republican who represented the La Crosse area, agreed that the number of rejected amendments indicates a split, but added: "Partisanship has always been part of the process. Parties get elected to stand for something." For his part, Werwie cited a spreadsheet produced by the governor’s office on the 44 bills Walker has signed into law. It shows there were a total of 331 yes votes by Assembly Democrats on the bills. That means, on average, 7.5 of the 38 Democrats voted yes on each of the 44 bills. Our conclusion Hulsey said the Republican-controlled state Assembly adopted only one of nearly 400 amendments offered by Democrats to bills that were adopted by the Assembly. Complete official data is not available, but GOP leaders don’t dispute that only one Democratic amendment was approved. We rate Hulsey’s statement True.

pomt-05072	The Mack Penny Plan for the federal budget "would balance our budget by 2019" and "continues to gain support."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/jul/05/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-cutting-one-penny-out-every-/	U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV faced accusations of using public money for campaigning when he sent an office mailer about his "Penny Plan" beyond his southwest Florida congressional district in May. Mack, R-Fort Myers, is running statewide for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. Mack blamed the widespread mailing on the vendor who had also done campaign work for Mack. The vendor then reimbursed the government. While who received the mailer drew much scrutiny, what the mailer actually said drew less attention. Mack’s mailer was about a plan he introduced in May 2011 to balance the budget that he says is so basic it comes down to -- you guessed it -- a penny. "The Mack Penny Plan is simple -- eliminate one penny out of every federal dollar spent," the mailer said. "Doing this would balance our budget by 2019 and restore economic freedom by reducing spending and bringing fiscal discipline to Washington. The Penny Plan continues to gain support and now has 70 cosponsors in the House of Representatives, as well as support from key senators like Marco Rubio, Pat Toomey and Rand Paul. If Florida families can cut one penny, or more, out of every dollar in their budgets, so can Washington." We had a few questions about Mack’s plan: • Does the math work -- would it balance the budget in eight years? • How would Mack get to that 1 percent cut each year -- would it be across the board in every area, including Social Security and Medicare? • Is it really gaining support? Or is it stalled? By the numbers Mack has a fact sheet that shows the numbers for H.R. 1848, the One Percent Spending Reduction Act. Mack got the idea from the One Cent Solution. The founder, Bruce Cook, is a businessman from Georgia and a graduate of Harvard Business School. The math works like this: For six years, the federal government would reduce spending by 1 percent each year. In the seventh year, funding would be capped at 18 percent of gross domestic product, which measures the size of the overall economy. By the eighth year, the plan would balance the budget and save $7.5 trillion over 10 years. If Congress and the president couldn’t reach an agreement about what to cut, the plan would trigger automatic across-the-board spending cuts. Mack’s website shows the 1 percent reduction each year: FY 2012 – $3.382 trillion*, less 1 percent => $3.348 trillion cap FY 2013 – $3.348 trillion, less 1 percentt = > $3.315 trillion cap FY 2014 – $3.315 trillion, less 1 percent => $3.282 trillion cap FY 2015 – $3.282 trillion, less 1 percent => $3.249 trillion cap FY 2016 – $3.249 trillion, less 1 percent => $3.216 trillion cap FY 2017 – $3.216 trillion, less 1 percent => $3.184 trillion cap At the beginning of fiscal year 2018, it sets an overall spending cap of 18 percent of gross domestic product. The mailer says the plan would balance the budget by 2019, while a Mack congressional staffer told us based on the latest figures it would do the trick by 2017. To give you an idea of how dramatic this is, Paul Ryan’s budget plan wouldn’t balance the budget for nearly three decades, until 2040. The math isn’t the hard part We sent Mack’s fact sheet to several federal budget experts and asked them if the math worked and their opinion of Mack’s plan. Our experts included JD Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation; Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute; Josh Gordon of the centrist Concord Coalition; Jason Peuquet of the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget; and Michael Linden, of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Our experts generally agreed that Mack’s math is correct and would balance the budget. But no one we interviewed thought Mack’s plan was a realistic way to balance the budget. "One can always make the math work, as presented in this fashion it's a fairly straightforward exercise," Foster said. The straight math isn’t the hard part. It’s whether to cut everything by 1 percent or to target programs selectively. "The numbers work, but they have to be made effective by policy changes," Foster said. "The easiest part legislatively is the targets, and you have to have those, but then you still need to finish the job." Republicans have programs they want to protect from cuts, just like the Democrats do, and the GOP can end up fighting amongst themselves about what to cut -- take for example the battle over whether to extend the Export-Import Bank. "There are a lot Republicans in the House and Senate who fashion themselves as being for small government and supporting these overall caps, but when the rubber hits the road and they actually have to vote on cutting particular programs, they chicken out," Edwards said. Most notably, the bill doesn’t explain how it would adjust Medicare and Social Security to make up for the expected growth as Baby Boomers retire. We asked Mack’s congressional office if Mack supports cutting peoples’ Social Security 1 percent a year for six years. Their statement: "The Penny Plan sets a framework for reducing spending. It will be up to Congress and the president to work together to determine how best to achieve those spending reductions." (The One Cent Solution states that some programs could be spared while others cut more than others, so theoretically that could mean Social Security wouldn’t be cut though that would mean larger cuts elsewhere.) Linden, who called Mack’s plan "ridiculous", noted that this plan could mean an even cut larger than 1 percent for each senior, since the number of seniors getting Social Security will increase. And if Social Security and Medicare were off the table, that would remove about 35 percent of non-interest spending from the chopping block, leaving bigger cuts elsewhere. Most proposals to control spending account for the fact that more people are going to be getting Social Security and Medicare benefits in the future, Peuquet said. That means making actual cuts to the programs is very difficult. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities hasn’t analyzed the Penny Plan but examined a 2011 plan by Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to limit total federal spending to no more than 20.6 percent of the gross domestic product -- slightly larger than Mack’s proposal of 18 percent. The Center wrote that the cuts to entitlements would be massive: "There is little possibility that Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security all would be exempted from these cuts. To do that would require cutting everything else — including defense, veterans’ programs, education, scientific research, and the like — by unthinkable amounts. ...and the cuts would have to be even larger if the economy faltered." Social Security and Medicare aren’t the only programs that our experts raised concerns about. Linden raised questions about whether Mack would cut veterans’ benefits although their needs are growing. "You have to think not just compared to what we spend today, but what we have to spend based on underlying demographics," he said. Gaining support? Mack introduced his bill in the House on May 11, 2011. It was referred to committees and introduced in the Senate on June 30. Since then, it’s seen no official action, according to the Library of Congress website. All 70 cosponsors in the House signed on in 2011. In the Senate, there is one sponsor plus 13 cosponsors and about half of the cosponsors signed on in 2012. Mack’s office also points to this April 2012 article in the conservative Washington Times cowritten by a Treasury official who worked under President George W. Bush. Mack also spoke about his plan at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center in April 2012. We agree that the Penny Plan is still getting some attention, but even Mack’s own website largely links to endorsements and news coverage from 2011. Our ruling Mack’s plan calls for reducing federal spending 1 percent a year for six years and then capping spending at 18 percent of GDP. Our experts agreed that the math works to balance the budget. But Mack has not provided a detailed road map on how to achieve cuts -- he simply says if Congress and the president can’t work it out, there will be across-the-board cuts, with no explanation about what that means for programs serving an increased number of people. We’d like to hear him provide details about whether older Americans should expect lower Social Security checks and to pay more for Medicare, or if they’ll be spared and in turn other departments will face much larger cuts. And we don’t see evidence that the plan is gaining support. The lack of action in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives is a sign that balancing the budget requires broader policy discussions and debates about spending priorities.

pomt-00008	Said that man wearing racist shirt was working at a polling station in Mississippi.	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/12/blog-posting/racist-t-shirt-wearer-mississippi-polling-station-/	A photo of a man voting in Mississippi while wearing a racist T-shirt went viral after a Twitter post claimed he worked at the polling station. He didn’t. The T-shirt contained the image of a noose in front of a Confederate flag, along with the words "Mississippi justice." The original tweet of the photo was captioned "Olive Branch, Mississippi. Nov 6th, 2018." It got about 5,500 likes. The second tweet quoted the first and added, "Wait I forgot to mention he was one of the poll workers...." That post got more than 143,600 likes and garnered more than 50,000 retweets. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo is a real photo of a voter in Mississippi, but he wasn’t working at the polling station, according to election commissioner Paul Beale. The incident did not take place in his district, but he confirmed the authenticity of the photo. "He was not a poll worker; he was just a voter," Beale said. Beale said that the only time he would ask someone to leave would be if they were wearing campaign buttons or material supporting a candidate. Otherwise, he said, it was out of his hands. "We cannot regulate that; we cannot regulate stupidity," Beale said. "That’s all I’ve got to say about that." The image originates from a since-deleted Facebook post. Social media users and BuzzFeed News identified the man as Clayton John Hickey, a registered nurse at Regional One Hospital in Memphis and a resident of Olive Branch. The day after the election, Regional One tweeted that it was "aware of a photograph in circulation" and that they "are investigating and will take appropriate action." Regional One did not respond to our inquiry. The viral photo of a man with a racist shirt at a polling station in Mississippi is not photoshopped. However, the man was not a poll worker.

pomt-04851	"I didn’t try to push" a bill to reduce lottery scholarship proceeds for students.	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/aug/12/dolores-gresham/education-chair-gresham-said-she-didnt-push-bill-s/	The Tennessee Education Lottery Corp. released its fiscal year 2011-12 results on July 16, reporting record sales and record proceeds for education. The Commercial Appeal called state Sen. Dolores Gresham, R-Somerville, for her reaction because she sponsored the bill this year to raise the eligibility standards for Tennessee’s lottery-funded Hope Scholarships. We weren’t surprised that Gresham, the chairwoman of the Senate Education Committee, was pleased with the lottery’s financial news – a $30 million increase for education over the previous year, far more than needed to cover the projected deficits. "Their success means success for students who earn lottery scholarships," she said. But we were surprised when the senator told the newspaper that she hadn’t pushed the bill that would have made it tougher for high school students to win the full $4,000 per year basic Hope Scholarship. "I didn’t try to push anything," said Gresham, whose district is about 30 miles east of Memphis. "The bill died. That’s not even an issue." Gresham was sponsor of the bill in the Senate and argued for its approval in two separate Senate committees and on the Senate floor, where it was approved in a partisan vote April 16. The bill later failed to become law when the House sponsor withdrew it on April 30, citing record lottery revenues. In March, we examined Sen. Gresham’s statement that the lottery reserve fund could sustain possible lottery-scholarship program deficits for "only" a few more years more and ruled it False. The policy contained in the bill was recommended last December by the Senate Lottery Stabilization Task Force, which Gresham chaired. The Tennessee Higher Education Commission had estimated the change would eliminate projected deficits in the program by cutting in half the Hope Scholarships for 5,200 to 6,600 new students per year. The bill also would have increased by $10 million per year state funding for the Tennessee Student Assistance grants, a separate scholarship program whose aid is entirely need-based. That provision would have served about 5,700 more students, with annual grants averaging $1,800 each. Gresham had also sponsored a bill in 2011 that would have raised qualification standards for all Hope recipients, but it never reached the Senate floor. We wondered how a lawmaker could say she didn’t "push" a bill when she was its sponsor, argued on several occasions for its passage, resisted efforts to block its passage and led it to approval in the Senate, so we emailed Gresham to ask for clarification. Senate Republican Caucus press secretary Darlene Schlicher responded, after speaking with Gresham, with a statement: "This sounds like a quibble over semantics. Sen. Gresham sponsored and advocated for this piece of legislation in her role as Lottery Scholarship Stabilization Task Force Chairman. No one disputes this. What Chairman Gresham took issue with was the implication by the reporter that she had attempted to twist arms or exert undue influence on the bill. She did not. Chairman Gresham did her job as a Task Force chairman and sponsor. Period." Some background is in order. The task force’s reason for being really dates back to fiscal year 2009, when the Tennessee Lottery had its first and only year-to-year decline in proceeds since its 2004 launch. It was the first time the program ran a deficit, and to close the books that year, the scholarship program took about $9.3 million from its huge $400 million-plus reserve fund. Last summer, Senate Speaker Ron Ramsey appointed a task force of senators and higher education officials to examine the issue. It concluded that deficits of up to $17 million to $20 million a year would occur in the short term, before falling considerably by 2020 if no changes were made. The panel recommended tightening eligibility requirements so that students entering college in 2015 must have a high school grade-point average of at least 3.0 and at least a 21 on the ACT to qualify for the basic $4,000 per year Hope Scholarship. Since the program began, students qualified by achieving one of the two standards – either a 3.0 high school GPA or a minimum 21 ACT score. Under the task force plan, students who scored one of the two standards but not both would receive a $2,000 annual scholarship. But even as the task force was working last autumn, the lottery was racking up record sales monthly. In fact, the lottery has been on a roll since the 2009 decline, rebounding in 2010 to a record level outstripping 2008’s pre-recession earnings. It set another record in 2011 and again in fiscal year 2012, yielding $323 million for education – up from $292 million the previous year. Thus, the projected annual deficit did not occur, and the lottery reserve fund still has over $400 million in it. As chairman of the task force, Gresham sponsored the task force’s recommendations in the form of Senate Bill 2514. Some examples of her advocacy: --Gresham argued for passage in a 51-minute discussion in the Senate Education Committee on Feb. 15, over the objections of Sen. Andy Berke, D-Chattanooga. --On Feb. 29, the Education Committee heard an update on lottery revenues from lottery executives, who reported that proceeds for education in the first seven months of the fiscal year were already $10 million ahead of the previous year and said they believed they could sustain at least that level into the future. Gresham told reporters after the meeting that she "absolutely" planned to proceed with the bill. --On March 7, after 21 minutes of talk, the Education Committee approved an oral amendment by Gresham that said the new eligibility standards would not go into effect in 2015 as the bill required if the lottery’s education proceeds were up at least $10 million annually over the next three years. --On March 20, Gresham presented the bill in the Senate Finance Committee, which discussed it for 22 minutes and then deferred a vote to the following week. --On March 27, the Finance Committee discussed the bill for 38 minutes before sending it to the Senate floor.. Gresham discussed the amendment again and emphasized that it meant only that the lottery had to generate $10 million more this year than last year, $10 million plus $1 the following year and $10 million plus $2 the following year. --On April 16, the bill was debated for 46 minutes on the Senate floor before winning approval on a 20-10 vote, with all Republicans favoring it and all but four Democrats opposing it. Gresham made her most vocal arguments for the bill here, against specific arguments raised by Democratic Sens. Berke, Jim Kyle (Memphis) and Roy Herron (Dresden). Gresham moved an amendment on the bill and tabled another. Our ruling It may be a quibble over semantics, but we think when the record shows that a state Senate committee chairwoman sponsored a bill, argued for its passage through two separate committee, tabled amendments offered by opponents and led it to passage on the Senate floor, that qualifies as trying to push for a bill. On the Senate floor, only one other member even spoke in favor of the bill in the entire 45-minute floor debate. We rule this statement False.

pomt-02364	Says President Barack Obama was responsible for "the assassination of at least four American citizens" in drone strikes.	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/mar/19/kesha-rogers/four-us-citizens-killed-obama-drone-strikes-3-were/	As LaRouche Democrat and U.S. Senate candidate Kesha Rogers of Texas calls for the impeachment of Democratic President Barack Obama, she lists among her reasons the "assassination" of U.S. citizens. Rogers says on her campaign website that Obama violated the Fifth Amendment "with the avowed assassination of at least four American citizens, Anwar Al-Awlaki, his 16-year-old son, Samir Khan, and Jude Mohammed, without benefit of due process of law. Indeed, the death warrants against these individuals were effectively signed in secret, in a committee which is overseen directly by the president." PolitiFact has dipped before into the debate around the Obama administration’s use of pilotless drones armed with missiles to target terrorism suspects, exploring whether the president can legally authorize the killing of a U.S. citizen fighting for a foreign terrorist group, whether the program could be used on U.S. soil, if it complies with international law and if Obama has kept Congress fully informed. Were the individuals named by Rogers all U.S. citizens "assassinated" at Obama’s direction? Rogers’ views and alignment with conspiracy theorist and former presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche led the Texas Democratic Party to urge voters not to cast ballots for her in the March 4, 2014, primary. Rogers still won enough votes to trigger a May 27 runoff that will determine whether she or Dallas investor David Alameel, who led the field, will challenge the Republican nominee, second-term U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, in November. In support of Rogers’ assassination claim, her campaign manager, Ian Overton, emailed us news stories from The New York Times and the New Yorker magazine, and we found more news coverage using Google and the Nexis news database. The citizens On May 22, 2013, the Obama administration "formally acknowledged for the first time that it had killed four American citizens in drone strikes outside the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq" since 2009, The New York Times said in a news story posted online that day. The acknowledgement came in a letter signed by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder sent that day to the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman: Since 2009, the United States, in the conduct of U.S. counterterrorism operations against al-Qa’ida and its associated forces outside of areas of active hostilities, has specifically targeted and killed one U.S. citizen, Anwar al-Aulaqi. The United States is further aware of three other U.S. citizens who have been killed in such U.S. counterterrorism operations over that same time period: Samir Khan, ‘Abd al-Rahman Anwar al-Aulaqi, and Jude Kenan Mohammed. These individuals were not specifically targeted by the United States. Anwar al-Awlaki and Khan were killed in Yemen on Sept. 30, 2011. A March 9, 2013, Times news story about the strike said al-Awlaki, a cleric born in New Mexico, incited and plotted terrorist incidents involving U.S. targets, including lending support via email to Nidal Hasan in 2009 before Hasan killed 13 and wounded more than 30 people at Fort Hood in Texas. Khan, who the story said came from North Carolina, edited the online al-Qaeda propaganda magazine Inspire. The Times wrote of al-Awlaki’s death, "For what was apparently the first time since the Civil War, the United States government had carried out the deliberate killing of an American citizen as a wartime enemy and without a trial." Al-Awlaki’s 16-year-old son, a U.S. citizen born in Denver, Colo., died Oct. 14, 2011, in Yemen when, the Times wrote, "a missile apparently intended for an Egyptian Qaeda operative, Ibrahim al-Banna, hit a modest outdoor eating place in Shabwa. … Banna was not there, and among about a dozen men killed was the young Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, who had no connection to terrorism." U.S. citizen Jude Kenan Mohammad was believed by his family to have been killed in a November 2011 strike in Pakistan, according to a May 24, 2013, Los Angeles Times news story that said, "Former U.S. officials said that even if Mohammad wasn't the target of the strike, he was of interest to American intelligence because he was believed to have communicated with Muslims in the United States and encouraged them to travel to Pakistan or carry out attacks at home." The New York Times said another U.S. citizen, Kamal Derwish, had been killed by a drone strike in Yemen on Nov. 3, 2002, when George W. Bush was president. Derwish was a recruiter who put together an al-Qaeda sleeper cell in Lackawanna, N.Y., according to an Oct. 12, 2003, New York Times news story. The U.S. said he was not the intended target and did not acknowledge killing him, but a Yemeni official identified him as one of six men who died in the attack, the story said. Another U.S. citizen could be facing death by drone, according to news reports. A Feb. 28, 2014, New York Times news story said Abdullah al-Shami, "a militant who American officials say is living in the barren mountains of northwestern Pakistan" and who was possibly born in Texas, "is at the center of a debate inside the government over whether President Obama should once again take the extraordinary step of authorizing the killing of an American citizen overseas." Obama’s role Of the 2011 deaths, Rogers spokesman Overton said, "The Obama White House claims that only Anwar al-Awlaki was specifically targeted. However, there is no way to verify that, since the deliberations are secret. Either they were targeted or they were collateral damage of a kill policy. In either case, the program is run by Obama, who personally makes the final decision to kill a target. If the three were not specifically targeted, their deaths remain the responsibility of Obama." We looked to Obama’s public comments as well as news reports, including those Overton sent, for details. In a May 23, 2013, speech at the National Defense University, Obama said he had authorized the attack on Anwar al-Awlaki: "I would have detained and prosecuted Awlaki if we captured him before he carried out a plot, but we couldn’t. And as president, I would have been derelict in my duty had I not authorized the strike that took him out." What about the strikes that Holder said killed U.S. citizens unintentionally? News accounts indicate Obama likely approved those attacks as well. The New York Times reported in a May 29, 2012, news story that cited current and former presidential advisers, "Obama has placed himself at the helm of a top-secret ‘nominations’ process to designate terrorists for kill or capture." The story, which quoted sources including William M. Daley, chief of staff in 2011, and Thomas E. Donilon, White House national security adviser from late 2010 to mid-2013, said that "the nominations go to the White House, where by his own insistence and guided by (then-White House counterterrorism adviser John) Brennan, Mr. Obama must approve any name. He signs off on every strike in Yemen and Somalia and also on the more complex and risky strikes in Pakistan — about a third of the total." Brennan, who became director of the CIA in 2013, said in an April 30, 2012, speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars that proposals for a lethal strike are "evaluated by the very most senior officials in our government for a decision." CNN’s Jessica Yellin asked Obama in a Sept. 5, 2012, interview if he decides who will be targeted in drone attacks. The president said, "As president, ultimately I’m responsible for decisions that are made by the administration," and said an "extensive process" is behind such decisions. He described criteria: the target must be "authorized by our laws"; there must be a serious, not speculative, threat; there must be no option to capture the targeted individual instead of using deadly force; and civilian casualties must be avoided. Yellin pressed: "Do you personally approve the targets?" Obama said, "I can’t get too deeply into how these things work," but again said, "Ultimately I’m responsible for the process that we set up." An Oct. 23, 2012, news story in the Washington Post said, "Obama approves the criteria for lists and signs off on drone strikes outside Pakistan, where decisions on when to fire are made by the director of the CIA." ‘Assassination’ Were the cited deaths assassinations? Dictionaries define assassination as killing a person, particularly a prominent political figure. Left open is the question of whether the person’s death was intentional or collateral. A 1976 presidential executive order banned government employees from involvement in political assassinations; the word "political" was dropped from later orders, "assassination" is not defined and the federal government has argued the restriction doesn’t apply to wartime or terrorists. A Nov. 4, 2002, CNN news story on the ban notes that in 1986, President Ronald Reagan ordered the bombing of the home of leader Moammar Gadhafi of Libya and in 1998, President Bill Clinton ordered missile strikes on suspected terrorist compounds in Afghanistan. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Bush signed an "intelligence finding" that enabled the CIA to pursue and kill terrorists around the world. Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University expert on international law, told us by phone that the 1976 order was meant to prohibit attacks on political opponents such as Cuba’s Fidel Castro, "where those individuals were not combatants in an armed conflict against the United States." Holder has said the drone strikes are not assassinations because they are not illegal. In a March 5, 2012 speech at the Northwestern University School of Law, Holder said, "Some have called such operations ‘assassinations.’ They are not, and the use of that loaded term is misplaced. Assassinations are unlawful killings. … the U.S. government’s use of lethal force in self defense against a leader of al Qaeda or an associated force who presents an imminent threat of violent attack would not be unlawful — and therefore would not violate the executive order banning assassination or criminal statutes." Arend said that wasn’t how he’d state it, but agreed the deaths were not assassinations. That term, he said, applies to political opponents rather than foes at war with the U.S. In his view, Arend said, the use of military force authorized by the president "against a combatant in an ongoing armed conflict -- which I would argue and one could argue actions against terrorists are -- that wouldn’t constitute an assassination," whether the combatant was American or not. Our ruling Rogers said Obama was responsible for "the assassination of at least four American citizens" in drone strikes. U.S. drone strikes reportedly carried out on Obama’s authority killed the citizens listed by Rogers. But three deaths were evidently not intended, while it’s debated -- and unsettled at best -- whether the killing of al-Awlaki, targeted for his al-Qaeda role, was an assassination. We rate this claim, which presents these deaths out of context, as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-08028	"The richest 1 percent of America will get a bigger tax cut through this bill than the family income of the average family here in Central Texas."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/jan/07/lloyd-doggett/lloyd-doggett-says-richest-americans-getting-bigge/	Austin U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett vigorously opposed the deal reached between President Barack Obama and Republicans to extend tax cuts initially put in place by Congress when Republican George W. Bush was president. After Vice President Joe Biden urged House Democrats Dec. 9 to vote for the deal, Doggett told reporters: "If it's take it or leave it, we'll leave it," according to an online USA Today news post. Early Dec. 17, the House approved the extension. Doggett then said on CNN’s "American Morning:": "We all like less taxes. But this came at an immense cost. It's our money. It certainly is. But it's also our (future) debt." Doggett, a Democrat representing the state's 25th Congressional District, which takes in parts of Travis and Bastrop counties plus Hays and five counties south and east of Austin, had swung home before the vote. And on Dec. 12, he told Austin’s KVUE-TV, Channel 24: "The richest 1 percent of America will get a bigger tax cut through this bill than the family income of the average family here in Central Texas. That’s just not equitable." Solid comparison? To our inquiry, Doggett’s office passed along a report by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal group focused on federal, state and local tax policies and their impact. The Dec. 9 report states that under the extension, the nation’s wealthiest 1 percent would enjoy an average tax cut of almost $77,000 in 2011. The report says that in Texas, the wealthiest 1 percent would see an average cut of $79,563. Doggett spokesman Cameron Arterton said the U.S. Census Bureau says the median family income for Doggett’s Congressional District 25 based on a 2009 survey is estimated at $57,723. Arterton said for Travis County, the median family income is $67,030; for Hays County, $70,998; and for Bastrop County, $55,344. To refresh, the median is not the same as the average, which is based on adding up all the family incomes and dividing the total by the number of families. In this instance, half of the area’s families have a lower income than the median and half of the area’s families have a higher income than the median. At the Census Bureau, spokeswoman Jenna Arnold guided us to county-by-county survey research showing estimated median and mean (or average) family incomes for the counties singled out by Doggett’s office for 2005-09; they differ slightly from the one-year estimates cited by Doggett’s office. For 2005-09, the median family income in Travis County is estimated at $69,251, about $25,000 less than the county’s average estimated family income of $94,955. Bastrop County’s median family income, $59,582, was about $12,000 less than its estimated average, $71,656. Hays County’s median family income, $72,647, was about $14,000 less than its estimated average, $86,364. Median or mean, what’s the best way to judge income? Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, told us that generally, he prefers to use average (or mean) income in comparisons rather than median income. "There’s something intuitive about the concept of an average," he said. But averages, Potter said, are sometimes distorted by extreme values at the high or low ends. "So if you had someone (in your county) who was really wealthy, like a billionaire, or just a couple, that would pull the mean up fairly significantly. It’s perhaps misleading as far as how most people are living," Potter said. "You’ve got some very wealthy people in Travis County. Doesn’t Sandra Bullock live there?" We heard next from Doggett, who pointed out via e-mail that in his Dec. 16 House remarks opposing the extension, he correctly compared the tax cut for the wealthiest Americans to median--not average--family incomes in Central Texas. Doggett said that in the earlier KVUE interview, "I wasn’t trying to change the standard of measurement... I was conveying the same important point about this tax deal -- the inequality between the tax benefits for the wealthiest 1 percent in this deal and the typical family income in our area for an entire year." His e-mail continues: "Even if you strictly limit ‘average’ to mean ‘mean,’ not ‘median,’ my statement is still accurate for the congressional district I represent." His office pointed us to census research indicating that family incomes in the district averaged $75,455 for 2005-09 in 2009 inflation-adjusted dollars. Doggett added that "‘median’ is a type of ‘average’ too according to Merriam Webster’s online, which lists the first definition of ‘average’ as ‘a single value (as a mean, mode, or median) that summarizes or represents the general significance of a set of unequal values.’)" As he acknowledges, Doggett didn’t specify median or mean incomes to KVUE, enabling his statement to leave the misimpression that the 2011 tax cut for the nation’s wealthiest 1 percent exceeds the average income of Central Texas families. Solely considering average family incomes, his claim doesn’t hold up for two of three counties singled out by his office. Taking median incomes into account, though, his statement is supported. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Lloyd Doggett	None	None	None	2011-01-07T06:00:00	2010-12-12	['United_States']

pomt-01552	Says Glenn Grothman pushed through state tax credits that when phased in, "someone that owns a factory that produces millions in income" will pay "less tax than their nephew would if he worked full time at Taco Bell for minimum wage."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/14/mark-harris/new-wisconsin-tax-breaks-will-let-factory-owners-p/	To spark his underdog campaign for Congress, Democrat Mark Harris is steering attention to his GOP opponent, state Sen. Glenn Grothman. And doing so with an attack that compares how much factory owners and Taco Bell workers pay in state income taxes. The winner of the Nov. 4, 2014 election will succeed retiring Fond du Lac Republican Tom Petri, who was first elected to the east-central Wisconsin seat in 1979. In doing an interview with Harris on Sept. 2, 2014, John "Sly" Sylvester, a liberal radio talk show host in the Madison area, argued that Gov. Scott Walker’s administration has provided "corporate welfare" and that the Legislature "has been sort of a rubber stamp." Harris, who is the Winnebago County executive, referred to Walker’s 2011-’13 state budget in giving this response: "Well, even in the first Walker budget, Mr. Grothman pushed through tax credits for manufacturing and agriculture," Harris said. "And he did it in the last day of the Joint Finance Committee, when there really wasn't time for anyone to scrutinize what was happening. And they basically passed credits that all but eliminate income tax on manufacturers and on agricultural operations." He continued: "And, you know, it's not fair to have someone that owns a factory that produces millions in income pay less tax than their nephew would if he worked full time at Taco Bell for minimum wage. But that's exactly what Glenn Grothman passed, and it's phasing in gradually." That’s an eye-opener. Did Grothman push through credits that, over time, would enable a factory owner earning millions to pay less state income tax than a worker earning minimum wage? The credits In June 2011, Grothman helped lead an effort to add manufacturing and agriculture tax credits to Walker’s state budget. The credits apply to the production income of the businesses, not to income such as royalties and investments. The measure gave businesses that are assessed as manufacturing or agricultural for property tax purposes a dollar-for-dollar credit on income from manufacturing or agricultural production on their 2013 tax bill. The credit, which began in 2013, rises annually until reaching 7.5 percent in 2016. Businesses organized as, for example, limited liability companies -- where an owner pays the firm's tax as personal income tax -- can reduce their state income tax rate from as much as 7.75 percent to 0.25 percent or less. In other words, come 2016, the 7.5 percent credit could eliminate a large share of a factory owner’s tax liability. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates the credits will mean $359.7 million less in tax revenues for the state over its first five years, and $128.7 million a year once it is fully phased in starting in 2016. The value Harris, who formerly practiced as a certified public accountant and a lawyer, provided figures on the state’s income tax rates and on the 2016 tax credits. The figures support his claim in that the credits would wipe away all of a factory owner’s state income tax liability -- on factory production income only -- for the first $2.4 million in production income. We consulted two accounting professors: the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater’s William Raabe, whose specialties include state taxation; and Stacie LaPlante, chair in accounting at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Business School. They agreed that a full-time minimum-wage worker ($7.25 per hour for 2,000 hours per year) claiming the standard deduction ($9,930) and exemption ($700) would owe about $170 in state income tax. They also agreed that the factory owner wouldn’t owe more than that on production income until after earning roughly $2.6 million in production income -- a figure even higher than the one Harris cited. But the professors added some caveats under which the owner could pay more state income tax than the Taco Bell worker. "Qualified production income" is a specific type of business income. Not all of the net income from a factory would necessarily qualify for the tax credits, which would mean the owner would be paying additional taxes. Once the factory owner's production income exceeds roughly $2.6 million, he would pay more income tax than the Taco Bell worker. But it's worth noting that the owner's rate on that level of income would be only 0.15 percent (7.65 percent rate minus 7.5 percent credit), well below the 4 percent rate paid by the Taco Bell worker. Our rating Harris said Grothman pushed through tax credits so that when they are phased in, "someone that owns a factory that produces millions in income" will pay "less tax than their nephew would if he worked full time at Taco Bell for minimum wage." Once the credits pushed by Grothman are fully phased in, in 2016, some factory owners who earn up to roughly $2.5 million from production income from the factory will owe less in state income tax on that production income than a full-time worker earning minimum wage. But factory owners earning above that amount from production income would pay more than the minimum-wage worker, and more on any other income that doesn’t come from production. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, our definition of Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel web page. This item was changed on Sept. 15, 2014 to clarify that the tax rate on production income above roughly $2.6 million is effectively 0.15 percent.

pomt-09388	The health care reform bill "is the largest tax increase in U.S. history."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/25/joe-scarborough/bush-i-clinton-and-reagan-all-pushed-taxes-higher-/	On his Morning Joe program on MSNBC on March 24, 2010, host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida, sparred with Sen. Dick Durbin over the tax effects of the health care reform bill. In the course of less than a minute, the bill was alternately described as "the largest tax increase in U.S. history" (Scarborough) and "the biggest tax cut in history" (Durbin). This seemed like a good place to step in and referee. First, here's the full context of the exchange between Scarborough and Durbin. "If this fall's election is going to be a referendum on this health care bill," Scarborough said to Durbin. "What should Democrats do when their opponents say, correctly, this is the largest tax increase in U.S. history? And it was passed at a time when we've got 17 percent real unemployment. And also, it's a further expansion of the federal government at a time when that worries a lot of Americans." "Joe, I keep hearing you every morning talking about the biggest tax increase in history, but you don't mention it's also the biggest tax cut in history," Durbin responded. "We have almost $500 billion in tax cuts. And the tax cuts go to small businesses to help pay for health insurance premiums. They're going to go to individuals who can't afford their health insurance premiums. It's really going to make certain everybody has a chance for affordable health insurance." We'll deal specifically with Durbin's claim in a separate item. Here, we'll tackle Scarborough's claim the health bill is "the largest tax increase in U.S. history." On the tax increase side, here are the biggies, along with what the government's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates they will bring in over the next 10 years: • Starting in 2013, an increase in the Medicare payroll tax by 0.9 percent on incomes over $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly). Also, people at this income level would pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income. The 10-year cost: $210.2 billion. • Starting in 2018, a new 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called "Cadillac plans," over $10,200 for individuals, $27,500 for families. That's expected to bring the government a total of $32 billion in 2018 and 2019. • Starting in 2011, new annual fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers. That's expected to raise $27 billion over 10 years. • Starting in 2014, a 2.3 percent excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices. The 10-year total: $20 billion. • Starting in 2014, a new annual fee on health insurance providers. Total estimated 10-year revenue: $60.1 billion. • Starting in 2013, the floor on medical expense deductions will be raised from 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income. That's expected to bring in $15.2 billion over the next 10 years. • Starting in 2011, a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services. That's expected to bring in $2.7 billion over the next 10 years. In all, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates various revenue-generating provisions in the health bill will bring $437 billion over the next 10 years. When it comes to tax cuts in the health bill, that's a matter of some debate. The plan includes government money to subsidize the cost of health insurance for lower income people who don't get insurance through their employer. Those subsidies, which are estimated to amount to $464 billion over 10 years, are paid directly to the insurance companies. They come via tax credits, but many Republicans and tax experts argue those shouldn't count as tax cuts. We'll get into that in more detail in the fact-check on Durbin's claim. There's also a no-doubt-about-it tax cut for some very small businesses that kicks in immediately, and allows them to write off a portion of the cost of providing insurance to their employees. That's expected to cost the government $40 billion over 10 years. "There are big chunks of money coming in and big chunks of money going out," said Linda Blumberg, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute. So let's talk net. The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the changes in direct spending and revenue effects of the health care reform bill (as well as the reconciliation bill, which has yet to pass) and concluded the total net effect is that the bill would bring in an additional $525 billion in total revenues over the next 10 years. Does that translate to the biggest tax increase ever? Let's first agree to some ground rules. For starters, it doesn't make sense to compare, say, 2019 dollars to 1985 dollars. You have to adjust for inflation, or express the amount as a total of Gross Domestic Product at the time. The Republican calculation also uses the 10-year total effect of the net revenue gain, while in decades past, the Joint Committee on Taxation used to analyze tax provisions only in a 5-year window. Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, thinks it makes the most sense to look at the last year of the 10-year CBO projections for the health care reform bill. By then, the plan is fully phased in, including the full effect of all the tax cuts and tax hikes. In that year, the total revenue increase is estimated to be $104 billion. That comes to a little less than 1/2 percent of the projected GDP that year. Horney notes that that's slightly smaller than the tax effect in the fifth years of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (a tax increase signed by President George H.W. Bush) and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (a tax increase signed by President Bill Clinton), as a percentage of the GDP at the time. And it's less than half of the tax increase (again as a percentage of GDP) from the Tax Equity And Fiscal Responsibility Act signed by President Ronald Reagan. "CBO says the net effect on revenues is that it is an increase," Horney said. "It's not insignificant. But it is far from being the largest tax increase in recent history." William Ahern with the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group, said total new revenues of $525 billion over 10 years isn't close to the size of the Clinton tax hike in 1993 or the Reagan tax hike in 1982. However, he said, a rigorous comparison can't be made because in 1982 and 1993, the Joint Committee on Taxation only did five-year estimates. Blumberg, of the Urban Institute, said both Republicans and Democrats would be wise to get away from the "biggest" jargon. Again, here we're are looking at Scarborough's side of the hyperbole wars. There's ample evidence that the health care bills result in a net tax increase. But when Scarborough characterized it as "the largest tax increase in U.S. history," that doesn't hold up when you level the playing field and compare several tax increases in recent decades to the GDP at the time. And so we rate his claim False.	None	Joe Scarborough	None	None	None	2010-03-25T19:08:35	2010-03-24	['United_States']

pomt-09670	The Senate health care bill is longer than Tolstoy's 'War and Peace.'	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/20/orrin-hatch/hatch-senate-health-care-bill-longer-war-peace/	They are both epic works of literature. One begins like this: "Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news." The other starts like this: "Part A of title XXVII of the Public Health Service 10 Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg et seq.) is amended (1) by striking the part heading and inserting the following: 13 ‘‘PART A—INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP MARKET REFORMS’’; (2) by redesignating sections 2704 through 2707 as sections 2725 through 2728, respectively (3) by redesignating sections 2711 through 2713 as sections 2731 through 2733, respectively . . . " The first passage comes from Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace . The second comes from Harry Reid's health care bill. Republicans have been comparing them to make the point that the Democratic plan is big and will lead to a bloated bureaucracy. In a Nov. 19, 2009, news release, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said that the 2,074-page bill was "longer than Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace ." We decided to see if he was right. The Oxford World's Classics paperback edition of War and Peace weighs in at 1,392 pages, according to Amazon.com. By that measure, the 2,074-page Senate bill would indeed be longer. But using pages as the benchmark is misleading. The page layout of a Senate bill is much different from a novel. The bill uses much larger type, on 8.5-by-11-inch paper. The margins are larger and there are wider spaces between the lines. On balance, then, fewer words fit on a page of the Senate bill than fit on the page of the paperback novel. So for an accurate comparison, you need to count words. That's not perfect either, since the Senate bill (like its House counterpart, which checked in at just under 2,000 pages) has lots of line-by-line numbering, section headers, and various forms of coding that complicate the process of word counting. But it's still the best method available. To count the words in War and Peace , we relied on a feature on Amazon.com called "Search Inside!" that quantifies the books it sells on various measurement scales. That function found that the Oxford paperback version of War and Peace , an English translation, has 561,893 words. (In an accompanying chart, Amazon notes that 0 percent of books it studied have more words than that, so Hatch has picked the the right epic novel for his comparison.) As for the bill, we cut and pasted it into a Microsoft Word document and found that the bill contained 384,067 words. Just to make sure that Word wasn't choking on such a large file, we did a sampling of word counts on individual pages, then multiplied the typical one-page count by the total number of pages in our Word document. The single pages we checked tended to have a bit fewer than 300 words per page in Word. So, with our document running to 1,372 pages -- shrinkage that illuminates how spread-out the text of the Senate bill is -- we came up with a ballpark estimate of 411,000 words. That last estimate is a bit higher than what the Microsoft's word count function found, but not by much. Either way, Reid's health care bill is actually shorter than War and Peace . So while Hatch is right if you simply count pages, when you use a more accurate comparison -- the number of words -- War and Peace is actually longer. In other words, he is right by one measurement, but not by the best measurement. So it turns out that Democrats aren't as wordy as a Russian novelist. Who knew? We find his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06669	Thomas Jefferson expressed "strong support" for a balanced budget amendment in 1798.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/sep/09/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-says-thomas-jefferson-strongly-backed-ba/	Almost two centuries after his death, Thomas Jefferson is often quoted by Virginia politicians espousing limited, frugal government. So it wasn’t surprising when U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th, invoked Jefferson’s name in urging Congress to approve a balanced budget amendment and send it to states for ratification. "This amendment isn’t my idea. It’s not even a new idea," Goodlatte said Sept. 3 in the Weekly Republican Address to the nation. "Thomas Jefferson expressed strong support for it in 1798." Goodlatte has authored two balanced budget amendments pending in the House. Both require that spending doesn’t outpace revenues in a given fiscal year unless three-fifths of Congress signs off on the deficit spending. We were well aware of Jefferson’s remarkable resume -- author of the Declaration of Independence and the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, governor, secretary of state, president and founder of the University of Virginia. But we had never heard that he was a father of the balanced budget amendment and wondered if that is true. A spokeswoman for Goodlatte told us the congressman’s assertion is based on a Nov. 26, 1798 letter Jefferson sent to his friend, John Taylor. "I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our constitution; I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine principles of its constitution," Jefferson wrote. "I mean an additional article taking from the federal government the power of borrowing." Kathryn Rexrode, Goodlatte’s press secretary, said ending federal borrowing would result in a balanced budget. Several Jefferson scholars told us there’s no doubt the former president opposed racking up national debt. But they said Jefferson’s position on federal borrowing, like much of his long life, was complicated and rife with contradiction. Princeton University is transcribing Jefferson’s correspondence through 1809 -- shortly after Jefferson’s presidency ended -- and expects it will fill 60 volumes. At Monticello, Jefferson’s plantation, editors are compiling additional correspondence from the statesman’s political retirement to his death in 1826. "Jefferson is a human being and he says a lot of things in the course of his very long career," said J. Jefferson Looney, a historian at Monticello and editor of the "Papers of Thomas Jefferson Retirement Series." Looney noted that during the War of 1812, Jefferson was open to the nation incurring debt. The evidence is a June 24, 1813 letter Jefferson wrote to U.S. Rep. John Wayles Eppes of Virginia, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee who was also the former president’s nephew and son-in-law. Jefferson wrote that debt was acceptable as long as as it was paid off in a generation, which he calculated to be 19 years. He also suggested imposing a tax to ensure the debt was paid off within that time frame. "I hope yourself and your committee will render the immortal service of introducing this practice not that it is expected that Congress should formally declare such a principle," Jefferson wrote. "They wisely enough avoid deciding on abstract questions but they may be induced to keep themselves within its limits." Is this a flip-flop? "You pick the year -- 1798, he’s for an amendment (banning federal borrowing)," Looney said. "In 1813 he’s saying it’s OK to borrow, but you have to borrow within certain restrictions, but don’t tie the hands of Congress by saying it’s a rule." Looney said Jefferson always fretted about public debt but appeared more concerned about it when his political adversaries, the Federalists, were in power. Historians also note that as president Jefferson relied on public debt to finance one of his most famous accomplishments - the $15 million Louisiana Purchase. The deal with France bought the U.S. more than 800,000 square miles of land west of the Mississippi River. "People often say he believed in getting rid of debt, then what happened when Louisiana came along? Of course he bought it," said Barbara Oberg, editor of The Papers of Thomas Jefferson published by Princeton University Press. "It would have been silly not to. He’s a wonderful, pragmatic statesman." A couple of historians told us Jefferson’s unease with public debt may have stemmed from his own financial difficulties. Monticello’s website notes that at the time of his death, Jefferson had debts totaling somewhere between $1 million and $2 million in modern dollars. The historians also cautioned against using 18th century references and applying it to today’s debate over a balanced budget. "I don’t think any politician, Jefferson or otherwise, at this point was presented with a balanced budget amendment as we understand that today," said J.C.A Stagg of the University of Virginia. Oberg said the 1798 letter cited by Goodlatte hardly qualifies as a public call to end government debt. After all, she said, Jefferson threw out the idea in a private letter. Our ruling: Goodlatte said that Thomas Jefferson "strongly supported" the idea of a balanced budget amendment in 1798. The congressman cites a 1798 letter Jefferson wrote to a friend saying he would like to see a constitutional amendment "taking from the federal government the power of borrowing." This lends some credence to Goodlatte’s claim, although it’s a stretch to conclude that the private letter proves Jefferson "strongly supported" a balanced budget mandate. Goodlatte omits that Jefferson’s thoughts on government debt evolved in later years. As president in 1803, he borrowed money to make the Louisiana Purchase. And in 1813, he wrote another private letter suggesting it is OK to run up debt so long as its paid off in a generation. So there’s some basis to Goodlatte’s characterization of Jefferson’s view in 1798, some exaggeration and some selective interpretation. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-07492	A cap-and-trade bill would "destroy over 50,000 jobs in Virginia."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/12/robert-hurt/robert-hurt-says-cap-and-trade-would-cost-50000-vi/	U.S. Rep. Robert Hurt, R-Va., took time out from the budget showdown March 25 to express his contempt for cap-and-trade legislation aimed at regulating and lowering greenhouse emissions. In a newsletter to his 5th District constituents, Hurt detailed his efforts to cut the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget. The freshman congressman wrote he is "a co-sponsor of H.R. 153, which would prohibit any funds at the EPA from being used to implement a cap-and-trade system that would harm our agriculture and manufacturing sectors, destroy over 50,000 jobs in Virginia, and amount to a job-crushing national energy tax when we can least afford it." A cap-and-trade bill known as Waxman-Markey passed the House during the prior Congress, only to die in the Senate. With the GOP now holding a majority in the House, the bill is generally considered dead. But Hurt’s claim that the legislation would cause more than 50,000 people to lose their jobs caught our eye. First, a word on how cap-and-trade would work. Each company with major greenhouse gas emissions would be subject to a cap on its emissions. Companies producing fewer emissions than their limit could trade or sell their extra emissions credits to companies exceeding the cap. The trading system would create a market for greenhouse gas emissions and give companies incentives to lower their emissions levels, since a cut in emissions could be turned into profits from the sale of extra credits. Each credit would cover one metric ton of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas and carry a price between $48 and $61 around 2020. The Waxman-Markey bill would have gradually lowered emission limits for companies. By 2020, U.S. emissions would be capped 17 percent below 2005 levels. In 2030, the level would be 42 percent below 2005 levels and 83 percent lower by 2050. Hurt drew his job-loss estimate from the National Association of Manufacturers, a business group opposed to the bill. NAM estimated that by 2030 Virginia could lose between 41,400 and 56,400 jobs because of the legislation, including lost mining jobs and positions lost if higher electricity prices cut back on manufacturing output. Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has also cited the report in making almost identical claims as Hurt. NAM’s analysis projects Virginia would see higher energy prices under the bill, since the state’s electric utilities rely heavily on coal-fired power plants. The plants produce high levels of greenhouse gasses and might need to be retooled or replaced with non-emitting power sources -- such as nuclear plants or wind turbines -- to help Dominion Virginia Power or other utilities comply with the proposed law. If the utility companies continued to use coal plants, they might need to purchase extra carbon permits, again leading to an additional cost that could raise prices. These higher electricity prices, in turn, could force job cuts in the coal mining and manufacturing sectors, the report says. But independent experts and the federal Energy Information Agency say it is extremely difficult to calculate the bill’s long-term impact on employment. An EIA report notes the difficulty of predicting the price and availability of renewable energy sources in 2030. If cheaper wind and solar power became available, higher electricity prices may not be a major issue under the bill. Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard University, said it is "not unreasonable to expect job losses in several sectors ... especially coal, unless we come up with some genuine clean coal technology." But Frankel said the NAM report cannot really make an accurate jobs forecast for 2030 when economists often struggle to make employment predictions more than 6 or 12 months in advance. The economist also said the NAM analysis ignores the jobs that would be created due to a growth in new, non-emission technologies. "My feeling, as I think most economists would agree, is that the jobs created would approximately equal the jobs lost," he said. Charles Kolstad, a professor of environmental economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, added that "long range forecasts of unemployment are highly suspect. Sectors change, people change jobs. Unemployment is by its nature transitory." The Congressional Budget Office, the independent research and analysis arm of Congress, notes in a report that cap-and-trade could shift demand away from fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas. The CBO said jobs in coal mining and at coal-fired power plants could decrease unless new technology is able to capture emissions. But the CBO also expects employment to increase in sectors that require fewer emissions, such as nuclear, solar and wind power. Its report says the Waxman-Markey system, where carbon caps tighten over several decades, "would probably have only a small effect on total employment." As the CBO and Kolstad noted, the U.S. economy is adept at retooling to meet new challenges. Manufacturing employment fell by about 3.5 million jobs from 2000 through 2007, but employment in other sectors increased by 8.2 million jobs in that period, continuing the 40-year shift in America’s economy from manufacturing jobs to service jobs. Though workers who lose coal mining or other fossil fuel-related jobs may need retraining before finding a new position, the CBO predicts that "most laid-off workers would find employment in other industries whose products are less emission-intensive." One potential problem, however, is the risk that job losses would be concentrated in small communities, such as those scattered across Virginia’s coal belt, where other job opportunities are limited. This could force workers to relocate to find new work. The National Mining Association reports Virginia had about 4,650 coal miners in 2009, compared with 21,665 in West Virginia and more than 18,000 in Kentucky. The Virginia Employment Commission reported the state had an average of 8,748 coal-mining and natural-gas jobs in the third quarter of 2010, the most recent period for which data are available. The VEC also says Virginia had about 230,700 manufacturing jobs as of February, and the NAM believes some of those could be threatened by higher energy prices. The mining jobs are concentrated in the Southwest Virginia district represented by Republican H. Morgan Griffith. Hurt’s district contains manufacturing jobs as well as three power plants, according to EIA records. Let’s review our findings. Hurt, citing solely from a short report by the National Association of Manufacturers, says a cap-and-trade bill would cost Virginia 50,000 jobs. The NAM is an opponent of the legislation. The non-partisan CBO acknowledges there would likely be job losses in certain mining and manufacturing sectors under a cap-and-trade bill. But unlike the NAM, the CBO accounts for jobs that would be gained in new sectors. Independent analysts also predict cap-and-trade would have a far smaller impact on Virginia employment than projected by NAM. They also note long-range employment projections can be dicey. A thorough economic analysis should consider both gains and losses from a policy. The NAM report fails to do that. Hurt’s statement, based on the study, omits critical facts. We rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12583	"Seven out of ten doctors are not taking any new Medicaid patients as lower reimbursement rates make it cost-prohibitive."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2017/apr/07/donna-campbell/donna-campbell-says-due-low-rates-70-percent-physi/	In a March 2017 email blast, a Texas state senator who's a physician said that in a meeting with President Donald Trump, she’d promoted federal block grants as a way to give states more sway over the costs of Medicaid, the decades-old federal-state insurance program for the poor and disabled. Donna Campbell, R-New Braunfels, then declared: "Seven out of ten doctors are not taking any new Medicaid patients as lower reimbursement rates make it cost-prohibitive." Really? Let’s gauge physician acceptance of Medicaid patients, then the program's payments. A Senate aide to Campbell, Curtis Buckley, said by email that Campbell based her 7-out-of-10 statistic on a 2012 Texas Medical Association survey indicating 44 percent of doctors were declining new Medicaid patients, 26 percent limited such patients and 31 percent accepted new Medicaid patients without restriction. Indeed, in 2013, we found Mostly True a claim tied to that survey that 31 percent of Texas physicians were accepting all new Medicaid patients. Those figures, we noted, were based on poll responses rather than hard numbers. There's fresher data. The group's 2016 survey, which we fielded from TMA spokesman Steve Levine, found 38 percent of physicans accepting no new Medicaid patients, 21 percent limiting such patients and 41 percent accepting new Medicaid patients without restriction. Both surveys, that is, indicated about four in 10 Texas practices not accepting new Medicaid patients. Levine, asked why the association surveys suggest some inching up in the share of Texas physicians accepting all Medicaid patients, said a factor was a provision in the 2010 Obamacare law that temporarily raised Medicaid rates paid for services by certain physicians. Buckley, Campbell’s aide, also pointed out a 2014 study by Merritt Hawkins, a Dallas-based health-focused consulting firm, testing Medicaid acceptance rates in Dallas and Houston. His nudge led us to find another Merritt Hawkins study, were released just before Campbell made her claim. It indicates that nationally as of early 2017, 53 percent of 1,414 contacted physician practices in major metro areas were accepting Medicaid insurance with 60 percent of 494 practices in mid-sized metro areas doing so. Acceptance rates were lower, though, in cities where different kinds of practices (cardiology, dermatology, obstetrics-gynecology, orthopedic surgery and family medicine) were queried by phone in January-February 2017. On average, 17 percent of Dallas practices, 26 percent of Odessa practices and 37 percent of Houston practices, respectively, reported accepting new Medicaid patients. The 2017 report said: "The rate at which physicians accept Medicaid can vary for a number of reasons. In some cases, reimbursement rates provided by Medicaid to particular specialists may be below their cost of providing services. If not actually below costs, Medicaid reimbursement often is relatively low compared to that offered by other payers, and busy physicians may have no economic incentive to see Medicaid patients. In other cases, the process of billing for and receiving Medicaid payment can be problematic and some physicians choose to avoid it." A Merritt Hawkins spokesman, Phil Miller, pointed us to yet another report, though its focus wasn't on acceptance of "new" Medicaid patients. The 2016 national survey of 17,200 physicians conducted by the company for the Physicians Foundation, which says it seeks to empower physicians to lead in the delivery of high-quality, cost-efficient healthcare, found 16 percent not seeing Medicaid patients, 20 percent limiting such patients and 64 percent accepting Medicaid patients. A chart based on the survey showed variations among states -- and that nearly 30 percent of Texas physicians did not accept Medicaid patients. State data Next, we asked the Texas Health and Human Services Commission for data on Texas physicians and Medicaid patients. By email, Christine Mann sent a spreadsheet indicating that in fiscal 2016, which ran through August 2016, 63,915 Texas physicians were enrolled in Medicaid, including 31,585 primary-care doctors. The sheet further says that as of September 2016, per the Texas Medical Board, 74,098 physicians were licensed to practice in Texas. So, about 85 percent of the state’s physicians had a connection to Medicaid, though Levine separately said that could overly represent doctors who only occasionally treat Medicaid patients in emergency rooms and in unusual circumstances. But the commission’s data showed that only 32,130 Texas physicians reported a paid Medicaid claim in fiscal 2016. Those doctors amounted to about 43 percent of physicians licensed to practice in the state. Yet there’s a twist to that too, Miller helped us recognize: Data tracked by the Texas Department of State Health Services shows that in 2016, the state had 50,948 "direct patient care physicians," meaning doctors who worked directly with patients as opposed to those who were researchers, administrators or teachers. If you assume direct-care doctors predominantly submitted the tallied paid claims, then you can hypothesize that 63 percent of active physicians had a paid Medicaid claim. Levine commented: "Still–having one Medicaid claim paid is not nearly the same as taking new (let alone all new) Medicaid patients." Other analyses For broader perspective, we turned to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which focuses on national health issues and said in a March 2017 web post that nationally, about 70 percent of office-based physicians accept new Medicaid patients. That figure is a little old; it traces to a 2015 study based on the 2013 National Electronic Health Records Survey, a nationally representative survey that collects information on physician and practice characteristics. According to the results, 68.9 percent of U.S. office-based physicians who accepted any new patients were accepting new Medicaid patients--with 57.6 percent of such Texas physicians doing so: We sought more recent data and Jeff Lancashire of the National Center for Health Statistics emailed us an excerpt from the 2015 NEHRS survey indicating 28.2 percent of primary-care physicians weren't accepting new Medicaid patients with 71.6 percent accepting such patients--with Texas-specific results yet to be posted, the center's Corey Slavitt told us. After Campbell made her statement, FactCheck.org, a fact-checking effort based at the University of Pennsylvania, posted a lengthy analysis of flaws in claims about low physician participation in Medicaid. "There are no continuous measures on Medicaid participation," that story says, "but federal statistics gathered over recent years show that the percentage of physicians accepting new Medicaid patients has remained around 70 percent," though the story says participation rates have been affected by differences in state-specific reimbursement rates. Medicaid fees Campbell’s aide, Buckley, said her reference to lower Medicaid fees tied to her professional background and her understanding that Medicaid fees have long been a factor in doctors not accepting or limiting new Medicaid patients. Buckley also pointed out a June 2016 analysis published by the TMA confirming that in Texas, "reimbursement amounts for the same procedures differ among payers, with public payers (Medicare and Medicaid) setting a much lower rate than" what private payers offer. Our hunt for expertise led us to Stephen Zuckerman, co-director of the Health Policy Center at the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Institute, which has surveyed state-set Medicaid fees since 1993. On March 5, 2017, the institute posted a report co-authored by Zuckerman indicating that in July 2016, Medicaid fees paid Texas physicians amounted, on average, to 65 percent of fees paid in the state by federally funded Medicare; nationally, Medicaid fees averaged 72 percent of Medicare fees. In Texas, the report says, Medicaid fees paid for primary care services in 2016 were 58 percent of Medicare fees; for obstetric services, 66 percent; and for other services, 85 percent. A chart in the report indicates 2016 Medicaid fees paid Texas physicians were up slightly, 0.2 percent, from 2014 and those fees amounted to 88 percent of average Medicaid fees paid nationally. By phone, Zuckerman said Medicaid’s relatively lower fees definitely influence some physician decisions to accept patients. Zuckerman said doctors also cite the hassles of signing up for Medicaid and submitting claims. Another expert, the Kaiser foundation’s Julia Paradise, said by phone that Medicaid fees and physician participation comprise part of the story. A broader issue, she said, is whether Medicaid beneficiaries have access to providers. In that vein, Zuckerman pointed out a University of Pennsylvania study published in March 2017 finding that in 2016, appointments could be scheduled by phone by Texas Medicaid patients with about 60 percent of primary-care physicians--an insignificant change from 2013, the researchers wrote. Texas private-pay patients were able to schedule appointments with more than 80 percent of primary-care physicians, the researchers found. Our ruling Campbell said: "Seven out of ten doctors are not taking any new Medicaid patients as lower reimbursement rates make it cost-prohibitive." Texas Medicaid payment rates indeed trail those for other kinds of insurance. But the crux of this statement, the 7-in-10 statistic, lacks factual footing partly because it combines different answers to an outdated Texas physician survey. In contrast, a 2016 national survey indicated about 2 in 10 U.S. physicians were not accepting Medicaid patients with about 6 in 10 accepting them. The same year, a survey found about four in 10 Texas doctors weren't accepting new Medicaid patients. It's worth noting, still, a 2017 study suggesting far more Texas specialists weren't accepting new Medicaid patients. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-13759	"An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-correct-lyndon-johnson-passed-legisla/	In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, presidential candidate Donald Trump singled out "the evangelical and religious community" for their assistance in getting him nominated. "They have much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits," he said. "An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away," Trump said. "I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and to protect free speech for all Americans." We were curious about the issue and whether an amendment — constitutional or otherwise — prevents the practice for religious institutions. For this fact-check, we're relying largely scholarly articles in the Denver University Law Review, the Case Western Reserve Law Review, Boston College Law Review. The restriction is actually a law, not an amendment, and it isn't exclusive to religious institutions. Lyndon Johnson is best known as America's 36th president, the Texan who assumed the office when John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Texas politics can be rough, and Johnson knew how to play that game. Therein lies the origin of the "Johnson amendment." The restriction was championed by LBJ in 1954 when Johnson was a U.S. senator running for re-election. A conservative nonprofit group that wanted to limit the treaty-making ability of the president produced material that called for electing his primary opponent, millionaire rancher-oilman Dudley Dougherty, and defeating Johnson. There was no church involved. Johnson, then Democratic minority leader, responded by introducing an amendment to Section 501(c)(3) of the federal tax code dealing with tax-exempt charitable organizations, including groups organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literacy and educational purposes, or to prevent cruelty to children or animals. It said, in effect, that if you want to be absolved from paying taxes, you couldn't be involved in partisan politics. There was no record of any debate around the amendment. "The logical argument favoring such an amendment is that those corporations qualifying for the section 501(c)(3) tax subsidy should not be permitted to directly or indirectly use that subsidy to support candidates for office," said Michael Hone in the Case Western article. However it was likely, he said, that "Johnson was motivated by a desire to exact revenge on the foundation he believed supported his opponent and to prevent it and other nonprofit corporations from acting similarly in the future." Nonetheless, "Subsequently it proved to have a profound effect on how thousands of tax-exempt organizations — including churches — dealt with issues relating to political campaigns," according to Patrick O'Daniel of the University of Texas School of Law in the Boston College article. The law says all such organizations "are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office." That includes contributions to political campaigns and any form of public statement for or against a candidate or group of candidates. Violating the restriction could result in the revocation of the organization's tax exempt status and the imposition of taxes. Nonpartisan, unbiased voter education or similar activities such as church-organized voter registration drives are allowed. Historically, that hasn't stopped some religious organizations from issuing endorsements anyway. O'Daniel has a list of examples. To cite two from 2000: Rev. Jerry Falwell told worshippers at the Genoa Baptist Church in Ohio to "vote for the Bush of your choice" and "We simply have to beat (Al) Gore." That same year, a pastor at a Bronx church who supported Hillary Clinton's run for the U.S. Senate at the time, substituted her opponent's name for Satan during a hymn. "In the face of lackluster opposition by the Internal Revenue Service, the Democrats and Republicans . . . continue to use the literal bully pulpits of the churches to preach to the party faithful," O'Daniel wrote. Nonetheless, the threat of losing tax-exempt status persists as long as the law is in place, and politically-minded religious groups, particularly evangelicals, have regarded it as a suppression of free speech and an entanglement of the IRS in the operation of their religion. In 2008, for example, pastors in 20 states organized to give politically-oriented sermons to protest the law, according to the Pew Research Center. The GOP platform has picked up that cudgel, calling for the repeal of that portion of the tax law. The Johnson amendment survived court challenges in 1983, 1990 and 2000, according to Pew. Our ruling Trump said, "An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views." Trump is correct that the law was pushed by Johnson and that religious groups that advocate for candidates risk losing their tax exempt status. It's important to note that the prohibition is not just restricted to religious institutions. It's nonprofit charitable organizations in general. But overall, we rate the statement as True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/519857c8-1caa-412b-9ad9-04aa24f141e6	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-22T01:02:06	2016-07-21	['None']

pomt-05861	Oregon House Republicans’ jobs plan could generate more than 50,000 jobs over five years.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/feb/11/kevin-cameron/oregon-house-republicans-tout-five-year-plan-50000/	Oregon House Republican leader Kevin Cameron came out swinging in January with a jobs plan that his caucus says could create 50,000 jobs over five years. The plan calls for a mix of tax cuts as well as job growth in forestry, farms and food processing. Cameron insists it’s not a partisan plan and has offered to work with House Democrats who share the chamber with Republicans 30-30. Democrats said no, thank you, so we’re pretty sure the package won’t go anywhere this month. But a reader asked -- and we agree -- that the numbers need vetting. What’s their documentation for the claim that "the plan could generate more than 50,000 jobs?" As our sister organization PolitiFact Florida wrote in July 2010, we can’t weigh in on what may or may not happen in the future. But like PolitiFact Florida, we can check whether the House plan, as put together, actually calls for 50,000 jobs over five years. In other words, has a valid third party come by these numbers in some way? Cameron is wise to use the word "could." And to put it into perspective, 50,000 jobs isn’t too big. Portland Mayor Sam Adams said way back when that he would bring 10,000 jobs over five years in the city. Also, Portland metro area employers added 14,200 jobs over the last year, according to December unemployment figures reported by The Oregonian’s Richard Read. Nick Smith of the House Republicans provided emails and spreadsheets generated by the building’s nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office, backed up by reports and data from Business Oregon and the state agencies of Employment, Forestry and Agriculture. There are seven components to the plan: (1) Water: Use 450,000 acre feet of water from the Columbia River to boost jobs in farm and food processing. The Agriculture Department estimates 72 acre feet of water could equal one direct job. That would yield 6,250 jobs, plus an additional 4,000 indirect jobs based on a multiplier used by Oregon State University. (2) Forests: Increase the amount of new growth timber harvested, adding 175 million board feet of timber to the 275 million board feet harvested in 2010. Legislative Revenue Officer Paul Warner checked with Forestry and calculated 7. 3 direct jobs for each million and 4.7 indirect jobs for each million, totaling 1,278 direct jobs and 823 indirect jobs. (3) Enterprise: Create more enterprise and e-commerce zones, providing incentives to companies that promise to hire people. The Legislative Revenue Office estimates 4,900 direct jobs and 3,200 indirect jobs. (4) Construction: Create an income tax credit for capital improvements to private homes and businesses. Legislative Revenue estimates the creation of more than 4,000 direct jobs and 2,600 indirect jobs. (5) Unemployed: Give businesses a tax break to hire people. Legislative Revenue projects more than 600 direct jobs and 400 indirect jobs. So far, that adds up to a little more than 17,000 direct jobs and roughly 11,000 indirect jobs. (Indirect jobs refers to the assortment of jobs that could be propped up by the direct job, such as at companies that supply material or at bars that serve thirsty new workers.) The final two proposals rely on a "general equilibrium analysis," and not impact analysis, which is why there’s no breakout between direct and indirect jobs. (6) Taxes: Double the income in the two lowest tax brackets, and provide a $250 per child tax credit. Combined, this should save a family of four with an adjusted gross income of $35,000 a year, about $927 a year. Legislative Revenue Office estimates more than 18,500 jobs at the end of five years. (7) Capital gains: Reduce the tax rate to 2.5 percent for two years, and then increase to 5 percent. This is expected to translate into nearly 3,800 jobs in 2016. Again, PolitiFact Oregon is not in a position to second-guess economic modeling by Legislative Revenue. But we did ask Paul Warner, the top man there, and Chris Allanach to walk us through some of the analyses. At the end, we asked: Is it fair to say this plan could result in 50,000 jobs? "Overall, I think it’s objective and under certain conditions I think those are reasonable approximations," Warner said. But, he also added, who knows what sorts of global and national factors might have an impact on our jobs picture five years from now? We turned to House Democrats to get their take. Jared Mason-Gere directed us to Steve Robinson, a consultant and former state analyst. Robinson questions the numbers -- as well as the philosophies behind the tax cuts -- and reminds us of jobs lost by the reduction in money to the public sector, such as at the Department of Human Services. (He points us to a report by ECONorthwest that examines the impact of loss of funding on long-term care workers.) We totally get that economists could measure impact on jobs in different ways. But the only real question we had left for Warner was whether his analyses regarding taxes and capital gains projected net jobs, in other words, accounting for losses as well as gains. He said yes, after a five-year period. "So when you reach this new equilibrium state, your private sector is bigger and your public sector is smaller," Warner said. We have a ruling to make. We stated upfront that we don’t have the economic credentials to second-guess these numbers, but we’ve largely cleared them of political manipulation. There are caveats galore, but House Republicans have relied on neutral third-parties to come up with job impact analyses. The only quibble we have is that indirect jobs are not the same as direct jobs estimated, and the statement should have included the distinction. Still, we end up with nearly 40,000 direct jobs estimated. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Kevin Cameron	None	None	None	2012-02-11T00:00:00	2012-01-21	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-06080	Says area near proposed northern Wisconsin iron ore mine is "15 hours away" from where public hearing on mining was held.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/08/kelda-helen-roys/public-hearing-wisconsin-mining-held-15-hours-away/	Passions run high over whether Wisconsin should allow a four-mile, 1,000-foot-deep iron ore mine near Hurley, a burg perched on the state’s northern border that brags of "wilderness, waterfalls and wildlife." And passions can sometimes lead to exaggeration. In a news release issued Jan. 5, 2012, state Rep. Kelda Helen Roys, D-Madison, complained that a hearing on speeding the approval process for new mines was held in southeastern Wisconsin -- "15 hours away" from the mine region. Whoa. Stop the car. We love to drive through Wisconsin, but it seems like after 15 hours in the car, we’d be able to get from one end of the state to the other. And back. With plenty of time for potty breaks. To be sure, the distance question isn’t the most important issue in the mining debate. But the statement underlines how high the emotions are on the issue. Instead of driving the distance ourselves, we asked Roy, an attorney for her evidence. In her original news release, Roys cheered the fact that a Republican-controlled committee of the state Assembly, which is considering legislation to change the mine approval process, had changed course and decided to hold a public hearing on the measure in Hurley. The panel had held a hearingon the bill Dec. 14, 2011 near Milwaukee, which is a major center for mining equipment manufacturing. But only after two angry Assembly Democrats scheduled their own hearing for Jan. 7, 2012 in Ashland, much closer to Hurley, did the committee set a hearing in Hurley for Jan. 11, 2012. That led the Democrats to cancel their hearing. "I am pleased that the Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economy and Small Business has reconsidered and will now hold a public hearing in Hurley on the bill to permit a giant strip mine in northern Wisconsin," Roys began her news release. "It remains unclear why the original plan was to have the only hearing in Milwaukee -- 15 hours away from those most directly affected." Hurley and Milwaukee -- actually, the first hearing was held at State Fair Park in suburban West Allis -- are on opposite ends of the state. But Mapquest tells us the drive from Hurley to West Allis is about 300 miles and 5-1/2 hours by one route, or about 320 miles and 6-1/2 hours by another. Roy’s response: We should not be measuring the distance from West Allis to Hurley, but rather to communities to the north and west of Hurley such as Ashland and Superior. They are home to "lakes, streams, wetlands and groundwater that would be impacted" by the mine, she said. And we shouldn’t just measure the distance there, she said. We should measure it there and back. In bad weather. For residents of those communities, Roys said, "it was indeed a 15-hour round-trip drive, through snow and inclement weather," to West Allis. But that’s setting the claim on a whole new road. Roys had complained that the West Allis hearing was held "15 hours away from those most directly affected" -- in other words, claiming it would take a person 15 hours to drive to the hearing from northwestern Wisconsin. Roys also said that according to Google maps, "it takes 14 hours and 1 minute to travel the 772 miles from Port Wing," which is between Ashland and Superior. But then she goes on to acknowledge that that distance and duration would be round-trip between Port Wing and West Allis, not one way. Indeed, Mapquest shows that the longer of two driving routes between West Allis and Port Wing is 385 miles and just over seven hours one way. Roys concluded her email by telling us not to "miss the bigger point here," saying it was "an extremely long and inconvenient drive" for northwest Wisconsin residents to attend the West Allis hearing. OK. It is, indeed, a lengthy drive from northwestern Wisconsin to West Allis. About seven hours long, or less. Not 15. We rate Roys’ statement False.

pomt-00876	Said former U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Scott Gration "was forced to resign two years ago because of his personal use of emails."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/11/david-shuster/no-email-use-didnt-sink-us-ambassador-kenya/	Hillary Clinton’s press conference about her use of a private email account when she was secretary of state basically came down to two points. She wants people to trust that she turned over every email that she should have, and that she "fully complied with every rule." But before she even left the podium, Clinton got pushback on whether she truly did follow State Department rules. David Shuster, a New York reporter for Al Jazeera America, brought up the 2012 resignation of Scott Gration, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya. "What about Scott Gration, who was forced to resign two years ago because of his personal use of emails?" Shuster asked. "David, I think you should go online and read the entire IG (inspector general) report," Clinton replied. "That is not an accurate representation of what happened." The case of ambassador Gration has come up frequently in recent days. The man himself was a guest on CNN’s State of the Union where he said that on the email issue, he was the victim of a double-standard. We thought it would be worth getting to the bottom of the assertion that Gration was forced to resign because of his personal use of emails. One of Obama’s biggest fans President Barack Obama appointed Gration to head the American embassy in Kenya in 2011. Gration was a retired Air Force general who had spent years in East Africa as the child of missionaries. Gration toured Africa with Obama in 2006 and was completely won over by the man who would become president. He was an early and key foreign policy adviser to Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and was tapped by the president to serve as Obama’s special envoy to Sudan. He moved from that post to lead the embassy in Nairobi. Less than a year and half later, Gration departed, saying in his resignation letter that "differences with Washington regarding my leadership style and certain priorities lead me to believe that it’s now time to leave." Gration stepped down about a month before the release of an internal management audit by the State Department’s Office of Inspector General. In keeping with standard process, Gration had seen that report and was given the chance to respond before it came out. A damaging assessment The first bullet point in the inspector general’s report is a global indictment of Gration’s capacity to serve as chief of mission. It reads: "The Ambassador has lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission. Of more than 80 chiefs of mission inspected in recent cycles, the Ambassador ranked last for interpersonal relations, next to last on both managerial skill and attention to morale, and third from last in his overall scores from surveys of mission members. The inspectors found no reason to question these assessments; the Ambassador’s leadership to date has been divisive and ineffective." The auditors noted that many of the 19 federal agencies operating out of the embassy had little or no access to Gration, who they said showed an "ongoing unwillingness" to meet with agency heads. The auditors reported confusion and disruption. "Unless corrected there is a risk that the country team will become dysfunctional," the auditors wrote. Other issues included that Gration did not read classified cables and that an initiative he launched redirecting nearly $550 million in U.S. health assistance proved "disruptive." Communications with Washington were a significant source of friction, and Gration’s use of a personal email account was just one example of a larger pattern. The inspector general’s report said Gration "does not read classified front channel messages and has not established a system to have his staff screen incoming cables relevant to Kenya and U.S. interests in the region." Relating to emails, the report said: "The Ambassador’s greatest weakness is his reluctance to accept clear-cut U.S. Government decisions. He made clear his disagreement with Washington policy decisions and directives concerning the safe-havening in Nairobi of families of Department employees who volunteered to serve in extreme hardship posts; the creation of a freestanding Somalia Unit; and the nonuse of commercial email for official government business, including Sensitive But Unclassified information. Notwithstanding his talk about the importance of mission staff doing the right thing, the Ambassador by deed or word has encouraged it to do the opposite." The report goes on to say that Gration "ordered a commercial Internet connection installed in his embassy office bathroom so he could work there on a laptop not connected to the Department email system," and that Gration "very infrequently logs onto his classified account, which would allow him to read cables and classified emails." To our reading, Gration’s email habits were one point in a series of issues. Ronald Neumann, who served as American ambassador three times, most recently in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007, agreed. Neumann, who is now president of the American Academy of Diplomacy, said he finds it hard to miss the main message of the inspector general’s report. The message, Neumann said, is, "The ambassador is completely incompetent and should be removed as quickly as possible before he does any more damage to American interests." Neumann said from his experience, the staff in the Inspector General’s Office are credible and objective. He had no direct experience with the embassy in Kenya, but his reading of the report suggested the email issue played a minor role. "It could be an important issue, but when you screw up as many things as this guy did, it’s hard to get through to that one," Neumann said. We reached out to Shuster via email and through Al Jazeera’s press office and did not hear back. In an email to several news organizations, Gration said he was "‘'fired’ for the use of Gmail in the U.S. Embassy, my insistence on improving our physical security posture, and other twisted and false allegations." Our ruling Shuster said Gration was forced to resign because of his use of personal email accounts. That was one issue State Department officials raised. But just one of many. The State Department Inspector General’s report paints a much more troubling picture of an embassy in disarray under Gration’s leadership. In the words of the auditors, Gration "has lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission." Gration ranked at or near the absolute bottom among other ambassadors assessed by the department. His use of email was an issue, but according to an ambassador with much experience, it was a relatively minor one. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-14991	Says as secretary of state she was reserving judgment about the Trans-Pacific Partnership and "hoped it would be the gold standard."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/13/hillary-clinton/what-hillary-clinton-really-said-about-tpp-and-gol/	Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defended her opposition of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the first Democratic debate of the 2016 race. Clinton announced last week that she no longer supports the international trade deal, despite supporting it while serving as secretary of state -- once calling it the "gold standard." CNN anchor and debate moderator Anderson Cooper picked up on those words and asked Clinton about her reversal at the Oct. 13 debate in Las Vegas. "I did say, when I was secretary of state, three years ago, that I hoped it would be the gold standard," Clinton said. "It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn't meet my standards. My standards for more new, good jobs for Americans, for raising wages for Americans. And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle-class American and say, ‘this will help raise your wages.’ And I concluded I could not." Clinton’s phrasing -- that she said she "hoped it would be the gold standard" -- implies that she was undecided on the TPP. But that doesn’t exactly match up to her prior comments. We found that her previous remarks actually gave the impression that she had confidence in the deal as it stood. In Australia in 2012, Clinton delivered remarks on the general topic of the U.S.-Australia relationship. Here’s everything she said about the TPP in that address, with the "gold standard" comment in bold. "So it's fair to say that our economies are entwined, and we need to keep upping our game both bilaterally and with partners across the region through agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. Australia is a critical partner. This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment." So it seems Clinton is saying the TPP does, definitevely set the gold standard -- as opposed to Clinton hoping it will. In other addresses around the same time, she expressed similar assuredness that the TPP would meet a high standard. In November 2012 remarks in Singapore, she encouraged all nations "willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP" to join the deal. "The so-called TPP will lower barriers, raise standards, and drive long-term growth across the region. It will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and establish strong protections for workers and the environment. Better jobs with higher wages and safer working conditions, including for women, migrant workers and others too often in the past excluded from the formal economy will help build Asia's middle class and rebalance the global economy. Canada and Mexico have already joined the original TPP partners. We continue to consult with Japan. And we are offering to assist with capacity building, so that every country in ASEAN can eventually join. We welcome the interest of any nation willing to meet 21st century standards as embodied in the TPP, including China." Here are some of the other words Clinton used to describe the TPP before she left the State Department in 2013: "exciting," "innovative," "ambitious," "groundbreaking," "cutting-edge," "high-quality" and "high-standard." (To read more of her comments in full, check out our previous article on this subject.) As a presidential candidate Clinton has used more hedging language, for example saying she has "some concerns," and now she has said she outright doesn’t support the deal as it stands. In her 2014 memoir Hard Choices, she wrote: "Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. It’s safe to say the TPP won’t be perfect -- no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be -- but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers." In fairness to Clinton, the TPP was still under negotiation when Clinton made the "gold standard" comment. The partners only finalized the deal this year. It’s quite possible the deal looks dramatically different than it did at the early stages of negotiations, when Clinton was at the State Department -- something Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill pointed out to us for this fact-check. The negotiations have been conducted in secret, so it’s hard for us to assess that ourselves. Also, as secretary of state, she spoke as a representative of the Obama administration, which was and remains wholeheartedly in favor of the deal. Our ruling Clinton said when she was secretary of state, she was reserving judgment but "hoped (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) would be the gold standard." She’s twisting her 2012 remarks a bit. Clinton said, "This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements," which is a more confident claim than if she had said she "hoped" it would meet that standard. This is in contrast to more recent comments where Clinton said she had concerns about the deal and that she ultimately opposes it. The statement is distorting her previous comments.

pomt-01607	The United States had "allies lined up" for air strikes in Syria and then Obama "pulled the rug out."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/31/peter-king/peter-king-us-had-allies-lined-air-strikes-syria-o/	Sunday marked the one-year point from President Barack Obama’s Aug. 31, 2013, Rose Garden address seeking congressional approval to conduct air strikes in Syria against Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Twelve months later, the situation in Syria remains a troubling international crisis, amplified by the growing presence of the terrorist group Islamic State, also known as ISIS, throughout the region. Across all five major Sunday political shows, Republicans — and even some Democrats — criticized the administration’s response to the unrest, with many politicians and pundits leaching on to Obama’s remark Thursday that "we don’t have a strategy yet" for dealing with the Islamic State. Among the critics was Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who said on CBS’ Face the Nation, "I wish our president was showing the same leadership that (British Prime Minister) David Cameron showed. What is President Obama waiting for?" "It was a year ago this all started," King added. "I remember being in the White House with (White House Chief of Staff) Denis McDonough talking about the importance of air attacks in Syria, and we had allies lined up and then the president pulled the rug out. And those allies are going to be very hard now to get back into a coalition." We looked at a similar claim in March, when former Vice President Dick Cheney said, "a lot of the allies signed on (for airstrikes in Syria). At the last minute, Obama backed off." We rated that statement Mostly False. Given the recent developments, we thought King’s comments about what happened a year ago deserved a review. Unlike Cheney, King does not go so far as to claim "a lot of allies signed on" to air strikes. The push to intervene in Syria came to a head on Aug. 21, 2013, when the Assad regime attacked a rebel-held area on the outskirts of Damascus using chemical weapons. A year earlier, Obama had said "a red line for (military intervention) is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized." Within a week of the attack, the administration was talking about launching air strikes at weapon depots and military command centers in Syria. To do so, Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry tried to garner support from the international community. Leaders in France and Britain immediately jumped on board the idea of limited air strikes. On Aug. 27, 2013, French President Francois Hollande said, "France is ready to punish those who took the heinous decision to gas innocents." A top British official was quoted as saying it was "reasonable to assume our armed forces are making contingency plans." But Prime Minister Cameron suffered an embarrassing rebuke Aug. 29, 2013, at the hands of Parliament — controlled by his own party — which narrowly voted to defeat a motion to support military intervention in Syria. According to the Telegraph, it was "the first time that a British Government has been blocked from executing a military deployment." Cameron later called off a military deployment. Support among the other European states was equally hard to find. Italy said it would only go along if the U.N. Security Council approved the use of force (which didn’t happen). Germany, seen as a pivotal player, was clearly against military action. Germany signed on to a G20 statement that called the use of poisonous gas a war crime and said the Syrian government was the likely culprit. But the statement added, "The EU underscores at the same time the need to move forward with addressing the Syrian crisis through the U.N. process." The strongest legal justification for an air strike would come through the U.N. Security Council. That was impossible to achieve since two permanent members, Russia and China, had made it clear they would veto any such resolution. Within NATO, Turkey was a major proponent of intervention. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia was the most eager to see an attack on Syria, a long-time political foe. Qatar and the United Arab Emirates were also on board. However, the Arab League, which includes Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, never approved a military strike. In the end, the most significant show of unity with allies was a Sept. 6 joint statement between the United States and Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and the United Kingdom calling for "a strong international response to this grave violation of the world’s rules and conscience that will send a clear message that this kind of atrocity can never be repeated. Those who perpetrated these crimes must be held accountable." However, a "strong international response" was never defined, and eventually even France said it wanted to wait for a final report from U.N. chemical weapons inspectors. King also claimed support among allies dissipated because Obama "pulled the rug out" from plans to launch air strikes. It’s unclear exactly what moment King is referencing (his staff did not respond to an email seeking further explanation). But widespread hesitance to intervene among the international community was palpable from the start. Even before Obama sought congressional support for targeted military strikes on Aug. 31, 2013, — as opposed to unilateral action — Britain had already voted against any military action. It’s true Obama had a hand in shelving military action when the United States and Russia struck a deal that sidelined the use of force in exchange for Syria giving up its chemical weapons (which has since been completed). At that point, an international movement for significant military intervention dissipated since the source of the angst — Assad’s use of chemical weapons — was eliminated. But support was already fading anyway. Our ruling King said, "we had allies lined up (to launch air strikes on Syria) then the president pulled the rug out." A handful of allies "lined up" for air strikes. We counted France, Turkey and Saudi Arabia as countries that were supportive. Hardly an overwhelming show of hands, but King did not specify how many in his remarks. Among the "no" crowd were key allies like the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. The Arab League and the United Nations also balked. Any support faded after Russia helped broker a diplomatic solution in which Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Peter King	None	None	None	2014-08-31T15:58:30	2014-08-31	['United_States', 'Syria', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-05411	Says "in our gun laws we’re allowing domestic abusers to sidestep this ban on getting a gun. The loophole allows a convicted abuser to walk into a gun show and walk out with a gun, no questions asked."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/03/frank-lautenberg/frank-lautenberg-claims-loophole-allows-individual/	U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg pushed through a law 15 years ago that prohibits people convicted of domestic violence from acquiring a gun. But the Democrat said there’s still avenues for those individuals to arm themselves. Lautenberg spoke April 26 on the Senate floor in favor of reauthorizing legislation that supports efforts to help victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse. During his speech, he said even more needs to be done in this area. "Let me be clear. It would be tragic to turn our backs on victims and the people who dedicate their lives to supporting them. While we can’t stop all malicious acts, we can do more to keep women and their families safe," Lautenberg said. "In 1996, I wrote the domestic violence gun ban, [which] forbids anyone convicted of domestic violence from getting a gun. Since the law's inception, we have kept guns from falling into violent hands on over 200,000 occasions. For instance, in our gun laws we’re allowing domestic abusers to sidestep this ban on getting a gun. The loophole allows a convicted abuser to walk into a gun show and walk out with a gun, no questions asked." PolitiFact New Jersey wondered if it’s that simple for someone who, under federal law isn’t allowed to have a gun, to buy one. "Yes," said James Jacobs, director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law, it’s "that simple." Lautenberg was describing what is commonly known as the "gun show loophole." The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, or Brady Act, requires all federally licensed firearms dealers to run a background check on potential customers to ensure they are not prohibited from owning a gun. But private sellers without a federal license don’t have to meet the same requirement. Though this exception is known as the "gun show loophole," unlicensed individuals don’t have to perform background checks whether they are selling a gun at a gun show or somewhere else. "Of course, a prohibited possessor can also buy from a private party outside of a gun show with no paperwork or background check," said Gabriel Chin, professor of law at the University of California at Davis School of Law. "But the trick is that many of the private sellers at gun shows are really unlicensed full time dealers, so they may be selling scores or hundreds of guns a year with no paperwork. Because of the volume, they are much more reliable sources of firearms for prohibited possessors." As a result of the loophole, "it’s possible a convicted felon could go into a gun show and buy a firearm without ever being checked," said Chris Bombardiere, public information officer at the Newark Field Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. That isn’t possible everywhere, however, since some states have passed more restrictive gun laws. According to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, 17 states, including New Jersey, "have either closed the gun show loophole or have taken action to close the loophole." Our ruling Lautenberg said that "in our gun laws we’re allowing domestic abusers to sidestep this ban on getting a gun. The loophole allows a convicted abuser to walk into a gun show and walk out with a gun, no questions asked." That statement is true because federal law does not require individuals who are not federally licensed to perform background checks before a gun transaction, whether they are at a gun show or not. Though laws can vary state to state and some states have passed laws that have essentially closed that loophole, this does not diminish Lautenberg’s statement. He was speaking on the Senate floor about federal law. We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-07208	"We’re the seventh highest taxed state in America. And that’s not just state, it’s local as well."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/06/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-ohioans-carry-seventh-heavies/	Out on the stump, Gov. John Kasich loves talking taxes—specifically about how he thinks people in Ohio pay too much in them. During his successful run for governor against Democrat Ted Strickland in 2010, Kasich claimed that Ohio was one of the most heavily taxed states in a television ad that got major airplay around Labor Day. And the Republican governor was talking again about tax burdens at a May 24 event in Dublin, a Columbus suburb, as part of a discussion about his state budget proposal and the need for Ohio to stay competitive with other states. The state, he said, has given local entities, like schools and libraries and governments, the tools to keep their costs down, and they shouldn’t be going to voters for tax increases to offset cuts from the state. "If we don’t lower our taxes, we’re not competitive," Kasich told a GOP-friendly crowd inside a local ice cream parlor. "We’re the seventh highest taxed state in America. And that’s not just state, it’s local as well." Politifact Ohio gave Kasich a Half True rating for when he called Ohio one of the most taxed states last fall. But the governor’s now getting more specific about how he defines "taxed" by placing it in the context of Ohio’s combined local and state tax burdens. And he’s got a ranking — seventh in the country. So we decided to give this issue another study. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols pointed to a study from the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, which crunched state and local tax data and found Ohio to be seventh-highest among the 50 states. This ranking was most recently referenced by the group in a release entitled Fiscal Fact #207, dated Jan. 7, 2010. But the numbers have been updated since Kasich made his claim last fall and that data is no longer the most current from the Tax Foundation. A more recent Feb. 23, 2011 report from the group, entitled Special Report #189, ranks Ohio 18th in tax burden among the 50 states and suggests Ohio hasn’t been as high as seventh in tax burden since 2005. So why did a Jan. 2010 report from the group say Ohio was currently seventh? Tax Foundation spokesman Richard Morrison said the methodology used by the group is "tweaked" from report to report slightly and that updated, more accurate information is applied to back years which changes the rankings for multiple years from one report to the next. Additionally, there is an ongoing debate in taxation circles over whether the methodology employed by the Tax Foundation to determine a state’s local and state tax burden is correct. That’s because the group adjusts raw census data in certain ways to include considering taxes Ohioans may pay in other states before diving a state’s total tax collections by total personal income. In contrast, the Federation of Tax Administrators, sticks with the raw census data without making any adjustments. Their numbers had Ohio 16th in percentage of personal income paid to tax collectors in 2008. They haven’t yet crunched any numbers for 2009. Ron Alt, research economist for the Federation of Tax Administrators, said he thinks Ohio is getting close to the middle of the pack when it comes to tax burden around the country. "My judgment is that it’s close to the median in ranking," he said. "I would say it’s a pretty typical tax burden." So where does that leave Kasich’s claim? Kasich said Ohio had the seventh highest state and local tax burden in the country, relying on a study of the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation study. However, that figure was for 2005 and the study has been updated with the most recent set of rankings showing the state to have the 18th highest state and local tax burden. Another tax ranking, compiled by the more neutral Federation of Tax Administrators, showed Ohio 16th in state and local tax burden in 2008. No matter which set of rankings you use, Ohio clearly no longer has the seventh-highest tax burden. Kasich needs to update his talking points, and start giving his fellow Republicans a little credit for the full impact of the income tax cuts they began delivering to Ohioans back in 2005. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kasich’s claim as False.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2011-06-06T06:00:00	2011-05-24	['United_States']
pomt-14134	"The overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising is not going to Hillary (Clinton) to run for president. ... It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2016/may/05/george-clooney/george-clooney-decries-big-money-politics-says-mos/	Editor's note, May 4, 2016: We originally published this item on April 17 and rated it Mostly True. Since then, readers have contacted us to consider other evidence about the Democratic Party’s fundraising processes, especially state parties sending money back to the Democratic National Committee. We have updated and rerated this fact-check based on new information, changing the rating from Mostly True to Half True. You can read an archived version of the original report here. You had to pay — or collect — as much as $353,000 per couple to attend recent fundraisers for Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, including one hosted at the home of actor George Clooney. After the affair drew protesters who support Bernie Sanders, Chuck Todd, host of NBC's Meet the Press, asked Clooney what happened when he encountered them. Clooney said he was accused of being a corporate shill, which is "one of the funnier things you could say about me." Then he told Todd, "The overwhelming amount of money that we're raising, and it is a lot, but the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising is not going to Hillary to run for president, it's going to the down-ticket. "It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress. And the reason that's important (is) ... we need to take the Senate back because we need to confirm the Supreme Court justice, because that fifth vote on the Supreme Court can overturn Citizens United and get this obscene, ridiculous amount of money out so I never have to do a fundraiser again. And that's why I'm doing it." Here, we’re fact-checking Clooney’s claim, "The overwhelming amount of money that we're raising, and it is a lot, but the overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising is not going to Hillary to run for president … It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress." What we found is that Clooney is technically accurate about most of the money not going to Clinton’s campaign, but it’s not necessarily going to "congressmen and senators." Clooney is right about the direct support for Clinton’s presidential campaign. Federal law says individuals can't give more than $2,700 to a presidential candidate's primary campaign. Another $2,700 can be collected for the general election. It doesn't matter whether you give it directly or a friend collects it from you on the candidate's behalf, the limit is there. Where the rest of those big-dollar donations end up is a bit of a maze. We’ll try to walk you through it. In this case, the Clinton California fundraisers were held on behalf of the Hillary Victory Fund, which distributes the money to Clinton's campaign committee, Hillary for America. But it also distributes money to the Democratic National Committee and the state parties. A donor can also give up to $33,400 a year to the DNC and $10,000 a year to each of the state parties for use in getting its candidates elected to federal office. If you do the math, with 32 state parties included in the Victory Fund, that's $356,100. The state parties generally are tasked with helping elect Democrats at the state level, and the DNC does the same at the national level. The way the donations are divided is explained at the bottom of the Hillary Victory Fund page on the Clinton website. The first $2,700 goes to Clinton, the next $33,400 goes to the DNC and the rest goes to state parties. How does this translate into total donations for each group? If you look at the money going out, which is available through campaign finance reports, it looks like Clinton is getting most of the money. According to the Center for Responsive Politics by the end of 2015, the Hillary Victory Fund had given $4.4 million to Clinton, $2.3 million to the DNC, and $2.2 to state political parties. That makes Clinton's share through 2015 almost exactly 50 percent. In the first quarter of this year, Clinton's share was 63 percent of the money that was officially spent on campaigns. Politico reported that the fund also spent $6.7 million for "online ads that mostly looked like Clinton campaign ads, as well as $5.5 million on direct marketing." The Clinton campaign gets the lion's share of the money collected by the Victory Fund, said Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin, because most of the donors give much smaller amounts, and everything up to $2,700 per person is earmarked to go to Hillary for America first. It's when a donor exceeds that limit that the excess spills over to benefit the national and state Democratic committees. Or — in the case of the state parties — that's how it appears on paper. Federal Election Commission records show that in most cases, the money given to the state parties has been immediately redirected to the DNC. The money isn't staying with the states at all. On May 2, Politico published a story reporting that 88 percent of the state money was immediately passed along to the DNC. In some cases, the state parties didn't even know the money had gone in and out of their accounts until after the fact. The Hillary Victory Fund sent $214,100 to Minnesota, for example, and that state party didn't keep a dime. It was routed to the DNC, which otherwise wouldn’t have been able to accept the money "since it came from donors who had mostly had already maxed out to the national party committee," Politico reported. We contacted the DNC and the Clinton campaign to try to understand what was compelling the states to immediately send funds back to the DNC. We couldn’t get straight answers. The Clinton campaign provided a copy of the agreement with the state parties, but it contains no language requiring such a transfer. Although DNC spokesman Luis Miranda said that the terms of the agreement called for states to send the money to the DNC for election infrastructure, Clinton spokesman Schwerin was emphatic that the state committees were free to keep whatever money they wanted. However, a Feb. 20 Washington Post story on Clinton's fundraising efforts says the executive director of Utah's Democratic party said state party officials understood they were supposed to send back money to DNC headquarters. So if money is going back to the DNC, what’s it being spent on? The overarching response of both the Clinton campaign and the DNC was that the money being diverted to the DNC was, in fact, being used to help local Democrats get elected. Those candidates need voter information, research, media monitoring, organizing capacity and other infrastructure services provided by the DNC to run a successful campaign, and that's how the money was being used. However, such services also benefit the Clinton campaign. "The process Hillary Victory is using has been common practice for a number of years," said Bob Biersack, senior fellow at the Center for Responsive Politics. "The states always agree because they have no choice. Transferring the money back to the national party is a condition of participating. They do it in hopes of getting some good will from the national party down the road." As for the degree to which the system really helps House and Senate candidates, Biersack said there isn't a precise answer. He noted that the party's congressional committees aren't party to the deal. "If the goal was to support those campaigns, surely the national organizations most responsible would be participants. Traditionally the DNC and RNC are taken over by their presidential nominees during the election year, and the first priority for every spending decision is how it relates to the presidential race," he said. "If that campaign were to become significantly less competitive, then the national party might well move to other races, but it would happen in that sequence and in those conditions." One final important note: Spokesmen for both the Clinton campaign and the DNC said many millions raised for the state parties have not been distributed yet, but will be soon. Our ruling Clooney said, "The overwhelming amount of the money that we're raising, is not going to Hillary to run for president. ... It's going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress." Clooney is correct that most of the big-dollar donations in question are not going to Clinton’s campaign for president. By law, they can’t. Whether the money is "going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress" is a much different story. Most of the money appears to be winding up at the DNC, not state parties, as individual donors may have expected. The national party says that money is being used on campaign infrastructure that will benefit House and Senate candidates. But it will benefit Clinton, too. Clooney’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-09140	Bill McCollum has "recovered $200 million in Medicaid fraud."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/14/jeb-bush/bill-mccollum-claims-he-recovered-nearly-200-milli/	Attorney General Bill McCollum, who is running as a Republican gubernatorial candidate, recently launched his first statewide TV campaign ad with a helping hand from former Gov. Jeb Bush. During the 30-second commercial, Bush speaks about McCollum's accomplishments: "Tough times require proven leadership. "Bill McCollum is a principled conservative with a record of doing what is right for Florida. "Bill’s recovered nearly $200 million in Medicaid fraud. "He’s leading the charge to stop President Obama’s health care takeover. "And, he has a plan to create 500,000 new jobs, reform government and cut wasteful spending. "Support my friend Bill McCollum, the kind of solid leader Florida needs." We decided to focus on this claim: "Bill's recovered nearly $200 million in Medicaid fraud." Increasingly Medicaid accounts for a huge chunk of the state budget, with Florida spending roughly $19 billion for the program that serves 2.7 million people, or 14 percent of Florida's population. And fraud is a big problem. Annually, some $3.2 billion in Medicaid fraud is bilked from the state and federal governments. To check whether McCollum has made a dent in curbing that fraud, we asked McCollum campaign spokesman Kristy Campbell for documentation. She gave us a March 9 press release from the Attorney General's office. "I am proud of the record-breaking recoveries my Medicaid Fraud Control Unit has made over the last three years, including $198 million last year," McCollum says in the release. Next, the Attorney General's office provided us with a list of recoveries from the Medicaid Control Unit for 2009. The list of 153 cases includes settlements that reach into the millions, like $32 million to be paid by pharmeceutical giant Eli Lilly, and smaller sums like $50,000 to be paid by Hialeah physician Ausberto B. Hidalgo. Adding up the itemized list, the sum is actually $203 million. So Bush is almost on the money. We should note that the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit has been around since way before McCollum became attorney general. The unit started under the auditor general's office, but in July 1994 it was moved under the Attorney General's Office as a way to police the state's burgeoning Medicaid program. And McCollum has come under attack from state officials in both the Republican and Democratic parties for not doing enough. As for Bush's claim that McCollum "recovered nearly $200 million in Medicaid Fraud," we rate it True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2010-06-14T10:26:09	2010-05-20	['None']

pomt-07334	During his time as House speaker, "unemployment came down from 5.6 percent to under 4 (percent)."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/11/newt-gingrich/gingrich-unemployment-rate-claim-target/	Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich did the, well, expected Wednesday, May 11, 2011, and announced his candidacy for president. The former Georgia congressman made it official in a campaign video on his website, as he had signaled earlier in the week. Gingrich promoted his credentials by touting a list of accomplishments in his four years as House Speaker, which began in January 1995 and ended in January 1999. Those accomplishments included cutting unemployment, which was at 9 percent in April 2011 and one of the nation’s biggest problems. "Unemployment came down from 5.6 percent to under 4," Gingrich, a Republican who now lives in Virginia, said in the video. Considering that Republican candidates will likely attack President Barack Obama over the unemployment rate as the presidential race heats up, Gingrich’s claim may sound like he has the solution to the problem or at the very least be able to argue he can do better than the Democratic president has done. In that vein, we wanted to check Gingrich’s numbers. In January 1995, the month Gingrich took the gavel as speaker, the nation’s unemployment rate was indeed 5.6 percent. The unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent by December 1998, the month Gingrich announced he was going to resign as speaker. The rate dropped one-tenth of a percentage point by January 1999, when Gingrich resigned. Each tenth of percentage point at that time equaled about 50,000 unemployed Americans. The unemployment rate didn’t fall below 4 percent until September 2000, which was 21 months later. The lowest the unemployment rate fell during Gingrich’s time as speaker was in April 1998, when it was 4.3 percent. An e-mail to a Gingrich spokesman late Wednesday was not immediately returned. Gingrich was correct about the unemployment rate when he became House Speaker and correct that it did go down, but he was wrong in saying it went down to 4 percent during his term as speaker. The lowest rate it hit during his tenure as speaker was 4.3 percent. He could have easily looked it up and gotten it right. We rate his claim as False.

Rick Scott's elections chief is defending changes to election law that shrink the number of days for early voting by arguing that polling places will be open the same number of hours they are now. Yes, fewer days, Secretary of State Kurt Browning wrote in a May 23, 2011, guest column in the St. Petersburg Times. But longer hours on those days. HB 1355, which Scott signed into law May 19, cuts the number of days of early voting from 14 to 8, makes it harder for third-party voter registration groups to register prospective voters and requires voters who change their address from one county to another on the day of an election to cast a provisional ballot, which would then be reviewed by the county canvassing board. Browning and Republicans who supported the law say the changes will better protect the state's voting system against fraud. Democrats say the changes are an attempt to suppress voter turnout. "To combat voter fraud, reduce the burden on poll workers and provide needed flexibility to local election supervisors, the number of days polls remain open has been reduced from 14 possible days to eight days, even as the total number of hours available for early voting will remain the same," Browning wrote in a column titled "Florida's early voting remains at 96 hours." "The result is that working voters will be able to vote before or after work, something they haven't been able to do in the past," he wrote. "That added flexibility will enable more people than ever to take advantage of early voting. And, if an election supervisor finds it's not absolutely necessary to keep all of his or her polling places open a full 12 hours a day, which isn't unusual for rural areas, he or she has the flexibility to save taxpayer money by not employing poll workers that aren't needed. "Critics of the new election law suggest there will be less time to vote. That is just not the case. Now, more than ever, voters have more options to choose from in order to take advantage of early voting." In closing Browning wrote: "Today, the following remains true: Early voting remains at 96 hours, with greater flexibility for counties ... " We wanted to see if Browning is right. Before HB 1355 became law, statutes required that early voting begin 15 days before and end two days prior to an election, or 14 days overall. Further, statutes required that supervisors provide eight hours of early voting during weekdays sometime between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., and a total of eight hours during each of two weekends. Over the 14 days prior to a Tuesday election -- two weekends and 10 weekdays -- that means that supervisors had been required to conduct early voting for a minimum of 96 hours. The law that Scott signed changes several provisions of the early voting requirements. The new version requires that early voting begin 10 days before and end three days prior to an election, or 8 days overall. The new statute says early voting must be available for six hours each of the eight days, and no more than 12 hours per day at each polling site. We'll repeat that -- under the new law, early voting must be available six hours a day for eight days, or a total of 48 hours, and can be available for up to 12 hours a day for eight days, or 96 hours. In other words, local supervisors of elections will have the ability to cut the number of hours of early voting in half. They will, however, have to increase the number of hours of early voting on weekends from 16 to 18 hours. What will local supervisors choose to do? For many, it's too early to say. In Pinellas County, Republican Supervisor of Elections Deborah Clark said the longer early voting days would be more convenient for people who want to vote before or after work. But Clark also has been critical of early voting, saying in 2008 that early voting "does not increase voter turnout," just "election costs." Clark spokeswoman Nancy Whitlock said the Pinellas supervisor is not against extending early voting hours as allowed by the new law, but has yet to adopt an early voting schedule for the 2012 elections. But in Jacksonville and Duval County in northeast Florida, Republican supervisor Jerry Holland told voters not to expect 12-hour-a-day early voting, according to the Florida Times-Union. "The 12 hours is just not practical for us," Holland said. Another point about Browning's column. He wrote that a result of the new law is "that working voters will be able to vote before or after work, something they haven't been able to do in the past." But that already was happening, at least in Miami-Dade County. There, during the 2008 election, the supervisor staggered the eight-hour window of early voting between the first and second weeks. In the first week, early voting sites opened at 7 a.m. (the earliest they could open allowed by law). In the second week, early voting sites opened later so they wouldn't close until 7 p.m. (the latest they could stay open). Gov. Charlie Crist ultimately issued an executive order in 2008 requiring that all early voting sites stay open for 12 hours on weekdays. Browning spokesman Chris Cate said Browning will work to ensure that nearly all medium and large counties in Florida use all 96 hours of early voting available to them. "Every county that anticipates a high voter turnout during early voting, which applies to nearly every medium-to-large county in the state, will use all 96 hours of early voting made available. Voters can be confident of this fact," Cate e-mailed PolitiFact Florida. "Secretary Browning can also confidently say this because he will work with the appropriate supervisors of elections to make sure of it. "The only locations where early voting sites could possibly be open for less than 12 hours a day would be in rural counties, where voters don’t need all 12 hours a day to vote," Cate continued. "It would be a waste of local taxpayer dollars to force supervisors of elections to keep early voting locations open where nobody is trying to vote." In a follow-up e-mail, Cate was more blunt, saying that he doubts "the writers of the new law considered that a supervisor of elections for a large county (like Duval) might have such a lack of foresight that they wouldn’t open their early voting sites for the full 12 hours." Cate noted that supervisors are required to inform Browning's office of their plans 30 days ahead of time, giving Browning an opportunity to convince them to alter their schedule if necessary. The new law also allows Browning to provide "written direction and opinions to the supervisors of elections on the performance of their official duties." That flexibility in the law may save some smaller jurisdictions taxpayer dollars, but it's also the root of the problem when considering Browning's claim. While he noted in a May 23 op-ed piece that rural counties may schedule less than the current 96 hours of voting, he failed to note that the same option is available to every county in Florida regardless of size. In fact, local supervisors could cut the total number of hours of early voting from 96 to 48 if they chose because it's what the new law allows. However, they have the ability to keep 96 hours of early voting by increasing voting to 12 hours a day. So a requirement of 96 hours of early voting has been replaced by an option of 96 hours. We rate this claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11290	"Archbishop Desmond Tutu dies while holidaying in Texas"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/23/blog-posting/website-falsely-claims-desmond-tutu-died-texas/	False information is circulating on social media inaccurately claiming Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu died in Texas. "Anti-apartheid and human rights activist Archbishop Desmond Tutu has died in Texas at the age of 86," claimed an undated post on nytimes-news.com. Tutu’s office debunked the claims in an April 22 statement. "There is a false story doing the rounds today suggesting that Archbishop Emeritus Tutu has passed away in the United States," said a statement posted on the Facebook page for The Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation. "The Archbishop and Mrs. Leah Tutu are in fact in good health and spirits at home in the Western Cape," the statement said. The website nytimes-news.com (note: not the online home of The New York Times) claimed Tutu’s wife "told reporters that the couple were in Texas for holiday and had plans of greeting George H.W Bush who lost his wife few days ago." The undated false claim was flagged on Facebook as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The post seemingly gained traction due to national and international media coverage of former first lady Barbara Bush’s funeral on April 21. It’s not the first time fake news sites have claimed Tutu died. Another hoax about his death spread in September 2016 after a hospitalization. The former Anglican archbishop of Cape Town was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his opposition to apartheid policies. Nytimes-news.com does not feature any description of who runs the site. The website’s banner only says "New York," and its address is designed to give readers the wrong impression that it’s the actual New York Times. (The real Times can be found at www.nytimes.com.)

pomt-05405	Says she is "saving ratepayers $6 million/year."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/may/04/amanda-fritz/amanda-fritz-saving-water-ratepayers-6-million-eve/	Portland city Commissioner Amanda Fritz is running for re-election as a penny-pincher who has saved residents and ratepayers millions of dollars. Specifically, Fritz says in her first television commercial via a voice-over that "she saved ratepayers $6 million a year in reduced water rate tax hikes." That she is "saving ratepayers $6 million a year" is included in the Voters’ Pamphlet as well and on her campaign website, where she writes: "That vote decreased the rate increase in 2010 by over 6 percent, saving ratepayers $6 million in 2010-11 and each year thereafter." In The Oregonian’s Voter Guide, she writes she "saved ratepayers $6 million per year starting 2009." PolitiFact Oregon knows from a previous fact check that Fritz saved ratepayers $6 million in 2010-11. (It is inaccurate of Fritz to claim the savings started in 2009, but we’ll let that go. We have bigger fish to fry.) The question we have is whether it’s accurate to claim the savings into the future, which is what Fritz says. We’ll explain. Once upon a time, in the not so distant past, the black-hearted U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered the fair City of Portland (and other municipalities) to protect drinking water from terrorists and cryptosporidium. Portland officials objected, claiming the city had the best drinking water in the world. But their pleas fell on indifferent ears in Washington, D.C., and City Hall decided in 2009 to build a treatment plant to guard against cryptosporidium, an evil parasite that can make people very sick. In all seriousness, with the feds breathing down their necks, Water Bureau officials recommended the council approve a $385 million direct filtration system. Commissioner Amanda Fritz, however, argued for a cheaper $100 million system that would zap cryptosporidium with ultraviolet rays. We ruled Mostly True her 2011 statement that she persuaded City Council to save water ratepayers $500 million, because she did change the minds of commissioners ready to approve the more expensive system. (We knocked the ruling down from True because of details on construction costs) That’s all fine and good. Except that in March of this year, the state, with authority from the feds, told the city it would not have to build a treatment system at all. Despite the fact that we no longer have to build a plant, Fritz argues she can claim a $6 million savings every year into the future because she was responsible for lowering the baseline to start. "The savings are carried over year after year," she wrote in an email, "because the six percent wasn't added to the rate." We turned to David Hasson, the water bureau’s finance director. He said at most, she could have claimed the savings for at least a generation, had we built the UV treatment system. "Of course it is all hypothetical, because we didn't build either one," he said. And that’s the point. We’re not building a system. And Fritz had nothing to do with that decision. We give her credit for steering us to a less expensive option in 2009 and saving us money from 2010 through June 2012. But it stops there. Fritz cannot continue to claim credit for saving ratepayers money on something that they’re not buying. The statement is inaccurate. We rate the claim False.

pomt-14934	Bernie Sanders’s plan is "to raise your taxes to 90 percent."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/28/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-bernie-sanderss-plan-raise-you/	New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie drew chuckles at the Republican presidential debate in Boulder, Colo., when he described the Democratic field as consisting of "a socialist, an isolationist and a pessimist -- and for the sake of me, I can’t figure out which one is which." He went on to single out Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, one of those three Democratic candidates and a self-described democratic socialist. "The socialist says they’re going to pay for everything and give you everything for free, except they don’t tell you they’re going to raise your taxes to 90 percent to do it," Christie said. That echoed a claim made by Donald Trump at a rally in Richmond, Va., on Oct. 14, 2015. At that rally, Trump called Sanders a "communist" and said that tax hikes would come for everyone, not just billionaires. "This maniac that was standing on (Hillary Clinton’s) right is giving everything away, so she’s following," Trump said at the Richmond rally, referring to the Democratic debate the previous night. "He’s gonna tax you people at 90 percent. He’s gonna take everything. And nobody's heard the term communist, but you know what? I’d call him a socialist/communist, okay? ‘Cause that's what he is." There’s no doubt that Sanders wants to raise taxes on the richest 1 percent: "Yes, we are going to ask Trump and his billionaire friends to pay more in taxes. ...We'll come up with that rate. But it will be a damned lot higher than it is right now," Sanders said in an Oct. 18 interview with ABC’s This Week. But does Sanders want to tax the average Americans at 90 percent as well? Here, we’ll recap the problems we found with Trump’s claim and address why Christie’s claim was equally problematic. What Sanders has said Sanders hasn’t released a tax plan yet -- the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has a summary of the candidates’ tax plans here -- and we searched Lexis Nexis and CQ and found that Sanders has never explicitly proposed a 90 percent tax rate for billionaires, let alone applying that rate across the board. The confusion may stem from comments Sanders made in May 2015 about the marginal tax rate for the very wealthy. In an interview with CNBC, Sanders he doesn’t think a top marginal tax rate of 90 percent is too high. Before we parse his comment, let’s review what the marginal tax rate means. It’s the tax rate that’s applied to the last dollar you earn. The U.S. tax system is based on tax brackets. Let’s say you were a single filer who earned $410,000 in adjusted gross income last year. The first $9,075 you earned was taxed at 10 percent, the amount from $9,076 to $36,900 was taxed at 15 percent, the amount from $36,901 to $89,350 was taxed at 25 percent, the amount from $89,351 to $186,350 was taxed at 28 percent, the amount from $186,351 to $405,100 was taxed at 33 percent, the amount from $405,101 to $406,750 was taxed at 35 percent, and the amount above $406,751 was taxed at 39.6 percent. (The dollar levels are different for other types of filers, such as couples filing jointly.) In other words, the current top marginal tax rate is 39.6 percent, affecting individuals who make more than $400,000 a year. That’s roughly the threshold to make it into the top 1 percent of incomes if you’re filing as an individual. And even for this sample filer making $410,000, that 39.6 percent tax rate hits only a relatively small amount of their income. The average American never sees marginal federal income tax rates that high. "If my memory is correct, when radical socialist Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, the highest marginal tax rate was something like 90 percent," Sanders said on May 26. (His memory is correct.) "That's not 90 percent of your income, you know? That's the marginal." Many on the right and left interpreted Sanders’ comments as advocating for increasing the top rate to 90 percent. The Sanders camp, however, told us the Vermont senator has made it very clear that that’s not what he was saying. And beyond what his camp told us, a review of his past comments — one from 2008, and four more from this year — Sanders doesn’t seem like he’s committed to any figure: • Nov. 5, 2008 on Fox News’ Your World with Neil Cavuto: Sanders said of the top tax rate, "No, of course, it is not going to be 90 percent." Pressed by Cavuto for a figure, Sanders said, "Neil, I’m not going to develop tax policy in a three-minute segment on your show." • June 2, 2015 on Yahoo! News: In response to host Katie Couric’s suggestion that he proposed taxing the wealthiest Americans at 90 percent, Sanders interjected, "No, I didn’t. It’s not true. That’s one of these things that seems to be circulating. We haven’t come up with a formal tax proposal. ...Will we raise the individual tax rate for the wealthy? Absolutely, but we haven’t come up with a number yet." • June 11, 2015 on Charlie Rose: "We are working right now on a comprehensive tax package which I suspect will for the top marginal rates go over 50 percent." • Sept. 18, 2015 on CBS This Morning: "No, I don’t think you have to go up to 90 percent. …I don’t know if you have to go there but we will come up with some very specific ideas." • Sept. 23, 2015 on CNN New Day: "If you are extremely wealthy, yes, you are going to pay more in taxes. If you are a large corporation today, by the way, that's stashing your money in the Cayman Islands and not paying a nickel in federal taxes, yes, you are going to be paying taxes." In short, the most specific figure we found from Sanders on the top marginal tax rate is not terribly specific — "over 50 percent" — and it would only affect a tiny fraction of Americans. Nothing is certain but taxing corporations And that’s the point that’s even more problematic with this claim -- who Sanders’ supposed 90 percent tax would affect. Both Trump and now Christie have indicated that essentially everyone will be hit by a 90 percent tax hike. With Trump, this rate would supposedly be levied on "you people" in the audience at his rally. Christie, for his part, said Sanders would "raise your taxes to 90 percent." But whatever big hike a President Sanders would seek to implement -- and based on his comments it would be something south of 90 percent -- would be targeted mostly at the wealthiest Americans, including hikes to the tax on the largest estates and on trading transactions and an elimination of tax deferrals for U.S. corporations located abroad. The one exception is his call for paid family and medical leave, based on legislation introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., that would require "just a small increase in the payroll tax" that would hit everyone, Sanders said on This Week. How small? Employers and employees would chip in an additional 0.2 percent each, bringing the federal payroll tax from 12.4 percent to 12.8 percent. According to a report by Gillibrand’s office, that’s the equivalent of $72.04 per year for the average worker, and $227.40 for the highest wage earners. Beyond this, there’s some doubt that Sanders could achieve his policy proposals without additional tax increases. Indeed, one tax expert cautioned against speculating because Sanders has been so vague about his proposals. "There is not enough substance to (Sanders’) proposals for anyone to have analyzed them," Roberton Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said when we checked Trump’s original claim. "Organizations typically wait until there is a fully formulated plan before they try to model them. Sanders is not anywhere near that point yet." Our ruling Christie said that Sanders’s plan is "to raise your taxes to 90 percent." Sanders hasn’t released an official tax plan, either for billionaires or for anyone else. But based on his previous comments and proposals, the tax policies Sanders is advocating are targeted at corporations and affluent Americans. Sanders has dismissed the notion that he wants to set marginal tax rates for billionaires at 90 percent. And on the whole, his tax proposals so far do not envision raising "your taxes" -- that is, those of ordinary Americans -- to anything approaching 90 percent. This is a grossly misleading characterization of the extent and scope of Sanders' plan, so we rate Christie’s claim Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/94917f97-e53e-4d00-8f83-c9f2de668891	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2015-10-28T21:28:36	2015-10-28	['None']

pomt-14688	"For the first time ever, we completely funded the critical needs waiting list so persons with unique abilities can get the help they need."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/jan/13/rick-scott/rick-scott-florida-completely-funded-critical-need/	Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican seeking $1 billion in tax cuts this year, portrayed state spending on services for disabled Floridians as solid during his 2016 State of the State address. "With your help, we have invested Florida taxpayer dollars to make a lasting difference in the lives of Florida families," he said during the Jan. 12 speech. "For the first time ever, we completely funded the critical needs waiting list for persons with unique abilities so they can get the help they need." Scott is technically right about a specific waiting list for people with disabilities, but he omits important context. Namely, the critical needs waiting list is one component within a bigger waiting list for services. Wait-list rundown People with disabilities can apply through the state to get financial assistance through a Home and Community-Based Services Medicaid waiver, a joint state-federal program. The program serves people with intellectual disabilities, autism, cerebral palsy or other disabilities. The goal is to provide them care in their homes or community instead of sending them to more costly institutions. About 32,000 Floridians have this waiver now, but about 20,000 remain on a waiting list, according to a spokeswoman for the Agency for Persons with Disabilities. The state hasn’t provided enough money to fully empty out the waiting list for home- and community-based care. Florida’s waiting list is the second-highest in the nation behind Texas as of 2014, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. That’s not surprising considering Florida’s large population, but some states do a better job at clearing off the waiting list than others. It’s important to note that Florida’s "critical needs" waiting list is a classification devised during Scott’s administration. So when he says he completely funded this waiting list "for the first time ever," he is referring to something that has only existed for a few years. In 2013, the state Agency for Persons with Disabilities had a work group that met to discuss how to reduce the waiting list. "We decided to take those with the most critical needs first," said agency spokeswoman Melanie Etters. That’s when the agency came up with the idea for a specific "critical needs" waiting list. The state assesses those on the waiting list and places them into different categories based on criteria set out in state law in July 2010, a few months before Scott took office. People who end up on this critical needs list face difficult circumstances, such as being a child in the welfare system or a person at risk of losing a caregiver. The state received money to whittle the critical needs list starting in 2013 when it gave waivers to 1,600 Floridians. However, some still remained on the list that year. The next year, 2014, the state emptied out the list for the first time when it gave waivers to 1,200 people. Again in 2015, the agency received enough money to offer a waiver to everyone on the critical needs list, around 2,500 at that time. Although the state has brought the list down to zero twice, it then starts to regrow again pretty much instantly as new babies are born or people with disabilities move to the state, sign up for the first time or move into categories deemed critical. Scott’s budget request for the next year calls for enrolling more than 700 individuals from the critical needs list, which is projected to empty the list. We won’t know the outcome of his budget request until the Legislature concludes the session in March. Advocates for people with disabilities said Scott has a point about working to reduce this specific waiting list, but he left out part of the story by not acknowledging the larger, non-"critical needs" list for services. "The governor is correct that he has funded the critical needs waiting list, but that’s not to be confused with the overall waiting list," said Suzanne Sewell, president of the Florida Association of Rehabilitation Facilities. Other advocates we interviewed backed up her argument. The last time the waiting list was fully funded was when Jeb Bush was governor, and that was as a result of a lawsuit, said Clint Bower, president of MACTown, or the Miami Achievement Center for the Developmentally Disabled. The advocates noted that while some people on the waiting list are not receiving services, others are getting services through other programs, such as at school. And some sign up on the waiting list although they don’t need services now but anticipate they will in the future. They had little hope for the wait list being completely cleared. It would be difficult to do because every year new babies are born with developmental disabilities, and they end up on the waiting list. "There will always be more people coming on," Sewell said. Our ruling Scott said, "For the first time ever, we completely funded the critical needs waiting list" for people with disabilities. Advocates said Scott has a point about working to help around 5,000 disabled Floridians get off a narrow waiting list, but he left out two pieces of important context. First, the critical needs waiting list is a category that Scott’s administration came up with about three years ago, so it’s not as if he had any historical competition. The state offered services to everyone on the critical needs list in 2014 and 2015, and Scott wants to do it again this year. However, Scott omits that those on the critical needs list are a subset of the overall waiting list of about 20,000 people. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-10501	"Iraq is costing each household about $100 a month."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/01/barack-obama/yes-families-pay-more-for-iraq-war-than-cable/	The cost of the Iraq war has often been expressed in billions or trillions, numbers so big and abstract they remind us of Carl Sagan's description of the universe ("billions and billions of stars…"). The candidates have cited alternative uses for the war money, saying it would have been better spent on health coverage for the uninsured (Sen. Hillary Clinton) or on more school teachers (Sen. Barack Obama). In a speech on March 20, 2008, Obama took a different approach and emphasized the personal cost of the war. "When Iraq is costing each household about $100 a month, you're paying a price for this war," he said in the speech in Charleston, W.Va. At $100 per month, the war cost to each U.S. household would be more than cable TV (average bill: $58), but less than a car payment (average bill: $400-500). We asked the Obama campaign about the source of the $100 figure and were told it came from The Three Trillion Dollar War, a new book by Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, and Linda J. Bilmes, a former Commerce Department official from the Clinton administration who is now a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. The book says the monthly operating cost of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is about $16-billion. "To think of it another way," the book says, "roughly every American household is spending $138 per month on the current operating costs of the wars, with a little more than $100 per month going to Iraq alone." (Of course, Obama's simplified analysis does not reflect the variations in income tax levels. And you don't have to write a check for the war each month. The war costs are included in government spending that is paid for by taxes.) There was no footnote for the $100 estimate, so we called Bilmes to ask how she had calculated it. She said they took the Bush administration's 2008 request for war funding – $196-billion – and divided it by 12 to get a monthly cost. That works out to $16-billlion for both wars and about $12-billion just for the Iraq portion. Then, she and Stiglitz divided those figures by the number of U.S. households and came up with $138 for both wars and slightly more than $100 for Iraq alone, she said. We double-checked the authors' sources and math, and found they were right. Indeed, the Bush administration request for 2008 was $196-billion for both wars, with $159-billion going to Iraq, according to a summary by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. A recent Census Bureau report said there were 116-million households. So that works out to about $140 per month for both wars and about $114 for Iraq alone. (Our numbers are slightly higher than Bilmes and Stiglitz because we used the latest estimates from CRS and a newer and slighter higher count for households.) To verify the Bilmes and Stiglitz calculation, we checked with Steven Kosiak, vice president for budget studies with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on defense issues. He said their methodology was correct and that the number "sounds about right." Bilmes, a Democrat who is neutral in the presidental race, said Obama could have used an even higher figure if he had included other war costs that aren't in the Pentagon's $196-billion tab. These include disability payments, the cost of replacing war-fighting equipment and interest on the borrowed money. By using the figure he did, Obama "really was being conservative on this," Bilmes said. "He's not overstating it in any way." And so we find Obama is right about the war's monthly cost.

pomt-13250	"When asked about equal pay for women, (Rubio’s) quote was that it was a waste of time."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/oct/18/patrick-murphy/rubio-called-equal-pay-women-waste-time-murphy-say/	During their first debate, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy attacked incumbent U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s positions on women’s issues, saying Rubio didn’t think the battle for equal pay was worth fighting. "When asked about equal pay for women, your quote was that it was a waste of time," Murphy said Oct. 17 at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. We checked the record to see if Rubio called the issue a "waste of time." While he used the expression, it was because he opposed specific parts of equal pay legislation, not the overall concept. The Paycheck Fairness Act Murphy’s accusation centers on Rubio’s take on the 2014 version of the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill filed in the U.S. Senate by Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. Democrats had touted the measure as a way to increase gender parity in compensation, but Republicans opposed tthe bill. Rubio was one of the Republicans who planned to vote against it. In April 2014, after the bill was introduced, Rubio told CNN’s Jake Tapper that he felt it was addressing equal pay in the wrong manner. Rubio said that he was against provisions to make it easier to sue for discrimination, and that it would be better to focus on training to help women gain job skills (emphasis ours): "The proposals before the Senate now are really geared toward making it easier to sue an employer," Rubio told Tapper on April 8, 2014. "I understand the political benefit of highlighting that and why they're (Democrats) doing it, but it isn't going to solve the core of the problem. And I just think we're wasting time. Meanwhile, an entire generation of young women is caught in low-paying jobs with no way to emerge from that into a better-paying job." Tapper pointed out that female staffers in Rubio’s office made less than the men. Rubio admitted there was "a disproportionate number of women in our office who are working at the legislative assistant level," which accounted for the gap. "In terms of apples to apples, where you have two people working the same job, we pay people based on their skill and their ability and not their race, their gender, or anything of that matter," Rubio said. The next day, the Paycheck Fairness Act lost a cloture vote, when Rubio and other Republicans voted against it, and the bill failed to advance. He voted against the measure two more times that year before it was reintroduced in the following Congress. Rubio had made similar comments in 2012 about an earlier version of the bill, which he had voted against. "Once again, Senate Democrats have wasted the American people’s time by holding yet another show vote that proves any sense of urgency they have is about scoring political points instead of solving the problems that threaten America’s future," he said in a statement. He also attacked the 2012 version for including measures that he said would lead to lawsuits. He said the bill read to him like "a welfare plan for trial lawyers." Rubio touted another bill called the RAISE Act, but that bill focused on merit-based pay raises in union shops, not specifically gender equity. The context here is important, because it’s not that Rubio said he thought the concept of addressing the pay gap was a waste of time. He said he disagreed with Democrats trying to advance what he considered ineffective legislation. During the debate, Rubio said he supported equal pay for women, especially because he has two young daughters who will be entering the workforce. But he chastised Murphy’s talking point, alleging that under the Paycheck Fairness Act, a business trying to keep a woman from being lured away by another company wouldn’t be able to give her a raise to keep her without also giving her male counterpart a raise. "It has unintended consequences that would not have achieved parity in pay, but would have had these consequences making it very difficult for businesses to actually give raises to men and to women," Rubio said. It’s not our job to debate the merits of one policy approach over another. It’s clear Murphy wants to make it appear as if Rubio said the very issue is a waste of time, when Rubio actually was deriding a specific Democratic approach. Our ruling Murphy said, "When asked about equal pay for women, (Rubio’s) quote was that it was a waste of time." Rubio did use the expression to describe Democratic efforts to advance the Paycheck Fairness Act. Rubio thought the bill focused too much on allowing workers to sue employers for discrimination, and not enough time focusing on job training and other solutions. That’s not the same as dismissing efforts to close the gender pay gap out of hand. Murphy misrepresented the context of Rubio’s response. We rate Murphy’s statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/94b2ce38-f51a-4520-850d-1879affad57d	None	Patrick Murphy	None	None	None	2016-10-18T15:41:13	2016-10-17	['None']
pomt-01920	Republican candidate for governor Ken Block was "fined and had to admit that (he) funneled money illegally to the Moderate Party."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jun/29/allan-fung/allan-fung-gop-challenger-ken-block-was-fined-ille/	During the June 17 Providence Journal - WPRI-TV debate between the Republican candidates for governor, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung said his GOP rival, businessman Ken Block, was caught illegally funneling money to the Moderate Party that Block founded. That was before Block changed his affiliation to become a Republican. The comment came after Block criticized Fung for accepting campaign money from the city's police union. (The department was ultimately caught up in a parking ticket scandal, a controversy Fung has been accused of mismanaging.) Fung, in response, said he was not going to be lectured on ethics by someone who "has been fined by the state Board of Elections for funneling money into his Moderate Party." Fung repeated the allegation two minutes later, telling Block, "The fact that you were fined and had to admit that you funneled money illegally to the Moderate Party speaks for itself." To evaluate Fung’s claim, we first turned to The Journal’s December 2009 story. We also examined emails and the original consent decree signed by Block. Block founded the Moderate Party in 2007 and was its chairman in 2009. He successfully sued the Board of Elections in federal court over its rules that hampered establishment of new political parties. He would subsequently be the Moderate Party's candidate for governor in the 2010 election. On Monday, Sept. 21, 2009, he made a $10,000 party-building donation to the state Moderate Party. Most political donations are capped at $1,000 each year per person but that cap increases to $10,000 if the money is designed for "party building" to cover expenses related to staffing, rent and utilities, but not to winning a specific election. That same day, Block sent an email to Richard E. Thornton, director of campaign finance at the Rhode Island Board of Elections, asking if, "Using the most extreme example, an individual donor can make a $10,000 'party building' donation to every State Committee and every Town Committee of every political party in the State every year." The goal was to establish Moderate Party town committees in all 39 cities and towns. Thornton initially wrote back to say that would be allowed. But 74 minutes later, Thornton sent a followup message saying, "I need to do some additional research . . . before I can confirm that your assessment is accurate." "OK, Rick. Please let me know when you have more clarification on this issue," Block responded. Thornton then said the board would need to issue a full advisory opinion on the matter. Block, already at odds with the board over the federal lawsuit, didn't want to wait. He subsequently informed Thornton that he had made a second $10,000 donation, this time to the Barrington Moderate Party Town Committee. But two days later, the Barrington group transferred the money to the state Moderate Party. Ultimately, the board concluded that Block had violated campaign finance law in two ways: first, by making the second donation and second, because the Barrington committee had shuttled the money to the state committee. The two sides eventually settled for a $2,000 fine, to be paid personally by Block, who also signed an admission of wrongdoing. "I do believe that given the time and energy, we could have proven that we were right. But the election would have come and gone by then," Block said at the time. "It just made much more sense to put it behind us." Today, Block argues that when he sought advice, "They never actually said, 'No. Don't do this. You can't do it.'" "We were completely in the open about doing this," Block said. "Their overreaction to what we had done is a classic Rhode Island political payback story." Fung, during the debate, didn't go into details. He simply said that Block was "fined and had to admit that [he] funneled money illegally to the Moderate Party." We rate the claim as True.

pomt-01410	Says Scott Brown co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for mammograms.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/oct/10/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-scott-brown-backed-bill-let-em/	The U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire has been awash in claims about abortion and women’s health issues in recent days. One claim by incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen caught our eye. Shaheen is facing a challenge from former Republican Sen. Scott Brown. In a news release from her campaign, Shaheen said: "I have always supported a woman’s right to choose because I know women should be making health care decisions in consultation with their doctors and their families, not their employer. Scott Brown’s record is clear: When it counts, he doesn’t stand up for women’s reproductive rights and economic security. He co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control or even mammograms. New Hampshire women can’t trust Scott Brown, and his record is move evidence that he is wrong for New Hampshire." We noticed two claims that are related, but distinct enough to analyze separately. First, would the legislation in question have allowed employers deny women coverage for birth control? And would it have allowed employers to deny coverage for mammograms? We’ve heard of controversies over birth control, but not mammograms. So we decided to check it out. (We’ve addressed birth control in a separate fact-check.) Mammograms are used to screen for breast cancer, either preventively in women who have no signs of the disease, or as a diagnostic aid after a lump or other symptom is reported, according to the National Cancer Institute. In a different Shaheen campaign news release, the campaign explained its sourcing by writing, "FACT: Scott Brown both co-sponsored and voted for the Blunt Amendment that would let employers deny women access to a range of healthcare services, including contraception and coverage for mammograms." The amendment in question was proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. It was tabled -- that is, dispensed with -- by a 51-48 vote in which a simple majority was required. Among those who voted "nay" -- that is, those who wanted to keep it under consideration -- was Brown, then representing Massachusetts in the Senate. He also co-sponsored a predecessor measure, S.1467, the Respect for Rights of Conscience Act of 2011. So Shaheen’s camp is correct that Brown acted in support of this measure. But what did the amendment say? It acted to widen the scope of acceptable actions for opting out of provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on religious or moral grounds. It focuses on mandates within the law for preventive services, called the "essential health benefits package." The Shaheen campaign pointed us to a Feb. 29, 2014, news release opposing the Blunt Amendment by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. The release said, "the expansive nature of the proposed Blunt amendment ... could result in coverage denials of life-saving preventive services such as mammograms or tobacco cessation based on employer discretion." But we aren’t accepting the claim of an advocacy group without digging further. So we read the relevant portions of the law ourselves. We agree that the provision is drawn broadly. It’s not targeted at abortion or birth control -- it simply says that employers cannot be required to cover "specific items or services" that are "contrary to the religious beliefs or moral convictions of the sponsor, issuer, or other entity offering the plan." So, presumably, any aspect of preventive care could qualify for a religious-conscience opt-out -- including mammograms. Or, for that matter, stethoscopes or tongue depressors. We can’t imagine any religious objections to the use of tongue depressors. But what about mammograms? We asked a number of experts in medicine and bioethics whether they had ever heard religious objections raised regarding mammograms. None said they had. "I have not heard this claim in the specific context you describe," said Paul A. Lombardo, a specialist in medical law and ethics at Georgia State University. Adam Sonfield, a senior public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute, noted that Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dissent in Hobby Lobby noted past religious objections to blood transfusions (by Jehovah’s Witnesses); antidepressants (by Scientologists); medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin (by certain Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations (by Christian Scientists). However, Sonfield couldn’t recall hearing objections to mammograms. Opposition to mammograms would also be news to a leading anti-abortion group, the National Right to Life Committee. "I've never heard of any argument being made against mammograms based on a conscience objection," said Susan T. Muskett, the group’s senior legislative counsel. Arthur Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center, said the closest he can get "to making any sense of" the claim involves what in the game of pool would be known as a multiple bank shot. Here goes: Planned Parenthood has become a target of anti-abortion activists because it performs abortions, but the group’s clinics also provide other forms of health care to women. These include breast examinations, but not mammograms per se. If the clinic determines that a patient needs a mammogram, they will be referred to a health care provider that offers one. Some abortion opponents might "see this as a ruse," Caplan said. "So there might be a doctor or a nurse who would refuse a mammogram referral from Planned Parenthood on the grounds that that they are just funding abortions." But this is all speculative, Caplan added. "No doc I know of has any issue with mammograms," he said. Holly Fernandez Lynch, a Harvard bioethicist and author of Conflicts of Conscience in Health Care: An Institutional Compromise, called the claim "technically true" but "a bit of a strawman." Could it have been used to deny access to mammograms? "Yes," she said. "Would it have been? Almost certainly not. I have never heard of a religious or moral objection to mammograms. The better examples would have been contraceptives, abortion, vaccines (especially HPV), psychiatric care, or palliative care/hospices." Our ruling Shaheen said Brown co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for mammograms. The amendment, which Brown supported, was written loosely enough to allow a religious-conscience opt-out for almost any conceivable form of preventive care. But it didn't target mammograms, as Shaheen implied. And while the amendment would have protected religious-conscience objections, we failed to uncover any evidence that mammograms have inspired religious opposition, either now or in the past. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-00590	"Since 2010, eight children in Georgia have died due to vehicular heatstroke."	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jun/05/nathan-deal/deal-knows-his-numbers-child-deaths/	Editor's note: This fact-check was updated after it first published to included corrected information from the state on one child death. A year ago this month, hearts across Atlanta collectively sank. Dominating the news last June 18 were reports that a 22-month-old Cobb County boy had been left in the back seat of his family’s locked SUV and had been found unresponsive nearly eight hours later. His dad, Justin Ross Harris, would tell family he thought he had dropped off young Ross at daycare before parking the SUV and going into work for the day. Police would later say the dad’s account didn’t add up. Harris, who has denied any wrongdoing, is awaiting trial on several charges, including malice murder. His boy is now part of the statistics that state officials used Wednesday in their ongoing campaign to raise public awareness of the potential dangers of leaving a child alone in a car, especially in the hot Georgia summer. "Since 2010, eight children in Georgia have died due to vehicular heatstroke," Gov. Nathan Deal said at a press conference outside the state Capitol. The governor, first lady Sandra Deal and a contingent of state leaders gathered to promote a new public service video that encourages parents and caregivers to "look again" before they leave their vehicle to make sure they are not leaving a child behind. PolitiFact Georgia decided to look deeper into the stats Deal cited on child deaths caused by heatstroke. But first a little background. Annually, since the death of 2-year-old Jasmine Green in 2011, state officials have used the kickoff of summer to launch a public campaign to remind the public of the dangers of leaving a child in a hot, closed vehicle. Jasmine was found dead in a day care center van that had returned from a field trip to a Chuck E. Cheese in Jonesboro. Authorities said she had apparently fallen asleep between the seats of the van, and staff didn’t notice she was missing from the center for more than two hours. The state agency that oversees child care centers received 17 reports in fiscal 2013, 18 reports in fiscal 2014 and four reports in fiscal 2015 of children being left in vehicles by child care providers. "We receive calls about incidents where children are left in vehicles from a few minutes to several hours, and we investigate each incident," Amy M. Jacobs, the commissioner of Bright from the Start: Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL), said Wednesday. "While, thankfully, we have not seen any heatstroke-related deaths in child care centers since 2011, these dangerous close calls are completely unacceptable," she said. So what about those stats? We contacted DECAL, which provided us information on the eight Georgia deaths. In addition to the deaths of Ross and Jasmine, they include: *a 2-year-old Clarkston girl who was apparently trapped inside her mother’s car for more than an hour in 2014; * a 5-month-old girl was left in the family car outside a Kennesaw day school for five hours in 2011; * a 3-year-old Warner Robins boy left in a car outside a family day care for an hour in 2011; * a 3-year-old Canton girl left outside a church in 2010 for an unknown amount of time in the family minivan; *a 6-year-old girl from Evans who gained access to the family car in her garage for an undetermined amount of time in 2010. *an 18-month-old Monroe County boy was left in 2010 in the family van at an elementary school for seven or eight hours. Nationally, 639 children -- or an average of 37 per year -- died from heatstroke after being left in a vehicle between 1998 and 2014, according to data compiled by Jan Null with the Department of Meteorology & Climate Science at San Jose University. In that same time period, Georgia had 22 deaths, Florida 68, Alabama 14 and South Carolina 9. Our ruling Gov. Nathan Deal held a press conference Wednesday to raise public awareness of the potential dangers of leaving a child alone in a car. He and other state officials have been doing similar events since 2012, following the tragic death of a 2-year-old girl. The governor cited statistics showing that since 2010, eight children in Georgia have died due to vehicular heatstroke. The death count is accurate and makes the case that without vigilance on the part of parents and caregivers, there’s the potential for tragedy. We rate the governor’s statement True.

pomt-02427	"For every week that (state lawmakers are) able to cut off our timeline, it saves (Georgia taxpayers) approximately $100,000."	true	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/04/casey-cagle/cagle-state-saves-money-shorter-session/	Georgia lawmakers have been racing through the 2014 legislative session faster than NASCAR drivers, and for many observers frightened by the prospect of 236 politicians together for a lengthy period of time, that’s a good thing. Lawmakers want to return to their districts earlier this year. Why? The political party primaries are being held on May 20, two months earlier than normal, and elected officials want more time to campaign. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle talked about the financial benefits of a short legislative session. "For every week that we’re able to cut off our timeline, it saves us approximately $100,000," the Republican said in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. PolitiFact Georgia decided to whip out its calculator to see whether Cagle’s math was correct. The Georgia House of Representatives and Senate typically begin their 40-day legislative session in early January and typically finish around the end of March or early April. The end of the session, or "sine die" as lawmakers call it, is scheduled for March 20 this year. The state Capitol can seem as frenetic as a NASCAR driver’s pit crew during the legislative session. Lawmakers, lobbyists, reporters and visitors roam the halls for various meetings during those 40 days as the Legislature passes legislation that has an impact on all 10 million Georgians. The Legislature hires additional people to help during the session, but it comes at a cost. Slightly more than 200 aides and interns are temporarily working this session, Cagle’s staff said. Those additional workers are paid about $93,000 a week, Cagle’s office said. We asked Cagle’s office for information to back up the numbers. It took some time, but they eventually came our way. Cagle’s office sent us two sets of weekly payroll data for the temporary session staff. The first was for the week ending Jan. 19. The total was $96,666.94. The other was for the week ending Feb. 9. The total was $96,673.79. The longer the Legislature is in session, the more it costs to pay those additional workers. A 40-day session stretched over 90 days would be more expensive than a 40-day session stretched over 60 days. Cagle’s spokesman, Ben Fry, said the temporary session staff is one of three factors that the lieutenant governor had in mind when he made his statement. The second is the cost to the state for lawmakers to drive to and from the state Capitol each week. Legislators receive round-trip mileage reimbursement once a week for travel to and from Atlanta. All 236 lawmakers are eligible to get about 56 cents -- the federal standard -- for each mile they drive. The weekly total? It’s at least $20,000, Cagle said. Each lawmaker would drive an average of about 150 miles round-trip to get to that $20,000 estimate. Other Georgia lawmakers have written about the taxpayer savings of a more condensed legislative session, citing similar numbers for the cost of temporary staff. "For every week the General Assembly is in session, temporary staff in both chambers cost the state approximately $93,000 per week in payroll – and that’s not even including the savings from legislator per diem," Sen. Bill Heath, R-Bremen, wrote in an item on GaPundit.com. Ah, what about the per diem? Shouldn’t that be included in the cost? That brings us to the third factor Cagle had in mind. Georgia lawmakers currently get a daily per diem of $173 for travel and other expenses. That adds up to about $200,000 a week. Adding the per diem to the cost of temporary session staff increases the weekly cost to about $300,000. Wouldn’t that mean Cagle underestimated the weekly total cost? "That cost (of giving lawmakers a per diem for 40 days) is the same regardless of how the session goes," said Fry, Cagle’s spokesman. Fry said the savings would come from what he described as "sandwich days." These are weekdays when the Legislature is not in session. Lawmakers can still request the $173 per diem. Fry said it’s difficult to come up with an estimate of how much those days cost taxpayers, but he said it can add up. To sum up, Cagle said the state could save $100,000 for each week the Legislature can reduce their session schedule. Cagle’s argument is the longer the Legislature is in session, the more it costs Georgia taxpayers. The lieutenant governor’s statement is correct that it costs a good bit of money to operate when the Legislature is in session, if you consider the cost of temporary staff alone. If you consider the regular per diem costs, Cagle’s weekly estimate of $100,000 seems too conservative. We rate his statement True.

pomt-09992	"You can't read a speech by George Washington . . . without hearing him reference God, the Almighty."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/10/rush-limbaugh/Rush-limbaugh-washington-religion/	Radio host Rush Limbaugh, railing against a Newsweek cover that proclaimed "The Decline and Fall of Christian America," called on no less than the Father of Our Country for backup. Limbaugh was talking to a high school teacher from Rochester, N.Y., on his show April 8, 2009, when he invoked the first president to support the argument that the United States is a Christian nation. "Now, you've got people who want to conform and not cause any ripples, 'Oh, yeah, yeah, we're not a Christian nation, Judeo-Christian ethic, we are a lot of different religions here,' " Limbaugh said. "You can't read a speech by George Washington, you can't read his inaugural address, you cannot read them without hearing him reference God, the Almighty, and how this nation owes its existence to God and our thanks to God for the vision in founding this nation with people treated as he made them, the yearning spirit to be free and so forth." To see whether you indeed "can't read a speech by George Washington" without seeing a reference to God, we checked Washington's most noteworthy speeches, starting with his two inaugural addresses, since Limbaugh mentioned those specifically. The first inaugural address , though lacking the word "God," did contain plenty of references to a deity, such as one to "that Almighty Being who rules over the universe," and a line about how "no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the United States." But Washington's second inaugural address , the shortest on record, had no references to God, direct or indirect. Nor did Washington's Second Annual Message to Congress, the sort of speech that would come to be known as the State of the Union. Washington's famous speech at Newburgh to officers of the Continental Army, who were threatening to desert for lack of pay, also contained no references to God other than as an exclamation. "My God!" Washington said in a speech that came six years before he became president. "What can this writer have in view, by recommending such measures?" (That, and one other reference to the "God of Armies," were the only two times in the 13 speeches we read that Washington used the word "God.") So clearly Limbaugh was wrong that you can't read a Washington speech without seeing a reference to God. It's also worth noting, given Limbaugh's larger point that Washington's religious views support the idea that the United States is a Christian nation, that Washington was hardly a devout Christian. Peter Henriques, retired professor of history at George Mason University and author of the 2006 book Realistic Visionary: A Portrait of George Washington , said Washington's voluminous writings contain exactly one explicit reference to Jesus — when he told the natives of the Delaware Nation a decade before he became president: "You do well to wish to learn our arts and ways of life, and above all, the religion of Jesus Christ. These will make you a greater and happier people than you are." And in Washington's private writings, there's not one specific reference to Jesus, said Henriques, whose book includes a chapter devoted to Washington's religious views. Washington was fond of religion in general, saying in his farewell address to the nation in 1796 that of all the habits that lead to political prosperity, "Religion and Morality are indispensable supports." But he was also wary of religious sectarianism. He wrote of how religious disputes are "the most inveterate and distressing," how he feared they would "endanger the peace of society," and how he believed the Constitution established "effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny." Henriques said Washington was reluctant to spell out his own religious views, partly because he was "trying to be a unifying symbol for everyone." He believes Washington was best described as a "rational theist," meaning he believed in God and elements of Christianity, "but with a very strong dose of rationalism and reason." Other scholars label Washington and most of the other founding fathers "deists," meaning adherents of the 18th century movement that believed in God but emphasized morality. "They were sort of products of the 18th century Enlightenment," said John Ferling, a retired professor at the University of West Georgia whose book, The Ascent of George Washington: The Hidden Political Genius of an American Icon , is due to be published in May. "They thought in terms of there being a Supreme Creator who created life and the universe but then didn't intrude in things from that point on." So Washington wasn't nearly the devout Christian that Limbaugh suggested he was and he did not refer to God in all his speeches as the talk show host claimed. We find Limbaugh's claim is False.

Carter was promoting his new book, "A Call to Action: Women, Religion, Violence, and Power." A former Georgia governor, Nobel Peace Prize winner and perhaps the nation’s best-known Sunday school teacher, Carter is also a prolific author. "In the United States for the same exact work for a full-time employee, women get 23 percent less pay than men," Carter told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell in an interview that aired March 24. The so-called "gender wage gap" gets a lot of ink. PolitiFact has fact-checked various incarnations of the statistic Carter uses as the basis of his claim. Speakers have ended up all over the Truth-O-Meter depending on how accurately they framed the results of the study upon which the numbers are based. President Barack Obama ended up on the Truth-O-Meter for his take on the numbers during his 2012 campaign. He got a Mostly False ruling. Carter made a similar claim last year at a women’s conference in Atlanta. He told the conference that women in the United States are paid about 70 percent of what men earn for the same work. PolitiFact Georgia rated that statement Mostly False. Carter’s claim here is a bit different and more specific than the claim we checked last year. And this time, he was using the numbers to tout his book. PolitiFact Georgia decided to take another look. We reached out to Carter, and his assistant, Steven Hochman, emailed this about Carter’s television interview: "In a conversation or an interview, sometimes we don’t say all we want to say. In the United States for the same exact work, most women earn less than men. For full-time employees, the median annual earnings are about 23 percent less for women than for men." Let’s start with a basic primer on wages and gender. Experts agree there is a gender-based wage gap. But it is not as simple as it seems. Differences in the life choices of men and women — such as women tending to leave the workforce when they have children — and other factors make it difficult to make simple comparisons. The number Carter used in his TV interview comes from a U.S. Census Bureau study that looked at the total wages earned by male and female workers. The study found men’s total wages were about 23 percent higher than the total amount of women's wages. But that large discrepancy was due in part to the fact that men generally work more hours. The study did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Other data -- including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as data comparing the same jobs -- yield smaller wage gaps. Experts say the figure, which is often used to bolster arguments for gender-based wage bias, is misleading. Advocates often use the Census Bureau report because it shows the largest wage gap. The number does not take into account critical factors that could influence the figure, including specific occupation, time on the job and education level. And the gap drops dramatically if you compare men and women of similar education levels, job titles, time on the job and other relevant factors. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis cited one survey, prepared for the Labor Department. It found that when such differences are accounted for, much of the hourly wage gap vanished. It shrinks to the low single digits. Carter’s public statements about the gender wage gap are also at odds with his book. On Page 168, Carter states that "full-time female workers still earn about 23 percent less than men." There is no mention here of less pay for the "same exact work." During his MSNBC interview, Carter took a legitimate statistic and described it in a way that makes it sound much more dramatic than it is. The 23 percent figure is real. But it does not factor in occupations held, hours worked or length of tenure. That statistic does not refer to the pay of women doing "the same exact work" as men. There is a gender pay gap. But Carter vastly overstated it during his television interview. We rate Carter’s statement Mostly False.	None	Jimmy Carter	None	None	None	2014-04-04T00:00:00	2014-03-24	['United_States']
pomt-04994	Over the last six months, President Barack Obama has golfed 10 times and held 106 fundraisers, but his jobs council has never met.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/19/republican-national-committee-republican/did-barack-obama-hold-100-plus-fundraisers-while-h/	In a video and an infographic, the Republican National Committee amplified a charge first raised by Mitt Romney on the stump the day before -- that President Barack Obama has held more than 100 fundraisers in the past six months, yet his jobs council didn’t meet once. "In the last six months, he has held 100 fundraisers, and guess how many meetings he has had with his jobs council?" Romney said in a July 18, 2012, campaign event in Bowling Green, Ohio. "None. Zero. Zero in the last six months. So it makes it very clear where his priorities are." The following day, the RNC released a graphic that provided some additional specifics. Over the last six months, the graphic said, Obama has golfed 10 times and held 106 fundraisers, but his jobs council has never met. The RNC supplemented this with a video that added a goofy soundtrack as well as audio and video of an exchange on this topic between reporters and White House press secretary Jay Carney. Several readers asked us to check this statistic. We won’t pass judgment on how Obama should spend his time, but we will check the accuracy of the numbers. The jobs council Let’s start by explaining what the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness actually is. Its website explains that the panel was established "to provide nonpartisan advice to the President" on strengthening the economy and creating jobs. The council is chaired by the chairman and CEO of General Electric, Jeffrey Immelt, and is populated by a variety of other business figures, such as former AOL chairman Steve Case, venture capitalist John Doerr, former Citigroup and Time Warner chairman Richard D. Parsons, as well as economist Laura D’Andrea Tyson and AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka. Checking the lack of recent meetings was straightforward. The council’s own web page cites four meetings of the council so far -- Feb. 24, 2011, at the White House, June 13, 2011, in Durham, N.C., October 11, 2011, in Pittsburgh, and Jan. 17, 2012, at the White House. The Web page does add that the council has also conducted "18 listening and action sessions in communities around the country with businesses and local leaders" and that it plans to hold more in the coming months. However, the Web page doesn’t appear to consider these to be "meetings," and since the most recent was just slightly over six months ago, the RNC’s claim is correct. Asked about the lack of meetings in a July 18, 2012, press briefing, Carney said "the president solicits and receives input and advice from members of his jobs council and others about economic initiatives all the time. … There’s no specific reason (why they haven’t met) except the president has obviously got a lot on his plate." Golf and fundraising For statistics on Obama’s golf and fundraising activities, we turned to the RNC, which provided us with an Excel spreadsheet they had compiled internally. We then double-checked the RNC’s work. There is no official tally of the president’s daily activities. There is one tally that’s unofficial but widely respected -- one compiled by longtime CBS News correspondent Mark Knoller. Knoller tweeted on June 12, 2012, that "today's six events will bring to 160 the number of fundraisers Pres Obama has done since filing for re-election with the FEC last year." He also wrote in a story on June 17, 2012, that Obama had just played his 100th round of golf since taking office. However, because Knoller did not return an inquiry for this story, we could not match these numbers to the RNC’s claim. The RNC offered links to news accounts to back up Obama’s 10 golf outings in the past six months, and they confirmed golf outings on the dates cited by the RNC count. As for fundraising events, the RNC only provided dates and locations. However, we were able to check this list using two sources. The White House’s archive of presidential speeches and remarks offers chronological links to transcripts of the president’s comments at every public appearance he makes. Many, though not all, fundraising events are included in this archive. Meanwhile, to track events that were closed to the press -- and thus wouldn’t be included in the archive of speeches and remarks -- we relied on our personal archive of White House pool reports, which are the dispatches written by journalists covering the White House several times a day and distributed to all members of the White House press corps. These pool reports will typically mention that the president is attending a fundraiser even if the event is closed to the press. Using these two sources, we were able to confirm virtually all of the fundraisers cited by the RNC. In only three cases were we unable to verify fundraisers cited by the RNC using these sources. This doesn’t mean that these three events didn’t happen; we just couldn’t find pool reports that specifically backed them up. However, even if the actual number of fundraisers in the last six months turned out to be 103 rather than 106, we won’t quibble -- the number would be close enough for us to consider it accurate. Our ruling The RNC said that over the last six months, Obama has golfed 10 times and held 106 fundraisers even as his jobs council didn’t meet once. The RNC’s tally is on target. We rate the statement True.	None	Republican National Committee	None	None	None	2012-07-19T17:40:46	2012-07-19	['None']

pomt-08584	Kilmartin has helped pass laws to "create a witness protection program."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/sep/26/peter-kilmartin/kilmartin-says-he-helped-create-rhode-islands-witn/	You might think a state like Rhode Island, with its legacy of organized crime and corruption, would have had a witness protection program for decades. So we were surprised when Peter Kilmartin, a Democrat running for attorney general, said he helped create it just nine years ago. On his website, Kilmartin boasts about a host of professional accomplishments during his 20 years as a state representative. Among them, he says, he helped "create a witness protection program." Was there really no witness protection program before Kilmartin? First, a history lesson. The federal Witness Security Program, the one that gives witnesses new identities and new lives, was created as part of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 and amended by the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. It is run by the U.S. Marshals Service. But that program primarily covers federal cases. Witnesses in state-level cases have occasionally been placed in the program, but only in the most dangerous of circumstances. Several decades ago, states began to realize there was a need for less drastic, localized protection when witnesses needed temporary security before and after testifying, not a whole new identity. So they began creating their own programs. Here in Rhode Island, the push for a state policy began in the wake of a scandal involving mob informant Peter Gilbert, who used drugs, carried weapons, collected welfare and went skydiving while under the protection of the Providence police. His case led then-Attorney General James O'Neil and the legislature to create new guidelines to control the costs of monitoring witnesses and establish a board to oversee who was eligible for protection. But there were gaps in the new policy. Local police departments continued to run their own protection programs with little coordination. Witnesses were typically afforded temporary protection only if they said they felt threatened. That meant it was mostly limited to criminal witnesses who agreed to testify in exchange for leniency. Innocent witnesses rarely participated, according to Michael J. Healey, spokesman for the attorney general's office. "It was a witness protection program in name only because it wasn't what you think of when you think of protecting someone who witnessed a crime," he said. The flaws in the system were exposed a decade later. In the spring of 2000, 15-year-old Jennifer Rivera, a key witness in a Providence murder case, was fatally shot the day before she was to testify. Then-Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse, now a U.S. senator, came under fire for not protecting the teenager. He subsequently created a group to study how to remake the law to better identify and protect vulnerable witnesses. Among its recommendations: centralize the program within the attorney general's office and devote a full-time staff person to oversee it; require prosecutors and police to conduct independent assessments of the witness's need for safety, instead of waiting for the witness to express concern; and seal the program's records to protect participants. This is when Kilmartin, a state representative from Pawtucket, entered the picture. With the outline of the bill in hand, Whitehouse asked Kilmartin to sponsor the legislation, according to both the attorney general's office and Kilmartin. Kilmartin was a city police officer at the time and had sponsored several law-enforcement related bills. "I think the Rivera situation clearly showed that the statute we had was antiquated and wasn't comprehensive enough. It didn't provide the evaluation necessary to protect people," Kilmartin recalled. "So we passed the bill and updated the law in response to that situation." The legislation was introduced in the spring of 2001 and became law that summer. Did Kilmartin technically help create the Rhode Island's witness protection program? No. He wasn't even in office yet when the first version become law. But as the attorney general's spokesman points out, that was a protection program in name only, since it provided little protection for innocent witnesses. What Kilmartin did through his sponsorship of the 2001 bill was to help update and strengthen an existing witness protection program to centralize it and create necessary controls. He can't take all the credit, but we'll give him his fair share and call it Mostly True.	None	Peter Kilmartin	None	None	None	2010-09-26T00:01:00	2010-09-20	['None']

pomt-14176	Says he "was the only Republican" to vote against creating a House panel to investigate Planned Parenthood.	true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/26/david-jolly/us-rep-david-jolly-says-he-voted-against-house-pla/	Seeking Marco Rubio’s soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat, U.S. Rep. David Jolly said during a debate in Orlando that he’s committed to sticking to conservative principles, even if it means voting against his own party. Jolly met with U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, at an Open Debate Coalition event on April 25, 2016, to discuss the Senate candidates’ platforms. After a question about whether he would support defending or defunding Planned Parenthood, Jolly said he opposed abortion and could not support the group, which has been under fire after being accused of selling fetal tissue. But he acknowledged other women’s health services deserved funding and decried government wasting too much time and money on attacking Planned Parenthood. "When my side of the aisle asked for an investigation of Planned Parenthood, I actually voted no. I was the only Republican to vote no," he said. "Should the issue be looked at? Yes. But there were already three committees looking at the issue. We didn’t need a fourth. We’re either going to be the party of less government or not." Technically, the investigation Jolly is talking about doesn’t mention Planned Parenthood by name, but the Indian Shores Republican was the lone member of his party to oppose it. Copious committees The Republican-controlled House responded swiftly after the Center for Medical Progress released their heavily edited videos in July 2015 alleging Planned Parenthood sold fetal tissue after abortions. The Energy and Commerce Committee, the Judiciary Committee and the Oversight and Government Reform Committee all announced investigations into the videos on July 15. (The Senate also prodded the Health and Human Services Department to open an investigation, as well.) Despite several hearings, including testimony from Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards, there was no proof the group broke the law, which allows for tissue donations for an unspecified procurement fee but not taxpayer funds for abortions. On Oct. 7, 2015, the House voted on HR 451, which created a select investigative panel "for the purpose of investigating abortion practices and the handling of and policies regarding fetal tissue, its cost, and how it is obtained." Planned Parenthood was not named in the resolution, but was clearly the target of the investigation. Jolly was the only Republican to go against his party in a 242-184 vote, with two Democrats voting for it. Jolly noted in a Facebook post after the vote that he did not believe the panel was necessary. "We should always look to streamline government, not expand it. And the bottom line is today's decision unfortunately fails that most basic conservative principle," he said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. "Simply put, because three panels currently have jurisdiction to investigate, we do not need to create a fourth." We couldn’t find the post when we looked at Jolly’s Facebook timeline. His campaign directed us to a similarly worded Newsmax article Jolly wrote on Oct. 14, 2015. The article highlighted legislation Jolly introduced "to fully defund taxpayer support for Planned Parenthood until a thorough investigation is completed, and instead transfer that funding to other providers of critical non-abortion women's healthcare in underserved communities." Investigations by 12 state governments did not find any evidence of fetal tissue sales, although a grand jury in Texas in February 2016 did indict David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt, who made the videos. They both face charges of tampering with a government record, while Center for Medical Progress founder Daleiden was charged with prohibition of the purchase and sale of human organs. The panel the House created in October, the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, has held hearings but has not yet asked Daleiden to testify. Our ruling Jolly said he "was the only Republican" to vote against creating a House panel to investigate Planned Parenthood. The reason he voted no, he said, is because the House already had three investigations into Planned Parenthood’s alleged sale of fetal tissue. Jolly made it clear at the time he was not in favor of spending more taxpayer dollars to investigate something already under the microscope.

"We will be a country of generosity and warmth," Trump said. "But we will also be a country of law and order." That includes getting tough on immigration policy. "The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015," Trump said. We were curious to know if so far this year, the number of immigrant families who have crossed the border has surpassed all of 2015. Definition of family Immigration experts pointed us to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics on monthly and fiscal-year apprehensions of families along the Southwest border. CBP uses apprehensions as an indicator of total attempts to cross the border illegally. Ana Gonzalez-Barrera, a senior researcher at Pew Research Center, says the definition of a family unit is quite loose, but basically involves at least one child who is accompanied by at least one adult who is their parent or legal guardian. Turning to the data There are two ways to interpret the data — by calendar year (January 1 to December 31) and by fiscal year (October 1 to September 30). And that makes all the difference. By calendar year -- the way most people would interpret Trump’s comment -- he’s wrong. But by fiscal year, he’s right. CBP’s has apprehended 29,682 family members from January to June 2016, records show. In all of 2015, CBP apprehended more family members, 53,840. If he’s reading by fiscal year, as CBP reports it, then the numbers support his statement. In fiscal year 2015 (Oct. 1, 2014-Sept. 30, 2015), there were 39,838 apprehensions. So far from Oct. 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016, there have been a total of 51,152 apprehensions. Fiscal year 2016 includes three months -- October to December 2015 -- when there was a notable spike in apprehensions. From October to December 2015, there were 21,470 apprehensions — 2.8 times higher than the same period in 2014 and 4.1 times higher than combined average for same months over the last four years (2012–15). What caused the numbers to spike? Experts aren’t sure. Federal officials generally have discussed challenges created by Central American families trying to enter the United States. "We are cognizant that conditions in Central America push many to flee the region in search of a better life in the United States, and recognize the need to provide a safe alternative path to our country, and that many from the region should be regarded as refugees," Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Jeh C. Johnson said in a statement accompanying the latest data. Nestor Rodriguez, a sociology professor at the University of Texas at Austin who has been researching immigrant communities for decades, said these numbers mainly represent young mothers with small children from Central America "fleeing poverty and lethal danger from gangs in their countries," many who turn themselves into Border Patrol to seek asylum. Our ruling Trump said, "The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015." Many would understand it as calendar year and by this metric, Trump is wrong. However, Customs and Border Protection reports apprehension data by fiscal year. And by that measure, he has a point.

pomt-11255	"Flint still doesn’t have clean water."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/01/michelle-wolf/michelle-wolf-right-flint-still-doesnt-have-clean-/	The remarks by comedian Michelle Wolf at the White House Correspondents' Dinner were intensely scrutinized by journalists, commentators and users of social media. We don’t fact-check jokes, but we did want to look at one line by Wolf that seemed to be dead serious. At the end of her monologue, Wolf said, "Flint still doesn’t have clean water." She’s referring to the woes of Flint, Mich., where a switch in water sources was improperly handled, leading to unsafe levels of lead in the city’s water system. We’ve periodically checked in to see how Flint’s water problems are progressing, but the last time we looked was in late 2016. So, now that Wolf has used Flint’s situation as an exclamation point for her high-profile remarks, we decided to gauge whether she’s right that "Flint still doesn’t have clean water." Ultimately, we concluded that the reality is more nuanced than Wolf portrayed it. (We reached out to Wolf’s representatives but did not hear back.) Origins of the problem Flint is a low-income and majority African-American city beset by a decline in its manufacturing industry. The city’s lead poisoning was precipitated by Gov. Rick Snyder. Snyder, a Republican, had campaigned on his managerial experience and promised to bring outside experts to transform financially languishing municipalities. Under an emergency manager appointed by the state, the city ended its agreement to obtain water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and instead joined a new pipeline project, the Karegnondi Water Authority, that would draw water from Lake Huron. The move, made officially in April 2013, was done in large part to save the city millions of dollars. The day after the switch was announced, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department said it would cut off service in April 2014. Since the pipeline wouldn’t be ready by then, the city prepared to switch its water supply to the Flint River. However, the river water contained salts that would corrode pipes, and the right mix of corrosion inhibitors was never used. Not only did residents complain that their new water was foul, but it eventually became clear that lead was leaching into the water supply from the city’s old pipes. Lead is a highly toxic metal, especially for children whose bodies are still developing. After a litany of missed opportunities, the situation became a focus of the national media in the second half of 2015, prompting both emergency water distribution and a search for a longer-term solution. Water quality Flint faces two issues around its water supply: the quality of the water itself, and the effort to remove pipes that contain lead. First, let’s take a look at water quality. By July 2016, the federal Environmental Protection Agency had found significant reductions in lead levels, as long as residents used filters that were provided free of charge. Since then, there have been further improvements. A regulation known as the Federal Lead and Copper Rule set the safe limit for lead in water at 15 parts per billion in 90 percent of samples, using specific testing procedures. Most tests with these procedures in Flint have found that "lead levels have fallen to legally safe levels," said Peggy Kahn, a University of Michigan-Flint political scientist who has closely tracked the issue. Tests conducted in 2017 over a seven-month period by Susan J. Mastern of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Michigan State found lead levels that met the federal standard. Marc Edwards is a Virginia Tech environmental and water resources engineer who leads the Flint Water Study team, which helped identify the problem in the first place. His team also conducted tests in late 2017 and found lead levels below the legal threshold. So there’s solid evidence that Flint’s water is in compliance with federal regulations. That said, no level of lead is truly safe. Even the legal lead level for water does not fully protect children’s health, Kahn said, especially when there are other environmental sources of lead. "There is no such thing as perfectly safe water anywhere in the U.S.," Edwards said. "Even bottled water sometimes has health risks." Water delivery infrastructure Progress on replacing old, unsafe pipes has been slower. In March 2016, Flint began to rip out and replace some of the hazardous pipes under a "FAST Start program." That program continues. Kristin Moore, a Flint city government spokeswoman, said that 6,264 pipes have been replaced as of April 18, 2018. However, an estimated 12,000 Flint residences still have lead and galvanized service lines that need to be replaced, she said. "The pipe replacement work is expected to be completed by 2020," Moore said. "However, the mayor is hopeful that the project can be completed even sooner." One factor slowing the work is that "individual home tests may vary even within the same neighborhood," due to differences in how the original pipes were laid, said Kimberly Saks McManaway, director of the master’s of public administration program at the University of Michigan-Flint. So, how safe is the water? The consensus we found is that the water quality in Flint is greatly improved, but the city is not out of the woods yet. "While progress indeed continues to be made in Flint, Mayor Karen Weaver has said that there are still issues that must be addressed," said Moore, the city spokeswoman. She said residents are urged to drink water that is filtered and to keep their filters properly maintained, adding "some with health issues or compromised immune systems may be advised by medical professionals to drink bottled water." That said, Flint’s water quality now exceeds that of other cities with old water pipes, Edwards said. Kahn agreed that there has been "great improvement" compared to the worst of the crisis. However, she added that "there are still significant safety concerns, and there is a deep level of mistrust in view of some of the recent testing results and warnings, terrible past damage, unresponsiveness, and cover-ups." Our ruling Wolf said, "Flint still doesn’t have clean water." In reality, testing in recent months has repeatedly shown that Flint’s water meets federal standards. At the same time, the city won’t be fully safe until its old pipes are all replaced, which is currently estimated to happen in 2020. Considerable hurdles remain for Flint, but Wolf’s statement glossed over the significant progress made in water quality since the worst of the crisis. We rate her statement Half True.

pomt-07061	"We do not want to raise anybody's tax rates. That's never been on the table."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/28/james-clyburn/james-clyburn-says-democrats-do-not-want-raise-any/	On the June 26, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C. -- the third-ranking House Democrat -- discussed tax policy. Amanpour noted that key Republicans participating in negotiations led by Vice President Joe Biden over the rapidly approaching debt ceiling had recently walked away, saying their party couldn’t stomach any deal that involves tax hikes. Amanpour asked Clyburn, "What do you think is going to be the result of the meetings between President Obama and the leadership when they start tomorrow?" Clyburn responded, "Well, I don't know what they're going to do in those meetings, but I think that we had some very effective meetings. We had 10 meetings, and of course when the Republicans walked away from the table, it was on the day that we were to have our either last or next to the last meeting. I thought we were doing very, very good. "Now, the question is, how do you define a tax increase? And I don't know of anybody who will define a tax increase as closing the loophole. If you tell me that my tax rate is going to be 30 or 35 percent and I come up with all kind of gimmicks with pretty smart lawyers and only pay 9 percent, there's something wrong with the loopholes in the law. We want to close those loopholes up. We do not want to raise anybody's tax rates. That's never been on the table. And I wish they would get beyond their talking points and really get honest with the American people as to what these discussions are about. "We ought not have these oil subsidies. We ought not have all these ethanol subsidies. We ought not have all these new breaks for millionaires and billionaires. We ought to be honest with the American people and have an effective tax rate that will be fair to everybody." We wondered whether Clyburn was accurate when he said, "We do not want to raise anybody's tax rates. That's never been on the table." To understand Clyburn’s comment, we need to go back a bit. During 2001 and 2003, the Republican-controlled Congress and President George W. Bush enacted a series of tax cuts. Unless they were affirmatively extended before expiration at the end of 2010, the rates were set to return to their level prior to their initial passage -- specifically, to rates that prevailed under President Bill Clinton. During the 2008 presidential campaign, President Barack Obama promised to extend the cuts for individuals with incomes below $200,000 and couples with incomes below $250,000 while ending the lower tax rates for Americans above those thresholds. In December 2010, Obama -- under pressure from Republicans who had just prevailed in the midterm elections -- agreed to keep the tax cuts not just for Americans below those thresholds, but also for upper-income Americans. The two sides agreed to extend the cuts for everyone for another two years, through the end of 2012. However, Obama did not go as far as many Republicans would have liked. They would have preferred to extend the Bush tax cuts indefinitely, or at least for a longer period, for all taxpayers regardless of income. After announcing the two-year extension, Obama reaffirmed his opposition to them over the longer term. "In the long run, we simply can't afford them," Obama said. "And when they expire in two years, I will fight to end them." That brings us to 2011. In analyzing Clyburn’s statement, we think it’s fair to look at the tax record of House Democrats, since Clyburn is a House Democratic leader. It turns out that House Democrats took their cue from Obama when assembling their 2012 budget proposal, which was released by the Democratic staff of the House Budget Committee on April 13, 2011. Here’s the relevant part of the proposal: "The Democratic budget makes permanent the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for working Americans (individuals with income below $200,000 and couples below $250,000), but does not extend the tax cuts for those with higher incomes. … It expressly rejects the approach in the Republican resolution that provides millionaires with even larger tax cuts at the expense of middle-income taxpayers." Being in the minority in the House, the Democrats were unable to pass their proposal. But the chamber did take a floor vote on it. On April 15, 2011, the House voted down the proposal, 166-259. But despite unanimous Republican opposition, the proposal won the backing of the overwhelming majority of Democratic lawmakers, with 166 voting in favor of it and only 23 voting against. Among those who voted for it was Clyburn himself. When we contacted Clyburn’s staff, a spokeswoman said that the congressman, in his CNN comment, "was addressing what was specifically discussed in the Biden deficit reduction meetings. Ending the Bush tax cuts was not discussed in those meetings, but closing loopholes for big oil, corporations and the wealthy were raised as potential sources of revenue." We can see his point -- it's true that Amanpour’s question was directed at the talks led by Biden, and in his answer, Clyburn did mention the wisdom of closing various "loopholes." Still, we think a reasonable person would interpret Clyburn’s comment as having broader implications. Clyburn said that Democrats don’t want to raise "anybody’s" tax rate, and that tax hikes have "never been on the table." But the reality is that Clyburn and his own caucus proposed tax hikes for wealthier Americans and then voted for them on the House floor. While Clyburn’s explanation does make some sense, we think it’s the only interpretation that would make his claim accurate. A broader interpretation -- and one we think would be more obvious to viewers -- would suggest that his statement is incorrect. So we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09688	The health care bills will be "mandated spending. You can't cut it, regardless of the budget circumstances."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/12/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-says-health-care-bills-spending-cant-be-c/	On his Nov. 10, 2009, show, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh decried President Barack Obama's spending priorities, saying the president is "worried about 50 measly billion dollars to win a war" in Afghanistan when he's already spent, or wants to spend, trillions of dollars on other items, such as the economic stimulus package and health care reform. One of Limbaugh's claims caught our eye. He said that the health care legislation "is going to be mandated spending. You can't cut it, regardless of the budget circumstances." Limbaugh was trying to make the point that spending demanded in the health care bill would expand without ordinary budgetary limits, and that the health bill's spending would ultimately crowd out other government necessities such as funding the military. To determine whether Limbaugh is right, we'll start by defining "mandated spending." Federal budget experts actually use a slightly different term -- "mandatory spending" -- but the meaning is the same. It refers to spending that isn't controlled by the usual congressional appropriations process. The spending goes up or down -- usually just up! -- based on the number of people who qualify. Examples include Medicare, Social Security, Medicare and food stamps. Their cost keeps going up as long as the number of people who qualify keeps going up. The health care bill that passed the House and the slightly different one that passed the Senate Finance Committee offer two significant new streams of mandatory spending -- the "affordability credits" that subsidize health plans that people buy on the newly created health insurance "exchanges," and an expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor. Both of these efforts, which are broadly intended to help cover previously uninsured Americans, are indeed mandatory spending, health experts said. Under the House bill, people qualify for the credits if they have incomes below 400 percent of the federal poverty level and are not eligible for Medicaid or Medicare. Beginning in year two, credits would be opened up to people whose employer?provided plan would cost more than 12 percent of their income. The Senate Finance bill would provide a credit to individuals with income up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. With either bill as currently written, that would fit the definition of mandatory spending. The second stream of mandatory spending -- an expansion of Medicaid -- also fits the definition of mandatory spending. Currently, Americans can qualify for Medicaid only if their income is low enough and if they are a child, pregnant, elderly, blind, or disabled. Both bills would expand eligibility for the program significantly. So Limbaugh is correct in that the most important new types of spending in the health care bills are mandatory. However, the second half of his statement -- that "you can't cut it, regardless of the budget" -- is off the mark. Just because mandatory spending is "mandatory" doesn't mean that it's permanent. Congress and the president can act to reduce mandatory spending, or even repeal entire programs, whenever they want. It's true that doing that is politically difficult. Once people get used to guaranteed benefits (such as Medicare), they usually fight hard to keep them. Politicians, fearing the wrath of highly motivated voters who stand to lose something they value, often back off from challenging mandatory programs. But occasionally, Congress finds the will to cut a mandatory program. In 1983, Congress agreed to some Social Security cuts that were recommended by a blue-ribbon commission chaired by Alan Greenspan. The cuts withheld cost-of-living adjustments for one quarter and cut benefits over the longer term. And under a major welfare overhaul enacted under President Bill Clinton, benefits were cut for some of those who had previously been entitled to welfare payments, including legal aliens (a bar that was subsequently repealed) and illegal aliens (one that remains in force). Along those lines, the Senate Finance health care bill includes a "fail-safe" provision that is supposed to ensure the mandatory spending won't bust the budget. Starting in 2012, the director of the Office of Management and Budget must certify every year that the provisions in the bill will not increase the budget deficit during the coming year. If the OMB director finds that the bill will increase the deficit, the subsidies in the health care exchange would automatically be cut. And that is . . . mandatory. So while it would be hard to take away mandatory health insurance assistance to lower-income Americans, it's not true to say, as Limbaugh did, that "you can't cut it, regardless of the budget circumstances." If Congress and the president have the will, there will be a way. So Limbaugh is right that the most important spending streams in the House and Senate bills are mandatory. But he's not correct that Congress is powerless to do anything about them. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2009-11-12T14:52:12	2009-11-10	['None']

pomt-12682	"What has happened since 2005? We’ve seen violent crime continuously go down" due to Florida's "stand your ground" law.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/mar/16/dennis-baxley/did-floridas-stand-your-ground-law-reduce-violent-/	As one of the original authors of Florida’s 2005 "stand your ground" law, Sen. Dennis Baxley, has a long history of touting its success. Since the 2012 shooting death of Miami Gardens teen Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, opponents have pointed to an increase in justifiable homicides to argue against the law, which protects individuals who use deadly force in self-defense instead of retreating. Baxley, a Republican from Ocala, has repeatedly countered that argument and others by connecting the law’s passage 12 years ago with decreasing crime rates. He did it again in a March 15 debate on legislation that would shift the burden of proof from the defendant to the prosecutor in "stand your ground" cases. (The Senate approved SB 128 by a 23-15 vote; the House version has received the backing of one committee so far.) "So what has happened since 2005?" Baxley asked. "We’ve seen violent crime continuously go down. Is that not the public policy result that we would want?" When we examined a similar statement in 2012, we found that there had been a drop, but rates were declining before the law went into effect in 2005, calling into question what impact the law really had. Now it’s time to put this claim to the test once again, using updated data and research. Overall violent crime rate in Florida has dropped, but not every year Data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting statistics shows that from 2005 to 2015, the violent crime rate in Florida decreased by a cumulative 34.9 percent overall. However, if you look at the changes from year to year, the violent crime rate did go up three times — in 2006, 2007 and 2014. (And remember, the rate had been dropping for several years anyway.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Given that there is a certain amount of "noise" in yearly crime statistics, those spikes don’t really undercut the argument that violent crime has been dropping overall in Florida. However, the word "continuously" is too strong to describe the trend line. "I do not think that is quite the correct word to use," said Bill Bales, a professor in the College of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida State University. However, Baxley's argument is not far off as long as "the declines experienced were very minimal." Other experts have offered a similar assessment in previous fact-checks of crime data. Alan Lizotte, a University at Albany criminologist, told PolitiFact last year that "a small increase between two time points is not an increase when the 20-year trend is downward. If it went on for several years, it might indicate an increase." Impact of ‘stand your ground’ not proven The bigger problem is Baxley’s assertion that the "stand your ground" law led to a demonstrable reduction on violent crime. (He confirmed through an aide that that was his point.) In reality, violent crime in the United States has decreased since the 1990s, except for an uptick in the past two years that has come nowhere near erasing the previous quarter century of declines. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Given that, it’s hard to separate the downward trend in violent crime in Florida from the decline on the national level, which was also mirrored in many individual states. "I would posit that it has had little or no effect on any decrease," added Charles Rose, a Stetson University law professor. Baxley did not offer any evidence that showed "stand your-ground" had a demonstrable impact on crime. In fact, there’s actually contrary evidence. The journal JAMA Internal Medicine published a study in November 2016 that found that firearm homicides increased after the 2005 passage of the law in Florida. That’s a narrower measurement than violent crimes overall, but the findings shed some light on the issue. The study was done by David Humphreys of the University of Oxford, Antonio Gasparrini of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Douglas Wiebe of the University of Pennsylvania. They looked at trends for firearm homicides in Florida between 1999 and 2014. It found that after the "stand your ground" law took effect in October 2005, rates of homicide by firearm in the state significantly increased. "These increases appear to have occurred despite a general decline in homicide in the United States since the early 1990s," the authors wrote. And states without a "stand your ground" law that were studied — New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Virginia — saw no such uptick. "Our findings support the hypothesis that increases in the homicide and homicide by firearm rates in Florida are related to the ‘stand your ground’ law," the authors wrote. Our ruling Referring to the year that the "stand your ground" law passed, Baxley said, "What has happened since 2005? We’ve seen violent crime continuously go down." Crime has gone down significantly since 2005, though "continuously" is overstated. Moreover, it is hard to pin the cause of the decline on the passage of the "stand your ground" law, since the decline in Florida has been mirrored on the national level. If anything, firearm-related homicides may have increased after the law’s passage, according to one peer-reviewed study. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-01814	"Literally, by the time a child is 18 years of age, they've killed over 100,000 people in video games and other online things."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/21/mark-omara/cnn-legal-analyst-18-kids-have-killed-over-100000-/	The death of a Google executive at the hands of an escort he met online have pundits wondering: Is the digital age one of sex, lies and dark fantasies? To see the moral rupture created by technology, look no further than the reckless slaughtering on video games, said CNN legal analyst Mark O’Mara. O'Mara represented George Zimmerman, the Orlando-area man who shot and killed Trayvon Martin. "The perceived anonymity of digital existence makes it much easier to sort of distance yourself for your own morality," said O’Mara on July 16, 2014 on CNN Tonight. "It’s just what happens because it’s so much easier to be somebody you want to be but know you shouldn't be when you’re online. Literally, by the time a child is 18 years of age, they‘ve killed over 100,000 people in video games and other online things." Whether video games lead to real-life violence has been a debate for decades. As for the virtual violence, we were struck by O’Mara’s claim that an 18-year-old has killed over 100,000 people in video games. We wanted to check it out. Shots in the dark While O’Mara’s delivery suggests we’d find our answer in some sort of academic journal, his spokesman told us the statistic was "napkin calculation." More realistically, it sounds like a guess. "(He) may have underestimated that significantly, it could be less than 5 percent of what the real number may be," O’Mara spokesman Shawn Vincent said. "The point is that young people are simulating murders, and witnessing thousands of them on TV." We were unable to find any study or research that approximates the number of video kills of an 18-year-old, and experts in the field said no such research exists. The problems include the types of games children play, how often they play them, how they play them. Plus, while the vast majority of children play video games, not all do. "There's absolutely no way to determine this -- it's too vague," said Entertainment Software Association spokesperson Dan Hewitt. "It's all how a game is played. For example. Grand Theft Auto can be played from beginning to end without harming or ‘killing’ anyone. Same is true with many games. It's all in how an individual plays it and there's no way to even make an estimate." From the gamer’s perspective So while it’s dangerous to make a broad generalization the way O’Mara did, we can get a sense of what’s happening among gamers who play shooting-style games. The take-away: Their virtual personas do a lot of killing. One of the best-selling gaming franchises, Halo, estimates that the first three games amassed 136 billion player-versus-player kills. We reached out to several players either through Facebook groups or through colleagues to hear about their personal stories. Pete Cruz, 22, has a total kill count of player-versus-player 52,459 on one Halo 3 game. He estimates that this is a pretty average or slightly above average count. Cruz has been playing the Halo games since 2004 and says his total kill count was "easily 100,000" when he was 18. "More like 150,000 if not more," he said. "That number can easily be reached during your teenage years or from 10 to 19 (years old)." Jay Manning, 21, estimated he probably reached 100,000 kills in his first six months of playing. Reaching that count by the you’re 18, he agreed, is "easy." Govinda Sessa, 18, has a total kill count of 73,316 over 30 game days in Halo 4. Ben Stuart, 23, put these numbers in context: He averages about 10 to 15 kills per game and has played about 5 or 6 games daily since he was 10 years old. That adds up. Call of Duty, another popular shooting franchise, hasn’t released recent data since its newest game debuted, said spokesperson Kyle Walker. But from the start of the franchise in 2003 to its second newest game, players have "respawned" (come back to life after a player-inflicted death) 1.9 quadrillion times. That’s 15 zeroes. Marty Maldonado, 21, began playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 when he was 16. He estimates spending two or three hours daily on the game in high school, and says he probably reached 100,000 kills by the time he was 18. But Maldonado is wary of saying these kills were of people. "You don't really see them as people, mainly because you're playing a game and you think of the avatar as an extension of the other person's ability," he said. "The only time I would say I felt like I killed someone were emotional games that had good character development like the BioShock series or (the) nuke scene in Call of Duty 4." Different keystrokes Halo and Call of Duty are both first-person shooting games, a category of video games that make up about a fifth of the market, according to a Entertainment Software Association report. All the gamers and experts we talked to point out that it’s hard to compare total kills. "What’d you even consider a kill? Mario stomping? Call of Duty shooting?" said PC Magazine writer David Murphy. In some categories -- action and sports game, for example, which take up about 22 percent and 15 percent of the market respectively -- killing is not even the point. The No. 2 best selling video game of 2012 was Madden NFL 13, a football game in which players aim for touchdowns not deaths. In Assassin’s Creed, a popular action-adventure franchise, the main gameplay involves storylines and missions. Though you do kill in the game, you don't really count the number in an open world game, said player Rahul Prakash. Even in shooting games, total kill counts don’t account for the many variables in video games and differences in players. Time spent on games, time frame per game, game goals, player age, player level, online or offline, single player versus multiplayer -- these factors all matter and are rarely accounted for, said Cruz. "Depending on how that number is constructed, it can definitely lead to misinformation and misconstrue facts about video games," he said. The ruling O’Mara said, "Literally, by the time a child is 18 years of age, they‘ve killed over 100,000 people in video games and other online things." Literally, the stat is a "napkin calculation." Research doesn’t exist on the point and there are too many variables to affect how many people someone might have killed in video game. That said, a range of gamers told us that if you play shooting-style games in your teen years, you’re quite likely to kill 100,000 people or more. While that gives O’Mara’s statement some truth, the lack of definitive information makes this claim somewhat dodgy. We rate it Half True.

pomt-03925	Says if Congress doesn’t avoid the sequester, "tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find child care for their kids."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-sequester-would-leave-tens-thous/	Will the sequester yank away parents’ child care? On March 1, mandatory federal budget cuts take effect that were supposed to be so painful that Congress would take action to avoid them. President Barack Obama has urged lawmakers to avoid the cuts, known as the sequester, and has been citing dire predictions about who might be hurt by the across-the-board reductions in a broad range of federal programs. On Feb. 19, 2013, he warned that if Congress didn’t take action, "tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find child care for their kids." The New York Times reported the next day that "day care centers are almost certainly not going to be padlocked on March 1." But what will happen? And will it send parents scrambling? Child care subsidies and Head Start At least two federal programs that affect parents’ child care options face cuts under the sequester. First, let’s recap how the sequester works. Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount — tentatively 7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for nondefense discretionary funding. (Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.) The uniform cuts must be applied to any "program, project or activity" that isn’t otherwise exempted. However, within a given program, officials don’t have to cut every line item equally. They have discretion to move money around within a program. The two big federal programs affecting child care are the Child Care Development Block Fund, which helps states provide child care subsidies for low-income working parents that affect more than 1.6 million kids. The second is early education program Head Start, which awards grants to public and private agencies to increase kids’ "school readiness," such as with whole or half-day programs in schools and centers. (It also includes programs that wouldn’t offset parents’ child care needs.) Head Start says it serves more than a million kids a year. All of Head Start’s funding is open to sequester, according to the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. About half of the Child Care Development Block Fund’s program’s federal funding is mandatory — and therefore exempt from the sequester — but the other half faces cuts. Both programs are organized under the Health and Human Services Department, which estimates that "up to 70,000 children" would lose access to Head Start and Early Head Start programs, with some centers closing their programs early this year or delaying their start in the fall. Meanwhile, budget cuts would leave "up to 30,000 children" without child care services, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote. House Democrats and the White House also rely on the HHS estimates. But the precise impact and timing of the cuts is difficult to quantify. Why? Because the programs are designed to give considerable control over spending to states and other public and private agencies. Head Start’s rolling grant process means cuts will need to be made over the next seven months, the remainder of the current fiscal year, said Ted Froats, a spokesman for HHS’ Administration for Children and Families. But with the child care grant program, while cuts also take place over seven months, it’s harder to say when the impact may be felt. The department reached its 30,000 estimate by reducing the amount of funding available for the year according to the rules of the sequester and comparing that with the average cost per child served, Froats said. But states have "broad flexibility" in administering the program, which is also partly funded by the states themselves and by moving money from other federal pots, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Parents qualify for subsidies on a sliding scale, with some paying co-pays — and rules vary state by state. States might respond to federal cuts in a variety of ways, such as: • Imposing stricter eligibility criteria. • Freezing new enrollments. • Reducing subsidy amounts. • Increasing parental co-payment amounts. So it’s possible currently enrolled parents may keep their care, but with a lower subsidy or a higher co-pay. Still, it’s important to note that states are already stretched. Nearly half had waiting lists or stopped taking new families in 2012, according to a report by the Women's National Law Center, which advocates for affordable child care. Meanwhile, reimbursement amounts have lagged. Parents may not be able to keep up with yet another cut. And the idea that states might be able to move money around and still support the same number of kids doesn’t hold up, said Karen Schulman, a senior policy analyst who co-authored the report. "They wouldn't have waiting lists if they had other ways around," she said. "... To me, that suggests they've already looked at the 'fat.'" (The libertarian Cato Institute in 2010 noted a 2004 report from Congress’ Government Accountability Office found HHS didn't do a sufficient job overseeing state management of the program, leading to waste and abuse. But GAO’s recommendations have since been implemented.) Our ruling The president warned that if Congress didn’t take action, "tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find child care for their kids." The sequester does hit two big programs that affect parents’ child care or their need for it — a subsidy program and the early childhood education program Head Start. The government estimates up to 100,000 kids would be affected. But neither the White House nor HHS has provided sufficient evidence to establish the number of kids whose parents would need to find other child care. Parents might be able to keep their subsidized child care with lower subsidies or higher co-pays.

pomt-10053	"There are no earmarks" in the stimulus bill.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/04/robert-gibbs/stimulus-bill-includes-projects-some-consider-earm/	For weeks, President Obama and his aides have said it is critical that the economic stimulus package not contain any "earmarks," projects that are often viewed as wasteful or frivolous. This week, Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs declared they had succeeded. At his daily briefing on Feb. 2, 2009, Gibbs said the bill contains "unprecedented accountability and transparency. There are no earmarks in this bill. The information on the projects that will be funded in this legislation will be available online, as you know, at www.recovery.gov . There will be an oversight board that will monitor the progress of each project and address any problems that are involved early and aggressively." Obama made a similar claim in an interview with ABC on Feb. 3, saying, "If you take a look at the bill, the fact is, there are no earmarks in this bill, which, by the way, some of the critics can't claim for legislation they've voted for over the last eight years." Given all the complaints Republicans have made about the bill, we wondered if Gibbs and Obama were right. What's an earmark? We need to start by explaining the different ways earmarks are defined. The term comes from the practice of marking the ears of livestock for identification. It has been used in American politics since the 1930s and has come to mean money that is "set aside . . . for a special project or purpose," according to Safire's Political Dictionary, a well-regarded reference book on political terms. But Safire 's notes that in Congress, the term often has a narrower meaning: "funds that individual senators or representatives specify be directed to projects and activities that will benefit particular people, institutions or locations in their home constituencies." The Office of Management and Budget, an agency that is essentially an extension of the White House, offers a definition with a little executive branch attitude: "Earmarks are funds provided by the Congress for projects or programs where the congressional direction (in bill or report language) circumvents the merit-based or competitive allocation process, or specifies the location or recipient, or otherwise curtails the ability of the Executive Branch to properly manage funds." If you sense a little snarkiness in the OMB definition, it's because the executive branch doesn't fancy the legislative branch telling it what to do. But members of Congress, particularly those on the Appropriations Committee, say an earmark is simply how the legislative branch fulfills its duty under the Constitution to tell the executive branch what to do. (Article 1, Section 9: "No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.") Because of the fuss over the "Bridge to Nowhere" and other controversial projects, the House and Senate now have rules requiring members to disclose their requests for earmarks. The Senate avoids the fuzzy term "earmark," preferring the more lawyerly "Congressionally directed spending items," which it defines as "a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Senator providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula driven or competitive award process." The Senate definition also covers tax benefits for "a particular beneficiary or limited group of beneficiaries." The House rule defines earmark as "a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or Senator providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula driven or competitive award process." More earmarking in Senate The stimulus bills are huge. The Senate version has more than 700 pages that on average cost more than $1 billion per page. In general, the approach behind the bills is to leave the specific spending decisions to federal agencies and states and municipalities. For example, the bill's don't specify particular highways for federal money. The states can decide. Still, there are plenty of specifics in the House and Senate versions that indicate members of Congress are earmarking, at least in the broad sense of the word. PolitiFact has spent the past couple of weeks fact-checking many claims about what's in the bills. Although we found Eric Cantor was Pants on Fire wrong when he said the House bill included $300,000 for a Miami sculpture garden, the Republicans were right the House bill had $335 million for prevention of sexually transmitted diseases , and that the Senate version authorizes $198 million for Filipino veterans. (We should note that the Senate bill is a work in progress and that the contents may change; our rulings are accurate for the time when the statement was made.) When the House bill was being considered, it had controversial elements such as money for improvements to the National Mall, which some people consider an earmark. But that was stripped out before final passage. Matthew Specht, a spokesman for Rep. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who is considered the biggest critic of earmarks in the House, told us, "Yeah, we agree that the House version can probably be considered earmark-free." There seems to be more earmarking in the Senate version, however. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., has highlighted many provisions he considers to be earmarks, including a $246 million tax break for Hollywood movie producers. It would allow large Hollywood studios the opportunity to choose between an existing tax break or write off 50 percent of the entire production cost for movies and TV shows made in 2009. It was in the bill when Gibbs made his statement but was removed Feb. 3 when Coburn passed an amendment 52-45 to remove it. To answer whether that project and others could be considered earmarks, we turned to Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington advocacy group that tracks government spending and highlights waste. Steve Ellis, the group's vice president, said congressional leaders had generally resisted the urge to fill the bill with earmarks, according to the strict definitions of the word. But he said there still were some projects in the bills that he and other people would consider earmarks. "There’s at least a few and I wouldn’t be surprised if we end up finding more," he said, citing the provision for Filipino veterans as an example. Coburn spokesman John Hart and Taxpayers for Common Sense also cited another project as an earmark: a provision in the bill calling for $2 billion for a "near zero emissions powerplant." They say the money is intended to restart FutureGen, a near-zero emissions coal power plant in Illinois that is supported by Sen. Dick Durbin. Senators are also employing a wink-wink approach that uses vague-sounding language in a committee report to quietly direct money to pet projects. Although the language does not sound specific, groups that track earmarks say it's clear where senators want the money to go. For example, a report on the bill from the Senate Appropriations Committee specifies $70 million for "supercomputer activities, especially as they relate to climate research." The Senate Conservatives Fund, a political action committee, says that is probably targeted for the National Center for Environmental Prediction in Camp Springs, Md. The group also cites $250 million that is designated "to repair NASA facilities damaged by Hurricane Ike and to reduce the significant backlog of maintenance and repair projects at NASA facilities nationwide." That appears to be for the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Those projects don't have senators' names attributed to them, but the Senate Conservatives Fund points out that senators on the Appropriations Committee include Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. It's worth noting that Obama's observation about the overall nature of the bill is mostly correct. The House and Senate stimulus bills have not been stuffed with hundreds of pet projects the way that highway, energy and water bills often are. And that's especially true for the House bill. But the Senate version includes at least several projects that we consider to be earmarks. The Filipino project might not fit the narrow definition of earmarks that Congress or OMB uses, but we think reasonable people would consider it to be an earmark. And the movie industry tax break, which was in the bill when Gibbs made his statement, and the Texas and Maryland projects sure look like earmarks by any definition. Gibbs didn't leave himself any wiggle room. He said "no earmarks." But we see at least a few, so we find his statement to be False.

pomt-09089	"In the last 6 years, there have been 420 elections for State Senator and State Representative. Only three incumbents have been defeated!"	true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/24/fair-districts-florida/incumbents-hard-beat/	Underneath the loud tussling over who Florida's next governor and U.S. Senator will be runs a quiet political battle that could have far more lasting ramifications. Two warring efforts to reshape how Florida's voter districts are drawn are gearing up across the state. On one side stands Fair Districts Florida, a citizens group that claims political leaders manipulate the redistricting process to benefit incumbents. They put two constitutional changes, Amendments 5 and 6, on the November ballot. The measures would require lawmakers to adhere to redistricting standards that don't favor incumbents when they redraw legislative and congressional lines starting next year. On the other side are Republican lawmakers and a handful of minority leaders who argue the requirements set out in the amendments are both vague and impossible. They placed their own constitutional amendment on the ballot, Amendment 7, that would allow legislators to craft districts using "communities of interest," such as race or coastal communities. "We asked them a very simple question, 'How does your plan to draw the districts work?' And they said, 'I don't know,'" said incoming Senate President Mike Haridopolos, R-Melbourne, a critic of the Fair Districts campaign who pushed Amendment 7 through the 2010 legislative session. "I am not going to play politics with something as important as someone's voting rights." But critics of the legislative amendment paint it as a ploy to confuse voters and gut the Fair Districts amendments. Ellen Freidin, campaign chair of Fair Districts Florida, said Florida's redistricting process deters new candidates. "They actually designed their districts specifically for themselves," she said. "They know how many registered voters in the district are Republican or Democratic so someone from the other side can't win because they stack it that way." The Fair Districts Florida website explains the stakes this way: "In the last 6 years, there have been 420 elections for State Senator and State Representative. Only three incumbents have been defeated! After all, their districts are specially designed for them! With virtually certain seats, legislators have no incentive to be responsive to their constituents and they see no reason to compromise for the public good." We aren't going to address the finger-wagging over which side is in the wrong. But Fair Districts' election statistics are ripe for a Truth-O-Meter item. We wondered, are Florida elections really that predictable? The short answer is yes. We checked the state Division of Elections site, which lists every state Senate and House candidate since 1996. It also lists the outcomes of each race, including primaries, special elections, runoffs and general elections. In the past six years, Florida has held three regularly scheduled general elections and 17 special elections for Senate and House seats. By definition, special elections don't feature incumbents, so those campaigns are not relevant to our count. In 2008, there were 141 seats up for grabs. In 2006, there were 140, and 2004 saw 142 seats enter into play. That amounts to 423 potential general elections in six years. There are many more elections if you count individual primaries, runoffs and general elections. Freidin said her "420" figure was based on the number of Senate and House seats that might have been up for election during those three cycles. From 2004 through 2010, many Florida incumbents won re-election when candidate qualifying closed because they drew no opponents. In 2004, every incumbent won re-election. Of the incumbents who drew rivals, exactly three were defeated during that six-year span: Republican Rep. Sheri McInvale of Orlando lost her 2006 general election to Rep. Scott Randolph, a Democrat from Orlando. Two Republicans, an independent and a write-in candidate qualified in June 2010 to run against Randolph. Republican Rep. Susan Goldstein of Weston was trumped in the 2006 general campaign by Rep. Marty Kiar, a Democrat from Davie, who was re-elected in June 2010 when no other candidate qualified to run. Democratic Rep. Tony Sasso of Cocoa Beach failed to keep his seat during the 2008 general election. The winner was Rep. Steve Crisafulli, a Republican from Merritt Island who was re-elected in June 2010 without opposition. Fair Districts Florida's larger point that Florida races tend to be easy on incumbents still rang true after further scrutiny. A review of the past six election cycles shows challengers had a slightly better chance of winning just before and right after the state's districts were redrawn in early 2002, but not by much. In that election year, four incumbents lost their seats in a race where 160 seats were initially up for grabs. In 2000, with 141 open seats, four other incumbents were defeated. In 1998, with 141 seats in play, four incumbents didn't win back their seats. We'll do the math for you: just 15 state senators and representatives didn't win re-election bids over the span of six election cycles. Haridopolos said incumbent victories aren't necessarily tied to redistricting. The winners could simply have run better campaigns or enjoyed higher name recognition, he said. But our concern is the statement in question, which has to do with statistics, not cause and effect. Fair Districts Florida got it right. We rate this claim True.

pomt-12389	In Wisconsin’s school voucher program, "two-thirds of the money" in the "tax vouchers" went to people "making more than $100,000."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/31/mark-pocan/mark-pocans-errant-claim-about-tax-breaks-wisconsi/	U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan tried to grill U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos about a program he opposes: vouchers that use taxpayer dollars to send low-income children to private schools. But while posing questions to DeVos at a House subcommittee hearing on May 24, 2017, the Madison-area Democrat made a claim that mixed up the long-standing voucher program in Wisconsin with a relatively new private school tax break that’s offered to people of all income levels. "The last expansion in Wisconsin of this program -- 75 percent of the parents who got this money, their kids already attended the schools," Pocan said, after criticizing the voucher program at length. "And two-thirds of the money that went in the tax vouchers to the folks who receive this were making more than $100,000. So, largely, this is tax policy, this isn't education policy." The $100,000 claim is in reference to a tax break for people who themselves pay to send their children to private schools, not the voucher program. The voucher program The 2013-’15 state budget made more Wisconsin children eligible for the voucher program, which dates back to 1989, when Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson and a Democratic-majority Legislature created the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program, the nation's first urban school voucher program of its kind in the country. Its aim was to improve results for poor city children in public schools by allowing them to attend private or religious schools with publicly funded vouchers. To be eligible for the vouchers -- tax dollars paid to the private schools for tuition -- families must meet income limits. For the 2017-’18 school year, the limit for a family of four is $72,900 for students in Milwaukee and Racine and $44,955 for other parts of the state. The tax credit Unlike the voucher program, there are no income limits to qualify for the tax break, which reduces the taxable income for families who send their kids to private schools. The break also was created as part of the 2013-’15 state budget. Taxpayers can subtract from their income amounts paid to private schools for tuition and mandatory student fees. For each student in kindergarten through eighth grade, the maximum deduction is $4,000; for each student in high school, the maximum is $10,000. Pocan’s office told us the congressman made his claim based on a January 2017 news article in the Wisconsin State Journal. It says that in 2015, almost $8 million of the $12 million tax cut, or two-thirds, went to tax filers making more than $100,000. That amounted to about $388 per filer. But the tax break has nothing to do with the voucher program. Our rating While criticizing Wisconsin’s school voucher program, Pocan said "two-thirds of the money" in Wisconsin’s school "tax vouchers" went to people "making more than $100,000." But a tax break Pocan alludes to -- for people who themselves pay to send their kids to private schools -- has nothing to do with Wisconsin’s voucher program, which uses tax dollars to pay for low-income children to attend private schools.

pomt-14185	"In Africa, a child dies every minute because of (malaria)."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/apr/25/tim-ziemer/malarias-toll-close-one-african-child-killed-every/	A grim statistic is circulating this World Malaria Day. USAID’s Tina Dooley-Jones, deputy mission director in Kenya, marked the occasion in Nairobi saying that "globally, malaria kills a child every two minutes." Dooley-Jones is far from the only one with that message. It plays large among malaria advocacy groups like Nothing But Nets. So it was curious to see a post in January on Medium from the head of the President’s Malaria Initiative, rear admiral Tim Ziemer, with the statement that "in Africa, a child dies every minute because of the disease." The initiative is one of the government’s largest global health efforts. It began under President George W. Bush and has been carried forward by President Barack Obama. Malaria’s toll among African children is a touchstone for many health activists, but the numbers can vary. Our colleagues at Africa Check spotted a range of statements. One organization claimed a child died every 30 seconds, another said once every two minutes, and in between was Ziemer’s figure. In this fact-check, we affirm that the correct number is closer to once every two minutes. USAID spokesman Ryan Essman told us that until fairly recently, his agency would talk about a death every one to two minutes, but now uses the two-minute time frame. "Admiral Ziemer has been working with malaria for a decade," Essman said. "He had it when he was child. Usually he uses the right number, but he might have slipped in the previous one." As a humanitarian matter, the exact death toll makes little difference. This table from the Kaiser Family Foundation, using World Health Organization data, clearly shows that Africa bears the greatest burden of malaria. WHO Region Number of countries with ongoing transmission Estimated cases (1,000s) Percentage Estimated deaths (in 1,000s) Percentage Global total 96 214,000 100% 438 100% Africa 44 188,000 88% 395 90% Americas 21 660 <1% 0.5 <1% Eastern Mediterranean 8 3,900 2% 6.8 2% Europe 3 0 0% 0 0% South-East Asia 10 20,000 9% 32 7% Western Pacific 10 1,500 <1% 3.2 <1% Africa wrestles with 90 percent of all deaths by the disease worldwide, and almost as large a percentage of active cases. Malaria is particularly lethal for pregnant women and their babies. The federal government estimates that it kills about 10,000 expectant mothers each year in Sub-Saharan Africa. Another 200,000 children will die prematurely from complications due to their mothers having bouts of malaria during pregnancy. Malaria’s death toll Our colleagues at Africa Check turned to the World Health Organization data for 2015. With huge gaps in the health care systems in many African nations, all experts agree that a precise count of malaria death is impossible. The WHO provides a range of estimates. Number of malaria deaths in children under 5 in Africa Middle estimate 292,000 Lowest estimate 212,000 Highest estimate 384,000 From that, the middle estimate shows one child dies every 1 minute 48 seconds, or close to once every two minutes. Middle estimate 1 min 48 sec Lowest estimate 2 min 28 sec Highest estimate 1 min 22 sec The U.S. government spent about $860 million this fiscal year to fight malaria. The money went for a drug that can help pregnant women and their children, but many dollars also went to insecticide-treated nets and indoor spraying to prevent people from catching the disease in the first place. Obama seeks to raise the total by about another $70 million in the last budget of his administration. There is a strong global push to eradicate malaria, and gains have been made. In the past decade and a half, the rate of new cases has fallen by about a third in Sub-Saharan Africa. Going forward, many hurdles remain. Mosquitoes can become resistant to the most common insecticides, weak health care systems in many countries make it difficult to sustain antimalaria programs, and counterfeit drugs can be as fatal as the disease itself. Our ruling Ziemer wrote that malaria kills a child in Africa each minute. His staff at USAID said that figure is off. A better estimate is that a child dies every 1 minute 48 seconds. But even that figure comes with a measure of uncertainty. The actual death rate could be higher or lower. By any estimate, malaria remains a serious threat to children in Africa. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Tim Ziemer	None	None	None	2016-04-25T12:01:44	2016-01-20	['Africa']
pomt-06901	Says state Sen. Randy Hopper, R-Fond du Lac, unlike typical taxpayers, "didn’t pay taxes"	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/26/jessica-king/wisconsin-senate-recall-race-democrat-jessica-king/	In one of the recall elections that could determine whether Democrats take control of the Wisconsin Senate, the two candidates have accused each of other personally enriching themselves while other taxpayers pay more. State Sen. Randy Hopper, R-Fond du Lac, contends in a TV ad that Democratic challenger Jessica King voted herself a 63 percent pay raise when she served on the Oshkosh Common Council. King voted against the raise, and the percentage was wrong to boot. We rated Hopper’s statement Pants on Fire. King, with a TV ad released July 12, 2011, claims middle-class folks pay their taxes but Hopper didn’t. The ad begins with what the King campaign identifies as a soldier, a nurse and a teacher. They say "politicians like Randy Hopper have been fighting for wealthy people like himself, raising middle-class taxes to give tax breaks to big corporations, but then not paying taxes. Randy Hopper, we work hard, we pay our taxes; we can’t say the same about you." As the accusation is made, the words "Senator Hopper didn’t pay taxes" appear on the screen above a footnote citing a Fond du Lac Reporter newspaper article. (The headline in the newspaper was "Hopper fends off tax questions.") The ad not only accuses Hopper of not paying taxes, while average citizens did, but suggests he did something improper or took advantage of the system. Let’s see what the record shows. When we asked King campaign spokeswoman Gillian Morris for evidence to back up the ad, she provided the October 2008 newspaper article cited in the ad. The article ran less than two weeks before Hopper defeated King, by a recount-confirmed 163 votes, to win what was then an open Senate seat in the Fox Valley area of east-central Wisconsin. Their rematch on Aug. 9, 2011, is one of nine recall elections that could determine whether Democrats take control of the Senate from Republicans, who now hold a five-seat advantage. According the 2008 article, the liberal One Wisconsin Now group obtained state Department of Revenue income tax data for Hopper and his five businesses. Since an open records request could take a week or more, and the elections are upon us, we asked One Wisconsin Now for the data they received, which was contained in a letter from the revenue department. The letter says that from 1998 through 2007, Hopper’s five businesses had no state income tax liability; and that from 1997 through 2007, Hopper personally had a liability in just one year, 2006, of $22,752. (Since then, One Wisconsin Now requested more recent state income tax data for Hopper and received a Department of Revenue letter saying Hopper had no tax liability in 2008 and 2010, and a tax liability of $27,995 in 2009. But those tax years are not part of our evaluation for this article.) Hopper, who didn’t dispute the facts in the 2008 newspaper article, was quoted as saying that in the years when he had no income tax obligation, it was because of business debt and reinvesting in some of the businesses. He also said two of the businesses run by his wife had no revenue. Hopper also said in the article he incurred the one personal income tax obligation, and paid it, because of capital gains he earned from selling one of his radio stations. It’s not unprecedented for a state lawmaker to pay no state income taxes. The same holds for other members of the public, based on what the tax laws are and allow, particularly for business owners. In September 2008, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel found that six lawmakers -- four Republicans and two Democrats -- were among a number of state officials who didn’t have a state income tax liability in either 2006 or 2007; one of the lawmakers, state Rep. Mary Williams, R-Medford, hadn’t had a state tax bill since before 2000. Tax experts interviewed for the article said those public officials were treated the same as everyone else, noting that most small-business owners show their business earnings or losses on their individual income tax returns. We also contacted Hopper’s campaign spokesman, Sean Stephenson, to see if Hopper had any additional response about his taxes. Stephenson said Hopper’s radio stations paid nearly $1 million in workers’ compensation, Social Security, property and other taxes -- but not state income taxes -- from 1998 through 2010. He also pointed out that Hopper’s name does not appear on the state’s list of delinquent taxpayers. (We checked, and his businesses aren’t on the list, either.) Stephenson didn’t provide any official documents to back up his claims about taxes Hopper and his business paid. But since King made the allegation that Hopper didn’t pay taxes, the burden is on her to prove it. So, let’s review the case she made. King claims broadly in a TV ad that Hopper, unlike typical taxpayers, "didn’t pay taxes." The records indicate that over a decade, Hopper’s businesses had no state income tax liability and he owed taxes personally in only one year. But the claim leaves an impression, without providing any evidence, that Hopper did something improper in order not to have a state income tax liability in most of the years in question. After all, this is the language included in the ad: "We work hard, we pay our taxes; we can’t say the same about you." Moreover, there is no indication that Hopper did not pay the one state income tax liability he did have. We rate King’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

A story on sciencearticle.website said four homeless men were eaten alive, a gruesome narrative accompanied by photos of large rats held by sanitation workers and lying on a table. The warnings of 40-pound rats gnawing on unconscious humans isn’t true. This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Fake text When we asked the city about it, a health department spokeswoman Carolina Rodriguez said, "The only giant mutant rat in New York City is Master Splinter, and we all know he is partial to pizza just like another famous New York City rat." She explained that most rats in the city are Norway rats, which grow between 12 to 18 inches, with 5- to 6-inch tails. At most, they weigh about a pound. According to Rodriguez, the health department has not received any reports of rat attacks. Fake Pics This article also includes three pictures, all of which are gross. The first picture shows seven huge rats, laying dead on a table. When reverse-image searched, this photograph can be traced back to a National Geographic photo gallery on giant swamp rats. Also known as nutrias, these rodents weigh about 17 pounds and have been introduced to coastal regions in the United States. In Louisiana, they’ve become so prevalent that the government will pay hunters $5 per kill in an attempt to prevent overgrazing. These rodents do not live in New York, and they are unlikely to ever make the move. A 2014 study shows that nutrias prefer warmer climates, where only a few days per year are lower than 24 degrees Fahrenheit. New York’s sewer systems certainly don’t fit the bill. The image is reposted a second time within the article, although this time altered to make it appear that it was broadcast on the news. A breaking news runner gives the image an authentic look, but the fake "5 NEWS" logo and the "smhwtfnews.com" link make it clear that the screenshot was fabricated. The third image, in which a man in a green shirt appears to be holding a giant rat, is an old internet hoax. Reverse-image searches reveal that the man is demonstrating forced perspective: the rat isn’t bigger, it’s just closer to the camera. An accompanying image, which was omitted from the giant rat article, shows the same man and the same rat, but in the proper perspective. Both the giant swamp rat and the forced perspective images have been shared widely across fake news sites to "prove" that giant rats were caught in London, Hong Kong, and other urban areas across the world. Our ruling This article alleges that four men have died after being eaten by giant-sized rats. However, the story is completely fictional. There are no mutant, man-eating rats in New York, and the pictures have been stolen from various other giant rat hoaxes over the years. We rate this claim Pants On Fire!

pomt-04943	Says Romney had the uniforms for the 2002 Winter Olympic games made in Burma.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/27/priorities-usa-action/ad-says-mitt-romney-had-olympic-uniforms-made-burm/	With the Olympics about to begin, Priorities USA Action, a super PAC aligned with President Barack Obama, released an ad that used Olympic images to attack Mitt Romney. The ad shows a beaming Romney at the Olympic opening ceremonies. As each national team enters the stadium, an announcer provides a corresponding quip. "China, home to a billion people. Thousands owe their jobs to Mitt Romney’s companies ... And Burma, where Romney had the uniforms made for the 2002 games." Olympic authorities moved swiftly to get Priorities USA Action to withdraw the ad because of unauthorized use of Olympic footage, but the ad got such widespread coverage that we are still fact-checking it. PolitiFact has assessed that claim about jobs in China and and another one about Romney creating jobs in India. Both were rated Half True. In this fact-check, we look at whether Romney had the uniforms for the 2002 winter games made in Burma. The Torch Bearer Uniforms Burma, or Myanmar, is a country that until just recently was shunned for being a repressive regime that observed no fair labor practices. Olympic games use many different uniforms -- for staffers, athletes and so forth and not all were made in Burma. But there is no question about the origins of the uniforms for the torch bearers. These were the 11,500 volunteers who relayed the Olympic torch some 13,000 miles to Salt Lake City. That’s a lot of jackets with the Salt Lake Olympic logo. The Huffington Post reported this a couple of weeks ago, but the story received coverage in 2002. The day before the winter games opened, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions sent a letter of protest to the International Olympic Committee. "No responsible organization or body should make use of products originating in Burma," the letter said. "Doing business with Burma, in effect, supports human rights abuses." The next day, according to an article in the Ottawa Citizen, the company that provided those uniforms, Marker Ltd, confirmed that the uniforms had come from a supplier in Burma. The article quotes Marker’s Olympic program managing director, Ralph Eeson saying the company is "sensitive to to human rights issues and has no reason to believe the uniforms were made under conditions that violate international law." Marker, a Salt Lake City-based sports apparel company, was a co-sponsor of the games. In May of 1999 it had agreed to provide about $20 million worth of clothing. The company was the first new sponsor for the games in about a year because of turmoil over allegations of bribery. The timing of Marker’s sponsorship might be significant. Mitt Romney had just left Bain Capital in February 1999 to takeover the floundering Salt Lake Olympic Committee. Three months after he arrived, Marker signed on. Burma’s Reputation By 2000, Burma was a pariah. In 1997, the United States barred new investments in Burma by American corporations. The military dictatorship had been sanctioned by many international bodies for using forced labor on large irrigation construction projects and violating child labor standards. "It was well-known that it was a hell hole," said Scott Nova with the Worker Rights Consortium, an agency that helps colleges and universities avoid buying from factories that abuse their workers. Nova’s group traces the roots of all those sweatshirts, T-shirts and hats that carry the college name. The Worker Rights Consortium tracks more than 1,000 companies and each of the dozens of separate items they supply. "On that entire list," Nova said, "virtually nothing came from Burma in 2000. Maybe three items out of thousands. Every responsible manufacturer was long gone from the country." That may have been true for the companies Nova’s group watched, but many American firms continued to buy from Burma. A consortium of 15 European labor and human rights groups, the Clean Clothes Campaign, reported in 2000 that U.S. clothing imports from the country nearly tripled between 1995 and 1999. Companies cited in that report included Jordache, Nautica and Adidas. In 2001, a declassified State Department memo later corroborated that report. Marker was not alone in buying from contractors in Burma. The Winter Olympics Budget The ad suggests that Romney played a direct role in ordering the uniforms from Burma, but the only source provided by Priorities USA Action was the Huffington Post article which did not make that direct connection. In assessing his possible role, it's important to note it was a large organization. The SLOC had about 2,000 paid staff. The total budget for the Salt Lake Games was about $1.3 billion. There were about 10 other sponsors like Marker, plus about another 15 firms with marketing contracts. The list included companies such as Coca-Cola, Home Depot, and Gateway Computers. Marker’s sponsorship represented less than 1 percent of the total budget. We have asked the US Olympic Committee if the SLOC used any procurement guidelines and did not hear back. A recent Salt Lake Tribune article about the SLOC archives suggests that detailed information might no longer exist. Many internal memos were destroyed after the games ended. Our Ruling The ad from Priorities USA Action says Romney had the Olympic uniforms made in Burma. The torch bearer uniforms, perhaps more than 11,000 of them, were made in Burma, but that’s not all the uniforms used in the games, particularly for the athletes, as the visuals in the ad suggest. And we've seen insufficient evidence to directly link the torch bearer uniforms to Romney. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-11599	"Since we passed tax cuts, over 3 million workers have gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/trump-says-tax-bill-led-bonuses-three-million-work/	President Donald Trump said the tax bill passed in December has already led to millions of workers getting bonuses. "Since we passed tax cuts, over 3 million workers have gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars," Trump said during the State of the Union Jan. 30. In December, Trump signed a bill into law that lowered the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent. Trump’s numbers echo the finding of a conservative group that had compiled company announcements about bonuses, but the majority of companies’ bonuses appeared to be $1,000 or less, not the "thousands and thousands" Trump said. Companies announcing bonuses Trump’s numbers match a compilation by Americans for Tax Reform, a group started by anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist. Americans for Tax Reform advocates against tax increases and supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that Trump signed into law in December. Americans for Tax Reform used company press releases and media reports to compile a list of announced bonuses or other financial benefits. The group found that as of the day of Trump’s State of the Union speech, at least 3 million Americans are receiving special tax reform bonuses. American Airlines, FedEx, Home Depot, Nationwide Insurance, Walmart and Walt Disney Company were among the companies that announced bonuses. In total, at least 286 companies have announced wage and salary increases, bonuses, or 401(k) match increases, or in the case of public utility companies, lower rates. Trump said that "many" of the bonuses are "thousands of dollars per worker." But it appears that the majority of the company announcements were for bonuses of $1,000 or less. The list includes about nine companies that announced bonuses of $2,000, including Fiat Chrysler’s 60,000 employees. Some companies were very clear about who deserves credit for the bonus. The Hammock Source in North Carolina was one of many companies to announce employee bonuses following the passage of the tax bill. The company handed out the bonuses in envelopes that said, "Trump Republican tax reform bonus." "We at The Hammock Source want to continue to invest in the people that have made our business successful," CEO Walter Perkins III said in a press release Jan. 25. "President Trump’s tax cuts will provide the funds to make this desire a reality. We hope that other business will follow our lead and give back to their employees as well." The Americans for Tax Reform analysis was only of recent bonus announcements and did not include a historical comparison to determine how many of these companies gave bonuses in recent years. It’s not unusual for many companies to give bonuses. Some caveats Experts say that Trump’s claim is lacking important context. The bonuses only affect a small percentage of American workers. Willis Towers Watson, a global human resources consulting firm, surveyed 333 large and midsize employers in January to ask about their plans related to the tax bill. The survey showed that about 6 percent said they provided profit sharing or a bonus in 2017 and 5 percent planned to do so in 2018, while 10 percent were considering it. A slightly smaller number had given wage increases or planned to do so. A Reuters/Ipsos poll showed 2 percent of U.S. adults said they had gotten a raise, bonus or other additional benefits due to the tax law. The poll was conducted of 5,254 adults Jan. 12-23. Economists say it will take more time to fully assess the economic impact of the tax reform bill. Labor trend experts said that amid a tightening labor market and low unemployment, companies have been trying to use different compensation and rewards to attract and retain top talent. Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor, told PolitiFact that one-time bonuses are a low-risk way for companies to pass on some expected benefits of the tax bill to workers without being on the hook for sustained higher base wages. "In this hiring environment, plans for pay increases are likely to have already been in the works, and the passage of the recent tax bill may simply have been the occasion for announcement rather than the cause," he said. The news coverage following the new tax policy may have led some employers to announce pay or benefit changes in an effort to stay ahead of competitors. "This is not to say the tax bill hasn’t affected recent decisions to raise wages at all, but the full impact of tax reform on the job market is something that we’ll only know in time – years or even a decade from now," Chamberlain said. Brian Kropp, HR practice leader at Gartner, an information technology research and advisory company, told PolitiFact that companies have been trying to use different compensation and rewards to attract and retain top talent. "While, it is true that some companies have used the tax cut to provide bonuses for employees, the majority of companies had already been increasing, or planning to increase rewards, well before the tax cut," he said. Companies announcing bonuses by the end of 2017 do get a tax advantage of claiming a deduction in that tax year, Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center co-director Eric Toder told PolitiFact. "A payment in 2017 would be deductible at a 35 percent rate; the same payment in 2018 would be deductible only at the new 21 percent rate," Toder said. "My understanding is companies would only have had to announce the bonus by the end of 2017 to claim the deduction in tax year 2017; they would not literally have had to send out the checks." Any surge in bonus payments now probably says little or nothing about how the corporate tax cuts will affect wages in the long-run, Toder said. Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute who favored the corporate tax changes in the bill, said that the response from corporations was a surprise. "Taxes matter to businesses, and they respond," he said. However, bonuses are a short-term response to the tax bill, which is less important than potential long-term changes, such as whether corporations will build new factories or purchase more machinery. Our ruling Trump said, "Since we passed tax cuts, over 3 million workers have gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars." Americans for Tax Reform, a group that supported the tax reform bill, found that at least 3 million Americans are receiving bonuses that the companies said were related to passage of the tax bill, based on company press releases and news reports. However, economists and labor experts say it will take years to fully assess the economic impact of the tax bill. In this tight labor market, it’s possible that some businesses were already planning to give out bonuses or other financial incentives to retain workers. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09866	A loophole "still exists which allows members of Congress and high-powered executive branch appointees to exploit 'insider' knowledge of the financial industry in order to turn personal profit."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/06/public-citizen/public-citizen-gets-it-right-about-insider-trading/	Little-known fact: Members of Congress are exempt from rules that prevent insider trading. Or so says the left-leaning advocacy group Public Citizen in a July 10, 2009, e-mail sent to supporters. "The federal government has finally got the message that it’s time for stronger oversight of Wall Street and the financial services sector. It’s also time to put an end to secret spending and insider trading," the e-mail reads. "A dangerous legal loophole still exists which allows members of Congress and high-powered executive branch appointees to exploit 'insider' knowledge of the financial industry in order to turn personal profit." It goes on to describe an army of lobbyists and traders who "haunt the halls of Congress seeking insider tips from staff — known as 'political intelligence consultants'" who may also use the confidential information. The e-mail asks supporters to write their representatives to support the Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, a bill sponsored by Reps. Louise Slaughter of New York and Brian Baird of Washington, that would ban insider trading by lawmakers, members of the executive branch and staff, and require that they publicly disclose stock trades of more than $1,000 within 90 days. It would also require the "political intelligence consultants" to register as lobbyists in both chambers of Congress. We hadn't heard the allegation that members of Congress had a leg up for insider trading and wondered if it's true. Thomas Newkirk, a partner with the law firm Jenner and Block, told us that indeed there's some uncertainty about how insider trading rules impact members of Congress and their staff. For example, in 2001, a financial consultant meeting with the Treasury Department learned that the department planned to kill off the 30-year bond. In turn, the consultant tipped off traders at Goldman Sachs who proceeded to use that information to make the firm lots of money. It was considered insider trading because the consultant knew he was not supposed to release the information, Newkirk said. Federal regulators settled with Goldman Sachs and the consultant for about $10.3 million in September 2003. But with members of Congress, it's different. Unless lawmakers have some express confidentiality agreement — whether it's in writing or in word — they can do whatever they want with the information they obtain on Capitol Hill, Newkirk said. Bruce Carton, a former Senior Counsel with the SEC's enforcement division and current editor of Securities Docket, agreed there is uncertainty about the rules. "Insider trading depends on some kind of duty. You can steal information, but unless you have some sort of duty of confidentiality to it, you're not going to be held liable," Carton said. Right now, there is no duty of confidentiality for Congress, their staff or executive branch employees, he said. "It may be unethical, and it may be unseemly, but it's not illegal," Carton said. So yes, it seems there is a way for members of Congress to engage in insider trading. Whether they are actually doing it is another story. So far, there are no specific examples of lawmakers engaging in "secret spending and insider trading," as the e-mail indicates. But for its factual claim, we give Public Citizen a True.

pomt-01482	This Congress "adjourned earliest of any time in congressional history before an election."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/28/laura-ingraham/current-congress-adjourned-earlier-election-year-a/	A couple of hefty issues await congressional action. There’s the matter of replacing departing Attorney General Eric Holder, and even more pressing, authorizing or rejecting America’s attacks on the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq where airstrikes are ongoing. But both items are for the moment on hold until lawmakers get back Nov. 12. Their last official day of business was Sept. 19. Conservative radio show host Laura Ingraham was particularly peeved by Congress’ absence as the American military returns to war in the Middle East. Ingraham focused on the constitutional role Congress has in declaring war. "We should have civilian authorization, civilian leadership authorization for this war, otherwise we're going to be in for real trouble down the road," Ingraham said. Moments earlier, she said: "The Congress adjourned earliest of any time in Congressional history before an election." We thought we’d check whether taking a long break in September and October is as record-setting as Ingraham asserted. She’s incorrect, but before we get to the details, we need to clarify a couple of terms. When we talk about a session of Congress, we mean the stretch that starts in January and generally ends in December. According the Congressional Research Service, "A session begins when the chamber convenes and ends when it adjourns. A recess, by contrast, does not terminate a session, but only suspends it temporarily." Lawmakers and pundits often refer to a recess as an adjournment. Right now, technically Congress is in recess. The Congressional Research Service acknowledged that the informal use of the words doesn’t always align with their formal meaning. The House of Representatives has a table with the schedule of every session of Congress going back to 1789. To check Ingraham’s claim, we need only go back as far as 1960. That year, Congress ended its session for the year and adjourned on Sept. 1. That was a full adjournment (not just a recess) and it came 18 days sooner than this year’s extended recess. For the record, 1960 was the year that Republican Richard Nixon faced Democrat John F. Kennedy. Interestingly, Sept. 1 was not particularly early for the times. In 1959, Congress adjourned for the year Sept. 15. In 1958, Congress adjourned Aug. 24. In 1956, it was July 27. We note that the last two in that list were election years. So Ingraham is wrong, but we should note similar-sounding claims Sunday that are accurate. On Fox News Sunday, Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barasso said, "This is the earliest Congress has adjourned in over 50 years." On CBS’ Face the Nation, Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine called it "the second-earliest recess before a midterm since 1960." Both senators are correct (if you excuse Barrasso’s use of adjourn instead of recess). For Barrasso, "over 50 years," takes us back to any year up to 1963, or 51 years ago. The record shows that since 1963, Congress often has taken short breaks in September, given lawmakers several weeks in October to campaign in election years, and even closed the books for the year in October. But an extended break from mid September to mid November has not occurred. Kaine’s claim is spot on. Our ruling Ingraham said Congress had adjourned earlier this year than in any time in "Congressional history before an election." Technically, Congress is in recess and hasn’t adjourned. But setting that aside, the record shows that in 1960, Congress adjourned and ended its session Sept. 1 -- more than two weeks before the current Congress took its recess. We rate the claim False.

pomt-12037	"We've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/15/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-35-corporate-tax-rate-keeps-3-trillion-t/	When U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan met with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel staff on Sept. 1, 2017, an editor mentioned major tax cuts adopted under Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1981. At first, Ryan joked around. "The music was bad in those days, and the tax laws were as well," he replied, chuckling. "So, I think -- I’m not a big ‘80s music guy; I’m more of a ‘70s guy." But the 47-year-old Janesville Republican quickly got serious. Arguing that U.S. taxes are stopping U.S.-based multinational corporations from bringing giant sums of money to America, he stated: We've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws. Ryan has made essentially the same claim a number of times, including on Milwaukee television, on CNBC, on Twitter and to the New York Times. So, do U.S. tax laws essentially prevent $3 trillion being held overseas from being brought to this country? Keep the word repatriate in mind. Taxing foreign earnings The object of Ryan’s criticism is the U.S. corporate tax rate. At 35 percent, as we reported in a Donald Trump fact check during the 2016 presidential campaign, it is among the highest in the world -- though it’s worth noting that, after deductions, companies typically pay an "effective" rate that can be much lower. (Trump, by the way, pledged during the presidential campaign to reduce the rate to 15 percent. That promise has been rated as In the Works on PolitiFact National’s Trump-O-Meter.) As for the focus of Ryan’s claim, he’s talking about U.S.-based multinational corporations. More specifically, the foreign-earned profits of those companies. Here’s an example of how the taxation works: If the company earns income in a country with a 20 percent corporate tax rate, it would pay that 20 percent tax immediately to that country. If that money is then repatriated -- that is, brought back to the company’s U.S. headquarters -- the company would pay an additional 15 percent to the U.S. government. (In other words, the U.S. tax rate of 35 percent minus the 20 percent already paid to the foreign country.) So, as long as the profits stay parked overseas, there is no U.S. tax on it. Now to the specifics of Ryan’s claim. The $3 trillion figure To back up Ryan’s statement, his office cited an April 2017 CNBC news article that said American companies are holding about $2.6 trillion in overseas earnings, and the figure has been growing. That’s the latest estimate by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, for 2015, although an estimate done in July 2017 for PolitiFact National put the figure at $2.8 trillion. So, Ryan’s claim of about $3 trillion is reasonable. It’s worth noting that the figure has been rising. In fact, considering only the Russell 1000 index of large companies, the amount of parked cash overseas has more than doubled since 2008, as shown in a July 2017 report by the Massachusetts research firm Audit Analytics: Year Amount of foreign-earned profits by U.S.-based companies kept overseas 2008 $1.09 trillion 2009 $1.19 trillion 2010 $1.36 trillion 2011 $1.63 trillion 2012 $1.89 trillion 2013 $2.12 trillion 2014 $2.3 trillion 2015 $2.43 trillion 2016 $2.62 trillion Now to the rest of Ryan’s claim. ‘Trapped’ and ‘basically can’t come back’ Ryan asserts that the money is "trapped overseas" and "basically can’t come back" because of U.S. tax laws To be sure, a substantial amount of foreign profits are repatriated each year. But Ryan didn’t invent the term "trapped cash." In fact, academics for years have referred to it as a commonly used term to describe the growing amount of cash held by U.S. multinationals overseas to avoid, or at least defer, paying the 35 percent U.S. tax rate. Ryan’s claim is also backed by September 2017 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan organization in Massachusetts. The paper found a dramatic increase in U.S. corporations holding onto cash; that the cash is concentrated in foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations; and that it is explained by low foreign tax rates. News articles also have reported on the phenomenon. In August 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook said of his company’s profits parked offshore: "We’re not going to bring it back until there’s a fair rate. There’s no debate about it." Apple is second to Microsoft in the amount of cash parked overseas, according to Audit Analytics. And as the San Jose Mercury News reported in May 2017, the tax is such a deterrent that even though Apple was sitting on $240 billion in overseas cash, it has continued to borrow money. The reason: The borrowing cost Apple 4 percent or less, far below the 35 percent tax that would be paid for repatriating the overseas cash. One more point before we close: The companies would like to repatriate the money because bringing it back to the parent company enables them to do things such as paying dividends, doing stock buybacks and investing in U.S. operations. Several academic experts told us that some of the overseas money, while not repatriated directly back to the companies’ U.S. headquarters, is invested in U.S. securities. That doesn’t trigger the 35 percent tax. Our rating Ryan says: "We've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws." To avoid a 35 percent U.S. tax, U.S.-based multinational companies have opted not to "repatriate" roughly $3 trillion of their foreign profits, a figure that is growing. That is, they don’t bring the money back to their U.S. headquarters, where it can be used for things such as dividend payments or investments in their domestic operations. But the overseas profits aren’t literally trapped and indeed some foreign-earned profits are repatriated, though they are subject to the 35 percent tax.

pomt-01810	Under Gov. Tom Corbett, "Pennsylvania ranks 49th in job creation."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/22/fresh-start-pa/democratic-group-says-pennsylvania-49th-job-creati/	Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, remains one of the most vulnerable incumbent governors running this year. Elected to his first term in 2010, Corbett now trails Democratic challenger Tom Wolf by more than 20 points in most recent polls. Despite Wolf’s lead, pro-Democratic groups are leaving nothing to chance. One of these is Fresh Start PA, a political action committee running parallel to the state Democratic Party. It’s headed by Katie McGinty, one of the Democratic primary challengers Wolf defeated, and its senior strategist is veteran Pennsylvania Democratic consultant Mike Mikus. Here’s the text of the ad released on July 15: "It's a shame what Tom Corbett has done to Pennsylvania: huge deficits, while he's given tax breaks to big corporations. He's let oil and gas companies off the hook. Under Corbett, we're the only state in the country who doesn't charge an extraction tax. Corbett's cut a billion dollars from our schools, forcing communities to raise property taxes. And Pennsylvania ranks 49th in job creation. Tom Corbett: why would we give him four more years?" There are a lot of claims here, but the one we’re going to check is that under Corbett, "Pennsylvania ranks 49th in job creation." The source of the statistic isn’t cited within the ad, but when we asked Mikus, he said it came from data compiled by the Keystone Research Center, a think tank whose board includes many labor-union officials and is often described as liberal-leaning. Because the data from the group’s report comes from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, we were able to recalculate it ourselves. We looked at the change in total, seasonally adjusted, non-farm employment in the 50 states between January 2011, when Corbett took office, and June 2014, the most recent month for which data is available. We found that Pennsylvania gained a net 124,800 jobs during that period -- an increase of 2.2 percent. Measuring by percentage increase, that ranked Pennsylvania 47th in the nation. The only states with a smaller increase were New Mexico (1 percent), Alaska (1.58 percent) and Arkansas (1.91 percent). The reason for the discrepancy between 49th (as the ad said) and 47th (what we found) is that the Keystone Research Center report used data only through April 2014, while we used it through June 2014. We can see why Fresh Start PA cited a pre-existing report for their data, but we figured it was better to use the most current data available during the ad’s run. Billy Pitman, a spokesman for the Corbett campaign, said the ad’s statistic is "misleading," noting that the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.1 percent in January 2011, when he took office, to 5.6 percent now. But Mikus counters that Corbett was the one who said that making Pennsylvania No. 1 in job creation was one of his goals, on at least two occasions (video here and here). One piece of context worth noting is that states that suffered relatively modest job losses during the downturn would be expected to experience a less robust recovery, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. During the recession and immediate post-recession years of 2008 to 2010, Pennsylvania lost less ground in employment than most states. Finally economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a limited impact on a state's economy. States are tied to larger economic forces, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly. Corbett's most direct impact on jobs would presumably have come in government employment. Since he took office, state and local government employment fell by 55,000, or 7 percent of the government work force. In fact, if government employment had remained stable over that period, total nonfarm employment would have been 44 percent higher than it turned out to be. Either way, the ad offered a specific statistic, and it’s pretty close. Whether the state ranks 49th or 47th in the nation, the ad raises a fair point that job growth in Pennsylvania has lagged that of most other states since January 2011. Another sign of the weak employment picture: The number of payroll jobs in the state isn’t even back to where it was at the start of the recession. Our ruling Fresh Start PA said that under Corbett, "Pennsylvania ranks 49th in job creation." We looked at the most current numbers and found the state is now 47th rather than 49th -- but even at 47th, Pennsylvania is clearly among the weakest states in job creation since the start of 2011. It’s important to note that Corbett, like all governors, has a limited influence on the economic performance of his state. Still, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-02403	"The president won the youth vote 3 to 1, but his numbers have dropped 20, 30 percent among the youth."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/09/rand-paul/sen-paul-says-obama-lost-youth-support/	Talk of Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., as a 2016 presidential candidate picked up steam over the weekend after he bested other potential party nominees in a Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll, pulling in support from 31 percent of attendees who voted. On Fox News Sunday, he criticized President Barack Obama’s inability to retain support among young voters, suggesting that Republicans such as himself could pick up more of the demographic’s support. "The president won the youth vote three to one, but his numbers have dropped 20, 30 percent among the youth," Paul said. "Really, the public at large is less trusting of this president, but the youth in particular have lost faith in this president. And so I think there’s a real opportunity for Republicans who do believe in the Fourth Amendment to grow our party by attracting young people and bring that energy into our party." Let’s take a look at how Obama has fared with young voters. According to 2008 exit polls, Obama took home 66 percent of the youth vote, which includes voters aged 18 to 29. In 2012, that number decreased to 60 percent, still a commanding majority of the demographic. That means the 3 to 1 ratio Paul cited is off base. Yes, Obama easily won the youth vote in both races. But he won it by roughly a 2 to 1 ratio in 2008 and a 3 to 2 ratio in 2012. Paul’s office specified that he was referring to a difference in percentage points when we cited a 20 to 30 percent drop in Obama’s youth support, but his statement reads like he was referring to percent change. We’ll crunch the numbers both ways. To gauge Obama’s recent approval ratings among young voters, Paul’s spokesman pointed us to a December 2013 report from the Harvard University Institute of Politics. Every six months, the nonpartisan institute surveys about 2,000 18- to 29-year-olds on political issues. Harvard reported that in surveys conducted in October and November 2013, 41 percent of young voters approved of Obama’s performance as president, while 54 percent disapproved. Participants answered right as the Affordable Care Act online marketplaces went through a rocky rollout. That’s the lowest approval rating the institute charted since the start of his presidency, a 14-percentage-point drop from November 2009. As a percentage of his support, it’s just over a 20 percent drop. We also looked at approval ratings reported by Gallup, a nonpartisan polling group. When Obama first took office in 2009, three-quarters of young voters polled approved of him. Although the percentage ebbs and flows from week to week, the general trend points downward. In 2014, the approval rating for the same demographic has hovered just over 40 percent. It’s a significant drop in Obama support from young voters, as Paul pointed out. Using Gallup’s numbers for the week of Feb. 24, the most recently reported, we get a decrease of 32 percentage points. That means that relative to his starting point, he suffered a 40-percent drop. That said, Democrats still have a stronger grip on young voters than Republicans. According to the Harvard survey, 33 percent of young voters considered themselves Democrats, compared with 24 percent Republicans and 44 percent independents. Our ruling Paul said, "The president won the youth vote three to one, but his numbers have dropped 20, 30 percent among the youth." Obama won the youth vote in both elections, but the ratios were smaller than 2 to 1, so Paul’s math is off. Approval ratings among young voters have indeed dropped since 2009, by as much as Paul said or more when we consider percent change. Overall, it’s clear that Obama is falling in favorability with young voters. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2014-03-09T16:53:59	2014-03-09	['None']

pomt-00184	Says Andrew Gillum "oversaw a 52 percent increase in murder."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/oct/19/florida-strong/florida-pac-video-wrongly-blames-andrew-gillum-tal/	Set to the creepy voice of Gollum from The Lord of the Rings, a Facebook video blames Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum for a murder spike in his city. "Andrew Gillum," says the narrator of the video, produced by the conservative Florida Strong PAC. "He is a failed mayor ..." The ad then levels a series of charges about his record, including that he "oversaw a 52 percent increase in murder." (Yes, the PAC was having some fun with the fact that Gillum’s name is similar to Gollum while bringing up violent crime.) Gillum and Republican Ron DeSantis have been arguing over the city’s record on crime for months. Did Gillum oversee a 52 percent increase in city murders? There's a way to get to that number, but it isn't very honest. The PAC cherry-picked data that made the city sound like a growing hotbed for murder. In reality, the number of murders during Gillum’s tenure as mayor has swung little, ranging from 11 to 17 deaths in four years. Further, the ad goes too far to pin the responsibility on Gillum. Tallahassee has a weak mayor form of government, which means Gillum is just one vote on the commission. Tallahassee’s murder rate Florida Strong PAC chairman Stafford Jones told PolitiFact that he gleaned the information about the city’s murder rate from a Republican Party of Florida Facebook post. The party drew data from Tallahassee Reports, a website critical of city government run by former city commission candidate Steve Stewart. Tallahassee Reports looked at data reported by the city’s police department to the state for the annual FBI reports. The data covers Gillum’s political tenure; he was elected to the city commission in 2003 and became mayor in late 2014. The website found that from 2002 to 2009 the average murder rate per 100,000 citizens in Tallahassee was 4.6. Then, from 2010 to 2017, the average murder rate increased to 7 murders per 100,000 citizens. The increase equals 52 percent. But if we look at the sheer number of murders we see that the number of murders ranges from a low of four deaths in 2003 to a high of 17 in 2017. If we look just at Gillum's mayoral tenure, the range was between 11 and 17 murders. We sent the Tallahassee Reports data to Brian Stults, a criminologist at Florida State University. "There is nothing wrong with the math, nor anything inherently wrong with the approach," he said. "It just cherry-picks a single number that happens to be the most volatile in most places." He said small numbers must be viewed with caution and that it requires taking a broader look at trends. "In both periods, the risk of being murdered is very, very low," Stults said. "Small random fluctuations from year to year can lead to dramatic changes in the murder rate that are not as substantial as they may seem." Stults created his own spreadsheet using FDLE data showing crime and crime rate data in Tallahassee. He, too, found spikes in the murder rate, though he noted that the size of the increase depended upon the methodology used. DeSantis has cited an even higher figure when he tweeted that "the murder rate increased 83 percent." That’s a reference to an increase in murders in Leon County from 12 in 2016 to 22 in 2017. A mayor isn’t to blame Several criminology experts said that the data about the murder rate in isolation doesn’t tell us much about murders, or more broadly, crime about the city. Experts also generally warn against blaming a mayor for the crime rate (or the inverse, giving a mayor credit for a drop in crime). Crime is influenced by local characteristics beyond a mayor’s control, such as poverty rates and the concentration of the youth population. A murder rate alone doesn’t account for shifts in the demographic makeup of the population that may affect the murder rate, said Florida State University criminologist William D. Bales. "Blaming changes in the murder rate, or any other type of crime, over time in a community on one single person is fallacious," he said. The number of murders alone doesn’t tell us anything about how many suspects murdered strangers compared to acquaintances or people they know well, University of Florida professor Jodi Lane said. Generally, people are more likely to be killed by someone they know, which is much more difficult for a politician to affect. Stults said that that while citizens are often quite concerned about the murder rate since it is such a serious form of victimization, the likelihood of being murdered in Tallahassee is extremely low. Our ruling A video by Florida Strong says Gillum "oversaw a 52 percent increase in murder." This attack is hollow. The attack stems from data showing that the murder rate increased from 4.6 per 100,000 residents between 2002-09 — when Gillum was on the city commission — to 7 per 100,000 residents between 2010-17, when Gillum was on the commission and then became mayor. The math works out to 52 percent. Highlighting this number with no context is a scare tactic. The annual numbers of murders are small, where any increase can lead to a large rate spike. By stating that Gillum "oversaw" that murder increase suggests that he is to blame when in fact he is one of a handful of votes on the commission. Crime is influenced by factors beyond a mayor’s control. We rate this statement Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Florida Strong	None	None	None	2018-10-19T16:49:31	2018-10-17	['None']

Wade charge against John McCain seems to be the result of a verbal lapse eight years ago by the notably anti-abortion McCain. McCain had answered written questionnaires saying he opposed Roe v. Wade, but when the San Francisco Chronicle and CNN asked him about it in late 1999, McCain said, "I'd love to see a point where it (the court ruling) is irrelevant, and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary. But certainly in the short-term, or even the long-term, I would not support repeal of Roe vs. Wade, which would then force X number of women in America to (undergo) illegal and dangerous operations." McCain aides almost immediately started backpedaling from McCain's words, noting that McCain misspoke when he used the phrase "even in the long term." McCain said in an interview a few months later, "I clearly misspoke there. I'm a person who's made mistakes in this campaign, and I'll continue to make mistakes. My voting record is clear, of 17 years of pro-life. I continue to hold that position, and I … continue to believe that Roe vs. Wade was a very flawed decision, as in the opinion of most experts."

pomt-04254	Says the state of Texas rates as "unacceptable" almost 500 of the state's 8,000 public schools.	true	/texas/statements/2012/nov/14/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-says-almost-500-8000-texas-public-scho/	State Sen. Dan Patrick says so many Texas schools lag that lawmakers should widen school choices, feeding speculation that he will champion changes helping students transfer to private schools. The Houston Republican, chairman of the Senate Education Committee, has not spelled out a proposal. But he asked a Democratic colleague, Sen. Kirk Watson of Austin, to join his cause during a Nov. 8, 2012, joint public interview with the Texas Tribune. Patrick said: "I am willing to join you and do whatever it takes to give people an opportunity to succeed. But I need the Democrats also to join me and not draw a line in the sand, that money is the only thing that’s going to turn a school around. "If a student is in a failing school through no fault of their own — we have 8,000 campuses in Texas, almost 500 campuses are rated unacceptable — it should be unacceptable to every Republican, every Democrat in the state, every voter in the state, to say to a child you’re going to succeed even though we’re forcing you to go to a failing school," Patrick said. Watson replied that he would read Patrick’s plan when it is finalized. And are nearly 500 of 8,000 Texas public schools rated unacceptable? Seems so. In 2011, according to information posted online by the Texas Education Agency, 496 of 8,526 Texas campuses (5.8 percent) were rated academically unacceptable by the state education agency. No campus or district accountability ratings were issued in 2012; the agency says a revised system is intended to tie ratings to indicators including results on the student exams being phased in, the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness. So, Patrick nailed the number of campuses rated unacceptable while slightly understating the total number of campuses. According to an agency chart showing the 2011 figures, the nearly 6 percent of campuses marked as unacceptable in 2011 greatly exceeded comparable counts for previous years. From 2004 through 2010, the previous highest number of "unacceptable" campuses was 267 of 7,956 campuses, or 3.4 percent, in 2006, the chart indicates In 2010, it says, 84 of 8,435 campuses (1 percent) drew the dismal rating. According to news accounts including a July 30, 2011, article in the Austin American-Statesman, the five-fold increase in academically unacceptable campuses from 2010 to 2011 swept in several Austin middle schools and LBJ High School. And why the statewide surge? School administrators attributed it to changes in passing standards for the then-prevalent state test, the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills, the Statesman reported. The state also required a larger share of students to pass the TAKS than before and took into account more scores from special-education students, the story says. State education officials also had decided to drop a performance measure that kept some schools from being low-rated. A Houston Chronicle news story published the same day quoted an education agency spokeswoman, Debbie Ratcliffe, as saying the plunge in ratings was largely due to the state no longer using a statistical measure that gave credit for failing test scores if the students were on track to pass in coming years. "It's very important for parents to remember that the standards substantially increased this year," Ratcliffe said. In the Houston school district, the Chronicle reported, state-determined "unacceptable" campuses more than tripled to 25 — or 9 percent of its rated schools. The Dallas district experienced more than a doubling in campuses rated as unacceptable, going from 14 to 33, according to a Dallas Morning News article posted online July 29, 2011. By email, Graves told us the Texas Performance Measure not used for the 2011 ratings had given schools and districts credit for making progress, even if insufficient students reached required passing levels on the TAKS. The Morning News story quotes Robert Scott, then the state’s education commissioner, as saying his April 2011 decision to discontinue the performance factor meant there "will no longer be any allegations that we are pumping up the numbers. The numbers are real this year." Next, we wondered how each school drew its low rating. Of the campuses rated academically unacceptable, the agency says in a 2011 highlights summary, 479 experienced poor performance on the TAKS alone with remaining campuses getting the rating mostly due to a combination of factors. Ratcliffe emailed us an agency chart indicating that 159 campuses were rated unacceptable for student performance on the math TAKS alone. The next-most frequent reason, for 81 campuses getting the rating, was too many students failing the state’s math and science tests. The chart lists 29 other reasons for one campus or more being rated unacceptable. By phone, Ratcliffe told us that a large, diverse high school can be rated academically unacceptable if enough students fail to meet state expectations across any of more than 30 sub-categories ranging from different subject-matter tests to completion, graduation or dropout rates across sub-groups of students broken out by race or whether they come from low-income families. For instance: Austin’s LBJ High drew its unacceptable rating because not enough African American students passed the math TAKS, according to a state posting. Some 144 of 260 African American students, or 55 percent, met the math standard, according to the post. By our calculation, if 15 additional African American students had passed that test, the school would have been rated academically acceptable. Finally, there is at least one other way of gauging progress in individual schools. In August 2012, the state announced that about half of all Texas campuses statewide failed to meet federal standards based on the No Child Left Behind Act, as the Statesman said in an Aug. 9, 2012, news article. More Austin-area schools than ever also missed the mark because of tougher passing standards, the Statesman said. Our ruling Patrick’s claim, that almost 500 of the state’s 8,000 campuses are rated unacceptable, reflects the 2011 Texas ratings--and fresh ratings aren’t expected until 2013. We rate the statement as True.	None	Dan Patrick	None	None	None	2012-11-14T12:22:41	2012-11-08	['Texas']
pomt-07257	On whether judges should be allowed to place children with gay couples who wish to adopt.	half flip	/virginia/statements/2011/may/27/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-unmarried-couples-should-be-allowed/	Tim Kaine’s position on state adoption laws was well known when he was elected governor in 2005. Kaine, then lieutenant governor, said he favored the laws on the book, which allowed both heterosexual married couples and single people -- regardless of sexual orientation -- to adopt. The Democrat said he didn’t think unmarried couples, gay or straight, should be allowed to adopt. His opponent, Republican Jerry Kilgore, opposed any adoption by homosexual individuals. Kaine said then the best interest of a child should always be the ultimate consideration in adoption cases. He said adoption by unmarried couples was a bad idea because of possible disputes over the child "if the relationship breaks up." His position backed a state policy that eliminates gay couples from adopting because Virginia has never recognized same-sex marriages. Kaine said in 2005 that he did not support civil unions between homosexuals. Let’s flash forward to 2011. In April, Kaine announced his 2012 candidacy for the U.S. Senate and the state’s Board of Social Services rejected a measure that would have banned private adoption groups, such as religious charities, from discriminating against prospective parents on the basis of sexual orientation. In mid-May, Kaine told The Washington Post that he still thinks all adoption decisions should be made in a child’s best interest. But he said if a judge thinks adoption by an unmarried couple -- gay or straight -- meets that standard, then the couple should be allowed to complete the adoption. "I think the best interest of the child is a pretty hard standard to argue with and I think that ought to be the standard,’’ said Kaine, the former governor who is now a candidate in the Democratic Senate primary. Brandi Hoffine, Kaine’s campaign press secretary, told us her boss’s stance really hasn’t changed. "Governor Kaine's position has always been that judges should be empowered to do whatever is in the best interest of the child," she said. Kaine’s overall position may not have changed, but the details have. He now thinks judges should be empowered to allow unmarried couples to adopt children. In 2005, he opposed letting unmarried couples to adopt. Kaine has stopped short of urging the General Assembly to revamp laws so that unmarried couples could adopt. And his campaign for the U.S. Senate next year promises to focus on federal issues -- not state adoption laws, which he would have no control over if he is elected. But Kaine’s position has evolved.

abbc-00225	In the midst of a tax cut bidding war ahead of the federal election, debate recently turned to the question of whether the Turnbull Government's tax package is fair — not only to lower and middle-income earners, but also to women.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-01/fact-check-tax-cuts-women/9989858	Ms O'Dwyer's claim is misleading. While it is accurate to say 86 per cent of female taxpayers have a taxable income of $90,000 or less, the argument that this is where the Government's "tax relief" is "focused" is problematic. Only the first tranche of measures, beginning this financial year, favour people with taxable incomes of $90,000 or less. It is, however, important to point out that very low-income earners do not benefit because they pay little or no tax (moreover, a greater proportion of these very low wage earners are women). Meanwhile, the second and third stages of the tax plan, beginning July 1, 2022 and July 1, 2024, unambiguously favour people on higher incomes. This holds using several measures to gauge the meaning of "focus", including the dollar value of the tax relief provided to different income groups; the share of the cost of the package apportioned to different income groups; the share of the tax burden carried by different income groups before and after the introduction of the tax package; and, the impact of the package on disposable incomes for different income groups. Fact Check does not make a judgment about the fairness or otherwise of the tax package. Nor does it make a judgment about the affordability of the plan; nor the Government's spending priorities. What is clear, however, is that only the first stage of the tax plan is focused on people with annual incomes up to $90,000. It is possible that, in using the word "focused", Ms O'Dwyer meant the group of taxpayers earning up to $90,000 were being prioritised by receiving the first tranche of tax relief. However, she did not make this clear. Taken in its entirety, over seven years, the bulk of the benefits of the plan will flow to people earning more than $90,000 and, at the end of this period, those earning more than $90,000 will carry a smaller share of the overall tax burden. A clear majority of these taxpayers are men.

pomt-11841	"Teachers spend $1.6 BILLION per year on school supplies. The Republican tax bill ELIMINATES their ability to deduct those expenses."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/07/dianne-feinstein/closer-look-classroom-expenses-deduction-teachers-/	As congressional Republicans tout the benefits of their party’s tax proposal, Democratic lawmakers are trying to pick the bill apart, provision by provision. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., took aim at one specific element of the bill that is of interest to many K-12 teachers. "Teachers spend $1.6 BILLION per year on school supplies. The Republican tax bill ELIMINATES their ability to deduct those expenses," Feinstein tweeted on Nov. 6. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com She’s referring to a provision in the tax code that allows teachers to deduct eligible, unreimbursed classroom spending up to $250. The provision was expanded and made permanent in December 2015. The tax bill unveiled by House Republicans would have scrapped the deduction. Feinstein’s tweet was retweeted at least 26,000 times, and received at least 34,000 likes. The California Democrat has a point in her tweet, though we found two elements of it that are worthy of some caution. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., speaks during a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on Oct. 31, 2017. (AP/Andrew Harnik) The data Feinstein cited is old The $1.6 billion figure stems from a study by the National School Supply and Equipment Association. The study found that "on average, teachers reported spending about $149 of their own money on school supplies, $198 on instructional materials, and $138 on other classroom materials for a total of $485 in the 2012-2013 school year." Note the time frame: The study goes back five years. To be fair, there has been at least one more recent survey along these lines, from 2016 by a group called AdoptAClassroom.org. This study offers a higher figure for out-of-pocket classroom spending by teachers -- $600 a year. But if Feinstein had used the $600 figure, she would worsened the second, and more significant, problem with her tweet. Not all of the money spent by teachers is tax-deductible As we noted above, the limit for deducting unreimbursed classroom expenditures is $250 per teacher. So of that $485 spent out-of-pocket by the average teacher, $235 would not be deductible. (Teachers who itemize also can deduct more than that, but only if the out-of-pocket amounts are especially large, meaning few would qualify to do so.) If you adjust the calculation to take that into account, the approximate value of the lost deduction would be $825 million, not the $1.6 billion Feinstein cited in her tweet. Feinstein’s office said they sent out a subsequent tweet that provided some more specificity. That tweet said, "The average teacher spends $500 per year on school supplies. Republican plan says they can't deduct even $250 from their tax bill. Terrible!" See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com For what it’s worth, that tweet sent about three hours later attracted only a fraction of the attention the earlier tweet received -- 4,600 retweets and 8,600 likes. Is the deduction being taken? Finally, we should note that the $825 million figure is a maximum amount that could theoretically be deducted. In reality, not every teacher who qualifies for this deduction takes advantage of it, for whatever reason. The Treasury Department estimates that in tax year 2016, the classroom expense deduction reduced federal tax revenue by $210 million. That makes Feinstein's $1.6 billion figure even more overstated. Our ruling Feinstein tweeted, "Teachers spend $1.6 BILLION per year on school supplies. The Republican tax bill ELIMINATES their ability to deduct those expenses." She has a point that the GOP plan would get rid of the existing deduction for out-of-pocket classroom expenses for teachers. But the tweet overstates the value of the deduction in two ways -- first, because only a portion of that amount can actually be deducted under the law, and second, because not all teachers use the deduction. We rate the statement Half True. CORRECTION, Nov. 7, 2017, 7:30 p.m.: After this article was published, several readers informed us that teachers do not have to itemize to benefit from this deduction. Any qualified teacher can reduce their taxable income by $250 off the top, whether they itemize or not. Some teachers with very large out-of-pocket expenses may be able to deduct additional amounts if they itemize. We have changed the article to reflect this. The rating remains the same.

pomt-07157	The budget currently being debated "significantly decreases the use of one-time resources."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/14/ron-amstutz/state-rep-ron-amstutz-says-budget-now-being-debate/	State Rep. Ron Amstutz, a Republican from Wooster, recently defended Gov. John Kasich’s two-year budget blueprint, which the Republican-controlled House and Senate have left largely in tact. In a letter published May 28 in The Columbus Dispatch, Amstutz said that budget "invests in Ohio’s future and a stable fiscal path toward a stronger Ohio." Chairman of the powerful House finance committee, Amstutz was responding to criticism of the $55.6 billion budget that House Minority Leader Armond Budish made in his own letter to The Dispatch. Among Budish’s contentions was that Kasich's budget proposal amounts to Ohio's second largest spending increase, a claim PolitiFact Ohio rated as Mostly True. Amstutz said Budish’s charge that the budget increases state spending "left absent a major component to his commentary: reality." Among the points Amstutz raised to defend the GOP budget: "The current budget (now being debated) significantly decreases the use of one-time resources, using $1.2 billion this year and around $100 million the following year." Amstutz said that Budish and Democrats failed to wean the state from one-time money and that the Republican’s use of one-time money for the Kasich budget "pales in comparison." Given how often politicians use the term "one-time money" as a weapon, PolitiFact Ohio decided to look at Amstutz claims. When politicians refer to one-time money – they are referring to money that won’t be available in the next budget cycle. The sources of the one-time money include federal stimulus money and savings from debt restructuring. Ohio relied on unprecedented levels of one-time money to balance the two-year budget, passed in July 2009, when Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland and Democratic House were in charge. It will expire at the end of June 2011. Specifically, that budget contained around $4.89 billion in one-time money. That figure grew to more than $6 billion as a delay of an income tax cut, higher reimbursement rates for prescription drugs under Medicaid, and other money was added. Republicans have argued the figure is even higher – more than $8 billion. The differences between the figures are the result of disagreements over what qualifies as one-time money. Republicans, especially then-gubernatorial candidate John Kasich, exploited the state’s use of one-time money as reckless and said it leaves them to fill a massive budget hole. Given the Republican’s rhetoric, it might surprise some that they, too, are relying on such found money to balance the next two-year budget. This brings us back to Amstutz, who says the state will use about $1.2 billion this year and use $100 million in the following year. The governor’s budget – tweaked since by the legislature -- includes the following sources of one-time money during the first year of the two-year cycle: $500 million from leasing Ohio liquor sales to Kasich’s JobsOhio program $440 million in savings from restructuring state debt at a lower interest rate $115 million of unclaimed state money $75 million from the sale of state prisons $30 million from a tax amnesty program These total $1.16 billion. The only one-time money being used in the second-year of the budget is a transfer of $100 million in unclaimed state funds. So, where does this leave Amstutz claims? Again, he says the state is relying on $1.2 billion in one-time money in the first year of the proposed budget, which is pretty darn close to $1.16 billion. And, as he says, the budget eliminates in the second year all one-time money except $100 million. Though debate still exists over the exact figure of one-time money used in the last budget cycle, the level of one-time money used was unprecedented and is clearly far greater than what is proposed in the new budget. Amstutz’ statement is accurate and there’s nothing significantly missing for a full understanding. On the Truth-O-Meter, PolitiFact Ohio rates Amstutz’ statement as True.

pomt-05742	"Gingrich supported individual health insurance mandates."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/02/red-white-and-blue-fund/pro-santorum-super-pac-ad-says-gingrich-supported-/	The Red, White and Blue Fund, a super PAC supporting Rick Santorum, released a TV ad in Super Tuesday primary states charging that Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are just like President Barack Obama on many core issues. Among them: "Like Obama, Gingrich supported individual insurance mandates." This attack has been leveled at Gingrich before, and we’ve found it is correct. His comments on the subject In 1993, when the Clinton administration was trying to pass health care reform, Gingrich appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press and addressed the individual mandate. "I am for people, individuals -- exactly like automobile insurance -- individuals having health insurance and being required to have health insurance. And I am prepared to vote for a voucher system which will give individuals, on a sliding scale, a government subsidy so we insure that everyone as individuals have health insurance." He went on to criticize Clinton’s plan as "destructively big-government." But he also said, "I would like to see every American have health insurance. I am willing to require that." More recently, Gingrich joined a health care discussion with none other than Hillary Clinton in 2005 and said people should have to buy insurance or post a bond to pay for future care. Quick comparison: An individual mandate requires people to buy insurance or pay a tax penalty. The bond idea also requires people to buy insurance, and if they don’t, to put up money to be set aside to pay for their future medical care. Gingrich repeated his support for a bond in a 2007 column for his think tank Health Transformation. "In order to make coverage more accessible, Congress must do more, including passing legislation to … require anyone who earns more than $50,000 a year to purchase health insurance or post a bond," he wrote He advocated it again in his 2009 book Real Change: the Fight for America’s Future: "Those who oppose the concept of insurance should be forced to post a bond to cover costs. Allowing individuals to pass their health costs on to others reinforces the attitude that their health is not their problem and adds to the irresponsible, unhealthy behaviors that bankrupt the current system." This story in The Atlantic magazine reveals audio from a conference call Gingrich participated in that was hosted by Siemens Healthcare months after Obama's inauguration. "We believe that there should be ‘must carry’ -- that is, everybody should either have health insurance, or if you’re an absolute libertarian we would allow you to post a bond. But we would not allow people to be free riders failing to insure themselves and then showing up at the emergency room with no means of payment," Gingrich said. Finally, in May of 2011, while a candidate for president, he appeared on Meet the Press and called this concept "a variation" on the individual mandate. "Well, I agree that all of us have a responsibility to pay -- help pay for health care. And, I think that there are ways to do it that make most libertarians relatively happy. I've said consistently we ought to have some requirement that you either have health insurance or you post a bond … or in some way you indicate you’ll be held accountable," he said. (That remark kicked up so much controversy in Republican circles that Gingrich released a video statement the next day clarifying that he is "completely opposed to the Obamacare mandate on individuals. ... I'm against any effort to impose a federal mandate on anyone, because it is fundamentally wrong and, I believe, unconstitutional.") The bond option, we learned, has been kicked around for a while. "A bond alternative was part of the Heritage Foundation's plan and was actually originally in (Mitt) Romney's proposal in Massachusetts but was taken out by legislature late in game," said Michael Tanner, a health policy specialist with the libertarian Cato Institute. "It is a modest improvement over a straight mandate since it doesn't require you to buy a specific product, but libertarians like me still found it objectionable." Our ruling Red, White and Blue Fund’s ad says "Gingrich supported individual health insurance mandates." When we rated this before, we gave a Mostly True to Santorum's claim that "Speaker Gingrich for 20 years supported a federal individual mandate" because it was true for 20 years but Gingrich is now opposed. The wording is different for this one. The ad doesn’t put a timeframe on when he supported the policy, nor does it portray that as being his position now. As stated, it’s accurate. We rate it True.

pomt-00927	The FCC’s net neutrality policy includes what is "essentially a massive tax increase."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/26/mike-lee/effect-net-neutrality-rules-taxes-uncertain/	Does net neutrality mean a big tax increase? The Federal Communications Commission just approved a proposal reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications utility -- claiming that it will preserve the concept of net neutrality. While proponents of the policy shift argue that the changes won’t spur additional fees or taxes, opponents argue the opposite. "This is essentially a massive tax increase on the middle class being passed in the dead of night without the American public really being made aware of what is going on," Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, wrote in an email through the anti-FCC regulation group Protect Internet Freedom. On the other hand, FCC spokesperson Kim Hart told PolitiFact that the policy "does not raise taxes or fees. Period." Who’s right here? Estimates of the impact on consumers -- in terms of Internet service bill fees and taxes -- range from $0 to $11 billion. Politicians can make a case that the policy will bump up service bills for the 85 million households with Internet, but there are too many unknowns to make such a definitive statement as Lee’s. The proposal Net neutrality is complicated. In general, it’s the idea that Internet service providers (like Comcast) should not be able give preferential treatment to one website over another. Accordingly, the solution is also complex. The FCC voted to reclassify Internet service providers as common carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, meaning they will be treated as public utilities, like phone service -- subject to more regulation than they are now. (A previous fact-check covered this in more detail.) The full text of the proposal wasn’t available to the public before the vote, when Lee made his comments, though its general principles were widely understood. But, a fact sheet says it "will not impose, suggest or authorize any new taxes or fees." More importantly, Congress recently reauthorized the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act, which bans new taxes on Internet service. There’s legislation in the works to make this law permanent. That means the FCC couldn't levy taxes on its own even if it wanted to. There’s a big caveat, though. The Internet Tax Freedom Act bans taxes, but not fees. Fee revenue is set aside specifically for, in this case, a telecom-related service. Taxes, in contrast, raise general revenue. They’re legally different, but functionally the same from the consumer’s perspective. Many experts say consumers can expect additional fees. Some say the FCC has left the door open for attaching federal-level fees in the future. Regardless, the FCC can’t stop states and municipalities from tacking on their own fees. The estimates The nationwide annual impact on Internet broadband subscriber bills could reach a maximum $11 billion, as a result of new taxes and fees, according to a December report out of the Progressive Policy Institute, a center-left think tank (it identifies with former President Bill Clinton’s New Democrats). They recently lowered their estimate from $15 billion. For the study, the researchers assumed that state and local governments would take every fee currently applied to a telecom service and apply them to internet service -- because household Internet will become a telecom service. For example, the state of California charges telecom companies fees for special telecom-related services for the deaf and disabled, among other programs. Companies then pass these fees along to consumers. It makes sense that a state would want to apply already-established telecom fees to Internet service to increase revenue, said study author Hal Singer, in an interview with PolitiFact. He pointed out that Vermont’s director of telecom services has said the state would strongly consider levying fees on broadband Internet for the purpose of increasing Internet accessibility. Some net neutrality experts take issue with the study because of what the authors chose to include or leave out. "The PPI study has been thoroughly discredited," said Joshua Stager, policy counsel at the Open Technology Institute, noting that it was "disingenuous" of the study to ignore the Internet Tax Freedom Act in the first place. There is no guarantee that every state would choose to levy every fee. In some states, the legislatures would have to take action before it could happen. The report also assumes that federal fees will apply, but that’s still up in the air. Taking a different look at the PPI findings, the Free Press advocacy group argues that the potential fee burden could be around $4 billion, or as little as nothing. (Though Singer fervently rebutts their argument.) Personal finance website Nerd Wallet did their own assessment and settled on a possible $6.25 billion impact. They broke their estimates down by state and found that households would see an annual increase in their Internet service bills anywhere between $8 in Delaware and $131 in Pennsylvania. They estimate that the average American household will see their bill increase $67 annually. "I’d say claiming that this order will be a ‘massive tax on the middle class,’ is an overstatement," said Doug Brake, telecom policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. "But it is also true that we will likely see new fees on broadband as a result of reclassification." Our ruling Lee said the FCC’s net neutrality policy "is essentially a massive tax increase." Literally, there won’t be any new taxes as a result of the FCC changes, but there will likely be additional fees. There’s a wide range of estimates -- anywhere from zero to $11 billion a year. Lee’s comment doesn’t account for the fact that the impact on consumers’ service bills is far from certain, and a telecom policy analyst said it's an overstatement to call the potential increases "massive." The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Mike Lee	None	None	None	2015-02-26T14:11:15	2015-02-16	['None']
pomt-10597	"But it was Hillary Clinton, in an interview with Tom Brokaw, who quote 'paid tribute' to Ronald Reagan's economic and foreign policy."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/25/barack-obama/hes-right-but-clinton-quote-isnt-hers-exactly/	Ronald Reagan is back on the campaign trail. And this time, it's not the Republicans vying to claim his political DNA. It's the leading Democratic candidates, running as far as they can from the former president. The latest claim in this debate comes from Barack Obama, who hits Hillary Clinton's Reagan record as he fights off false attacks from Bill Clinton on the very same thing. Obama tries turning the tables on Clinton in a radio ad that makes passing reference to her views on Reagan. "But it was Hillary Clinton, in an interview with Tom Brokaw, who quote 'paid tribute' to Ronald Reagan's economic and foreign policy," an announcer says in an Obama radio advertisement that aired in South Carolina. The Illinois senator made a similar point during the Jan. 21, 2008, Democratic debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C. On both counts, Obama's assertion about Clinton's praise of Reagan is basically true. But a couple of significant points need to be made. First, Clinton didn't use the words "paid tribute," which the radio announcer says in quotations. That's how Brokaw summarized Clinton's remarks. (It's worth noting that the Obama campaign said it pulled this ad from the air shortly after Clinton's campaign did the same with one bashing Obama's remarks on Reagan.) And second, you have to read what Brokaw actually attributes to Clinton. Clinton's comments in question come from Brokaw's book, Boom: Voices of the Sixties . Brokaw notes Clinton's '60s rhetoric from her college days and writes about the current political climate. Then this passage from page 403 and 404: "She also believes modern conservatives such as Karl Rove are 'obsessed' with defeating her. "She prefers the godfather of the modern conservative movement, Ronald Reagan. He was, she says, 'a child of the Depression, so he understood it [economic pressures on the working and middle class]. When he had those big tax cuts and they went too far, he oversaw the largest tax increase. He could call the Soviet Union the Evil Empire and then negotiate arms-control agreements. He played the balance and the music beautifully.' "In 1969, who would have imagined that the Hillary Rodham on the Wellesley commencement stage would find herself 38 years later paying tribute to Ronald Reagan?" Compare that text with Obama's ad, and you'll see that Clinton didn't offer overall praise for Reagan's economic record. In fact, what she did was single out what she saw as his appreciation for the challenges of the working class and his willingness to reverse course when taxes were cut too much. It's true that Brokaw summarized this as paying tribute, but it still looks to us like the Obama ad somewhat mischaracterizes what Clinton said about Reagan. This leads us to rate it Half True.

pomt-09815	Van Jones signed a petition indicating he "thinks the Bush administration blew up the World Trade Center and covered it up."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/08/glenn-beck/van-jones-truther-glen-beck-thinks-so/	Glenn Beck has harshly criticized several appointees in the Obama administration. One of them was Van Jones, known as the "green jobs" czar. (His formal title was special adviser for green jobs, enterprise and innovation at the White House Council on Environmental Quality.) Jones is an environmental activist and author best known for his work promoting renewable energy as a means of creating jobs for low-income people. Conservative commentators and bloggers criticized Jones because of his past remarks and his involvement with controversial groups. His resignation was announced shortly after midnight on Sept. 6, 2009. Beck attacked Jones for endorsing a group known as the 9/11 "Truthers," conspiracy theorists who believe that the government deliberately allowed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in order to promote a militaristic agenda. Specifically, Beck said, Jones signed a 2004 petition promoted by 911truth.org, which demanded a new investigation into Sept. 11 to answer what the group considered to be unanswered questions about the attacks. Beck read the names of several celebrities who signed the petition, including the actor Ed Asner, actress and actor/comedian Janeane Garofalo, and Cynthia McKinney, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Georgia. He then noted that Jones signed as directer of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, a California-based civil rights group Jones directed at the time. Jones "thinks the Bush administration blew up the World Trade Center and covered it up," Beck said. Later he added, "Did President Obama know about all of this? . . . As the White House has been silent on this, I can't answer it." The Obama administration soon issued a statement from Jones, saying that Jones did not agree with the statements on the petition, especially that government officials may have allowed 9/11 to happen. "I do not agree with this statement and it certainly does not reflect my views now or ever," Jones said in the statement. We reviewed the petition, and its most incendiary language is in the form of hanging questions, such as, "How could Flight 77, which reportedly hit the Pentagon, have flown back towards Washington D.C. for 40 minutes without being detected by the FAA's radar or the even superior radar possessed by the US military?" and "What happened to the over 20 documented warnings given our government by 14 foreign intelligence agencies or heads of state?" Jones' name is listed on the petition , and he has not disputed that he signed it. Democrats such as Howard Dean said that Jones made a mistake by signing the petition without knowing its complete contents. Since the petition hit the news last week, some signatories have said they were misled about its contents and at least one asked that her name be removed. ( Politico has reported on these disputes in greater detail.) As fact-checkers, we can't know what Jones thought he was or wasn't signing. We can confirm that Jones is listed as a signatory on the petition. So far, his public statements seem to indicate he signed the petition but was either not in full agreement with some of its implications or didn't know what he was signing. He said, "I do not agree with this statement and it certainly does not reflect my views now or ever." On one level, the petition is just asking for more investigations. But given the pointed questions it asks, it pretty clearly implies that the Bush administration allowed the terrorist attacks to be executed due to indifference or incompetence, at a minimum. It also states that "people within the current administration may indeed have deliberately allowed 9/11 to happen, perhaps as a pretext for war." Still, Beck pushes the envelope when he says Jones "thinks the Bush administration blew up the World Trade Center and covered it up." The petition doesn't state that definitively. It does ask for investigations. We rate Beck's statement Half True. UPDATE: A few days after we published this story, Jones name was removed from the petition on the Web site of 911Truth.org. "Following recent media-generated controversy over Obama appointee Van Jones' signature on this Statement, he and two other signatories have requested their names be removed. That has been done," the site noted.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2009-09-08T18:32:56	2009-09-03	['George_W._Bush']

pomt-08869	"Eight of the nine justices in the Supreme Court decision (on campaign finance) said that not only is it constitutional for Congress to require disclosure of the special interest money, but they recommend we do it."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/04/charles-schumer/chuck-schumer-says-supreme-court-justices-back-cam/	While lamenting the fact that the vote to break the filibuster against the DISCLOSE Act would fail, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-NY, made some interesting claims about campaign finance disclosure and the Supreme Court. Schumer's bill, the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections Act, would, among other things, mandate disclosure of expenditures by corporations and unions that fund ads targeted at political campaigns. That includes ads that explicitly urge a vote for or against a candidate, as well as ads targeted to voters aired shortly before an election that only mention a candidate. The bill also prohibits any spending on elections by large government contractors as well as corporations that received TARP funds. The bill stalled July 27 when no Republican would join the Democrats to break the filibuster. "Eight of the nine justices in the Supreme Court decision said that, not only is it constitutional for Congress to require disclosure of the special interest money, but they recommended we do it," said Schumer in a press conference shortly before the failed cloture vote on Tuesday, July 27. We were curious whether eight out of nine justices had really spoken so highly of disclosure requirements and if they had in fact "recommended" that Congress require disclosure. Schumer's comments referred to the Supreme Court opinions in the landmark case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court struck down much of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law and went even further by saying that companies and unions could use money from their general treasury funds to finance ads in the run-up to federal elections that might be viewed as electioneering. Companies still cannot donate to candidates running for federal office, but they can create and buy time for ads attacking or supporting candidates. However, in the majority opinion, the Supreme Court upheld the disclosure aspects of McCain-Feingold. The four justices listed in the dissenting opinion disagreed with every aspect of the majority opinion, except on disclosure. When it comes to disclosure, eight justices seem to agree that disclosure is a good thing. Clarence Thomas was the lone justice to argue that even the disclosure aspects of the law are unconstitutional. So eight out of nine justices indicated that certain types of disclosure are constitutional. But did they "recommend" that Congress require disclosure? The Supreme Court typically doesn't recommend that Congress pass a law, and this case is no exception. Nowhere in the majority or the dissenting opinion does any justice advocate that Congress pass a specific law. However, "the Supreme Court clearly looks favorably upon disclosure, although not necessarily the disclosure provisions contained in this bill," said Sean Parnell, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, a group opposed to campaign finance restrictions and deeply critical of the Schumer's bill. "The question surrounding the DISCLOSE Act is just how much disclosure (is acceptable), and in what specific form that disclosure can or cannot take place." In the Citizens United decision, the Supreme Court specifically upheld the disclosure requirements of McCain-Feingold. Until Citizens United, many other types of political financing were illegal, so disclosure requirements were beside the point. One aspect of the DISCLOSE Act is an attempt to require disclosure for these newly legal political finance activities. Rick Hasen, a professor at Loyola Law School who writes a prominent blog on election law, said he believes that most, if not all, of the disclosure provisions in Schumer's bill would be welcomed by the Supreme Court. He pointed out some key passages in Justice Kennedy's "Opinion of the Court:" "A campaign finance system that pairs corporate independent expenditures with effective disclosure has not existed before today... With the advent of the Internet, prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters." Hasen said that he would view that, and the longer paragraph from which it came, as a recommendation. Hasen is in favor of the disclosure provisions of the DISCLOSE Act. One caveat to Schumer's claim is that just because the Supreme Court justices are in favor of disclosure does not mean that they would favor the DISCLOSE Act. The Supreme Court might decide the disclosure provisions go too far or disagree with other provisions that go beyond disclosure requirements. "Very clearly the Supreme Court approves of and thinks that there is value to disclosure, which is entirely different from whether they would endorse the DISCLOSE act," said Parnell. The bill, for instance, would not allow companies bailed out by the government, such as General Motors, to donate money to political campaigns. "Those provisions are not like the disclosure laws," said Hasen. The Supreme Court doesn't "recommend" that Congress necessarily do anything -- it's just not the court's style. However, certain phrases within a section of the Citizens United ruling do seem to look favorably upon the idea of more disclosure laws. We think Schumer's word choice could have been better, but his general point was correct, so we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-01677	Says Ted Cruz "was just bribed by the Kochs to introduce a bill that would give them and their allies America’s national forests, parks, and other public lands and open them for mining, drilling, fracking and logging."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/aug/17/occupy-democrats/ted-cruz-bribed-kochs-strike-match/	Ted Cruz took a bribe? So said a July 11, 2014, Facebook post by Occupy Democrats depicting the second-year Republican senator from Texas as the group’s "Sellout Politician of the Day." Its message, brought to our attention by a reader, said: "This is Sen. Ted Cruz, a Koch puppet. He was just bribed by the Kochs to introduce a bill that would gift or sell them and their allies America’s national forests, parks, and other public lands and open them for mining, drilling, fracking and logging." Democratic Party forces, including the Senate majority leader, Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, often assail the billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, pro-Republican Kansas industrialists who have plowed millions of dollars into influencing elections and government. PolitiFact in April 2014 rated Mostly True a statement by Reid that the Koch brothers together are the richest people in the world. The same month, PunditFact rated Half True a claim the brothers spent three times what the top 10 labor unions expended in the 2012 elections. An apples-to-apples comparison was undoable, but an independent analysis of trackable federal data found organizations tied to the Kochs spent three and a half times what unions did that year. Earlier in April, PolitiFact rated False a claim by Charles Koch, CEO of the privately held Koch Industries, Inc., that it was only in the past decade he realized the need to "engage in the political process." Records showed him giving tens of thousands to candidates and political committees prior to 2004 while collectively, his brother and their company’s PAC had donated $7 million to candidates and political committees. In Cruz’s Senate office, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier confirmed Cruz this summer offered a proposal, which wasn’t acted on, for the federal government to shed excess lands, but she said in an email the Occupy Democrats statement "looks like nothing more than politically charged rhetoric with no facts to back it up." Group lacks evidence of bribe Occupy Democrats didn’t offer evidence of Cruz getting money or another benefit to introduce his proposal. But Omar Rivero, the group’s founder and a 2014 Democratic nominee for the Florida House, said by email the Texan elected in 2012 had fielded campaign contributions from groups fueled by the Kochs, including the Club for Growth, which describes itself as the nation’s "leading free-enterprise advocacy group." The group has been Cruz’s top donor, giving more than $705,000 of his $18.1 million in contributions, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Government, which says Koch employees and the company’s PAC have contributed $25,750 to Cruz, placing Koch 26th among the senator’s most-generous givers. Rivero told us Occupy Democrats analyzed Cruz’s amendment via a July 10, 2014, web post on the pro-Democratic ThinkProgress.org website stating Cruz sought to force the government to hand prized lands in the West to home states that would be forced to burden state taxpayers with the costs of managing the lands or, more likely, sell or give away the lands for mining, drilling and logging. "We consider it bribery," Rivero said, "when a shadowy, wide-reaching corporate interest political machine like the Kochs’ bankrolls a U.S. senator’s political operation and then that same senator turns around and supports a major piece of legislation desired by those corporate interests." What Cruz proposed We looked over the amendment, contacted a Koch spokesman and asked advocates familiar with Cruz’s proposal about this claim. In July 2014, Cruz offered his amendment as a change to legislation authored by Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., the Bipartisan Sportsmen’s Act of 2014; neither survived. Cruz’s proposal said land under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal Interior and Agriculture departments in any state shouldn’t exceed half the state’s land area. In states where those agencies do control more than half the land, Cruz proposed, the government should sell the "excess" land at auction or transfer it to the state. His amendment called for auctions or transfers to take place by 2020. Frazier of Cruz’s office said he offered the amendment, as he had once before, because "he believes in principles of small government and like many conservatives, feels that federal ownership of land in the states should be limited so that the federal government does not own more than half of the land in any state." Asked the precise origin of the idea, Frazier said: "It came from him. He thinks the federal government should get out of the landlord business." Koch role? Like many companies, Koch Industries lobbies in Washington, according to summaries of federal records by the CRP, and it spent $5.4 million lobbying there from January through June 2014, just before Cruz offered his proposal. Koch lobbyists reported interests in nearly 50 topics including appropriations to the Interior and Agriculture departments, according to the center, though the company did not report any lobbying related to Hagan’s proposal. To our inquiry, Rob Tappan, a Washington, D.C.-based spokesman for Koch Public Sector, part of Koch Industries, said by email the Kochs had no position on Cruz’s amendment nor, he said, did it lobby the issue or contact Cruz’s office to discuss it. Shrinking federal lands not a new idea Experts familiar with Cruz’s idea said they were unaware of information confirming the Occupy Democrats’ claim. Each also said it's not a novel idea to reduce the amount of federally owned land. Broadly, Jessica Goad of the Colorado-based Center for Western Priorities, which says it "promotes responsible policies and practices, and ensures accountability at all levels to protect land, water, and communities in the American West," told us it’s not novel for legislators or members of Congress to advocate the sale or transfer of federal lands. Cruz’s amendment, she said by phone, "is in line with the anti-government, anti-establishment tone of that side of the (Republican) party." Curiously, Goad said, Cruz’s proposal would limit the transfer or sale of "excess" lands to the states of Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Nevada and Utah, the only states where more than half the land is federally controlled. She emailed us a Nov. 14, 2008, Heritage Foundation map of the U.S., drawing on federal data, showing the share of federally owned acreage by state. (Uncle Sam owns 2 percent of the land in Texas, the map indicates.) And how did the federal government end up with so much land in some of the states? Goad pointed out a center illustration showing that as a condition of joining the U.S., western states agreed to give up any stake in otherwise unclaimed lands in their respective boundaries. Goad said the concept of transferring or selling off federal lands has been promoted by right-leaning groups. By email, she pointed out a "model resolution" for state legislatures from the American Legislative Exchange Council, urging Congress to convey title of federal public lands to the states. An ALEC summary says: "Currently, huge swaths (over 50 percent) of the land in our nation’s western states are controlled by the federal government making it impossible for states to tax this land to fund education, grow state economies and generate high-paying jobs. Further, federal control prevents the states from accessing the abundant natural resources contained on these lands." By phone, Alan Rowsome of the Wilderness Society, which describes itself as the "leading American conservation organization working to protect our nation’s shared wildlands," said he had no information on the Kochs touching off Cruz’s proposal, which Rowsome described as a "blunt instrument" to shift lands to states or auctions instead of leaving decisions to designated federal agencies. He said, too, there’s no certainty under Cruz’s amendment that the trims of federal lands would lead to drilling for oil and gas or to forests being cleared. "It is not a mandate of the legislation," he said. Brian Mullis, a Cato Institute spokesman, put us in touch with Shawn Regan of the Montana-based Property & Environmental Research Center, a think tank which says its scholars have "documented how government regulation and bureaucracy often led to environmental degradation." By email, Regan said Cruz’s proposal reflected "a sentiment in many western states that local control of public lands is more desirable than management by distant federal bureaucracies." Of note, Regan said, three states affected by Cruz’s proposal -- Idaho, Nevada and Oregon -- are not oil-and-gas rich. He noted too that under the proposal, the secretaries of Agriculture and Interior would be responsible for identifying acreage to be auctioned off or transferred. Regan speculated: "These almost certainly would not be national parks, wilderness areas, or other ‘pristine’ federal lands, but would likely be lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service—many of which are already managed for logging, grazing, and energy development." Our ruling Occupy Democrats said Cruz "was just bribed by the Kochs to introduce a bill that would give them and their allies America’s national forests, parks, and other public lands and open them for mining, drilling, fracking and logging." If excess federal lands were put up for auction, as possible under Cruz’s amendment, anyone including the Kochs could perhaps purchase the lands and then, as the owners, possibly chop down trees, drill for oil and the like. All this said, this group failed to provide (nor did we find) evidence of a bribe or any Koch-linked inducement causing Cruz to present his proposal nor did we find confirmation his proposal came about so pristine federal lands could be exploited. Campaign contributions aren’t bribes and suspicions aren’t facts. We rate this unsupported and ridiculous claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-03064	"In 2010, the non-partisan Government Accountability Office found that only 6.5 percent of the U.S.-Mexico border was under full control of the Border Patrol."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/oct/01/lamar-smith/government-report-said-65-percent-border-miles-wer/	Continuing his call for more border security, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith said in a flier recently mailed to his constituents, "In 2010, the non-partisan Government Accountability Office found that only 6.5 percent of the U.S.-Mexico border was under full control of the Border Patrol." That’s not a lot of border. Is he right? Kim Smith, a spokeswoman for the San Antonio Republican (whose district runs north into Travis County), emailed us a web link to a Feb. 15, 2011, GAO report describing the five levels of border security the Border Patrol used from 2005 through 2010. The agency has not announced a new official measure but has said it plans to do so this year. In fiscal 2010, the report said, about 44 percent of the border was under "operational control," meaning the two highest levels of security: 129 miles at the highest level, "controlled," and 744 miles at the second-highest level, "managed." Dividing 129 by the border’s total 1,993 miles yields 6.5 percent. No miles were classed under the lowest level of security. About 1,120 miles were described as "not acceptable for border security" -- two-thirds of these were "monitored," the third-highest level, and one-third were "low-level monitored," the fourth security level. The levels describe how comprehensively an area is covered and how close to the border the agents and equipment are. A GAO report issued Dec. 10, 2012, explained it this way: "Resources were in place to apprehend illegal activity at the immediate border for 129 southwest border miles, or at some distance from the border for an additional 744 southwest border miles." Feb. 15, 2011, GAO report’s description of levels used in 2010: Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations nonpartisan think tank, told us by phone that "controlled," the highest level, meant agents and surveillance were directly on the border or within a few hundred yards. "The only places where the Border Patrol deems this necessary is in a very small number of what were historically high-traffic corridors, so San Diego, El Paso … mostly urban areas," he said. "The reason you need to be on top of those areas," Alden said, is that "in an urban area, with El Paso and Juárez backed up together, if somebody gets over the wall, you know it’s a minute until they disappear into the streets of El Paso. The San Diego border, it’s a little farther, sort of a suburban area, but it’s pretty easy to disappear," he said. "Managed," the second level of security, "can mean a series of cameras at various points, various distances from the border; it can mean physical patrols by the agents that two or three times a day go past the same area," Alden said. "Most of the border’s unpopulated, and you’re miles and miles from the nearest road. … You’ve got a surveillance camera that spots somebody in Arizona crossing the border, they may have a two-day walk before they get to the road" -- less if they’re in a vehicle, he said, but still not requiring instant response. Do any of the levels equate to "full control"? A former head of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, Doris Meissner, now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, told us in an interview, "It obviously depends on what you define as full control," but after years of "incredible investment" along the border with Mexico, "crossings are dramatically down in almost all of the high-traffic areas ... Overall, the enforcement picture at the border is vastly improved from what it was ten years ago." In light of those facts, Lamar Smith’s statement "sounds misleading to me," she said. PolitiFact has brushed on the border security buildup and drop in apprehensions before. We also found in a Sept. 6, 2013, fact-check that as many as 40 percent of undocumented U.S. residents didn’t get here by crossing a border illegally at all, but by overstaying their visas. The congressman’s flier notes the latter statistic alongside the border security claim in its section on "Supporting immigration enforcement." At the border, complete control -- zero illegal entries -- is improbable, and isn’t the goal. Lamar Smith’s spokeswoman pointed out that the 2011 GAO report said, "Border Patrol stated that operational control does not require its agents to be able to detect and apprehend all illegal entries." In testimony to a House subcommittee Feb. 11, 2013, the GAO's then-director of Homeland Security and Justice, Richard Stana, said that the "resources that would be needed to absolutely prevent every single incursion would be something probably out of reasonable consideration." Lamar Smith told us in an interview, "You make me think now, I wish I’d used the word ‘controlled,’ because ‘full control’ sounds so absolute that ‘controlled’ sounds to me to be less certain." But "the operative word is ‘control,’ I think, where they know they actually have a high probability of apprehending somebody who’s coming across," he said, adding that he also uses the 44 percent "operational control" figure when discussing border security." Alden called Rep. Smith’s statement misleading because "operational control" -- the Border Patrol’s top two security levels, covering 44 percent of the border miles in 2010 -- meant the Border Patrol was detecting and responding to "90, 95 percent" of the illegal entry activity there, he said, pointing us to the appendices of the 2012 GAO report for details. Using numbers in that report, a June 21, 2013, Washington Post news blog entry calculated "effectiveness" ratings for the nine border sectors -- the percentage of total estimated illegal entries in which the Border Patrol apprehended suspects or turned back suspects with a likelihood that they returned to Mexico: In fiscal 2010 and 2011, the nine Border Patrol sectors ranged from 63 percent to 96 percent effectiveness. 2010’s two highest-rated sectors accounted for 21 percent of the border’s nearly 2,000 miles and illustrate some of the physical differences Alden indicated. El Paso’s 286-mile sector averaged 96 percent effectiveness across New Mexico and Texas terrain described in the report as "including mountains and arid desert with canyons," 88 miles of river border "and an urban metropolitan area." Of the sector’s 11 Border Patrol stations, seven were on the border and four in the interior. The 126-mile Yuma, Ariz., sector averaged 95 percent effectiveness in fiscal 2010 over "sandy desert terrain, mountains and river valleys … sand dunes and several mountain ranges … In addition, large portions of the Yuma sector fall within federal land and military reservations." The sector had two border stations and one interior station. Our ruling Lamar Smith wrote, "In 2010, the non-partisan Government Accountability Office found that only 6.5 percent of the U.S.-Mexico border was under full control of the Border Patrol." That report showed 6.5 percent of border miles in fiscal 2010 were under the Border Patrol’s top level of security, meaning agents and equipment were constantly present and monitoring the border -- a level of enforcement usually reserved for high-traffic urban areas. But the rest of the border’s not a sieve. The same report said 44 percent of border miles were under what the agency considered acceptable levels of security. We rate this claim, lacking such clarification, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-06585	Despite opposition from national Club for Growth, Club for Growth Wisconsin "has endorsed" him for U.S. Senate.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/26/tommy-thompson/republican-tommy-thompson-says-club-growth-wiscons/	Perhaps the loudest voice in opposition to a Tommy Thompson candidacy for the U.S. Senate has been the conservative Club for Growth. The national anti-tax group has repeatedly accused him of spending too much as Wisconsin’s governor and later supporting President Barack Obama’s health care reform. Thompson, a Republican who has said he will run in 2012 for the seat being vacated by Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl, was asked about the criticism on the ABC News "TopLine" program on Sept. 12, 2011. Thompson called the national Club for Growth’s accusations -- made in statements, in an online ad and in a national TV ad -- false. Then he mentioned Club for Growth Wisconsin, saying: "It’s nice to point out that the state Club for Growth, the people in the state of Wisconsin, have endorsed me and support me and say that the national Club for Growth is just plain wrong in their assertions and accusations." We’ve already rated Half True the national Club for Growth’s claim that Thompson, who left the governor’s office in 2001 to serve as President George W. Bush’s health and human services secretary, supported what Republicans dubbed "Obamacare." What struck us about the ABC interview was Thompson’s claim that Club for Growth Wisconsin had endorsed him. That’s because a statement issued two weeks before Thompson’s interview by Club for Growth Wisconsin, which was founded in 2004, said the state group "shares the same economic agenda" as the national group, but is "a completely independent and separate organization." The statement also said that under its charter, Club for Growth Wisconsin "takes no position" on federal candidates: "We do NOT get involved in federal elections." (Conversely, the national Club for Growth says it endorses only federal candidates.) We asked Darrin Schmitz, a spokesman for Thompson’s campaign, about Thompson’s claim of being endorsed by Club for Growth Wisconsin. Schmitz said Thompson was referring to an endorsement from Terry and Mary Kohler, who Schmitz said are founding members of Club for Growth Wisconsin. He argued Thompson clarified his remark when he said "the people" endorsed him because that was a reference to the Kohlers as founding members of the state group. Hmmm. Thompson said "the people of Wisconsin," not people associated with Club for Growth Wisconsin. He didn’t announce the Kohlers’ endorsement until three days after the ABC interview. And an endorsement by individual members of a group -- however influential -- is not the same as an endorsement by the group itself. What’s more, Club for Growth Wisconsin doesn’t even endorse in federal races. Our conclusion In trying to fend off criticism from the national Club for Growth, Thompson told a national TV audience he has been endorsed by Club for Growth Wisconsin in his U.S. Senate bid. He hasn’t been. And, under the group’s charter, couldn’t be. We rate Thompson’s claim Pants on Fire.	None	Tommy Thompson	None	None	None	2011-09-26T09:00:00	2011-09-12	['None']

pomt-14066	"We now do have evidence" that Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting tool for terrorists.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/20/hillary-clinton/donald-trump-now-being-used-terrorist-propaganda-v/	Hillary Clinton took flak from fact-checkers back in December when she claimed that Donald Trump’s comments were being used as a recruiting tool by ISIS. We rated that statement False, for lack of evidence. The Washington Post Fact Checker said a link did not "appear to exist." Fast-forward five months. Clinton says those links now do exist. "When you say we're going to bar all Muslims, you are sending a message to the Muslim world and you're also sending a message to the terrorists because we now do have evidence," Clinton said May 19 on CNN. "We have seen how Donald Trump is being used to essentially be a recruiter for more people to join the cause of terrorism." So, has something changed? Indeed, yes. Not long after Clinton’s initial comments, Al Shabaab, the East African affiliate of the al-Qaida terrorist group, released a 51-minute video telling "Muslims of the West" that they are not welcome in countries like the United States. Ten minutes into the video, it says the United States has a history of "slavery, segregation, lynching, and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps." It then cuts to Trump calling for a temporary but "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S," according to SITE Intelligence Group, which studies jihadist propaganda, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. It urges American Muslims to leave the United States and join the group. Later, on March 24, Newsweek reported that an ISIS video released in the wake of the Brussels attack featured an audio clip from Trump. "Brussels was one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities of the world 20 years ago. It was amazing, actually, and safe. And now it's a horror show. It's an absolute horror show," Trump says in the video, as ISIS lets the phrase "absolute horror show" repeatedly echo and fade. Clinton's initial statement in December "was false at the time," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "It’s true now." Trump's comment in the Brussels video may not seem inflammatory, he said, yet "if you game it out from the perspective of, say, ISIS and they think Donald Trump is a great recruiting tool, then probably they don't want to play him up too much before the election because they'd want him to win." There may be other videos, Gartenstein-Ross said. "Unlike in the past when you had multiple analysts watch every al-Qaida release, ISIS's video production operation is so large, it's really hard for people to watch every single ISIS release because they release so much. They're extraordinarily prolific. I would wager there are other uses of him in their propaganda." Our ruling Clinton said, "We now do have evidence. We have seen how Donald Trump is being used to essentially be a recruiter for more people to join the cause of terrorism." That wasn't the case the first time Clinton claimed this. But now two different terror groups have used Trump's words in propaganda videos.

pomt-14494	"When they passed Obamacare, they put a bailout fund in Obamacare. … We led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/25/marco-rubio/rubio-we-wiped-out-obamacare-bailout-fund-insuranc/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took an outsize swing at a provision of Obamacare as GOP presidential candidates hammered their favorite target during the CNN debate in Houston. "When they passed Obamacare, they put a bailout fund in Obamacare," Rubio said while addressing frontrunner Donald Trump on Feb. 25, 2016. "All these lobbyists you keep talking about, they put a bailout fund in the law that would allow public money to be used, taxpayer money, to bail out companies when they lost money. We led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund." Did Obamacare contain a bailout for insurance companies, and did Rubio and congressional Republicans get rid of it? In short, they postponed a provision of the law, but it wasn’t a bailout. Risky business What Rubio calls a bailout is actually a part of the Affordable Care Act known as "risk corridors." When the health care law started requiring insurance companies to sell policies to everyone (even sick people with pre-existing conditions), those companies were caught in a tough spot. They didn’t know how much to charge in premiums to cover expenses for all those new policies. So the law set up a three-year period, from 2014 to 2016, during which the government would spread the risk for insurers in the new law’s marketplaces while they adjusted premiums. This program is known as risk corridors. If a company is good at setting its rates and make more than a certain amount, they pay Washington some of their extra money. These are called user fees. If a company is not so good at setting rates and loses money, the government would cover some of their losses. That’s the bailout to which Rubio is referring. He started calling it a "bailout" for unsuccessful insurance companies in 2013, the same year he introduced an ill-fated bill in the Senate to repeal the program. But let’s be clear: Several experts told us risk corridors aren’t a bailout. A bailout is usually a program that saves a company after the fact. Risk corridors are a mechanism that was put in place to deal with a problem that everyone assumes could occur. And they aren’t new, either. The risk corridors program was modeled after a successful plan that was part of George W. Bush’s Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, albeit slightly different than the Obamacare version. No one referred to that as a bailout. Finding money for payments Now, part of the problem is that the the health care law didn’t say where it would get the money for any risk corridor payments. Remember those user fees from successful insurers? The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, later decided they would use that money to make any payments owed to insurers that weren’t so successful. In 2013, CMS said insurers who said they needed money would get it, "regardless of the balance of payments and receipts" in the program. Rubio took this to mean that if there wasn’t enough money from user fees to cover the payments, the White House would ask Congress for money -- that is, tax revenue. CMS said in April 2014 it wouldn’t ask Congress for an appropriation, but instead would make up the difference in later years if the marketplace didn’t bring in enough user fees. Rubio went to work, urging then-Speaker of the House John Boehner in October 2014 to block potential tax money appropriations for risk corridor payments. That’s what Congress did. When lawmakers passed a spending bill in December 2014, it included special language called a "rider" that said the CMS’ parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, could not use any extra money in its budget to pay risk corridor expenses. That effectively locked CMS into its stated plan of using user fees. (The same rider was included in the 2015 spending bill.) Some legislators have credited Rubio with inspiring this language, although there have been questions about how much credit he can take. Rubio reintroduced his bill to repeal risk corridors. By October 2015, it became apparent the risk corridors program didn’t work so well in the first year. CMS announced the program took in $362 million in user fees for 2014, while less successful insurers asked for a total of $2.87 billion, leaving a $2.5 billion shortfall CMS can’t pay. CMS said it would pay out 12.6 percent of claims from 2014, then wait to see next year’s results. Some insurers left the marketplaces or even collapsed altogether, leading Rubio to crow his actions have been "a big part of ending Obamacare for good." (We likely won't know what the program took in for 2015 until fall 2016, and 2016’s totals until 2017.) Whether it will really kill Obamacare is up for debate. Some legal scholars have said all the rider did was highlight a problem the law already had and prevent a workaround. Two years ago, the Congressional Budget Office said the risk corridors will likely eventually break even by 2016. If the program doesn’t, CMS will have to find the money somehow or ask Congress to make an appropriation to pay insurers. Otherwise, insurers could sue to get those payments. An Oregon insurance company that is no longer offering marketplace plans did just that on Feb. 24, suing the government for $5 billion over missed risk corridors payments. Our ruling Rubio said, "When they passed Obamacare, they put a bailout fund in Obamacare. … We led the effort and wiped out that bailout fund." The "bailout fund" is actually a provision in the Affordable Care Act called risk corridors, designed to temporarily aid insurers as they adjust premiums. Rubio helped persuade Congress to prevent Health and Human Services from being able to cover expenses its own budget. But experts have said Rubio is wrong to call the program a bailout, and that the program is supposed to pay for itself through fees from insurers. Furthermore, the program hasn’t been "wiped out." At best, Rubio and Congress have temporarily limited one potential way CMS could have covered insurance companies' losses. We’ll have to see what happens when the program expires after 2016 -- then any outstanding bills will be due, one way or another. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/33a7e991-0d94-4526-a5a9-3a3f7a9a0fec	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2016-02-25T23:26:57	2016-02-25	['Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act']

pomt-13371	Says most illegal immigrants draw "welfare benefits, they’re sending their kids to school, they’re using the public services."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/sep/28/tom-delay/tom-delay-says-most-illegal-immigrants-draw-welfar/	Former Republican powerbroker Tom DeLay recently raised alarm about Houston "illegal immigrants" taking advantage of tax-funded benefits. DeLay, seated in what looked like a comfortable spot, took split-screen questions from MSNBC’s Kate Snow--both of them not quite getting facts straight. DeLay initially agreed in the Sept. 1, 2016, interview that "deportations are up" under President Barack Obama. Deportations hit a record high under Obama in 2013. However, the counts have since come down. The former U.S. House majority leader once known as the Hammer went on to say the flow of illegal immigrants also has gone way up--a claim that as of that month wasn’t reflective of border-area apprehensions by the Border Patrol. "I mean, right here in Houston, Texas," DeLay said, "you can go three blocks from here and you have apartment complexes after apartment complexes packed full with illegal immigrants." He shortly added: "Most of these illegals are drawing welfare benefits, they’re sending their kids to school, they’re using the public services. Many of them are paying taxes, I grant you that. But the impact," he said, "is monumental." DeLay’s comments fell in stride with a hot topic of the 2016 presidential race--the impact of unauthorized immigrants. Monumental or not, we wondered if he was right about government-funded benefits drawn by such residents. Some relevant recent fact checks: --In August 2016, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s claim there could be up to 30 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. came out Pants on Fire; the U.S. government and independent think tanks put the figure between 11 and 12 million. --The same day, Trump said unauthorized immigration costs more than $113 billion annually from federal, state and local coffers. That’s Mostly False, PolitiFact found, in that Trump cited the highest of all estimates from a range that varied widely, and excluded data on unauthorized immigrant tax payments. --The month before, we found Half True a claim by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton that unauthorized immigrants annually pay $12 billion into Social Security. That amount was paid jointly by unauthorized immigrants and their employers. DeLay offers no backup DeLay, who resigned as majority leader in 2005 after his indictment on Texas campaign finance charges (his subsequent conviction was ultimately overturned), gave us a lot to consider, starting with what he had in mind in mentioning nearby apartment complexes rife with "illegal immigrants." For a moment, we contemplated a field trip to see for ourselves, an option that fizzled after DeLay didn’t provide backup information; when we reached him by phone, the line went dead. Dani DeLay Garcia, his daughter who sometimes serves as his spokeswoman, told us by email that he wouldn’t be elaborating. Public schools and paying taxes For our part, we recognized that DeLay was correct about public schools serving children regardless of immigration status. In 2013, we found True a claim that the U.S Supreme Court had decided in 1982 that non-citizen children must get free public schooling through the 12th grade. Unauthorized immigrants also pay taxes, as DeLay said. Tanya Broder, a staff attorney for the National Immigration Law Center, said by phone that "undocumented immigrants have the same tax obligations as any other resident." Broder emailed a 2015 report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan think tank, which drew on its analysis of state tax laws to estimate that unauthorized immigrants in Texas in 2012 paid about $1.5 billion in state and local sales and property taxes. Earlier, a 2006 report from the Texas state comptroller, applying Pew Research Center population research and comptroller tax models, estimated that unauthorized immigrants in Texas in 2005 paid $1.58 billion in state and local taxes. We focused next on whether unauthorized immigrants draw welfare and tap other public services. Welfare benefits The federal government hasn’t distributed welfare checks to eligible people in poverty for around 20 years; that approach was replaced in the late 1990s by targeted aid programs jointly administered by the federal and state governments that provide assistance with cash, food, housing and health care. That act, the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, also barred unauthorized immigrants from drawing benefits. Title IV of the act, subheaded "restricting welfare and public benefits for aliens," states that "aliens who are not qualified aliens" are ineligible for "federal public benefits" and for "state and local public benefits." The act defines qualified aliens as people with certain legal documented immigration status, meaning unauthorized immigrants are not eligible. We confirmed from eligibility rules posted on government websites that unauthorized immigrants aren’t eligible for major aid programs including Medicaid, the joint federal-state health coverage for people in poverty; Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which provides cash assistance to the impoverished elderly or disabled; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which used to be food stamps; housing assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development; and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), which provides grants for state-administered family assistance programs like child care, cash assistance or counseling. Separately, Broder and Randy Capps of the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that believes in the benefits of well-managed immigration, each told us federal welfare benefits aren’t available to unauthorized immigrants. By phone, Jack Martin, author of reports on unauthorized immigrants in Texas for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates tighter immigration controls, put it this way: "Illegal aliens are not eligible directly for welfare assistance" though, he said, parents living in the country without permission can sign up qualified children for aid. All U.S.-born children are automatically U.S. citizens, even if born to unauthorized immigrants--and Martin was correct, we found, in that Medicaid eligibility rules specify that unauthorized immigrants "may apply for coverage on behalf of documented individuals." Eligibility rules for SNAP say that a person who is ineligible because of immigration status "may choose to apply only for his or her U.S. citizen children in the household." On the other hand, Broder said, certain federal benefits are available to children regardless of residency status: the Child and Adult Care Food Program, which provides food aid to care centers for low income children, elderly or disabled adults; the National School Lunch and Breakfast Program, which subsidizes in-school meals for children from low income families; and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, which provides nutritional supplements and health education for pregnant women, breastfeeding women and their infants up to five years old who are deemed "at nutrition risk" by a doctor. Capps agreed those programs are open to unauthorized immigrants but said they’re "programs that I wouldn’t consider welfare." Case said the basic nutrition programs qualified as public health spending. Regarding the school lunch program he said: "I wouldn’t consider it welfare the same way I wouldn’t consider public schools welfare." Public services Finally, we found validity to DeLay’s assertion that unauthorized immigrants use "public services." Capps said there were state-administered public health services available to residents regardless of immigration status while Alex Nowrasteh, an analyst for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, nudged us afresh to the 2006 report from the Texas state comptroller. That report, "Undocumented Immigrants in Texas: a financial analysis of the impact to the state budget and economy," listed nine publicly-funded programs for which unauthorized immigrants in Texas were eligible--public schools plus eight health care programs: emergency medical care for indigent residents; Children with Special Health Care Needs; substance abuse services; mental health services; immunizations; Women’s and Children’s Health Services; public health programs; and emergency medical services such as ambulances. We wondered if the listed programs continue to be open to anyone regardless of immigration status. Seems so; agency-posted eligibility requirements do not say beneficiaries must be legal U.S. residents. SOURCE: Report, "Undocumented immigrants in Texas: a financial analysis of the impact to the state budget and economy," Texas state comptroller Carole Strayhorn, December 2006 In 2005, the report estimated, Texas spent about $58 million caring for unauthorized immigrants through the eight programs--compared to $57.8 billion in total state spending that year. Health Care As the largest health-related service used by unauthorized immigrants, the comptroller identified indigent care at public hospitals. The Texas Indigent Health Care and Treatment Act of 1989 requires Texas counties to fund stabilizing health services for indigent people without insurance. According to the act, county hospitals, public hospitals and hospital districts must admit anyone who earns 21 percent or less of the federal poverty level. That includes unauthorized immigrants, who the comptroller estimated drew $1.3 billion in such services in 2004. The services required under the 1989 act include: "primary and preventative services," inpatient and outpatient hospital services, rural health clinics, laboratory and X-ray services, family planning, physician services, payment for up to three prescription drugs and "skilled nursing facility services." We found specifics in a 2010 report from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission titled "Report on services and benefits provided to undocumented immigrants." The report listed uncompensated costs incurred at each Texas public hospital in 2008, plus the estimated share of that cost "attributable" to unauthorized immigrants. The report estimated that between two and 22 percent of uncompensated costs are attributable to unauthorized immigrants at each of 99 public hospitals statewide, totaling about $717 million in 2008. Our ruling DeLay said most illegal immigrants draw "welfare benefits, they’re sending their kids to school, they’re using the public services." People living in the U.S. without authorization indeed draw on public services including government-supported hospitals. Also, children of all origins attend public schools. But counter to DeLay’s prime point, adults lacking legal residency are barred by law from government programs that fit the "welfare" category. Parents still may seek benefits, though, for their child-citizens. All told, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04402	Says Paul Ryan’s budget plan "ends Medicare."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/17/rob-zerban/paul-ryans-house-opponent-democrat-rob-zerban-says/	Understandably, Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan is more focused on running for vice-president than he is on seeking re-election to his southern Wisconsin House seat. But his House opponent, Democrat Rob Zerban, continues to run hard against him. The former Kenosha County supervisor used his first TV ad, released Oct. 4, 2012, to attack Ryan. He repeats one of the most common -- and debunked -- claims of the past year. "Paul Ryan -- his controversial budget for America has been called dangerous, cruel and deeply wrong," a narrator says of the House Budget Committee chairman as the ad begins. "The Ryan plan ends Medicare." No maybes. No qualifiers. Just a straight declaration. Zerban’s evidence As the claim is uttered by the narrator, the words "End Medicare" (in quotation marks) appear on the screen, along with a citation to a June 2011 opinion article in The New York Times. Paul Krugman, who writes The Conscience of a Liberal column, had written that "Republicans are trying to end Medicare. The program we now call Medicare is one in which the government acts as your insurer, paying your major medical bills; coverage is guaranteed to all seniors. The program Republicans want gives you vouchers and tells you to go buy your own insurance, if you can. That’s not at all the same thing." It’s important to underline the fact that Zerban’s ad cites an opinion column. We asked Zerban if he had other evidence. Campaign spokesman Karthik Ganapathy sent us a statement citing news articles that say Ryan’s plan would effectively end Medicare; end Medicare as we know it; or reform Medicare into a voucher system relying on private insurers. The statement also quoted the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning Washington, D.C. think tank, as saying Ryan’s plan would raise Medicare recipients’ premiums and "lead more of Medicare’s healthier enrollees to abandon it for private plans, very possibly setting off a spiral of rising premium costs and falling enrollment for traditional Medicare. Over time, traditional Medicare would become less financially viable and could unravel." So, Zerban cites news accounts and a think tank report on how Ryan would change Medicare -- substantially, to be sure -- but not end it. And then Zerban wavered on his claim. The statement his campaign sent us quotes Zerban as saying: "We don’t say anything we don’t mean -- Paul Ryan’s budget ends Medicare." But then Ganapathy e-mailed us to say he wanted to emphasize the ad’s reference to the Times opinion article: "We are citing other folks who claim the Ryan plan will end Medicare, not coming up with a new accusation ourselves." Zerban is hardly the first to claim Ryan’s plan ends Medicare. But, no bones about it, he clearly made that allegation. So what would Ryan’s plan do? Other evidence In December 2011, more than nine months before Zerban’s TV ad, PolitiFact National rated as its Lie of the Year for 2011 the oft-repeated Democratic line that Republicans voted "to end Medicare" by voting for Ryan’s plan. (FactCheck.org has also knocked down the ends-Medicare claims.) PolitiFact National noted that the allegation ignores the fact that people 55 and older would remain on traditional Medicare and that, even with the privatized system under Ryan's bill, younger people would still receive a guarantee of care. Moreover, around the time the top lie was chosen, Ryan announced he was altering his plan and would retain an option for people to stay in traditional Medicare if they want. In other words, Medicare doesn’t end. Which isn’t to say there wouldn’t be major changes. PolitiFact National rated as Mostly True a charge by President Barack Obama that Mitt Romney and Ryan want to turn Medicare into a voucher program. In that item, our colleagues noted that under Ryan’s original plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. This would have affected people who today are under 55 only. But Ryan later proposed allowing beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they could use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. So, Medicare would remain the same for people 55 and over and it would remain an option for those who are younger. Our rating Long after the claim had been debunked, Zerban flatly stated that Ryan’s budget plan "ends Medicare." People 55 and older would remain on traditional Medicare, while those who today are under 55 could use a voucher they would receive to buy either a private insurance plan or a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.

pomt-15374	Says his release of 33 years of tax returns is "more than any presidential candidate in history."	true	/florida/statements/2015/jul/01/jeb-bush/which-presidential-candidate-has-released-most-tax/	Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush released 33 years of tax returns, casting it as the high water mark of transparency for presidential hopefuls. "Today, I’m releasing 33 years of tax returns – more than any presidential candidate in history," Bush said on his website. He also bragged about it on Twitter. The returns run from 1981 to 2013. We wondered if Bush’s 33 years was indeed the most ever, and that does appear to be the case. We also found it’s highly unusual for a candidate to share so many returns, especially so early in the campaign. The previous record was held by Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., who won the Republican nomination to run against President Bill Clinton in 1996. In January of that year, Dole released 29 years of tax returns, stretching from 1966 to 1994. He added 1995 in April, for a grand total of 30 years. Most of Dole’s ire at the time was directed at primary rival, publisher Steve Forbes, who was reticent about revealing his finances. Dole took the opportunity to rebuke his opponent for pushing for a flat tax. The next highest number of releases was Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who released a total of 20 years of returns: five years worth of returns in April 2004, adding to 15 years of returns he had revealed in prior Senate races. Critics of Kerry’s campaign were more concerned that his independently wealthy wife, millionaire Teresa Heinz Kerry, wouldn’t give out her returns. (She eventually provided two pages of her 2003 return.) There is no law requiring candidates to show their tax returns, but it has become common practice since Jimmy Carter became president in 1976. The releases have been far from uniform, however, down to when candidates make their returns public. Bush is an outlier for providing so many returns so early in the campaign, as the lion’s share of candidates usually wait until the year of the election to give out their information. The amount of documentation also has varied widely from person to person. George Romney released 12 years in 1968, as did Bill Clinton in 1992. Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., gave out 10 when he was Kerry’s running mate in 2004. The numbers then dwindle, from George W. Bush (nine in 2000) and Al Gore (eight the same year) to Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., and Hillary Clinton, who both released seven in 2008. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Mitt Romney both released two years during their campaigns. In 1980, Ronald Reagan only provided one. Releasing tax information is often a part of campaign strategy, usually to force other candidates to reveal their finances. But even then, the move can draw criticism. Liberal political action committee American Bridge 21st Century posted a laundry list of questions about the former Florida governor’s business dealings on the same day he released his returns. Bush’s 1,150 pages of financial documents show that the former real estate executive’s net worth dropped from about $2 million to $1.3 million during his two terms as governor. The campaign said he is currently worth between $19 million and $22 million. He has earned at least $29 million since leaving office in 2007. Our ruling Bush said his release of 33 years of tax returns is "more than any presidential candidate in history." That really is the case. The next highest total by a presidential candidate is from Dole, who released 30 years’ worth during his 1996 presidential campaign. We rate Bush’s statement True.

pomt-14362	"We have ten different tax brackets and if you’re making $9,000, you’re already in the top tax bracket."	false	/missouri/statements/2016/mar/22/eric-greitens/gubernatorial-candidate-exaggerates-missouri-tax-b/	Republican gubernatorial candidate Eric Greitens said the Missouri tax code is too complicated. In a Thursday GOP primary debate in Columbia, Greitens offered figures to back his claim: "We have 10 different tax brackets, and if you’re making $9,000, you’re already in the top tax bracket." That sounded a little low for the top bracket, so we asked Greitens’ campaign for evidence. His staff referred us to the Missouri Department of Revenue’s 2015 Tax Chart Missouri Department of Revenue's 2015 Tax Chart The chart actually shows 11 different tax brackets, but that aside, at first glance, it seems to back up Greitens’ claim. The top bracket is $9,000 and higher. However, there’s a catch. Greitens said people making $9,000 or more would fall in the top bracket. In fact, this chart applies not to how much a person earns but to that individual’s taxable earnings — after any deductions. Taxable income vs. gross income Taxable income is gross income less all personal exemptions and deductions. The Department of Revenue allows the following standard deductions for Missouri taxpayers. Standard deductions for Missouri taxpayers The chart shows a single filer can claim a standard deduction of $6,300. Therefore, if that person makes $9,000, as Greitens’ said, then he or she would only have a taxable income of $2,700 — even with no other exemptions. When we refer back to the department’s tax bracket chart, we can see such an individual would fit into the state’s fourth tax bracket instead of the highest tax bracket. All things being equal, a single filer would need to make at least $15,300 before he or she would face the highest tax rate. Married people filing jointly, heads of household and surviving spouses could make more than $15,300 and still not be in the top bracket. Our ruling Greitens said, "We have 10 different tax brackets, and if you’re making $9,000, you’re already in the top tax bracket." The plain meaning of "making $9,000" is that’s how much a person earns. However, the Missouri tax brackets aren’t based on gross income but on income after deductions and exemptions. Those reduce a person’s taxable income, which is the basis of the chart Greitens had in mind. A person making $9,000 would fall in the fourth tax bracket, closer to the bottom, and certainly not at the top. Most people would understand Greitens to be talking about gross income, and in this case, his statement falls far short of the mark. We rate this claim False.

pomt-01972	"Thousands of Westerners and Americans" are fighting with extremists in eastern Syria and Iraq.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/18/mike-rogers/are-thousands-westerners-and-americans-fighting-ex/	As turmoil breaks out in Iraq two and a half years after U.S. troops left the country, are Westerners — including Americans — flocking there to help extremists in the fight? That’s a case made by Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House Committee on Intelligence, during a June 15, 2014 appearance On Fox News Sunday. Rogers had this exchange with host Chris Wallace. Rogers: "This is as dangerous as it gets. Why? We have thousands of Westerners and Americans in both the eastern Syria and Iraq who have Western passports. This is like —" Wallace: "You're talking about members of ISIS?" Rogers: "Well, they're showing up to fight extremists, and so some are —" Wallace: "With the extremists?" Rogers: "Exactly." Wallace: "Yes." Rogers: "They're fighting with Al-Nusra in Syria or ISIS, and they will go with winners. So, this is what's so dangerous." Rogers went on to note that the first case of an American suicide bomber in Syria occured in May. It sounded to us like Rogers claimed there are thousands of Westerners and Americans in Syria and Iraq fighting with extremists. His office confirmed that’s what he meant. It’s an alarming statistic, and one we decided to verify. The movement of thousands of foreign fighters into Syria to join the fight against President Bashar al-Assad's regime was listed as a "Key Terrorism Trend of 2013" on the State Department’s annual terrorism report. Many of them in recent weeks have since moved into Iraq, where groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, have now taken a large swath of the country. Experts told us that conflicts in Muslim and Arab countries have often drawn fighters from across the world, including the Afghan-Soviet War and the Bosnian War. But the conflict in Syria has seen an infusion of foreign fighters to a much greater degree than past conflicts, said Bruce Riedel, director of the Intelligence Project at the Brookings Institution. "We’ve never seen anything on the scale or magnitude like this," Riedel said. "In the 1980s, a lot of the foreign volunteers went for relatively short period of time and it was more a photo-op than anything else. This time, they’re all fighting." Those not familiar with the ongoing civil war in Syria might wonder why the United States would care that Westerners are joining the fight against Assad. Assad is a brutal dictator, and President Barack Obama has called on him to step down. While there are some moderate forces in Syria fighting to oust Assad, there are also other militant groups like ISIS, which have more extreme jihadist and anti-American views, as well as links to terrorist groups like al-Qaida. Is it possible some of these foreign fighters are there to help more moderate forces defeat Assad? Some are, Riedel said, but "the majority of foreign volunteers are ending up joining or working with extremist groups like ISIS. They’re gravitating to the most extreme groups." Rogers’ office could not elaborate further on the number of Westerners fighting in those conflicts. Similarly, a spokesman for Rogers’ counterpart on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., confirmed that the committee was briefed that there were a large number of Westerners, and some Americans, fighting in Syria, but he could not provide exact figures. Instead, we were directed to the U.S. government’s National Counterterrorism Center. In March, Director Matthew Olsen warned that a growing force of foreign fighters in Syria was becoming a major concern. "European governments estimate that more than 1,000 Westerners have traveled to join the fight against the Assad regime," Olsen said. "Dozens of Americans from a variety of backgrounds and locations in the United States have traveled or attempted to travel to Syria but to date we have not identified an organized recruitment effort targeting Americans." So, 1,000 is not "thousands." But perhaps other estimates are higher. The International Center for the Study of Radicalization at King’s College London has studied this issue extensively, collecting information from 1,500 sources to put together a tally. As of December 2013, the center estimated there were upto 11,000 individuals from 74 countries in Syria — nearly double its April 2013 estimate. Between 600 and 1,900 of those are from Western Europe. Additionally, about 32 to 305 fighters hail from Australia and Canada. Foreign fighters from the United States made up a small piece, between 17 and 60. The number has grown since December, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, the Director of the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, so the high-end estimates are well past 2,000 at this point. For example, French officials recently said they believe more than 700 of their residents have joined the conflict. The December estimate from King’s College London said 412 was the high figure. So it is quite possible between 2,000 and 3,000 foreign fighters from Western countries have entered Syria and Iraq, said Riedel, who has also studied these figures. Bruce Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University, took issue with Rogers’ statement because even high end estimates make "thousands" a stretch. It’s also worth noting that the estimates don’t factor in whether foreign fighters left the fight, returned or died, only that they were there at some point in the last three years. That’s not clear from Rogers’ statement. "I would say that most convincing analyses hold that there are indeed thousands of foreign fighters in Syria of whom about 2,000 are thought to be from Western countries," said Hoffman, who was an adviser to the Iraq Study Group. National security officials in the United States and with its allies are especially concerned about this trend. In January, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told Congress, "We’re seeing now the appearance of training complexes in Syria to train people to go back to their countries and, of course, conduct more terrorist acts." This scenario has apparently already been realized in Brussels, Belgium, the site of a deadly shooting at a Jewish museum. French authorities have arrested a suspect, a 29-year-old Frenchman who allegedly carried out the shooting after fighting with Islamist rebels in Syria. So the threat is certainly real, particularly in Europe, Gartenstein-Ross said, where travel to and from the Middle East is logistically easier. Our ruling Rogers said there are "thousands of Westerners and Americans in both the eastern Syria and Iraq who have Western passports" fighting with extremists. The highest estimates put the figure between 2,000 and 3,000, which would make it technically accurate, but somewhat exaggerated, to say "thousands." A March estimate from the U.S. government said there were about 1,000 Westerners in Syria. Only a few dozen of them are from the United States, though, and you might not get that impression from Rogers’ comment. So Rogers may have amplified the numbers a bit, but he did not overstate the threat. Experts we spoke with, along with U.S. and Western governments, have expressed legitimate concerns about this issue. Therefore, we rate Rogers’ statement Mostly True.

pomt-00253	Says Bruce Poliquin "voted to strip 117,000 Mainers of their insurance."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/05/maine-democratic-party/did-bruce-poliquin-vote-strip-117000-people-health/	Democrats are latching onto Republicans’ voting records on health care as a springboard to criticize their midterm opponents. The Maine Democratic Party picked up on that argument in a mailer on the U.S. House race in the state’s 2nd Congressional District between Republican incumbent Bruce Poliquin and Democratic challenger Jared Golden. The mailer claims that "Bruce Poliquin’s dangerous votes to cut health care coverage harm Maine families." It goes on to say that Poliquin "voted to strip 117,000 Mainers of their coverage." The attack is based on Poliquin’s votes to repeal President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act and replace it the with the Republican-backed American Health Care Act, which Poliquin voted for in May 2017. Let’s take a look at the estimates for Maine. Where does the 117,000 figure come from? When we checked with the Democrats, party spokesman Chris Glynn pointed to a Portland Press Herald story that references an analysis published in May 2017 by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. The center came up with a state-by-state estimate of coverage losses based on a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The latter report found that the American Health Care Act would increase the number of people who are uninsured by 23 million in 2026, compared to the ACA. The center calculated that approximately 116,700 Mainers would see a net loss in insurance coverage under the plan by 2026. Here’s how that breaks down: 57,300 fewer Medicaid recipients, 11,900 fewer people with employer-based coverage, and 47,500 fewer people with insurance obtained through the individual marketplace. The combined total of 116,700 represents about 9 percent of the state’s population. But the number is a bit inflated The ad is based on findings of a liberal-leaning group, so we contacted other research organizations considered more moderate, such as the Urban Institute’s Health Policy Center. The institute produced its own study of the state-by-state implications of the AHCA. Its prediction of uninsured Mainers was half as much as the Center for American Progress. In the report, the Urban Institute estimated that by 2022, Maine would experience an increase in the uninsured by 56,000 people. Urban Institute fellow Linda Blumberg couldn’t say exactly how the center divided up the CBO data, but explained that her organization got its estimation from a simulation that showed 23 million more people uninsured under the AHCA by 2022. The estimated effects by state varied significantly in terms of numbers and percentages, Blumberg told PolitiFact. This is a function of the distribution of health insurance coverage in each state, distribution of income, and a variety of other factors related to the population and how it varies by geographic location. In general, she said, states that had gained the most coverage under the ACA were estimated to lose the most under the AHCA. Blumberg pointed out that while CAP’s estimation is higher, both organizations find that large percentage increases in the uninsured would have occurred under the AHCA in the state of Maine, had it passed. The Kaiser Family Foundation, also estimated that premiums would have likely gone up in large swaths of Maine (particularly in Poliquin’s district, which encompasses the entire portion of the state north of Portland and Augusta) under the AHCA, thus pricing many Mainers out of insurance. The way the figure is presented The mailer makes a blanket statement saying that Poliquin’s vote was to "strip" 117,000 Mainers of health coverage. It would be more accurate to say that, according to the Center for American Progress, 117,000 people could either lose their coverage, see a rise in premiums and be priced out, or be forced into an exclusion — which would limit coverage for a particular condition, but not coverage for those people entirely. Another critical part of the coverage losses in Maine would likely lie in the Medicaid cutbacks of the AHCA, which was estimated to be cut by $880 million over a 10-year span. According to the Portland Press Herald, about 75 percent of Medicaid recipients under the state’s "MaineCare" program are children, low-income senior citizens who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare, and the disabled. Our ruling The Maine Democratic Party said Poliquin voted to strip 117,000 Mainers of their insurance. The group refers to his votes to repeal Obamacare and replace it with the Republican-backed American Health Care Act. The 117,000 figure comes from an analysis by the liberal Center for American Progress. It is the highest of estimates we’ve found. The ad’s language would lead the reader to believe that Poliquin literally voted to strip 117,000 Mainers of coverage, and that all would lose their coverage automatically. This is misleading. The statement is partially accurate and needs additional context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-08861	"In recent years, Rep. LaTourette has sponsored legislation that would increase spending by 551.6 percent."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/05/bill-oneill/bill-oneill-accuses-rep-steve-latourette-trying-ra/	To err once is human. To err repeatedly is just not good. Thus, the tale of Bill O’Neill, a Democratic congressional candidate who wants to unseat longtime incumbent Steve LaTourette in Ohio’s 14th Congressional District. O’Neill, a former state appeals judge, is unlikely to win a majority of the conservative vote in this race. He acknowledged to the Portage County Tea Party that he shares few of its political positions. But he doesn’t want LaTourette, a Republican, to get the Tea Party’s support either. So O’Neill wrote to the Portage County Tea Party on July 30 (and released the letter to the press), saying that LaTourette misled the organization. LaTourette had told the group July 6 that his legislative agenda paralleled the Tea Party’s, but that’s demonstrably untrue, O’Neill wrote. O’Neill cited some examples in the letter, the most damning being this: "In recent years, Rep. LaTourette has sponsored legislation that would increase spending by 551.6 percent." That’s an enormous increase, especially if you consider that the government spends trillions of dollars a year. But O’Neill’s letter stated it as a fact, without saying where that figure came from. So we asked O’Neill’s communications director, Eric Rosso, about it – and the problems began cascading from there. Rosso pointed us to a New York Times article and chart published Feb. 13, 2005. The article was about the Republican revolution of 1994, when the GOP won control of the House of Representative and promised a smaller government. But the GOP cost-cutters had lost their way, according to the Times, which cited an analysis showing that the Republicans had become big spenders. The analysis was done by the National Taxpayers Union, a nonprofit group that favors smaller government and lower taxes, and according to the Times, it showed congressional proposals for new spending during the 2003-2004 term. According to the chart in the Times, LaTourette had sponsored or co-sponsored bills during that term that would add $551.6 billion in new annual spending. Notice the dollar sign? We did, although you’d have to look at the top of the Times’ chart to be sure. But O’Neill missed it, calling the purported increase a hike of 551.6 percent. This was just the start of his error, although it was a doozy, because the difference between $551.6 billion and 551.6 percent is enormous. "That would be the equivalent of a $10 trillion a year spending increase," explained Pete Sepp, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation. Still, even $551.6 billion in new annual spending sounded like a lot of money. Was LaTourette really proposing hikes of that magnitude? No, it turns out. Which brings us to error No. 2. As we researched this, we asked Rosso if he was sure about the Times chart and whether it was really measuring dollars, not percentages. He looked, saw that error, and soon contacted the Portage County Tea Party, he says, to tell it that O'Neill’s letter should have said that LaTourette added $551.6 billion in new spending, not 551.6 percent. But O’Neill’s letter actually should have said neither. To understand, it helps to know where these figures come from. The National Taxpayers Union estimates how much each piece of legislation will drive up or bring down annual federal spending using data from the Congressional Budget Office, from bill sponsors, from outside studies and other sources it deems credible. The taxpayers group then creates a cost-and-savings list for each member of Congress, based on the member's sponsorship or co-sponsorship of bills. But there were two problems with the $551.6 billion figure that appeared in the Times. First, it was based on an interim study, covering only the first 18 months of the 2003-2004 term. It was the best available data when the Taxpayers Union put it out and the Times used it, says Sepp. But later that year, a more detailed analysis was completed and the figures changed. LaTourette's total for 2003 and 2004 went down to a comparatively small $150.2 billion. We spotted that quickly when looking at the taxpayer group's online database. How could the estimate have gone down so dramatically, from $551 billion to $150 billion? We spent a day going over the numbers and, thanks to the National Taxpayers Union staff, it finally made sense. The group revised its cost estimate downward after being convinced that a single, particularly expensive bill -- one that LaTourette co-sponsored -- would not cost nearly as much as originally thought. The bill, the MediKids Health Insurance Act, would have provided health care coverage for children ineligible for other programs. It was sponsored by California Democrat Pete Stark, but he had 84 co-sponsors. The bill never got far. The National Taxpayers Union initially estimated the bill would cost $477.8 billion a year, based on information from the bill’s sponsor and Census data. But it later revised the cost dramatically, reducing it to $74.7 billion a year, after it was presented with new information and a study from Emory University. This revision, which dropped LaTourette's total considerably, occurred in 2005. That’s a full five years ago, for those of you who are counting. This change in arithmetic would have jumped out at O'Neill or his staff had they looked at the data underlying their claim. So as a percentage, how much higher would LaTourette's proposals have pushed federal spending? Using government spending data for 2004, we calculate 6.5 percent. That’s 6.5 percent, not 551.6 percent. And it could be even smaller because of some projected budget offsets that the taxpayers group does not consider in its calculations, saying they're not reliable. If you go to the taxpayers group’s website, you’ll still find some extremely high figures that make LaTourette look like a profligate spender: $536.8 billion that he purportedly proposed in 2003 alone, and $784.7 billion in new spending during the 2001-2002 congressional session. Yet those figures are incorrect. The National Taxpayers Union agrees with us on that. Both figures included the enormously high -- and ultimately abandoned -- projections for the proposed MediKids program. During that 2001-2002 cycle, in fact, the taxpayers group initially estimated MediKids -- which LaTourette supported -- would add a whopping $700 billion a year in new spending. Although the Taxpayers Union never went back to take out that figure, Sepp acknowledges that it should be scaled way, way back. So O’Neill’s claim of 551.6 percent is way off. He’s guilty of not just sloppy math, but shallow and incomplete research. It’s not 551.6 percent, it’s more like 6.5 percent. That’s so far off that we need to set the meter ablaze. Pants on Fire!

pomt-08855	Democrats do not have a plan for extending the Bush tax cuts.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/06/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-said-democrats-have-no-plan-extend-som/	Sarah Palin disagreed with the Pants on Fire rating we gave her for the statement, "Democrats are poised now to cause this largest tax increase in U.S. history." So she let us have it, via a note on her Facebook page. "Yesterday, PolitiFact.com fact-checked my statement about the coming $3.8 trillion Obama tax hike – the largest tax increase in history. They did such a bad job of it, however, that I feel compelled to fact-check the fact-checkers," she began. Palin, the former governor of Alaska, made several points in her rebuttal, the primary one being that the Democrats haven't put forward a plan stating how they intend to address the expiring Bush tax cuts. Palin's comments on Fox News Sunday gave the impression that Democrats want to see them all expire. In fact, Democrats have repeatedly stated they only intend to let lower tax rates expire for individuals making more than $200,000 or couples making more than $250,000. And that's nowhere near the largest tax increase in history, as we noted in our rating. But Palin doesn't see it that way. "Unfortunately for PolitiFact, no such proposal exists. ... Plan? What plan? There is no plan. All we have is smoke and mirrors based on an old Obama campaign pledge that if elected, he would exempt families making less than $250,000 a year from 'any form of tax increases.' ... "To prevent PolitiFact from making similar mistakes in future, it would be helpful if the White House and the Democratic Congressional leadership finally mustered the courage to table their plans to let the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire. Mr. President, publish your proposals, and we'll duke it out. You can argue in favor of a multi-trillion dollar tax hike in an age of economic uncertainty and mass unemployment, and we'll argue for fiscal sanity combined with serious spending cuts. I for one look forward to such a debate." We're not trying to antagonize Gov. Palin, but President Barack Obama has indeed published his proposals in some detail -- at least twice, in the annual budget documents that the White House releases. The president's 2011 budget, for example, says on page 39, "Allow the Bush Tax Cuts for Households Earning More Than $250,000 to Expire." "In the last Administration, those at the very top enjoyed large tax breaks and income gains while almost everyone else struggled and real income for the middle class declined. Our Nation cannot afford to continue these tax cuts, which is why the President supports allowing those tax cuts that affect families earning more than $250,000 a year to expire and committing these resources to reducing the deficit instead. This step will have no effect on the 98 percent of all households who make less than $250,000." Lest you think that's too general and vague, there are detailed estimates in the budget summary tables, starting on page 164, for provisions such as, "Upper-income tax provisions devoted to deficit reduction: Expand the 28-percent rate and reinstate the 36-percent and 39.6-percent rates for those taxpayers with income over $250,000 (married) and $200,000 (single) ... Reinstate the personal exemption phaseout and limitation on itemized deductions for those taxpayers with income over $250,000 (married) and $200,000 (single) ... Impose 20-percent tax rate on capital gains and dividends for those taxpayers with income over $250,000 (married) and $200,000 (single)." In Congress, key Democratic leaders have indicated they are using the plan outlined in the federal budget as the framework for their legislation. The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on dealing with the expiring tax cuts. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the committee's chair, said in a July 14, 2010, statement, "I support extending the middle-class tax cuts permanently, as soon as possible, so working families can keep more of their hard-earned money." The committee released a budget analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation, "Estimated Effects on Economic Growth and Distribution." That document showed estimates for the cost to make the Bush tax cuts permanent for those who are now taxed at rates of 10 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, "and part of the 33%." That 33 percent tax bracket, by the way, includes taxpayers who make slightly below and slightly above the benchmarks Obama described. And then there's also the U.S. Treasury Department's "General Explanations of the Administration's Fiscal Year 2011 Revenue Proposals," known by policy wonks as "the green book." It outlines in even more detail how the Obama administration plans to increase taxes for high-earners and keep the current rates for everyone else. "It is very much an official statement of policy. It's what they propose to do," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "Obviously, Congress will do or won't do what it will. But I have heard no one on the Hill saying we should let everything expire." News coverage from other publications from The Wall Street Journal to our fellow fact-checkers at Factcheck.org have also noted the Democratic proposals and ideas on these issues. "The Democrats' plan seems to me to be quite explicit: keep the tax cuts for those under $250,000 and let those for the rich expire," said Norman Ornstein, resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, and a longtime watcher of Congress. "Does that mean never, ever taxing the under-$250 (thousand) populace? No. But it is a straightforward policy plan." Palin does make a good point that there is not pending legislation to make some parts of the Bush tax cuts permanent. Certainly, lots of unexpected and surprising things can happen when Congress actually begins to take up legislation. It's possible that Congress could become entirely gridlocked. If no legislation passes, the Bush tax cuts will indeed expire for all incomes. And, she's also right that on the campaign trail Obama promised not to raise "any" taxes on a family making less than $250,000. We rated that Promise Broken after Obama signed laws increasing taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning. There is also the controversial tax penalty in the new health care law that will tax those who don't have insurance, starting in 2014. Yet Obama also promised to extend the Bush tax cuts for lower incomes and let the Bush tax cuts expire for higher incomes. Those two promises are both rated In the Works. (See all of Obama's tax promises.) But Palin was distorting the facts when she said, "All we have is smoke and mirrors based on an old Obama campaign pledge." There is much more than that in the public record from both President Obama and Democrats in Congress. Frankly, we anticipated criticism when we published our report on Palin, but we were not anticipating the criticism that the Democrats are hiding their intentions on tax rates for people of lower incomes, or the claim that Obama has not published fairly detailed outlines of what he intends for the tax code. There is a plan, and you can see it on pages 39 and 164-165 of the budget. We rate Palin's statement False.

pomt-11198	A legal settlement that reined in Chicago police "resulted in approximately 236 additional victims killed and over 1,100 additional shootings in 2016 alone."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/may/15/jeff-sessions/aclu-really-blame-chicagos-murder-spike/	U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently told a conference on policing that a 58 percent spike in Chicago murders in 2016 could be blamed on the settlement of a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. The settlement, Sessions said, led to a sharp reduction in "stop and frisks" by officers. Speaking to the Gatlinburg Law Enforcement Training Conference in Tennessee on May 8, Sessions highlighted the conclusions of a recent research paper on Chicago violence by two University of Utah professors that focused on what it called the "ACLU effect." "They concluded the 58 percent increase was caused by the abrupt decline in ‘stop and frisks’ in 2015," Sessions said. "The settlement of that lawsuit resulted in a decline in stops from 40,000 per month to 10,000 per month. Arrests fell also. In sum, they conclude that these actions in late 2016, conservatively calculated, resulted in approximately 236 additional victims killed and over 1,100 additional shootings in 2016 alone." Sessions cited those statistics in stressing the consequences of restraining police. But was the attorney general’s interpretation of the study accurate? And, more significantly, was the research itself academically sound? We decided to take a look. The study Sessions’s remarks to the police crowd were premised on a significant factual inaccuracy. The ACLU did not sue Chicago over stop-and-frisk, though it had threatened to. The city entered a voluntary agreement to end the policy in August 2015, five months after the Illinois chapter of the civil rights group issued a report indicating Chicagoans were stopped more than four times as much as New Yorkers before that city discontinued stop-and-frisk. In the summer of 2014, Chicago police stopped more than 250,000 people without making an arrest, taking into question the policy’s effectiveness, the ACLU report stated. In the agreement on stop-and-frisk, Chicago police said officers would be trained to stop people for questioning only when there is a "reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct." Also imposed were more thorough requirements for documenting every stop that did occur. The University of Utah research by Paul G. Cassell, a former federal judge and current law professor, and economics professor Richard Fowles found the agreement between Chicago and the ACLU was followed by a steep decline in street stops by police — from 40,000 monthly down to less than 10,000. The study attributed a surge in homicides, from 480 in 2015 to 754 in 2016, to the sharp reduction in police stops. But the work by Cassell and Fowles has fueled sharp criticism from some criminal justice experts. John A. Eterno, a criminal justice professor at Molloy College in Rockville Centre, New York, identified the study’s limited time frame as one flaw. He noted that, while Chicago did indeed jump in 2016 following implementation of the ACLU agreement, they dropped somewhat the following year. "It doesn’t make sense," said Eterno, a retired New York City police captain. "The data is just not there to recommend what (the study) is recommending." Eterno noted that New York City’s murder rate declined or remained steady after it ceased stop-and-frisk — a fact Casell’s study suggested was an "anomaly." But the cities of Newark, New Jersey; Seattle, Washington; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, all experienced similar changes to their murder rates after contemplating stop-and-frisk changes, suggesting a broader trend, according to an earlier Washington Post story examining the issue. Edwin C. Yohnka, director of communications and public policy for ACLU of Illinois, also questioned the study’s dismissal of other factors potentially contributing to the uptick in murders, such as intense local reaction to public release in late 2015 of police dashcam video that showed a Chicago officer shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times. The video caused an uproar in Chicago and across the nation and led to the filing of first-degree murder charges against the officer, Jason Van Dyke. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose administration fought release of the video in the 2014 shooting for more than a year, also fired his police chief, Garry McCarthy, after a court ordered the footage be made public. The Utah researchers dismissed the video as "an unlikely candidate to explain the Chicago homicide spike." They contended that awareness of Van Dyke’s actions and allegations of a cover-up were "widespread" as early as April 2015 when the Chicago City Council agreed to pay McDonald’s family $5 million."They say everyone knew what was on the video before it was released," Yohnkasaid. "I don’t think that’s even close to being true."Cassell defended his work. "It’s always easy to throw out allegations that something else caused something and how do you falsify that particular claim?" said Cassell, a former federal judge appointed by President George W. Bush. "It’s not scientific if you just throw something out and say ‘well there's no way to test it.’" Our ruling Citing a study by University of Utah researchers, Sessions claimed that a legal settlement over police conduct between the ACLU and the city "resulted in approximately 236 additional victims killed and over 1,100 additional shootings in 2016 alone." Sessions misstated the ACLU’s involvement with the Chicago police department — there was no lawsuit. He did, however, correctly recite conclusions of the study. The overriding question, then, is whether the study reaches sound conclusions. On that, there is considerable disagreement. Chicago police stops did indeed dramatically plunge in the wake of a city agreement with the ACLU to overhaul its stop-and-frisk policy. A big jump in the city’s murder rate also coincided with the end of policy’s end. Even so, New York and other big cities did not experience hikes in violence and murders after curtailing stop-and-frisk. Other academics express serious reservations about the research methods used by the Utah study. The skeptics also point to an array of factors that may also have contributed to the murder and violence spike — not the least of which was the wrenching impact of the Laquan McDonald shooting video. There is considerable debate about that. There is some element of truth in the statement made by Sessions, but it also ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-00858	Says Secretary of State John Kerry, "when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/16/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-john-kerry-visited-nicaragua-1980s/	The controversy over a letter to Iran’s leaders signed by 47 Republican senators prompted a sudden surge of interest in past efforts by lawmakers to meet with foreign leaders. After taking hits from many Democrats and some Republicans who said the letter unwisely undercut President Barack Obama’s negotiations with Iran over its nuclear capabilities, Republicans pushed back with examples of congressional Democrats engaged in overseas freelancing when Republicans held the White House. For instance, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh charged that the late Democratic senator Ted Kennedy "sent a letter to then Soviet leader Yuri Andropov apologizing for Ronald Reagan and begging the Soviets not to overreact." We rated that claim False. Other claims have involved House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other lawmakers. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., appeared on CNN’s State of the Union on March 15 to answer questions from host Dana Bash about what she called the "rushed way" the letter was circulated as senators were trying to get out of town for a snowstorm. She asked McConnell to explain the process, but McConnell began by sidestepping her question. "Well, Dana, first, let me just say, I think this is a good case of selective outrage," McConnell said. "I remember reading about Sen. Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) when he was the majority leader flying to Moscow during the negotiations over the SALT II treaty, explaining to the Russians the Senate's role in treaty ratification. And John Kerry, when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism. So, look, members of Congress expressing themselves about important matters, not only at home, but around the world, is not unprecedented." Since Kerry, many years later, is a central player in the Iran negotiations, we decided to focus on the claim that referenced him. (Indeed, on Sunday, Kerry said on CBS’s Face the Nation that the letter from the 47 senators "was absolutely calculated directly to interfere with these negotiations. … That is unprecedented.") There are some differences between the recent examples and the Kerry visit -- including the fact that the Nicaragua episode involved two individual lawmakers rather than 87 percent of the Senate GOP caucus, including the majority leader. But we’ll leave it to readers to judge whether McConnell’s comparison is apt. Here, we’ll look instead at the more straightforward factual question of whether Kerry, "when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism." When we dug into the archives, we found that the episode in question occurred almost exactly 30 years ago, in April 1985. It came at a time when Ortega, Nicaragua’s communist strongman, was being challenged by a U.S.-aligned rebel movement known as the Contras. (Now, after a period out of office in the 1990s, Ortega is once again Nicaragua’s president.) Here’s how the Associated Press covered Kerry’s comments in an April 16, 1985, dispatch: "Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., said Monday he and another Vietnam-era veteran, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, plan to go to Nicaragua this week in part because of worries the United States is repeating the mistakes of Vietnam in Central America. "Kerry said he and Harkin plan to meet with Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and with business, church and opposition leaders. "Their trip comes the week before the Senate is scheduled to vote on President Reagan's request for an additional $14 million in aid to the ‘contra’ rebels seeking to overthrow Ortega's leftist government. "Sen. Harkin and I are going to Nicaragua as Vietnam-era veterans who are alarmed that the Reagan administration is repeating the mistakes we made in Vietnam," Kerry said. "Our foreign policy should represent the democratic values that have made our country great, not subvert those values by funding terrorism to overthrow governments of other countries," Kerry said. … Kerry said he and Harkin plan to leave Thursday for Nicaragua and return on Saturday." This provides support for what McConnell said. We see only two inaccuracies, both around the margins. First, the way McConnell structured his claim suggests that Kerry made these statements after flying to Managua. In reality, the AP article makes it clear that he made the statement in the days before he and Harkin left for Managua. Second, McConnell could have been more precise in how he relayed Kerry’s use of the word "terrorism." McConnell said Kerry "accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism." That’s a slight exaggeration of Kerry’s words. Kerry actually said that the Reagan administration was "funding terrorism to overthrow governments of other countries." A slight rhetorical difference, but a difference nonetheless. Still, McConnell’s claim is pretty close to the mark. Kerry’s staff did not dispute the accuracy of the AP report. They did point PolitiFact to an April 24, 1985, Washington Post story about the votes on the Contra aid bill. The article noted that the late Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., said it was "wrong, wrong, wrong" for Kerry and Harkin to visit Nicaragua the previous week and return with a negotiating proposal from President Daniel Ortega. According to the Post article, "Kerry responded by reading a letter from Secretary of State George P. Shultz endorsing the idea of congressional visits to all Central American nations, including Nicaragua." Kerry’s comments at the time appear to accurately portray what Schultz wrote. Here’s an excerpt; the full text is available here. "I strongly encourage members of Congress, of both parties and regardless of their views on Central America, to visit not only Nicaragua but all of the countries of the region," Schultz wrote. "I would urge them to spend as much time there as their schedules will permit, to travel outside the capitals, and to talk with citizens in and out of government and of all political persuasions in order to better understand the difficult issues we must all resolve in forgoing a bipartisan policy on Central America. The Department of State will be pleased to assist members of Congress with their travel in any way possible." Our ruling McConnell said Secretary of State John Kerry, "when he was a senator, flew to Managua and met with a communist dictator there, Daniel Ortega, and accused the Reagan administration of engaging in terrorism." We aren’t comparing Kerry’s Nicaraguan visit to the recent Republican senators’ letter to Iran’s leadership. But on the facts, McConnell got it mostly right, with two imperfections on the margins, regarding both the timeline and the exact phrasing of Kerry’s charge against the Reagan administration. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-06259	Says Mitt Romney once supported President Obama’s health care plan but now opposes it.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/28/democratic-national-committee/did-mitt-romney-flip-flop-health-care-reform-dnc-s/	A 30-second ad from the Democratic National Committee mocks Republican candidate Mitt Romney for changing position. "Two men trapped in one body. Mitt vs. Mitt," the ad proclaims, adding, "Two Mitts willing to say anything." The ad highlights Romney’s former positions on abortion and health care, and teases to a web site the Democrats have created, MittvMitt.com, which claims to document even more changes on policy. Here, we’re fact-checking the ad’s claims about health care. As governor of Massachusetts in 2006, Romney signed a law that intended for every Massachusetts resident to have health insurance. As we’ve noted in previous fact-checks, the national health care law that President Barack Obama signed in 2010 bears a strong resemblance to the earlier Massachusetts law. Both plans leave in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. The plans reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and by offering subsidies to help those with modest incomes buy insurance. When the plans are fully in place, everyone must have insurance or pay a penalty, a requirement called the "individual mandate." Employers that don't offer health insurance to their employees will have to pay fines, with exceptions for small businesses and a few other cases. In interviews after the law passed, Romney said that the ideas in the state plan could be used in other states or even nationally. "This is a Democratic ideal, which is getting health care for everybody but achieved in a Republican way, which is reforming the private marketplace and insisting on personal responsibility," Romney said in an interview with the Associated Press in 2006. The DNC video shows two clips of Romney speaking. The first says, "We put together an exchange, and the president’s copying that idea. I’m glad to hear that." Words on the screen say "pro-health reform." In the second clip Romney says, "Obamacare is bad news." Text says "anti-health reform." So was Romney for health care reform before he was against it? We decided to check it out. Romney’s supposedly positive comments on health reform are from an interview with CBS News in June 2009. Romney did say that he was glad the national law included an exchange, but he also had pointed criticism for Obama’s plan. He was particularly critical of creating a government-run health insurance plan, the so-called "public option." "One thing we did not do was put in place a government insurance program. We did not have a government plan where people bought government insurance. That’s a mistake. Going down that road would mean, down the road, hundreds of billions of dollars of additional costs," he said in the CBS interview. Throughout 2009, much of Romney’s criticism of the health care law focused on the public option. In his book No Apology: The Case for American Greatness, which was released in early 2010 before the law’s final passage, he said the public option was "simply a transitional step" toward the creation of a single-payer health care system. (A single-payer system is one in which government pays the bills for health care using tax revenues. Medicare, the government health insurance program for those over 65, is an example.) The public option became moot, though. A government-run health insurance option wasn’t popular enough among Democrats in the U.S. Senate, so it didn’t make it into the final version of the health care law. Still, the demise of the public option did not cause Romney to embrace the law. Instead, he has continued to criticize Obama’s plan as an overreach of federal power. Health care reform should be left to the states, he has said. "Our plan was a state solution to a state problem, and his is a power grab by the federal government to put in place a one-size-fits-all plan across the nation," Romney said in Michigan in May 2011, when he gave an extended presentation on his views on health care. Our ruling It’s true that the law Romney signed in Massachusetts in 2006 looks a great deal like the federal law Obama signed in 2010. But the video implies that Romney supported the federal law. We looked, but we couldn’t find any instances when Romney endorsed the federal law. Instead, we found Romney criticized Obama’s plan repeatedly, usually over the public option. After the public option was left out of the law, Romney still criticized the law as a federal power grab. Democrats could make an argument that Romney has changed position in opposing the type of plan he once supported. But in this ad, they imply he once supported Obama’s proposal. We don’t find that he did, and we rate the Democrats’ statement Mostly False.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2011-11-28T19:12:25	2011-11-28	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-05447	"The Democrat-controlled Senate, it hasn't passed a budget in more than 1,000 days."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/26/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-senate-dems-havent-passed-budget/	As the House prepared to begin floor consideration of several contending budget resolutions for fiscal 2013, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner released a video trumpeting the Republican position. "Ours is the only responsible budget in town," Boehner said about the GOP spending plan proposed by Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee’s Republican chairman. Other budget proposals included those from the House Democratic leadership, the conservative Republican Study Committee, the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus, plus a bipartisan budget inspired by the Simpson-Bowles Fiscal Commission and co-authored by Reps. Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat, and Steve LaTourette, the Ohio Republican. "Unfortunately, we're again waiting for leadership from the Democrats who run Washington," Boehner added, and then refreshed a favorite GOP talking point: "The Democrat-controlled Senate, it hasn't passed a budget in more than 1,000 days." Ultimately the House approved the Ryan budget by a near party-line 228-191 vote, but it isn’t expected to go anywhere in the Senate. PolitiFact Ohio, though, thought it’d check out the speaker’s claim about Senate budgets. It is similar to other statements that have been rated by PolitiFact national, PolitiFact Ohio, PolitiFact Wisconsin, PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact New Hampshire. Among them: "The Democrat-led Senate has failed to pass a budget for 750 days ... Senate Democrats have neglected one of their most basic responsibilities." (Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio) "Congress has worked for two years without passing a budget." (former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer) The U.S. Senate Democrats "have gone without any budget at all" for almost three years. (Ryan) Each of those statements cites the same starting point as Boehner’s claim of 1,000 days -- April 29, 2009. That was, according to the Congressional Research Service and news sources, when the Senate passed a budget resolution for fiscal 2010. No budget resolution has passed since then, so Boehner's time tally -- like those of the previously checked statements -- is accurate. The day his video statement was posted, March 28, 2012, was 1,064 days from that date. The PolitiFact rulings on these and other similar statements depended on their phrasing, but none was rated entirely True. Knowing how Congress comes up with its federal budget helps to explain why. Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years. If these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise. Budget resolutions are policy plans. They are not appropriations bills, or spending bills, which actually allocate money for specific purposes. If a budget resolution doesn’t pass, the federal government won’t go dark. In the absence of a budget resolution, appropriations bills have continued to allocate money. But, as a previous PolitiFact story said, "the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate." We wondered if the Senate, under Democratic control, had neglected its basic responsibility. Our PolitiFact colleagues in Wisconsin, Florida and at PolitiFact national had the same question, and concluded that neither party can claim superiority on budget resolutions. In 2010, the then Democratic-controlled House and Senate did not adopt a budget resolution or adopt a single spending bill "because the Democrats were afraid of being labeled big spenders," said Steve Ellis, a budget expert with Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending. Senate Democrats didn’t pass a fiscal 2011 budget because "Republicans were threatening to hijack the budget process and waste the American people’s time with pointless political votes," a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told PolitiFact Florida. "Faced with this obstruction, we decided it would be a more productive use of the American people’s time to move on and address other issues critical to middle-class families." Our Florida colleagues also found that the House and Senate have failed to pass a joint budget bill on four earlier occasions since 1983. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, under Democratic control in 2002, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind. For fiscal 1999, 2005 and 2007, the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress. Those facts lend perspective to Boehner’s statement. But on its face, Boehner’s statement is accurate. And it is more precisely worded than those that we’ve previously checked. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2012-04-26T06:00:00	2012-03-28	['None']

The New Jersey governor in a recent radio interview slammed the MTV show, repeating one of his favorite criticisms of its cast. The roommates in the Seaside Heights beach house aren’t from New Jersey. "Here's the deal, let's remember something for the people who are listening in your audience, these 'Jersey Shore' folks, they're from New York," Christie said Wednesday on 77 WABC’s ‘The Joe Crummey Show’. "They parachute these New Yorkers into Seaside Heights, New Jersey, and they try to make the whole country think this is New Jersey. It's not. It's bad for New Jersey. It's bad ... because it's a mischaracterization of who the people are here in New Jersey and so I've said all along that I think ‘Jersey Shore’ is bad." Christie last month vetoed a $420,000 tax credit -- dubbed the "Snooki subsidy" -- for the MTV show, saying the program "does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the State and its citizens." There are eight fist-pumping housemates who are the target of Christie’s scorn. Of them, two are New Jersey natives, PolitiFact New Jersey found. Samantha Giancola, or Sammi, and Deena Nicole Cortese were born and raised in New Jersey. Giancola hails from Hazlet and attended William Paterson University, where she was a midfielder on the women’s soccer team. Cortese is from New Egypt and attended Brookdale Community College in Lincroft. She joined the cast in season three, replacing Staten Island, N.Y.-native Angelina Pivarnick. Five of the six other cast members are New York natives. Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino was born in Staten Island but grew up in Manalapan. His publicist said Sorrentino still lives in New Jersey, but he also conducts business in Miami. Jenni "JWoww" Farley also grew up in New York, but now lives within Jersey’s borders, according to an MTV spokesperson. Vinny Guadagnino, Ronnie Magro and Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi are from New York. Rhode Island-native Paul DelVecchio is the only cast member from outside the tri-state area. An MTV spokesperson declined to comment on Christie’s remarks. But Polizzi spoke with The Star-Ledger in August. "It’s the 'Jersey Shore.' We’re not trying to represent Jersey," she said then. "Even if you’re from Africa, you’re gonna come here." Our ruling The governor said the cast members of the "Jersey Shore" are from New York and misrepresent "who the people are here in New Jersey." Sammi and Deena are true Jersey girls -- born and raised. "The Situation" was born in New York, but grew up and still lives in New Jersey. We think he deserves some Jersey cred. Four New Yorkers -- one of whom, "JWoww," has since moved to New Jersey -- and a Rhode Island-native round out the rest of the crew. We rate Christie’s statement Half True.

"And unless you're pleased with the way the federal government has been running anything lately, I don't think that it's going to be real pleasing for Americans to consider health care being taken over by the feds." Problem is, Obama's plan keeps the free-market health care system intact, particularly employer-based insurance. It is not a goverment-run program and is very different from the health care systems run by the government in some European countries. Obama's plan essentially takes the health care system as it is today and seeks to expand it to the uninsured. The plan increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. It also creates pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. And it outlines several strategies aimed at reining in costs for everyone, such as streamlining medical record-keeping and emphasizing preventive care. Obama's plan does not mandate coverage, except for children. Obama said often during the Democratic primary campaign that he did not include a mandate for adults so as not to penalize people with modest incomes. His reasoning for not including a mandate for adults was this: If premiums don’t drop enough after his reforms are implemented, people will still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won’t. Obama’s argument is that if you then fine them, you’re essentially punishing the poor — and they will still be uninsured. Obama said he hopes his plan will lower costs enough that many of the estimated 47-million uninsured will sign up without a mandate, and a mandate will come later. Obama has said he would like it to be universal, in that everyone has health care coverage. So Palin is mostly wrong about Obama's plan having a mandate; it only has one for children. He would like it to be universal at some point. She also emphasized that Obama proposes government-run health care, a statement that is completely inaccurate. Taking all that together, we rate her statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2008-10-02T00:00:00	2008-10-02	['None']
pomt-03029	"Violent crime is up since the last year of Sharpe James’ administration. This year it’s higher. … The unemployment rate is almost 15 percent. The high school dropout rate is over 50 percent."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/oct/10/steve-lonegan/steve-lonegan-claims-violent-crime-newark-also-cit/	Violent crime higher now than eight years ago, unemployment well into the double digits, and more than half of Newark’s high schoolers forgoing their education. Are things that bleak in the Brick City? Republican Steve Lonegan, who is challenging Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a Democrat, for a vacant U.S. Senate seat on Oct. 16, addressed those issues during a Sept. 23 interview with radio host John Gambling on WOR 710 AM. "Violent crime is up since the last year of Sharpe James’ administration," Lonegan told Gambling. "This year it’s higher. … The unemployment rate is almost 15 percent. The high school dropout rate is over 50 percent." Those statistics offer a troubling view of the city and while there’s some accuracy to the claims, they leave out critical details. Let’s first address violent crime, then go to unemployment and education. Lonegan campaign spokesman Will Gattenby said in an e-mail that the violent crime claim is based on numbers from the FBI’s annual detailed report on crime statistics known as the Uniform Crime Report. Lonegan’s camp compared UCR data from 2005 and 2012. The FBI’s UCR defines violent crime in four categories: murder and nonnegligent homicide; forcible rape; robbery; and aggravated assault. The number of violent crime offenses in Newark last year totaled 3,219. The 2005 total was 2,821. James Allen, Booker’s communications director, said it would be "a fair benchmark" to use 2006 to measure violent crime since James, also a Democrat, left office that year and Booker succeeded him on July 1, 2006. The results are the same, though. When compared with 2012 UCR data, overall violent crime is up, as Lonegan claims, but he fails to note that offenses in three categories have fallen: homicides and manslaughters, rapes, and aggravated assaults. Here's a look at Newark's violent crime statistics, according to the data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report: YEAR POPULATION VIOLENT CRIME TOTAL MURDER/NON-NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE FORCIBLE RAPE ROBBERY AGGRAVATED ASSAULT 2005 281,063 2,821 97 83 1,250 1,391 2006 280,877 2,839 105 87 1,288 1,359 2012 278,906 3,219 95 55 1,976 1,093 Sources: FBI website, Crime In The United States (Uniform Crime Report), 2005, 2006, 2012 Robberies are driving that category's increase, according to Allen, who said the stealing of iPhones and smartphones represents a significant number of those crimes. "While the rise of smartphones over the last five years has made them increasingly prevalent targets for robberies, the generic UCR classification of ‘violent crime’ gives equal weight to a smartphone robbery and a first-degree murder -- despite the vastly different nature and frequency of those crimes," Allen said in an e-mail. Next, unemployment. Newark’s unemployment rate has largely been stuck between 14 percent and 16 percent for much of Booker’s tenure as mayor, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It’s worth noting, however, that Booker’s tenure also bookends the recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. BLS data shows a sharp uptick in the city’s unemployment rate during the recession and after it ended. Comparatively, Newark’s unemployment measured as a percent change is lower than unemployment increases for the state and nation, according to BLS data. Finally, let’s look at Newark’s dropout rate, which Lonegan said exceeds 50 percent. "The number of students who start 9th grade and graduate within four years via HSPA is 32.2%," Gattenby told us. That methodology has been cited by Gov. Chris Christie, who has claimed multiple times that the graduation rate for an incoming Newark freshman who finishes high school in four years is 23 percent. The Truth-O-Meter handed Christie a Pants on Fire for repeating the claim. Like Christie, Lonegan looks only at one group of students -– those who graduate by passing the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA), a state standardized test. But there are other routes to graduation, including the Alternative High School Assessment. Also, some students are exempt from testing. In total, 55 percent of students graduated from Newark’s high schools in four years, according to data from the 2009-2010 school year, PolitiFact New Jersey determined in January 2012. Jarrad Toussant, Booker’s senior education adviser, told us that the district’s graduation rate for June 2012 was 68 percent. The remaining 32 percent either graduated after more than four years or dropped out, he said. The Newark School District, which Toussant said tracks dropout data, did not respond to our request for comment. Our ruling Lonegan said, "Violent crime is up since the last year of Sharpe James’ administration. This year it’s higher. … The unemployment rate is almost 15 percent. The high school dropout rate is over 50 percent." Overall violent crime is up whether measured from 2005 or 2006 to 2012, but the increase is skewed by a sharp uptick in robberies, according to UCR statistics. Violent crime is down in other categories. Unemployment during Booker’s tenure has hovered between 14 percent and 16 percent, but the impact of the recession on those figures can’t be disregarded. Lonegan’s claim about Newark dropouts is based on students who graduate following a standardized testing route, but that doesn’t consider all of the district’s high schoolers. There are other routes to graduation. Each claim has a varying degree of accuracy to it, but each claim also leaves out important details and context. That’s why we rate the overall claim Half True.

pomt-13375	Says "no, you’re wrong," responding to the assertion that stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/28/donald-trump/debate-donald-trump-says-stop-and-frisk-constituti/	Donald Trump has been pushing for cities to expand stop-and-frisk policies in order to combat crime, but some argue it’s a form of racial profiling. At the Sept. 26 presidential debate, moderator Lester Holt asked Trump what he would do to heal racial divides. Trump said the country needs to "bring back law and order" in inner cities and praised stop-and-frisk policies in Chicago and New York. Then Holt jumped in with what sounded like a fact-check. "Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men," Holt posed to Trump. "No, you're wrong," Trump responded. "It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed." Whenever there’s a disagreement over who has their facts right, we’re compelled to sort it out. So the question of whether stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York piqued our interest. As it turns out, Holt and Trump are both a little bit right and a little bit wrong. But Trump's more wrong than Holt. Stop-and-frisk is the practice of a police officer stopping and questioning a person (the stop), then patting the person down for weapons (the frisk). Stops and frisks are legal, in New York and everywhere else. In its decision in the 1968 case Terry vs. Ohio, the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that an officer can legally stop a person if the officer has reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. And if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that this person is armed, he or she can legally frisk the person for weapons. Because of that reasonable suspicion standard, the court said these stops would be consistent with the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable search and seizure. A 2013 case before the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Floyd vs. City of New York, raised the issue of the constitutionality of New York City’s stop-and-frisk policies between 2004 and 2012. Judge Shira Scheindlin found that New York City had been conducting unconstitutional stops and frisks on two grounds: Officers were stopping and frisking people without reasonable suspicion, in violation of Terry and the Fourth Amendment; and a disproportionate number of those stopped and frisked were minorities, in violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. "Both statistical and anecdotal evidence showed that minorities are indeed treated differently than whites," Scheindlin wrote in her opinion. "For example, once a stop is made, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be subjected to the use of force than whites, despite the fact that whites are more likely to be found with weapons or contraband." So Holt was right to note that a court found New York City had an unconstitutional stop-and-frisk policy because police had been disproportionately targeting black and Hispanic people. But the Floyd case was specific to New York City’s particular way of conducting stops and frisks between 2004 and 2012. Scheindlin did not rule all stops and frisks unconstitutional, and her findings were consistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in Terry. Scheindlin ruled that New York City could continue to conduct stops and frisks as long as they made some changes. "Stop-and-frisk was not outlawed," said Andrew Schaffer, former deputy commissioner for legal matters for the New York Police Department and an adjunct professor at New York University Law School. The ruling only sought to correct a supposed problem of officers making stops without a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and disproportionately stopping black and Hispanic people. Schaffer added, "The Floyd decision in New York did not and could not overrule Terry." "The judge made it very clear that she was not finding stop-and-frisk as a general practice unconstitutional," said David Rudovsky, a leading civil rights attorney and senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. So Holt’s claim — "stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York" — isn’t quite precise because it makes it seem as if the judge decided that all stops and frisks were unconstitutional in New York, when really her ruling said New York had to stop and frisk differently. New York cops still stop and frisk today. But it also isn’t quite correct for Trump to call Holt’s claim "wrong" because that implies there was no finding of unconstitutionality in New York’s practices or that Scheindlin’s ruling was tossed out, when really it still stands. There might be some confusion in the public conversation over stop-and-frisk because it seems the public has come to associate the phrase "stop-and-frisk" with unconstitutional practices, like officers stopping people for no reason, said Ian Weinstein, professor at the Fordham University School of Law in New York. "Constitutional stop-and-frisk is legal across America, and the unconstitutional version is illegal across America," Weinstein said. For some additional context, we wanted to know what Trump was talking about when he said the case "was taken away" from Scheindlin. After Scheindlin ruled against them, lawyers representing New York City went to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, a rung above Scheindlin’s court. A panel of Second Circuit judges decided to remove Scheindlin from all future proceedings in the Floyd case because Scheindlin had spoken to the media while the case was pending and because the panel believed Floyd had been inappropriately assigned to her. The panel did not make this decision because Scheindlin was "anti-police," as Trump said in the debate. The panel also did not reverse or throw out Scheindlin’s ruling. A few months later, at the start of 2014, Bill de Blasio replaced Michael Bloomberg as the mayor of New York, and he decided to drop the appeal, accept Scheindlin’s ruling, and dramatically reduce the frequency of stops and frisks in New York City. Our ruling Responding to the assertion that stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, Trump said "no, you’re wrong." Trump has a point that a judge’s ruling in a 2013 case did not declare stop-and-frisk as a general practice unconstitutional in New York. Stop-and-frisk is still legal and still takes place in New York and across the country. But his claim ignores that a judge did decide that the manner in which New York previously conducted stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional and that her ruling still stands. Trump had argued that stop-and-frisk was working effectively in New York City to reduce crime during the time period covered by the lawsuit. Trump’s statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-07128	"The president came in and campaigned against me 12 times."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/17/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-still-claiming-obama-made-dozen-ca/	In a June 13 interview on Fox News’ Hannity program, Gov. John Kasich retold an old tale — how he beat incumbent Gov. Ted Strickland despite the Democrat getting repeated help from President Barack Obama, who jetted to the Buckeye State on Air Force One to help his party mate. If this is starting to sound familiar, it should. "The president came in and campaigned against me 12 times," Kasich told Sean Hannity. "And, you know, I mean, it didn’t work." Kasich made the comment after Hannity asked the governor about his invitation to play golf with the president on June 18, and how comfortable he would be with Obama given their political differences. But did Obama really come to Ohio 12 times to campaign against Kasich? Kasich has made this claim several times since being elected and Politifact Ohio has checked it and rechecked it. And while it is true Obama came to Ohio in 2010 to help Strickland with his bid for re-election, Politifact Ohio has also noted that the governor is clearly overstating the scope of the president’s assistance. The facts bear repeating, so here it goes. Obama did indeed visit Ohio 12 times between taking office in January 2009 and the November 2010 election. But a review of Obama’s travel schedule and the speeches he made offers a different picture. One of Obama’s visits, for instance, occurred March 3, 2009, a full two months before Kasich even announced his candidacy. And of Obama’s 12 trips, nine were made under the guise of official White House business during which he pushed specific policies – mainly health care reform and the economic stimulus bill. Two trips in 2010, Oct. 17 and Oct. 31, were made specifically to campaign for Strickland and the Democratic ticket. And on a trip made Aug. 18, 2010, Obama hosted a fund-raiser for Strickland and in a separate event pushed his economic polices. Transcripts from Obama’s non-campaign visits show he referred to Republicans in Washington many times in arguing that his policies are better than GOP plans. But Obama never mentioned the governor’s race or Kasich. At a campaign rally Oct. 17 before 35,000 people in Columbus, Obama never mentioned Kasich. He did name Kasich twice when he spoke at an Oct. 31 rally in Cleveland. So, by that recounting, Obama actually visited Ohio just three times to directly campaign or raise money for Strickland and only once in those three trips did the president actually mention Kasich by name. Kasich’s campaign team argues that every time Obama trekked into Ohio during a campaign season, his visibility alone could be taken as a campaign stop for Strickland, who trailed in the gubernatorial race the entire way and ended up losing by two percentage points. "Whether it’s one visit or 12 visits, Ohio is a key state and clearly the President wanted to keep his party in control of it going into 2012," Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said Thursday. And on several of the "non-campaign" stops, Strickland was at the president's side, Nichols rightfully points out, which certainly gives the impression that Obama was visiting to stomp for Strickland. But conversely, Ohio is an important political state for anyone seeking to be elected or re-elected president and Obama, facing re-election next year, could just as well have been trying to maintain and strengthen his own political fortunes in this bellwether state. The governor does have reason to be proud of his election victory. Here’s a completely accurate statement the governor could use that is remarkable unto itself: Kasich was the first person to defeat an incumbent Ohio governor since 1974. That alone makes his victory historically significant. As we have said before, there is a small element of truth in Kasich’s claim. Obama did make 12 visits to Ohio prior to the November 2010 election. But he made just three trips directly on Strickland’s behalf and he mentioned Kasich by name in his remarks on just one. Those are critical facts that give a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, that means Kasich’s claim rates Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06875	"The federal government is spending 25 percent of our entire economy versus 100 years ago we spent only 2 percent."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/31/ron-johnson/us-senator-ron-johnson-says-federal-government-spe/	As the debt-ceiling crisis deepened, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, lambasted Democrats for failing to put together a public plan to bring down federal spending. Johnson, in an appearance on CNBC’s "Squawk Box," argued constitutional limits on government spending were the only way to keep politicians’ hands off the pocketbooks of their constituents. To illustrate his point, the freshman Republican reached way back into the history books. "We’ll increase the debt ceiling, give the president what he wants, and all we’re saying is, ‘Let’s pass a constitutional limitation to the size of government,’ which by the way is the root cause of the problem," Johnson said. "The federal government is spending 25 percent of our entire economy versus 100 years ago, we spent only 2 percent. The problem is the size, the scope, all the regulations and the cost of government." PolitiFact National has tested the current end of this claim and found it True. But the back end is new territory. Has the federal government’s share of the nation’s economy really jumped twelvefold in a century? A frequently cited source on the history of federal spending is the White House Office of Management and Budget. Its website shows the federal share of "gross domestic product" -- the GDP, essentially our total economic output for a year -- was 25 percent in 2009, 23.8 percent in 2010 and is estimated at 25.3 percent for 2011. In 1930, by contrast, the federal government made up just 3.4 percent of the economy. There are many reasons for the change -- ones that go beyond year-to-year growth in spending for existing programs. Before the 1930s, the federal government was basically the post office, veterans benefits, a small defense department and national-debt payments, according to an official government summary and experts we consulted. Local government was dominant. World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam pushed up the federal role considerably, and when that spending waned, it was more than offset as the country aged into Social Security and the Great Society programs -- including Medicare and Medicaid -- took off. The federal share of the economy went up and down in the 1980s and 1990s, amid recessions, higher debt interest payments, higher health care spending and tax cuts. Homeland security and military spending in Iraq and Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks pushed the number up, as did the recession that began in 2007. The largest part of the growth since the 1950s, the Office of Management and Budget reports, came from a category that includes Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, deposit insurance, and means-tested entitlements such as Medicaid, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, the refundable portions of the Earned Income and Child Tax Credits. "A big part of the difference is that as the U.S. got richer, a lot more services were demanded, and a whole layer of protections unknown in 1910 got assumed by the government," said Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist. As we noted, the current numbers cited by Johnson are accurate. But what about 100 years ago? The OMB calculations on the federal share of the economy go back only to 1930, because GDP was not calculated before then. But earlier spending numbers are readily available, and several researchers have produced calculations dating back to the early 1900s. They use U.S. Census Bureau data that measured the economy in a different way, but produce comparable numbers, according to the economists we consulted. Johnson’s staff pointed us to 1902. We also looked at other years in that first decade of the century, to see if they were consistent with the year in question. Economists Robert Gordon at Northwestern University and Randall Holcombe at Florida State University independently calculated a federal share right around 2 percent in that time period. Our calculations produced a similar result. So Johnson’s numerical claim is on target. At the advice of our experts, though, we took one more step: We looked at what the combined local-state-federal share was a century ago compared to today. If local government was predominant and the federal government minuscule in earlier times, is it possible that all government spending combined took up the same share of the economy as today? No, we found. Holcombe said the total government share has gone up markedly, though not on the order of the twelvefold increase in the federal-only share. Gordon confirms that. Let’s tally this up. Johnson turned the clock way back in criticizing the size of the federal government. He claimed it took up just 2 percent of the economy a century ago, but 25 percent today. Johnson’s reference hearkens back to an entirely different era in American governance -- and it’s not clear just how far back in time on a percentage basis Johnson thinks we should go. But based on widely available, and generally accepted, historical data, he accurately described the dramatic rise of Washington, D.C., in our economic lives over the last 100 years. We rate his statement True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2011-07-31T09:00:00	2011-07-25	['None']

pomt-11271	"California State Assembly bill would ban the (sale of the) Bible!"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/26/oath-keepers/no-california-bill-would-not-ban-bible-sales/	Freedom of religion and speech are fundamental to American life, and some conservatives warn that a California bill threatens both. "California State Assembly bill would BAN the Bible!" said the April 19 headline on the Oath Keepers website. "Whatever happened to Free Speech and Religious Freedom? Of course, this is the People’s Republic of California, so such things are to be expected. They are so far down the totalitarian, Globalist path that they are oblivious to any sane, sensible ideas." The controversy is over California bill AB 2943, a measure that puts strict limits on programs that aim to change a person’s sexual orientation. The legislation, which passed out of the state assembly and over to the Senate, bans any "advertising, offering to engage in, or engaging in sexual orientation change efforts with an individual." The bill does this by amending the state’s consumer protection law, which covers such things as false advertising, selling defective goods and the like. So, the prohibition would only apply when money changed hands. Someone needs to be selling and someone needs to be buying a service called "sexual orientation change efforts" for this bill to apply. The Oath Keeper headline (since changed) spoke of a complete ban on the Bible with no mention of selling. But in the video interview that went along with the post, the Oath Keeper host asked, "Would this prohibit the sale of the Bible?" We’re checking whether the law would ban the sale of the holy book. While the odds are remote, some legal scholars said the law as written could lead to issues. A slender link to the Bible Even some opponents to AB 2943 argue that it likely wouldn’t ban the sale of Bibles across the board. "It is virtually impossible that California will immediately attempt to ban the sale of the Bible itself," wrote Robert Gagnon in the Federalist. "But citations of Bible verses in the context of declaring homosexual practice and transgenderism to be morally debased could indeed get one into serious trouble with the law if it comes in the context of selling or advertising a product or service." Concerned Women for California of America, a group that "promotes biblical values" through prayer and advocacy, told lawmakers that the bill "puts in question the sale of books, participation in events, and related activities." So from opponents, the impact on Bible sales is a question, not a certainty. Room for debate By one estimate, Americans buy about 25 million Bibles each year. Based on population, about 3 million would be sold in California. UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh dismissed the idea that simply selling the Bible would be affected, because people buy Bibles for many reasons that lie outside the bill. "The ordinary sale would not be an effort to change sexual orientation," Volokh said. But on the other hand, Volokh can imagine circumstances when things would get muddy. "There needs to be a practice that seeks to change the person's behavior," Volokh said. "A Bible sold with an eye to that could be affected by this law." Paul Horwitz at the University of Alabama School of Law said there’s a serious question that the law "could include books arguing that one should refrain from homosexuality lest one be condemned or damned, and thus could include the Bible, at least as some read it." Apart from any impact on Bible sales, the core ban on any program sold to change someone’s sexual orientation might itself fail on constitutional grounds, according to Jefferson Powell at Duke Law School. The bill fails to define what it aims to block, he said. "The law can’t constitutionally apply to many forms of speech that have the purpose of persuading people not to act on, or enabling them not even to feel, same-sex attraction," Powell said. "But the bill’s language displays no concern to tailor its scope to avoid those situations." If the bill failed to pass constitutional muster, then the whole thing would be thrown out, along with any possible impact on the sale of Bibles. Ample ground for disagreement The legal dispute we found centered on whether the Bible itself argues for changing one’s sexual orientation and whether every paid effort to dissuade a person from homosexuality meets the legal definition of a sexual orientation change effort. Before all else, said University of Miami law professor Caroline Corbin, the Bible as a book lies outside the bill’s reach. "The bill prohibits the provision of certain services and advertisements of those services, and the Bible is neither of those things." But what if the Bible were part of some sort of sexual orientation conversion program? Douglas Laycock at the University of Virginia said "no judge is that stupid" to view the Bible so narrowly. "The Bible is a vast collection of books," Laycock said. "Only a few brief passages say anything about same-sex sexual conduct, and those don't say anything about sexual orientation, or about changing it." In short, the Bible by itself is not a how-to kit for sexual orientation conversion. George Washington law professor Catherine Ross echoed that point and emphasized that simply calling homosexuality a sin would not meet the definition of a "sexual orientation change effort." "A person selling or promoting the Bible could say that in this book you will discover what is good and bad and the book will tell you that to be LGBT is really bad," Ross said. "But even that doesn't take the next step, and say that when you are convinced by reading this, the next step is to get into a Sexual Orientation Change program. And the statute is only triggered when a person promotes or advertises the Sexual Orientation Change Effort solution." Ross also noted that the proposed law regulates commercial speech, which she said the Bible is not. "The brief passages in the Bible that concern homosexuality would keep the book as a whole well below the standard for triggering the statute," Ross said. "An offer to sell a Bible would not bring the content of the Bible itself into the definition of commercial speech." Our ruling The Oath Keepers group said that a California law would ban the sale of the Bible. We found that even some opponents of the bill don’t go that far. The general consensus is that the Bible covers a lot of ground and the proposed law would have no effect on the ordinary sale of Bibles. If the law had any impact at all, it would be on those occasions when a Bible is sold in conjunction with a program to change someone’s sexual orientation. This is a point where legal scholars differ. Some say the law could touch the sale of a Bible, while others believe the Bible lies outside the scope of the law. But even assuming the law might have an impact, with millions of Bibles sold in California, the weight of evidence suggests the bill might only touch a fraction of them.

pomt-08781	"The Republicans have 2 percent of the Muslim vote.''	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/20/tamara-holder/crowd-gop-big-tent-doesnt-include-many-muslims/	Republicans already have minimal support among the Muslim community, so they better watch what they say about building a new Mosque near Ground Zero, said Tamara Holder, a liberal Fox News Contributor in an August 18, 2010, segment of Sean Hannity. "I just like to make the point that we can argue all day whether this is a moral issue or religious issue or whatever. But the bigger issue here on this political show is that the Republicans have 2 percent of the Muslim vote, 2 percent. Most Muslims, like 77 percent, are Americanized. They've been here for 20 years. Not all Muslims are radical," Holder said. It's a little known secret that we're suckers for arguments involving statistics, so we decided to look into Holder's claim that Republicans have 2 percent of the Muslim vote. We began by reading American Muslim Voters and the 2008 Election, a report put out in January 2008 by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a non-profit group that works to promote a positive image of Islam and Muslims in America. The study results come from a random sample telephone survey of 1000 American Muslim registered voters. The group found that 49 percent of Muslim Americans consider themselves Democrats, 36 percent independent, and 8 percent Republicans. The survey, taken before the 2008 election, also asked participants about the presidential candidates. Nearly 45 percent said that they "don't know" or "haven't decided," but among those who declared a preference, Democrats took the lead. "Republican Ron Paul, who is regarded by many Muslims as fair-minded, was mentioned by 2 percent, more than any other Republican hopeful," the report stated. Those numbers are consistent with at least one post-election analysis. On November 7, 2008, the American Muslim Taskforce on Civil Rights and Elections, an umbrella group for various Muslim advocacy groups, released the results of phone interviews with 637 registered Muslim American voters. The organization found that among those who voted, 88.9 percent backed President Barack Obama; only 2.2 percent voted for Republican John McCain. Then there is the Muslim West Facts Project -- a partnership between Gallup and the Coexist Foundation -- which released Muslim Americans: A National Portrait in early 2009. According to the report, 49 percent of Muslims identified themselves as Democrat; 37 percent said that they were independent and 8 percent considered themselves Republican. Gallup researchers did not analyze what percent of Muslim Americans voted for President Obama, but they found that from January through the end of October 2008, eleven percent said that they would vote for McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin. Eric Nielsen, who heads Gallup media relations, told us during a phone interview that the 11 percent is a "rough proxy" of how many Muslim Americans actually voted for the Republican duo. Finally, the Pew Research Center published Muslim Americans in May 2007. The survey found that 11 percent of Muslim Americans identified as Republicans, 63 percent as Democrats, and 26 percent as either independent or having no leaning. During the 2004 presidential election, 14 percent voted for Bush and 71 percent voted for Kerry, according to the study. So, to recap, Holder claimed that Republicans only have 2 percent of the Muslim vote. We found that roughly 8 to 11 percent of Muslims consider themselves Republicans. Muslims voted overwhelmingly for John Kerry during the 2004 election, and at least one post-election analysis shows that McCain only received 2 percent of the vote in the 2008 election. Gallup does not have data on how many Muslims voted for McCain, but we're told that it may be roughly 11 percent, a bit higher than what Holder claimed. Still, that's quite low compared to the support that Democrats have, so Holder's underlying point that Republicans lack significant Muslim backing is valid. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-03503	"Nearly 6 out of 10 believe that money and wealth should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of the people in the U.S."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/06/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-six-10-americans-say-wealth-sh/	In a recent tweet, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., reiterated one of his most frequent themes -- income inequality in the United States. "Nearly 6 out of 10 believe that money and wealth should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of the people in the U.S.," Sanders tweeted. We wondered: Is the percentage holding that view really that high? Actually, it is -- and it hasn’t changed much for almost three decades. The Gallup polling organization has been asking the following question periodically since 1985: "Do you feel that the distribution of money and wealth in this country today is fair, or do you feel that the money and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of the people?" The most recent data comes from a Gallup survey taken April 4-7, 2013. The result: 59 percent agreed that "the money and wealth in this country should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of the people," while 33 percent said the distribution was fair. The poll had a margin of sampling error of 4 percentage points. Gallup has asked the question 12 times since 1985, with the percentage saying that wealth should be more evenly distributed keeping within a fairly narrow band, ranging between 56 percent and 68 percent. Gallup also reported a partisan divide: More than eight in 10 Democrats said money and wealth need to be more evenly distributed, compared with 28 percent of Republicans. It’s worth noting that there is less agreement on how this situation should be remedied. Gallup has periodically paired the question above with one additional question: "Do you think our government should or should not redistribute wealth by heavy taxes on the rich?" During the 2012 presidential election, the candidates divided sharply on this question, with President Barack Obama favoring higher taxes on the rich and Republican Mitt Romney opposing any tax hikes. Support for higher taxes on the wealthy has zig-zagged between mild approval and mild disapproval since the 1980s, while backing for higher taxes on the rich has ranged from 45 percent to 52 percent. Most recently, in April 2013, Gallup found that 52 percent supported higher taxes on the wealthy while 45 percent opposed such a policy -- the second-largest gap in favor of higher taxes since the question was first asked. (In 2008, 51 percent supported higher taxes on the wealthy, while 43 percent were opposed.) Our ruling Sanders tweeted that "nearly 6 out of 10 believe that money and wealth should be more evenly distributed among a larger percentage of the people in the U.S." The senator has accurately reported the results of a longstanding Gallup question, so we rate his claim True.

pomt-03969	"I still live in the same working-class neighborhood I grew up in."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/feb/14/marco-rubio/look-marco-rubios-working-class-west-miami-home/	Forget for a minute about the awkward grasp for a plastic bottle of Poland Spring before millions on live TV. There’s something else in Sen. Marco Rubio’s response to the State of the Union on Tuesday that is riling up the blogosphere. Where does Marco Rubio live? President Barack Obama loves to say people who don’t agree with him are rich, Rubio said on Feb. 12, 2013. Rubio went on to emphasize his own middle-class Republican cred. "Mr. President, I still live in the same working-class neighborhood I grew up in. My neighbors aren’t millionaires. They’re retirees who depend on Social Security and Medicare. They’re workers who have to get up early tomorrow morning and go to work to pay the bills. They’re immigrants, who came here because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy." Some bloggers jabbed Rubio for omitting details about his West Miami crib. The headline of a post from Miami gossip columnist Jose Lambiet: "Marco Rubio: I still live in da hood -- sorta!" Lambiet included a slew of photos of Rubio’s home on his blog, including his living room, kitchen, and backyard pool, trampoline, wooden fort and patio surrounded by a tall green hedge. Miami New Times dinged Rubio for his "humbleboast." What’s their beef? One, Rubio did not mention his home is for sale. Rubio wants to sell the four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom home and buy one in D.C. so he can see his kids more often, spokesman Alex Conant told The Daily Caller in January. Rubio rents a room in a Capitol Hill apartment, Conant said. "If he can sell his home in Miami, he would be able to afford to move his wife and kids to Washington during the school year and still own a home in Florida," Conant told us in an email. And two, at a listing price of $675,000, the two-story, 2,700-square-foot home on a cul de sac is not what some may consider "working class." From New Times: West Miami is, in fact, a fairly blue collar town, just west of tonier Coral Gables. But it's pretty brazen to put your residence there in a nationally televised speech when 1) you are actively trying to leave that working-class neighborhood and 2) you stand to make more than a half-million bucks by doing so. Rubio and wife Jeanette bought the home in 2005 for $550,000, the same year it was built. The sale garnered controversy for Rubio in 2008 when the Miami Herald reported Rubio failed to disclose a $135,000 equity line he obtained from a bank run by political supporters after taking out his mortgage. Rubio’s realtor and brother-in-law, Orlando Cicilia of Centrust Realty, told us Rubio’s home is one of the nicer ones in his neighborhood. "It’s all a working-class neighborhood," he said. "You’ve got some executives, and you have a lot of regular people there." Cicilia said he found the home for Rubio at a construction price in 2005. Cicilia, married to Rubio’s older sister, lives in Rubio’s childhood home, about half a mile away. Cicilia did not want to elaborate on that. The neighborhood is in a central location close to pricier Coral Gables, the airport, shopping malls and other businesses. About 27,000 people live in Rubio's zip code (33144), according to the Census Bureau’s 2007-11 American Community Survey. Of those, 74 percent of the people are Cuban, and about 71 percent are foreign-born, according to Census data. The average years of education is 12, a high school diploma. The median household income is $37,556. Less than 1 percent of households there make more than $200,000 a year. And while Rubio’s home is going for $675,000, the median home value of an owner-occupied home is significantly lower at $311,475, according to 2010 Census data. Zillow.com put the median home list value in West Miami at $202,600. Rubio said he still lives in the "same working-class neighborhood" he grew up in. Yes, but he is looking to leave.

pomt-12229	"I've gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment … I signed an executive order so that now ... ministers and and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be, they can speak. You know, you couldn’t speak politically before, now you can."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/18/donald-trump/trump-claims-he-got-rid-johnson-amendment-true/	Responding to compliments about his election victory and support from evangelical voters, President Donald Trump told Christian Broadcasting Network’s founder Pat Robertson that he had signed an order to empower religious leaders to speak up politically. "We've really helped because I've gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment, now we are going to go try to get rid of it permanently in Congress, but I signed an executive order so that now people like you that I want to hear from, ministers and and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be, they can speak," Trump said in a July 12 interview with Robertson. "You know, you couldn’t speak politically before; now you can. And I want to hear from you and others that we like." During the campaign Trump accurately said that an amendment pushed by Lyndon B. Johnson threatened religious institutions with the loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocated their political views. Trump then said he would repeal that language. So Trump’s comments to Robertson left us wondering if in fact Trump had "gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment" and if because of his executive order religious leaders were able to speak up politically. Politics and religion experts told us Trump’s remarks were misleading on several grounds: He does not have the constitutional authority to eliminate the law, and religious leaders have been speaking up politically even before Trump’s order, despite the legal restriction. Background on the ‘Johnson Amendment’ We noted in a previous fact check of Trump’s remarks about the "Johnson Amendment" that the restriction comes from the Internal Revenue Code, and that it applies to all 501(c)(3) organizations, known as charitable organizations. The term "Johnson Amendment" derives from America’s 36th president, Lyndon B. Johnson, who became president when John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Johnson championed the restriction in 1954 when he was a U.S. senator running for re-election. A conservative nonprofit group that wanted to limit the treaty-making ability of the president produced material that called for electing his primary opponent, millionaire rancher-oilman Dudley Dougherty. In response, Johnson, then Senate Democratic minority leader, introduced an amendment to section 501(c)(3) of the federal tax code dealing with tax-exempt charitable organizations, including groups organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literacy and educational purposes, or to prevent cruelty to children or animals. The objective was to restrict the involvement in partisan politics of organizations that wanted to be exempt from paying taxes. The law says: "Under the Internal Revenue Code, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity. Violating this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes." ‘Gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment’? Trump told Robertson that he had "gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment." But that’s misleading. Trump cannot get "rid of" a law because a president does not have that constitutional authority. Trump needs Congress to take action; he even referenced that process when he added to his statement, "now we are going to go try to get rid of it permanently in Congress." (A bill on this topic introduced by Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., is in the Ways and Means Committee.) We asked the White House for more information on Trump’s comments but did not get a response. What Trump has done is sign an executive order that tells the Treasury Department to be lenient in its enforcement of current law against religious organizations. Specifically, the May 4 order said: "The Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective, where speech of similar character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury." The order defines adverse action as the imposition of any tax or tax penalty, delay or denial of tax-exempt status, disallowance of tax deductions for contributions made to the charitable organizations, "or any other action that makes unavailable or denies any tax deduction, exemption, credit, or benefit." An array of experts and groups said Trump's order doesn't achieve much. "As of right now, Trump's comments that he got rid of the Johnson amendment are inaccurate and an overstatement," said Jeanine Kraybill, who researches politics and religion and is an assistant professor of political science at California State University-Bakersfield. Trump did not get rid of the Johnson Amendment, "he just ordered that apparently it not be enforced," said Kenneth D. Wald, a distinguished professor of political science at the University of Florida. The American Civil Liberties Union expressed concerns about Trump’s executive order based on a leaked draft, but later said it had "no discernible policy outcome." The conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom, which advocates on behalf of pastors and churches and against the Johnson Amendment, said Trump’s order came up short and described it as just "vague instructions" with wiggle room to be ignored. ‘You couldn’t speak politically before, now you can’ Experts also told us that it's inaccurate to suggest religious leaders could not speak politically. "The regulations have never been designed to prevent ministers or other church officials from speaking in church about social and political issues," said Wald, the University of Florida professor. What they are forbidden from doing is formally endorsing candidates, Wald said. Also, the Johnson Amendment has not been strongly enforced over the years, and preachers and pastors have openly challenged it, said Kraybill, the professor at California State University-Bakersfield. Kraybill said that since 2008 the "Pulpit Freedom Sunday" movement, which began with the Alliance Defending Freedom, has led pastors of primarily conservative churches to intentionally preach about candidates and encourage their congregations to vote a certain way. A pastor in San Diego told CNN last year that his church records sermons and sends them to the Internal Revenue Service "in the hopes of provoking a lawsuit," and that those efforts have been fruitless. "It has been quite rare as matter of practice for the IRS to enforce that rule," said Kent Greenfield, a law professor at Boston College. Pew Research Center in August 2016 published survey results that said about two-thirds of Americans who had attended religious services had heard clergy at their church speak about social and political issues. Some churchgoers had even heard clergy speak in support or opposition of a specific presidential candidate, Pew found. With that context, Trump’s executive order in many ways attempts to codify the status quo. But it doesn’t eliminate the Johnson Amendment. Our ruling Trump said, "I've gotten rid of the Johnson Amendment … I signed an executive order so that now ... ministers and and preachers and rabbis and whoever it may be, they can speak. You know, you couldn’t speak politically before, now you can." Experts say Trump’s claim is an overstatement because his executive order merely directed the Treasury Department to be lenient in its enforcement of the law. The president does not have constitutional authority to eliminate laws. In practice, the law has rarely been enforced, experts said, and clergy members have spoken about social and political issues, or even spoken in favor or against candidates. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09567	"Inequality in Texas is steadily getting worse, with very few rich people, a great many poor people, and fewer and fewer in the middle."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/28/ronnie-earle/ronnie-earle-says-income-gap-steadily-widening-tex/	Ronnie Earle, the former Travis County district attorney seeking the Democratic nod for lieutenant governor, says powerful interests hold more sway at the Capitol than regular folks. According to The Austin Chronicle, he went farther afield before the NXNW Austin Democrats Jan. 18, saying: “Inequality in Texas is steadily getting worse, with very few rich people, a great many poor people, and fewer and fewer in the middle.” We wondered if the former prosecutor had stated his case on inequality correctly. Earle shared with us outside research suggesting growing gaps in household income nationally as well as in Texas, beginning in the late 1990's. For instance, research by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic Policy Institute found that the incomes of the poorest fifth of Texas families and the middle fifth of families didn’t change significantly between the late ‘90s and about 2005. Meantime, the average income of the richest fifth of Texas families increased by $10,505, or 9 percent, to $126,658. What about more recently? Karl Eschbach, the Texas state demographer, shared estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau that showed the distribution of Texas families across the income scale barely changed from 2000 through 2008, though inequality increased slightly. As of 2008, the state’s wealthiest 20 percent of households accounted for nearly 51 percent of income. That is, about half the money taken home that year went to the richest Texans. The next-wealthiest 40 percent of households garnered 37 percent of income. The remaining 40 percent of households -- the bottom earners in Texas -- got less than 12 percent of total household income. We also reviewed an indicator that's a widely accepted measure of income inequality. Scientists use the GINI coefficient to gauge inequality in income across societies. A society that scores 0.0 on the scale has perfect equality, meaning everyone has the same income. The higher the number over zero, the more the inequality. A score of 1.0 indicates total inequality where one person or household corners all the income. According to Eschbach’s analysis, the GINI coefficient for Texas was .466 in 2008, up slightly from .46 in 2000. Separately, the Census Bureau estimated a Texas GINI index of .474 for 2008—placing Texas fifth in income inequality among the states, trailing only Louisiana, Mississippi, Connecticut and New York, which topped the dubious category with a GINI index of .503. James K. Galbraith, a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, pointed us to research he’s overseen suggesting that income inequality in Texas widened over the past few decades. Texas had a GINI index of .37 in 1970. The index reached .39 in 1980, .42 in 1990 and .47 in 2000 before dropping to .46 in 2004. With help from a Census Bureau statistician, we tried to assess whether the state's middle class has shrunk. Kirby Posey, a bureau survey statistician, told us that if the middle class is shrinking in Texas, it's happening slowly. As of 1990, the middle class accounted for 47 percent of all the state's household income. The share of income attributed to the middle class was 46.6 percent in 2000 and 45.8 percent in 2008, according to the bureau. By and large, Earle correctly noted that Texas is home to lots of poor people and a clutch of the very wealthy. Earle passed along a September press release from the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income Texans, stating that the ranks of Texans living in poverty has likely swelled given the national recession. Even if so, that doesn't necessarily mean that fewer people are in the state's middle class. Eschbach, the state demographer, suggested that because there has been little change in income inequality across Texas over the past decade, more research would be needed before concluding the state's middle class has dwindled. Ultimately, neither Galbraith or Eschbach quibbled with the gist of Earle’s claim. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Ronnie Earle	None	None	None	2010-01-28T17:22:27	2010-01-18	['Texas']

He said he voted against Tuesday’s debt deal because it didn’t do enough to fix the problem. "I cannot vote for the largest debt-ceiling increase in America’s history without significant assurances that the bill’s proposed spending reductions will actually be realized, and without reforms to the way our government budgets its spending of taxpayer dollars," Chambliss said in a press release the day the Senate passed the deal and President Barack Obama signed it. Is this the "largest debt ceiling increase in America’s history"? Sounds like a job for the Truth-O-Meter. Chambliss is a member of the so-called "Gang of Six," which has fought for months for a bipartisan solution to cut the nation’s burgeoning federal debt. They floated a plan last month to end the stalemate on the debt ceiling, but it didn’t go far. The plan that did pass Tuesday calls for a debt limit increase of up to $2.4 trillion,accompanied by at least $2.1 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. PolitiFact Georgia contacted Chambliss’ press office to get evidence backing his claim. A spokeswoman sent us a July 26, 2011, report from the Congressional Research Service, the research arm of the U.S. Congress, and a list of debt ceiling increases from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. Federal laws have limited specific types of debt since 1917, according to the Congressional Research Service. But they did not exist as they do now, as a single limit that covers nearly all debt held by the public, until 1939. The list of debt ceiling increases from the Office of Management and Budget covers 1940 to the present. If you compare debt ceiling increases by their dollar amount, Chambliss is right. The only increase that rival’s Tuesday’s debt deal is a $1.9 trillion hike in Feb. 2010. A 2003 increase at $984 billion takes third place. We decided to nose around a little more. From our past research, PolitiFact Georgia knows that when economists talk about the size of the national debt, they often express it as a percent of the nation’s economy, or gross domestic product. This comparison gives a clearer sense of the debt’s scale. Tuesday’s deal increases the debt limit by up to $2.4 trillion, which amounts to about 16 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. We found two other occasions where the increase was greater: World War II and the mid-to-late 1970s. During the 1940s, the cost of the massive war effort pushed debt limit increases to higher than 47 percent of GDP. The 1970s increases were blips. During these years, the debt limit spiked repeatedly, peaking at more than 17.9 percent of GDP. In these instances, debt limits expired and returned to prior, much lower amounts. After a few days, Congress restored them to levels only slightly higher than the expired limits. How do we rule? Chambliss is correct by one measure -- the dollar amount of debt limit increase. He wasn’t that far off by another -- debt limit increases by percentage of GDP. In the case of this second measure, the only times the debt limit rose by an amount that exceeded this year’s increase were the result of highly unusual situations: a world war and legislative blips. We won’t count the ‘70s data against Chambliss as they resulted in small overall increases. But since Chambliss missed out on World War II, we’ll give him a Mostly True.

pomt-08070	"We have dozens of districts that go for 150 to 200 miles, splitting counties, splintering cities and connecting areas that have very little in common."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/dec/21/ellen-freidin/districts/	Following a polarizing midterm election, and with intensifying partisan bickering over everything from taxes to health care, a group dubbing itself No Labels is hoping to start an earnest discussion about policy over politics. The group, comprised of Democrats, Republicans and independents, launched its website on Dec. 13, 2010, in the hopes of starting a movement that "encourages leaders to ‘put the labels aside’ in an effort to seek common sense solutions to our nation's problems." The launch brought out independents like outgoing Florida Gov. Charlie Crist and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who both spoke at a kickoff event in New York City that was live-streamed on the No Labels website. Also speaking was Ellen Freidin, chairwoman of Fair Districts Florida, a group behind the passage of two constitutional amendments that set new guidelines for how legislative and congressional districts are drawn up. Freidin used the occasion to note: "We have dozens of districts that go for 150 to 200 miles, splitting counties, splintering cities and connecting areas that have very little in common." We decided to take a closer look at Freidin’s statement. The Fair Districts Florida website cites two examples of such districts, but we were curious to see if there were dozens of examples, as Freidin stated. About redistricting First, some background on how Florida’s districts are created. It’s an issue bound to be back in the limelight as state legislators restart the process of translating those numbers into political boundaries on a map. Every 10 years -- two years after U.S. Census figures are compiled -- state lawmakers redraw state and congressional legislative districts. The objective is to adjust district sizes to reflect changes in the population. Occasionally, new congressional districts are added when a state gains population. For example, Florida gained two House seats this time. The civics book reason for periodic redistricting is to protect the value of each voter’s ballot by preventing it from being diluted by a population surge -- the goal being for each person's vote to carry relatively equal weight in elections. But the process of redistricting is never without accusations of "gerrymandering" often brought up against the party in power. The term dates back to 1812 when Massachusetts Gov. Eldbridge Gerry signed a bill to redistrict Massachusetts. A newspaper noted that the contorted districts on the map resembled salamanders, and the term "gerrymander'' has since come to mean creating districts for political motive over geographical proximity. The Florida website for the redistricting that was carried out in 2002 gives a sense of the process and numbers involved. The Legislature divided the state’s population evenly into 120 state House districts, each containing a little over 130,000 people. Records show the number of registered voters per district ranged between 45,000 and 98,000. The same population is divided evenly into 40 state Senate districts. Each district's population hovered around 399,000, with the number of registered voters varying from about 134,000 to 280,000. Florida's Congressional districts contained a uniform population of 639,295, give or take a few people, and had voter registration ranging from about 232,600 to 418,700. During the November 2010 election, Florida voters approved two amendments to the state constitution that set specific guidelines in the creation of such districts. Amendment 5 was geared toward state districts and Amendment 6 was to be applied to congressional districts. Both amendments say districts should not be drawn to favor incumbents or a particular political party. Districts must be contiguous, compact and follow local and geographical boundaries. The districts shall also not be drawn to interfere with minority representation as provided for in the Voting Rights Act. The amendments were brought forth by Fair Districts Florida, a group that collected 1.7 million signatures to get the questions on the state ballot. A look at our districts So, do the districts created in 2002 "go on for 150 to 200 miles, splitting counties, splintering cities and connecting areas that have very little in common?'' Here, with the distances for the larger districts approximated by plugging cities into Mapquest, are some examples we found of both state and congressional districts that speak to the issue at hand: The 2nd Congressional District This Panhandle district represented by newly elected Republican Steve Southerland contains the largest number of counties in the state's delegation -- 16. It takes in some or all of Bay, Calhoun, Dixie, Franklin, Gadsden, Gulf, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Liberty, Okaloosa, Suwannee, Taylor, Wakulla and Walton counties. Approximate distance covered: 240 miles. The 3rd and 4th Congressional Districts The 3rd District, represented by Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown, contains portions of larger cities like Jacksonville and Orlando, while also taking in smaller communities like Gainesville and Apopka. The 2010 edition of the Almanac of American Politics notes that the district has three sets of borders. Designed in 1992 to be North Florida's black majority seat, from a partisan point of view it was also created "to shift as many Democrats as possible to the 3rd District to strengthen Republicans elsewhere,'' the Almanac says. It taps Democratic voters in the center of Jacksonville, then picks up voters in Orlando and Gainesville, with stops in Sanford and smaller communities. Approximate distance covered: 210 miles. Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Ander Crenshaw's 4th District stretches across the northern border of the state from the Atlantic shore in Nassau County to Tallahassee in the center. It includes, as the Almanac notes, "much of Jacksonville, minus the African-American neighborhoods,'' and runs west through Baker, Union, Columbia, Hamilton, Madison, Jefferson and Leon counties. Approximate distance covered: 165 miles. The 5th Congressional District Carved from west-Central Florida, this district represented in the upcoming Congress by Republican Rich Nugent stretches from the northern tip of Polk County to include nearly all of distant, rural Levy County, large portions of Lake, Marion and Pasco counties and all of Sumter, Citrus and Hernando counties. Approximate distance covered: 140 miles. The 6th Congressional District Republican U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns' district is another that takes a bite out of the metropolitan Jacksonville area. From there it wobbles south through wooded north-central Florida, shaving off part of Gainesville and stopping in Lake County, a short drive from Orlando. In the process it takes in some or all of Duval, Clay, Bradford, Alachua, Gilchrist, Levy, Marion and Lake counties. Approximate distance covered: 146 miles. The 10th and 11th Congressional Districts Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor's 11th District used to be entirely in Tampa and Hillsborough County, but during the 2002 redistricting, a sizable pocket of Democratic voters in South St. Petersburg were frog-marched across Tampa Bay, electorally speaking, to be joined with Democratic kindred spirits. The district also picked up a piece of Manatee County. The effect boosted the GOP margins in Pinellas County, where Republican Rep. C.W. Bill Young holds the 10th District, which voted for Bill Clinton in 1996 and Al Gore in 2000. Young's district is the only one in Florida contained wholly within a single county's borders. The 16th Congressional District Represented by Republican Tom Rooney, the district stretches from the Atlantic coast on the east almost to the Gulf of Mexico, and was described in the 2010 edition of the Almanac of American Politics as "one of the most oddly designed districts in the nation.’’ The district spans parts of Charlotte, Glades, Hendry, Highlands, Okeechobee, St. Lucie, Martin and Palm Beach counties. Approximate distance covered: 155 miles. The 22nd Congressional District While the district was once a Democratic stronghold, it recently traded hands into the Republican party when Allen West defeated Democrat Ron Klein. the narrow coastal district, which stretches from Palm Beach Gardens down to Cooper City Broward County, may be a straight shot down the coast, but the western portion of the district is a series of electoral cul-de-sacs. The 25th Congressional District The needs of voters in the largely Hispanic enclaves of West Miami-Dade County like Hialeah Gardens may have little in common with the needs of older rural voters in Collier County, but the two Republican-leaning areas are linked in the same congressional district. The 25th District was one of two new districts carved out by the Legislature in 2002. Mario-Diaz Balart, who was Florida House majority leader at the time, also chaired the redistricting committee that created the district. Diaz-Balart, a Republican, was subsequently elected the district’s first congressman in 2002. It is about to pass to newly elected U.S. Rep. David Rivera, also a Republican. State Senate District 1 Sen. Tony Hill's district cascades south through Duval County, spreading out in central St. Johns, and sending a spur line into Putnam County, and dips south to take in a large swath of Flagler County and a looping portion of Volusia County. Approximate distance covered: 108 miles. State Senate District 3 State Sen. Charlie Dean’s district covers Baker, Dixie, Hamilton, Lafayette, Suwannee and Taylor counties, in addition to parts of Citrus, Columbia, Jefferson, Leon, Levy, Madison and Marion counties. Approximate distance covered: 272 miles. State Senate District 7 Represented by Republican Sen. Evelyn J. Lynn, this district snakes from Clay County down to Putnam and Marion counties and covers most of Volusia County. Approximate distance covered: 165 miles. State Senate District 8 Republican Sen. John Thrasher’s district is spread along the Atlantic coast, running through Nassau, Duval, St. Johns, Flagler and Volusia counties. Approximate distance covered: 144 miles. State Senate District 14 Republican Sen. Steve Oelrich's district covers Alachua, Bradford, Gilchrist and Union counties with portions of Columbia, Levy, Marion, and Putnam counties in the fold. Approximate distance covered: 85 miles. State Senate District 15 Republican Sen. Paula Dockery's district is carved where four counties converge -- Hernando, Sumter, Lake and Polk, throwing in a piece of Osceola County to fill it out. Approximate distance covered: 159 miles. State Senate District 18 The district, represented by Democratic Sen. Arthenia Joyner, covers parts of East and South Tampa, South St. Petersburg in Pinellas County and a sliver of Manatee County. Approximate distance covered: 57 miles. State Senate District 21 Republican Sen. Mike Bennett's district covers nearly all of Manatee County, plus pieces of Sarasota, DeSoto, Charlotte and Lee counties (and the Senate misspells Charlotte on its website map). Approximate distance covered: 124 miles. State Senate District 26 The district represented by Republican Senate President Mike Haridopolos covers coastal areas of Brevard County, but also covers portions of Osceola and Indian River counties. Approximate distance covered: 164 miles. State Senate District 27 The district, currently represented by Palm Beach County Republican Lizbeth Benacquisto, spans five counties (Palm Beach, Glades, Hendry Charlotte and Lee) and travels nearly coast to coast from West Palm Beach in the east to Fort Myers in the west. Approximate distance covered: 140 miles. State Senate District 28 Republican Sen. Joe Negron's district hugs the highly developed southeastern coast, except when it veers deep into the state to pick up portions of Okeechobee, St. Lucie, Martin and Palm Beach counties. Approximate distance covered: 109 miles. State Senate District 39 Democratic Sen. Larcenia Bullard’s district covers a vast geographic terrain from Hendry County to rural Immokalee in Collier County, plus urban areas in Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties and down to the Florida Keys in Monroe County. Approximate distance covered; 268 miles. State House districts are more compact because they take in a smaller population, but they do meander from time to time, with electoral ramifications for the counties and towns affected. Here are a few notable clusters: State House Districts 29, 30, 31, 32 This Atlantic coast region is solidly Republican, with Tom Goodson in district 29, Ritch Workman in district 30, John Tobia in district 31 and Steve Crisafulli in district 32. Despite the GOP nature of the territory, it is still carved into byzantine interlocking connections of neighborhoods and towns around Melbourne and the beach communities to the north and south. State House Districts 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 49 These districts, taken together, are a case study of the political legerdemain when district lines are drawn. Districts 36, 39 and 49 rub shoulders in the urban Orlando area, and present three faces of the Democratic Party -- white liberal, African American and Hispanic. The state House district interactive map puts them in political perspective. District 36, represented by liberal Democrat Scott Randolph, is shaped vaguely like a lobster, with its claws in northern and eastern Orange County and its body in the center of Orlando. District 39, represented by African American Rep. Geraldine Thompson, is a more solid, cohesive block of voters. District 49, represented by Darren Soto, tracks the Hispanic population through west Orlando, down to Kissimmee and elsewhere, spreading across Orange and Osceola counties. All around them are Republican districts enjoying a carefully crafted symbiotic relationship. Between the lobster's claws rests the wealthy enclave of Winter Park, in district 35, home to Republican House Speaker Dean Cannon. Nearby is the southern edge of Apopka Republican Rep. Bryan Nelson's district 38, which picks up voters in the gaps between Democratic districts 36 and 39. District 40, represented by Republican Eric Eisnaugle, is another odd configuration, cobbling together disparate suburbs in lumps and bulges constituting southern GOP border of this political nexus. Neighboring district 41, represented by Republican Stephen Precourt, is where the tidy urban divisions really begin to break down. With districts 36 and 39 holding large groups of Democrats across the border, this Republican district sprawls west from Orange County into the old Florida region of south Lake County, and dips into Osceola County to the south. State House Districts 55, 67, 68 and 69 With its southern end sandwiched narrowly between three Republican districts, district 55, represented by Democrat Darryl Rouson, combines voters in Sarasota, Manatee, Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. Meanwhile, Republican Rep. Greg Steube's district 67 takes eastern chunks of Sarasota and Manatee counties along with an oddly shaped section of southern Hillsborough County. Republican Rep. Jim Boyd's district 68 covers the more affluent beach communities around Bradenton, and district 69, represented by Republican Jay Pilon, takes in south Manatee and Sarasota, enveloping the southern tip of Rouson's district. State House Districts 78, 79, 80, 84 District 78, represented by Democrat Stephen Perman, contains a large portion of western Palm Beach County, plus odd pieces of Martin, St. Lucie and Okeechobee counties, including what looks like a surgical sliver of metropolitan Fort Pierce. It also wraps around district 84, represented by Haitian-born Democrat Mack Bernard, whose district includes Belle Glade and the surrounding area, then tracks along a road east to pick up more voters in neighborhoods around West Palm Beach. North of this oddly shaped pair of Democratic districts it is solidly Republican. Mike Horner's district 79 runs north from Okeechobee County through Osceola County and picks up chunks of Orange and Polk counties. And Debbie Mayfield's district 80 tracks the jagged edge of Perman's district to the Atlantic Ocean. State House Districts 101 and 112 Naples Republican Matt Hudson's district is a political oddity with two nodes of urbanization separated by thousands of square miles of swamp, farms and open land. To the east it picks up a little of urban Broward County along the edge of Pembroke Pines, then it slides west through a long, narrow passage that includes the Everglades and Big Cypress swamp, emerging amidst a host of suburban neighborhoods around Naples, in Collier County. Approximate distance covered; 108 miles. The same strange geography and approximate distance applies with district 112, represented by Miami Republican Jeanette Nunez. Winnowing people by party alliance does raise a basic question about representative government -- Should a politician be given carte blanche to discard certain voters, or would the public good be better served if the offfice-holder were required to take divergent views into account? But that discussion is not why we're here. So, back to the question at hand. Was Freidin accurate in stating that Florida has "dozens of districts that go for 150 to 200 miles, splitting counties, splintering cities and connecting areas that have very little in common?" Florida has a total of 185 legislative and congressional districts -- 120 in the state House, 40 in the Senate and 25 in Congress. Of those, 67, or 36 percent, are contained within the borders of a single county. In less populated regions, a district must, of necessity, spread out to meet its population number. But, as the maps above show, that's not always the reason for the shifting lines. The state's major cities are carved into all manner of peculiar bits and pieces to assemble state House, Senate and even Congressional districts. Fort Lauderdale and Orlando are each divvied up into four congressional districts, often being grouped with smaller rural communities that share little common interest. It is also clear that the integrity of county lines is not a concern when district lines are drawn. As we mentioned before, only one of the state's 25 congressional districts is wholly contained in one county. Among the rest, one includes some or all of 16 counties, and the average number of counties per district is 4.8. Miami-Dade and Broward counties are in five congressional districts. Hillsborough, Pinellas and Duval counties are in three. The state House and Senate are not much better. In the House, 59 -- slightly less than half -- of the districts fall within one county. One district takes in portions of 10 counties, and the average number of counties included wholly or partially in a state House seat is 1.96. Only seven of the 40 state Senate seats fall within one county, and on average, senate districts spread over three counties. What about the claim that districts "go for 150 to 200 miles?'' Many do, as our rough approximations illustrate. Strictly speaking, there are not "dozens'' that run over 150 miles, but there are at least nine on our list, and if you loosen the standard slightly to take in those over 140 miles, we found 13. One might argue that districts should be measured not just from end to end, but by the sprawling territory they take up, which would likely add to the list. Whether it would get it to "dozens'' is debatable. Inarguably, the districts meander and wind in jagged jigsaw patterns that crisscross cities and counties. We highlighted more than three-dozen examples. With a slight penalty for fuzzy math on the number of giant districts, we rate Freidin’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-09251	"If you will go look up the definition of 'act of God,' we've used it in legal terms for a long time in this state."	true	/texas/statements/2010/may/05/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-oil-rig-explosion-could-have-b/	Two Texas Republicans have invoked God's ways in dramatic fashion recently. State Rep. Leo Berman of Tyler called Democratic President Barack Obama "God's punishment on us" April 24. And this week, Gov. Rick Perry suggested the April 20 British Petroleum oil rig explosion on the Gulf Coast could have been an "act of God." Perry, speaking Monday at a governors conference about job creation sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, warned that banning offshore drilling could hurt the economy. "From time to time, there are going to be things that occur that are acts of God that cannot be prevented," he said. Critics howled that Perry was dismissing the situation's seriousness. A day later, Perry defended the comment. He told reporters: "Here's what I said, and I think it's an interpretation issue with one reporter, is what I think. If you will go look up the definition of 'act of God,' we've used it in legal terms for a long time in this state and the — nobody knows what happened, and I said that in my remarks, that there were, you know, a lot of speculation. It could have been an act of God, it could have been, you know, who knows?" Texas law works in mysterious ways? Barron's Law Dictionary defines "Act of God" as the "manifestation of the forces of nature which are unpredictable and difficult to anticipate; 'the result of the direct and immediate and exclusive forces of nature, uncontrolled or uninfluenced by the power of man and without human intervention, [which] is of such character that it could not have been prevented or avoided by foresight or prudence.' Examples are tempests, lightning, earthquakes and a sudden illness or death of a person." The legalese dates back to Roman law, and judges have since continued to rule that an act of God doesn't depend on divine influence. In 1609, a British court ruled that a fire caused by lightning was an act of God. In 1785, a court ruled a fire not caused by lightning wasn't, according to a 1996 article in the American Journal of Public Health. Steve Bickerstaff, an adjunct law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that when someone who has previously expressed a strong religious affiliation — like Perry — calls an oil rig explosion an act of God, it sounds like that person is suggesting the disaster is celestial retribution. Bickerstaff said: "My first reaction was, 'Oh, no — we're back to God taking revenge on us. But, actually, the term act of God has very prominent historical significance, very commonly used in contracts." Bickerstaff concurred that the term has had historic uses in Texas and the United States, and it's in most contracts, particularly between big businesses. Take a house knocked down by an earthquake. Did someone cause that? "Well, if they didn't build the house adequately according to code and requirements, then yes," Bickerstaff said. "But the earthquake itself is an act in which they have no control." And the oil rig explosion? No way to know yet, Bickerstaff said. "Was the company negligent? Was it BP, or the company operating the rig? I don't know. Was the system flawed in some way? We don't know." We're not endeavoring to judge, so to speak, whether the rig explosion was an "act of God." That said, we quickly found several state laws that use the phrase. It's illegal for a railway company to obstruct a street, railroad crossing or public highway for more than five minutes, but "it's a defense to the prosecution under this section that the train obstructs the street, railroad crossing or public highway because of an act of God or breakdown of the train," according to a transportation law that took effect in 1995. An insurance carrier isn't liable to pay for an employee's injury if, among other exceptions, the injury "arose out of an act of God, unless the employment exposes the employee to a greater risk of injury from an act of God than ordinarily applies to the general public," according to a 1993 law about workers' compensation. An agriculture-related law that took effect in 2003 protects people who violate rules about artificially controlling the weather if they can prove the violation "was caused solely by an act of God, war, strike, riot or other catastrophe." A law enacted in 1997 similarly protects people who violate certain state water laws. Summing up: We're not judging whether the BP explosion was an "act of God." That said, Perry's follow-up statement reflects the term's prevalence in law. We rate that statement as True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-05-05T22:51:20	2010-05-04	['God']
pomt-12072	Hurricane Irma is "predicted to come through Mexico, hit us and everything in between up to Houston."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/01/blog-posting/map-showing-hurricane-irma-path-hit-houston-fake-n/	A map showing that government officials predict Hurricane Irma is on a path to hit Houston is fake news. "Everyone needs to pay attention to Hurricane Irma," read a Facebook post on Aug. 31, 2017. (The post has since been deleted.) "She’s predicted to come through Mexico, hit us and everything in between up to Houston. She's already a Category 2 and hasn't even got into warm water yet." The post uses the official logo of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and has a map showing a projected path of the storm. It had been shared more than 36,000 times on Sept. 1, 2017. Joe Maley, the author of the post, did not respond to our request for comment. The National Weather Service took the rare step of debunking the forecast on Twitter on Sept. 1, 2017, flagging the post as fake. "Keep your eyes out for fake forecasts. THIS is what an official NOAA advisory looks like. Note: forecast only goes out 5 days. #Irma," the National Weather Service tweeted. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "National Weather Service issued a tweet in response to a Facebook post by someone who is not an employee of NOAA, NWS or the National Hurricane Center," National Weather Service spokeswoman Maureen O'Leary told us. "The post included logos and language that could be mistakenly taken as an official forecast." As of this writing, the National Weather Service projects Irma’s probable path as moving in the direction of the Caribbean, but it’s still too early to tell where the storm will make landfall and whether it will impact the United States. U.S. code subjects people who counterfeit weather forecasts or falsely represent government-issued forecasts to fines or imprisonment for under 90 days. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-08275	On toll roads.	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-has-shifted-tone-highway-tolls/	For as long as there have been roads in Wisconsin, the notion of rigging them with tolls has been only slightly less popular than, say, abolishing deer hunting. Badger State motorists turn red with ire every time they head down I-94 toward Chicago and have to scrounge for change. So, it was notable late in the 2010 campaign when Governor-elect Scott Walker expressed support for certain tolls. The Republican nominee assured voters he didn’t back full-fledged toll roads that require all motorists to pay. Rather, he was open to adding a faster-moving lane to freeways that drivers would pay a toll to use. That is, toll lanes. "I don't support tolls," Walker said in an Oct. 23, 2010, article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "Tolls are where you have no options (on paying). I oppose tolls today just as much as I did in 2004." In 2004, Walker was running for re-election as Milwaukee County executive. He promised not only to block any toll ways but also any new fees. All of which means it’s time to break out the Flip-O-Meter, which we use to determine whether someone has flip-flopped on an issue. Walker’s support for toll lanes drew at least two accusations of flip-flopping in the days before the Nov. 2 election. One came from Democratic challenger Tom Barrett, who created a website called www.notolltax.com. Another came in a radio ad from the Greater Wisconsin Political Fund, an arm of the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee. So, let’s sort this out, using a timeline of Walker’s statements. 2004: During his re-election campaign for county executive, Walker distributed a flier promising voters he would do 10 things, one being:"Block any attempt to increase taxes or create new fees, including toll ways." So: Not only no toll roads, but no to any new fees. Feb. 19, 2009: Two months before announcing his campaign for governor, Walker reacted to news that Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle would be open to charging tolls on state highways, possibly for express lanes. Walker said he was generally opposed to tolls, but that the concept of a so-called HOT lane was worth discussing. High-occupancy toll lanes give motorists the option of paying a toll to use a less congested lane. In some places, drivers who have one or more passengers can use the HOT lanes without paying. So: Opposed to toll roads, but open to toll lanes, which would create a new fee for those who want to use them. Aug. 6, 2010: In a debate, Walker repeated his opposition to toll roads. But in an interview, he said he was open to allowing drivers to pay to use express lanes. Again, opposed to toll roads, but open to toll lanes and the fees that go with them. Oct. 19, 2010: Walker told the Transportation Development Association of Wisconsin he supports putting tolls on new highway express lanes. That was the move that prompted news stories and the flip-flop cries from opponents. So, where has this historical drive taken us? Walker has consistently opposed traditional toll roads, but as toll lanes emerged as an option, he embraced them in concept and finally endorsed them. In arguing he has not flipped on the issue, Walker actually provides some additional evidence he has at least twisted a bit: His 2004 promises list included a pledge not to create any new fees, but his support for toll lanes amounts to a user fee to drivers who want to use the faster lane. In our estimation, with his position on tolls, Walker has done a Half-Flip.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2010-11-09T09:00:00	2010-10-19	['None']

pomt-12860	"The chances of being killed by a refugee committing a terrorist act is 1 in 3.6 billion."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/feb/01/ted-lieu/odds-youll-be-killed-terror-attack-america-refugee/	President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration halts the admission of all refugees into the United States for four months as the federal government develops stronger vetting systems. It places an indefinite ban on Syrian refugees. Trump has cited national security concerns as the reason for his order, and during his campaign he called Syrian refugees "a great Trojan horse" that could lead to future terrorist attacks. In addition to the refugee halt, his order also suspends immigration for citizens of seven majority Muslim countries for 90 days. They are: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. Critics of Trump’s action say the notion that refugees represent a terrorist threat is false. They say the chance of being killed in a terror attack by a refugee is beyond remote. "The chances of being struck by lightning TWICE is 1 in 9 million. The chances of being killed by a refugee committing a terrorist act is 1 in 3.6 billion," California Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu said on Jan. 27, 2017 in a press release. "These facts lead me to conclude that Trump's action is not based on national security, it is based on bigotry. Lady Liberty is crying." We decided to fact-check Lieu’s claim that the "chances of being killed by a refugee committing a terrorist act is 1 in 3.6 billion." We interpreted his statement to apply to terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Before we start, here’s some background on refugees: The U.S. Code defines a refugee as any person outside of the U.S. that is of special humanitarian concern to the U.S. and "has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion," according to the Pew Research Center. America accepted large waves of refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia in the 1970s, followed by high numbers from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. More recently, refugees from Somalia, Burma, Bhutan and Syria have been granted refugee status and resettled in the United States. Refugees are the most heavily vetted of any people who enter the United States, facing an 18- to 24-month processing period, according to the Migration Policy Institute. Our research A spokesman for Lieu cited a September 2016 study by the Cato Institute called Terrorism and Immigration: A Risk Analysis, as evidence for the claim. Cato is a Washington D.C.-based think tank that advocates for limited government, free markets and greater immigration admissions. Its study does, indeed, conclude that "the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year." Here’s what the study reported: "Of the 3,252,493 refugees admitted from 1975 to the end of 2015, 20 were terrorists, which amounted to 0.00062 percent of the total. In other words, one terrorist entered as a refugee for every 162,625 refugees who were not terrorists. Refugees were not very successful at killing Americans in terrorist attacks. Of the 20, only three were successful in their attacks, killing a total of three people." To arrive at the "1 in 3.64 billion per year" statistic, Alex Nowrasteh, the Cato study’s author, told us he added up the nation’s population for each year between 1975 and 2015, and then divided the total by the three deaths. Lieu omitted the "per year," portion in his claim, though we did not view this as an egregious oversight. In his study, Nowrasteh notes that a trio of Cuban refugees carried out the three fatal attacks in the 1970s. Not a single refugee, Syrian or otherwise, has been implicated in a terrorist attack since the Refugee Act of 1980 set up systematic procedures for accepting refugees into the United States, the report adds. The study draws on data from a Global Terrorism Database maintained at the University of Maryland, College Park. Origin of past terror attacks Trump’s executive action affects many categories of immigrants from students to employers to refugees. Refugees, however, have not been the primary perpetrators of any of the country’s major terror attacks that killed Americans in recent decades. A Somali refugee injured nine people in a knife and car attack in November 2016 on the Ohio State University campus before he was shot dead. None of the victims died. Many of the major terror attacks that have killed Americans were carried out by U.S.-born citizens or permanent legal residents from countries not included in the ban. Here’s a look at the origin of those responsible for major attacks in recent years: 9/11 terror attacks Of the 19 people who hijacked planes on Sept. 11, 2001, all entered the United States legally on a temporary visa, most on tourist visas. They were not refugees and they were not from any of the seven countries in Trump’s executive order. San Bernardino attacks Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik shot and killed 14 people and injured 22 others in December 2015 in San Bernardino. Farook was an American citizen born in Chicago. Malik was born and raised in Pakistan. She arrived in the United States on a fiancée visa and later became a permanent resident. Boston Marathon bombings Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, were born in Kyrgyzstan to parents from war-torn Chechnya. Three people were killed and at least 264 were injured in the attack. The Tsarnaev family arrived in the United States in 2002 and was granted political asylum. Asylum is typically granted to people already in the United States who have fled persecution in their home country. Refugees are generally people outside their home country, and have applied for resettlement. Orlando Omar Mateen, the Orlando nightclub shooter was a U.S. citizen and son of Afghan immigrants. He shot and killed 49 people and wounded 53 others inside a gay nightclub in June 2016. Experts weigh in We asked experts on refugees and terrorism to evaluate the Cato study, and the claim at the center of this fact check. "Having gone through the methodology they used, the figure of one in 3.6 billion is absolutely correct. It is a well-done analysis based on available data," said UC Irvine Professor Ruben Rumbaut, a leading expert on refugee resettlement in the United States. Joel Day, a visiting research scholar at the University of San Diego and expert on terrorism, said the Cato study draws from reliable sources, including the Global Terrorism Database, considered the best of its kind. Day said he agreed with the study’s methodology, adding "I think their data is absolutely right." Another expert, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors stricter immigration policies, said the "one in 3.6 billion" statistic from the Cato study includes too many qualifiers. Notably, he said, it excludes terrorist attacks by refugees that did not kill anyone and those "we’ll never know about" foiled by law enforcement. "It’s not that it’s wrong," Krikorian said of the Cato study, but its author "is doing everything he can to shrink the problem." Kathleen Newland, a senior fellow and co-founder of the Migration Policy Institute, said she believes the Cato study is credible. Her own work, she said, has shown there’s "vanishingly small probability," that an American would be murdered by a refugee in a terrorist attack. Newland said her only disagreement with the study is its designation of the three Cuban refugees as terrorists. In her evaluation, she said, the crimes they committed don’t strictly amount to terrorism. In opinion polls, Americans have expressed worry over accepting a large number of Syrian refugees. Newland said people tend to lump refugees in with all categories of immigrants, without considering the data showing how infrequently refugees are involved with terror attacks. "I think people just don’t make the distinction between categories of people," she said. Our ruling California Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu recently said the "chances of being killed by a refugee committing a terrorist act is 1 in 3.6 billion." Lieu’s claim is backed by a September 2016 study by the Cato Institute. It’s important to clarify, however, that its study examined terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, something Lieu does not explicitly state. Also, the Cato study says the odds of an attack are one in 3.6 billion "per year." Without these words, Lieu’s claim could be viewed as slightly understating the odds, but we did not view his omission as egregious. Several experts on terrorism and refugees examined the Cato study and told us its methodology and conclusions were credible. One said the study had too many qualifiers, but did not dispute its data. A high-profile terror attack involving a Somali refugee took place in November 2016, after the period examined by the study. Nine people were injured in that attack, but there were no fatalities. This is a notable piece of information, but does not take away from the accuracy of the congressman’s claim regarding the "chances of being killed by a refugee" or the study he cited as its source. Lieu’s statement is accurate, though it needs a couple clarifications or additional information. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/27a77628-e6d7-4170-98a6-a2078ecebdc5	None	Ted Lieu	None	None	None	2017-02-01T13:50:08	2017-01-27	['None']
pomt-07096	Says Miami-Dade mayoral candidate Julio Robaina "has the highest salary among Florida mayors. More than $260,000."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/jun/23/common-sense-now/gimenez-group-says-robaina-highest-paid-mayor-flor/	In the June 28, 2011 Miami-Dade mayor's race, the opposing camps have tried to portray the other side as living high off the government hog. PolitiFact Florida has been watching the tit-for-tat, and trying to keep all of the tax dollars straight. Previously we explored a claim from supporters of former Hialeah Mayor Julio Robaina, who said former Miami-Dade County Commissioner Carlos Gimenez "drove a fancy European car at taxpayer expense" like recalled Miami-Dade mayor Carlos Alvarez. We found the claim Half True, noting the deals for Gimenez and Alvarez were not identical, and that taxpayer-funded cars are a common perk for South Florida politicos. Now, we're checking a claim from the other side. A group called Common Sense Now is airing an ad criticizing Robaina, and specifically, his salary while Hialeah mayor. "Say no to Mayor Julio Robaina ... No to Mayor Robaina because he has the highest salary among Florida mayors. More than $260,000," the ad claims (as $50 bills float around the screen no less). "More than our governor and U.S. Senators." Is that true? Hialeah has what's considered a strong mayor, in that the mayor acts like a city manager and serves as the executive of government. The position comes with a full-time salary, two expense accounts and access to city vehicles. The current city budget includes a salary of $155,243, a $75,019 expense account and an additional $41,616 for travel/per diem, or $271,878. (The city did cut its health insurance cost to Robaina, because Robaina gave back 7 percent of his base salary as an extra insurance contribution. That brings his total compensation to around the $260,000 cited in the ad). The ad, as you can tell, is including the expense account and travel budget in calculating Robaina's salary. But that's not altogether inappropriate. Unlike most situations, Robaina got the full amount of the expense account and travel budget whether or not he spent that money on travel or city expenses. In other words, Robaina did not have to submit receipts to get reimbursed for expenses, travel or per diem. "Expenses" could go toward anything he needs for city business, and whatever he didn't spend he could keep. "He doesn't have to show us what he uses it for," said Hialeah finance director Vivian Parks. "The intention is the mayor has to do a lot of city business on his own time and he doesn't get reimbursed for any of that. This is to cover his travel, his meals and his expenses for all city-related business." Check registers from 2010 and 2011 confirm that payments for salary, expenses and travel all were directly deposited to Robaina. And all three sources of money would be considered income for tax purposes. What's difficult to figure out, of course, is how much of that money Robaina spent on city business (which he could deduct from his income for tax purposes), and how much he pocketed as what most people would classify as salary. We called Robaina, but did not hear back. No matter, the setup -- or at least the size of the expense accounts -- appears unique within Florida government. We contacted several other large cities and asked about annual salaries and expenses for mayors. We couldn't find any in excess of $260,000. In Orlando, St. Petersburg, Tampa and Jacksonsville -- all strong mayor positions -- mayors made anywhere from $150,000 to $175,000. But none had expense accounts like Robaina. The mayors in those cities are reimbursed for city expenses. As for Robaina earning more than Gov. Rick Scott and U.S. Senators, it again comes down to the expenses. Senators earn $174,000 in salary and travel expenses come out of an office budget. Florida's governor is paid $130,273 (though Scott is declining a salary) though most of a governor's expenses, including housing, are paid for by the state. We also checked the position of Miami-Dade mayor, the job Robaina wants. County spokeswoman Vanessa Santana-Penate said the mayor's last annual salary was about $233,000 with around an additional $80,000 in benefits. But not all of those benefits are income, and not all of them come up front like they do in Hialeah. So it's clear on salary vs. salary, Alvarez made more. But when you factor in the expenses, it becomes more difficult to say. J.C. Planas, an attorney for the Gimenez campaign told us it's right to include Robaina's expense accounts as salary because he "does not submit invoices or receipts to get reimbursed, but simply collects the amount regardless of whether he spends it or not." But Planas' explanation ignores the fact that the some of that money was being used to conduct city business -- even though Robaina did not have to turn in receipts. To recap, the Common Sense Now add said Robaina "has the highest salary among Florida mayors. More than $260,000." Robaina had a salary of around $155,000 -- which is in line with many strong mayors in Florida, though less than Miami-Dade mayor. But Robaina received more than $105,000 for expenses, which he got whether or not he used the money on business. Other mayors in Florida are reimbursed for their expenses. We don't know how much of that money was used for legitimate expenses. So it's not fair to include all of that money as straight "salary." We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13488	"As governor, Ted Strickland left only 89 cents in Ohio’s rainy day fund."	true	/ohio/statements/2016/sep/08/us-chamber-commerce/heard-one-about-ted-strickland-and-89-cents/	Ads against Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland are torpedoing Ohio airwaves, even as reports say that supporters of incumbent Sen. Rob Portman are scaling back their spending. One claim that has been repeated across multiple ads is about a handful of change: 89 cents, to be exact. "Eighty-nine cents," reads the script from the ad, paid for by the US Chamber of Commerce’s political action arm. "You can find that in your couch. Or your jeans. Or even under your floor mats. But as governor, Ted Strickland left only 89 cents in Ohio’s rainy day fund." It seems unlikely that so specific a number would be used without factual underpinning. We wanted to be sure it checked out. It does. In official-speak, Ohio’s rainy day fund is known as the Budget Stabilization Fund. When Strickland left office in January 2011, the fund had bottomed out to $0.89. Here’s a chart using data from Ohio’s Office of Management and Budget. It shows the ebb and flow of Ohio’s reserves, including the low point in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. Where’d the reserves go? Stickland used $1 billion from the fund to balance the state budget in 2009, a move he and his campaign have defended. "I would not have had a rainy-day fund if I had listened to many Republicans," Stickland said in 2009. "I'm glad I held on to it. There is justification for it now." Kim Rueben, a state and local finance expert at the Urban Institute, told Columbus Business First that, "I wouldn’t blame a governor for spending budget stability funds in a time when you need to stabilize your budget." Yet the tiny reserve became a bit of Ohio lore. Brian Perera, the Ohio Senate’s former deputy chief of staff for budget and finance, even cut a check for $0.89 so he can say he personally doubled the state’s reserves. The reserve has grown since Strickland left office. Current Gov. John Kasich started to replenish the rainy day fund with a injection of $246.9 million in July 2011. The money came at the tail end of Strickland's final two-year budget even though he had left office. Today, the rainy day fund sits at over $2 billion, according to the state. Our ruling Campaign ads criticized Strickland for leaving Ohio’s rainy day fund at $.89 when he left office as governor. Strickland’s defenders say the recession that hit the United States and Ohio required Strickland and state officials to drain the $1 billion fund. And they note the fund started to be replenished at the tail-end of his final budget, even though Strickland had left office. But we don't think that affects the accuracy of this claim. We rate it True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2ce48995-a59a-4079-94eb-6d03717ebdf6	None	U.S. Chamber of Commerce	None	None	None	2016-09-08T13:12:51	2016-08-12	['Ted_Strickland', 'Ohio']

pomt-00588	"The entirety of North America -- Canada, the United States and Mexico -- there's more known reserves in those three countries than in Russia and Saudi Arabia."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/jun/05/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-us-canada-and-mexico-have-more-ene/	Former Texas governor Rick Perry was talking energy in Deerfield when he decided to put the country’s resources in perspective. "The entirety of North America -- Canada, the United States and Mexico -- there's more known reserves in those three countries than in Russia and Saudi Arabia," Perry said at the 9 Lions Tavern on May 7. While energy production in the United States has certainly boomed in recent years, Perry’s statement seemed surprisingly broad. Could three North American countries really outrank oil-rich Russia and Saudi Arabia? We decided to check it out. Thankfully, there’s a U.S. government agency that keeps track of just this kind of data. It’s the Energy Information Administration, a division of the Department of Energy that collects statistics and does analysis on all topics related to energy. Going through the site’s tables, though, would seem to suggest that Perry is off track. Using its 2014 data set for crude oil proved reserves, Canada, the United States and Mexico had a combined total of 219.8 billion barrels. A hefty amount, no question. But Russia and Saudi Arabia have a combined crude oil proved reserves of 348.4 billion barrels. The vast majority of that -- 268.4 billion barrels -- is held by the Saudis. (There are questions about the reliability of the Saudi-reported numbers, but let’s put those aside for now.) That certainly doesn’t seem to support Perry’s contention. So we checked with his staff. They also sent along data from the Energy Information Administration, but not just crude oil reserves. Their numbers included coal and natural gas totals. Those 2014 numbers show North America has proven reserves of 422.1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Russia and Saudi Arabia have combined reserves of 1,986.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, with 1,688 trillion of that coming from Russia. Once again, the energy giants to the east win out. As for coal, North America looks to be the clear leader. While only data from 2011 is available, Canada, the United States and Mexico have 267,411 million recoverable short tons of coal in reserve. Of that, 258,619 tons are in the United States. Russia and Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, have 173,074 million short tons of coal, all located in Russia. While Perry’s staff added the numbers from the various energy sources together to emphasize the former governor’s point, that’s misleading. The problem, put simply, is that each source of energy has a different kind of measurement. Barrels of oil, cubic feet of natural gas and short tons of coal are not directly equivalent. As the EIA explains, one short ton of coal (or 2,000 pounds) produces 19,210,000 British thermal units (a basic heat measurement). One thousand cubic feet of natural gas produce 1,025,000 Btu. And a single barrel of oil produces 5,892,000 Btu. There is a way to measure all of the resources together, though. It’s called BOE, or barrels of oil equivalent. The Congressional Research Service uses a simple multiplier to equate natural gas and coal to petroleum. Using these figures, including proven oil and natural gas reserves and recoverable coal reserves, North America has roughly 1,217 billion BOE. Russia and Saudi Arabia have about 1,296 billion BOE. But energy is a tricky subject. Proven reserves aren’t the same as estimated or potential reserves. Extraction methods can improve, adding resources thought off-limits to the overall supply. Energy efficiency measures and the types of coal or petroleum used can introduce even more variables. Much remains to be learned. As Ryan Carlyle, a subsea hydraulics engineer, wrote on Quora in 2013: "Corporate reserve estimates are too low by an unknown amount, and national reserve estimates are too high by an unknown amount. And no one knows how much oil is still undiscovered." While the United States has a lot of recoverable coal reserves, there are questions as to whether it will ever be mined. New environmental regulations, legal action and overall costs make it more challenging for energy companies to use the fuel. That being said, Perry has been outspoken in his criticism of President Obama’s energy policy, including coal regulations, so a Perry administration could see a change in course. Our ruling Perry said "The entirety of North America -- Canada, the United States and Mexico -- there's more known reserves in those three countries than in Russia and Saudi Arabia." There is some basic truth to Perry’s statement. North America does have a large supply of petroleum, natural gas and coal. But combining the three fuel sources together is like comparing fossil fuel-based apples and oranges. Just comparing straight numbers, Perry was right about coal, but wrong on natural gas and crude oil. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-10484	"I'm the product of a mixed marriage that would have been illegal in 12 states when I was born."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/15/barack-obama/obamas-more-right-than-he-knows/	Illinois Sen. Barack Obama recently confronted the issue of equal rights for gays and lesbians with some history about his life. "I'm the product of a mixed marriage that would have been illegal in 12 states when I was born," he told TheAdvocate.com. Obama made the remark during a wide-ranging interview about issues affecting the gay, bisexual and transgender community with a Web site for gay and lesbian readers. Obama said his perspective about rights for same-sex couples is shaped by the broader political and historical context of his upbringing. Such laws were more widepsread than Obama realizes. At the time of his birth Aug. 4, 1961, 22 states banned interracial marriages, not 12. (For those counting: Arizona, Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.) But it was never an issue for his white American mother and black Kenyan father, who lived in Hawaii. The island state is one of only nine that never declared these marriages illegal. At one time or another, laws against miscegenation were active in close to 40 states. In 1967, when the U.S. Supreme Court declared the bans unconstitutional in the landmark Loving vs. Virginia ruling, 16 states were still enforcing them, said Peter Wallenstein, a Virginia Tech history professor and pre-eminent scholar on the subject. Wallenstein said that although his number is off, Obama's point is still striking a chord with younger supporters who "can't imagine there was ever a time" when mixed marriages were illegal. We can't give Obama a straight-up true because his number is way off, but his larger point, that many states prohibited interracial marriage in the early 1960s, is correct.

pomt-09683	Under the House health care bill, the government "will have to penalize citizens if we choose not to buy a plan that will cost a minimum of about $15,000 per family per year."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/13/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-health-care-reform-will-be-costly/	Sarah Palin may be in the midst of launching her new book, Going Rogue , but she still found time to post a note on her Facebook page criticizing the Democratic plans for health care. Her note, titled "Pelosi 'Health Plan' Should Be DOA," argued that people shouldn't be compelled by the government to purchase health insurance. She also wrote that the House Democrats' measures for enforcing the new requirement, known as the individual mandate, are overly punitive. "If you don't buy what the government considers 'acceptable health care coverage,' you’re going to be hit with a tax of at least 2.5% of your income," Palin wrote. "And if you don’t pay that new tax, you could be fined as much as $250,000 and sentenced to up to five years in prison. "But here’s the thing: they have to make the penalty for opting out very harsh in order to force us to buy coverage. The only way to keep this government run health care plan afloat is for everyone to buy into it – especially young and healthy people. That means that they will have to penalize citizens if we choose not to buy a plan that will cost a minimum of about $15,000 per family per year." Palin is correct that the Democratic plan requires everyone to buy insurance or face a tax penalty. The fines and jail terms, though, are not part of the health care bill, but rather the tools the Internal Revenue Service uses against tax cheats. (We ruled on a similar statement about jail terms and fines for those who don't buy health insurance and rated it Barely True .) Here, we wanted to check out whether the plan requires people to buy plans that cost $15,000 per family per year. Here's how the overall plan for reform works: It largely leaves in place the current system for people who get insurance through work, people who have access to the Veterans Administration, and people on Medicare or Medicaid (government-run health insurance plans for the elderly and the poor, respectively). The people who will see the most immediate changes under the health bill are those who have to buy insurance on their own, and the uninsured. The House Democratic plan overhauls the rules for insurers who sell to individuals by creating a virtual marketplace called a health insurance exchange. On the exchange, individuals can compare plans and buy coverage. People of modest means will get a tax credit from the government to help them buy a plan. The poorest people will be enrolled in Medicaid. The $15,000 number that Palin cites comes from a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, a respected, independent federal office that calculates costs associated with pending legislation. The CBO found that in 2016, when the reforms are fully implemented, the annual cost of a basic family policy on the health care exchange will be $15,000. So when Palin says people will have to buy policies that "will cost a minimum of about $15,000 per family per year," that applies only to people who buy insurance on their own. For comparison, the average family policy in 2009 for someone who gets insurance through work is $13,375, according to an analysis from the independent Kaiser Family Foundation. The employer typically pays $9,860 of the policy, while the worker pays the remaining $3,515. People on the exchange will have to pay for the policies on their own, unless they qualify for tax credits to help them buy coverage. The tax credits are on a sliding scale; the House bill says that people who make up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level will qualify for credits. This year, 400 percent of the federal poverty level means $88,200 for a family of four and $43,320 for a single person. Palin said that under the House health care bill, the government "will have to penalize citizens if we choose not to buy a plan that will cost a minimum of about $15,000 per family per year." She's correct that they will be penalized if they don't have insurance. But her statement is misleading in two ways. For many who have health insurance through work, they won't have to pay $15,000 for the family plan because their employer will pay a lot of that. (The average employer would pay about three-fourths, if the current ratio continues.) For people of modest means, the government will give them a tax credit, so it won't cost them the full $15,000, either. The people who will have to pay the full amount will be people who have access to no other insurance and make more than 400 percent of the poverty level. Palin's statement implies that everyone will be forced to buy a family plan that costs them $15,000. In fact, only a small percentage of people would be forced to pay that full amount. So we rate her statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00156	Say Maine U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin "voted to gut your retirement benefits."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/24/maine-democratic-party/maine-democratic-party-overstates-poliquins-plans/	What’s the difference between a trim, a cut or a jagged, painful gutting? The Maine Democratic Party prompts such a question, thanks to a mailer it sent to homes in much of the state. It accuses Bruce Poliquin, the incumbent Republican in Maine’s expansive 2nd Congressional District, of "voting to gut your retirement benefits." The flyer then breaks this down, saying Poliquin has "turned his back on us by: "Voting to gut Social Security "Supporting a raises in the retirement age and capping cost of living increases for Social Security. "Voting to cut $500 billion from Medicare "Voting for a tax plan that rewards his donors but adds nearly $2 trillion to the debt, and will force cuts to Social Security and Medicare." That’s enough to make any retiree frugal, and by necessity, too. But it also appears to be overkill. Here’s why. Retirement "gutting" Some of the ad’s claims are based on a series of votes by Poliquin to approve tax cuts and a federal budget blueprint. Poliquin supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced individual and corporate income tax rates. The Maine Democrats’ flyer provides footnotes to explain how this could affect Social Security and Medicare, and how the tax plan helped Poliquin’s donors. The $1.5 trillion tax package was promoted as a way to propel the economy, because companies would have more money to invest and hire, and families would have more disposable income. Poliquin’s donors presumably supported the cuts, but it is impossible to say whether his retiree-donors — who have given more than $368,468 for his re-election — like them more or less than people behind the business PACs that have given him $1.25 million, or any other donors who helped make up his $3.6 million campaign chest, as of Sept. 30. The only thing certain about that is, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, about 45 percent of the tax cut benefits go to the top 5 percent of earners in the first year, and by 2027, 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent. The tax cuts were paid for through borrowing, and that borrowing will help push annual deficits to over $1 trillion by the year 2020, the Congressional Budget Office says. The CBO agrees that the tax cuts will "increase the supply of labor and capital in the economy, thereby raising potential output." But counting interest, the tax cuts will nevertheless add a cumulative $1.9 trillion to the federal debt over the course of 10 years, the CBO projects. Democrats said from the start that the loss of tax revenue was certain to bolster Republicans’ calls for cuts to Social Security and Medicare, which the GOP says are otherwise unsustainable. Together, they account for about 40 percent of all federal spending. In fact, in early December, 10 days before the House vote on tax cuts, U.S. News reported that House Speaker Paul Ryan said Congress would "have to get back next year at entitlement reform" in order to tackle the debt and the deficit. The Democrats’ worries over this were bolstered recently when on Oct. 16, less than two weeks after the Maine Democrats approved their mailer and prepared to send it to homes, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said spending on the retirement programs would need to be contained. McConnell blamed federal spending, not the tax cuts, for the problem. So how severe could this containment be, and would it amount to a gutting? McConnell and other Republicans have discussed for several years the possibility of shrinking the growth of Social Security and Medicare, not gutting it. Based on public discussions, this would involve delaying or trimming benefits for future retirees, not current ones. Other retirement changes This leads to the second part of the Maine Democrats’ claim — that Poliquin "has turned his back on us" by "supporting a raise in the retirement age and capping cost of living increases for Social Security." The Democrats cited a YouTube video from a 2011 breakfast speech to the Portland, Maine, Community Chamber of Commerce in which Poliquin, then the state treasurer, discussed a $4.3 billion shortfall in the state’s pension fund for teachers and state workers. To deal with it, he supported a proposal to limit cost-of-living increases for current retirees, require higher payments into the fund by those still working, and delay retirement — until age 65 — by workers there less than five years. That was a state pension issue, not a Social Security one. In Maine, employees in the public pension system don’t pay into Social Security and generally don’t draw its benefits. But the next year, when Poliquin ran unsuccessfully in a primary for U.S. Senate, he was quoted in National Review as saying he had a plan for saving Social Security: "The way to do it is raise the retirement age for new entrants and also slow down the rate of growth of benefits." Medicare cuts The other part of the Democrats’ claim is that Poliquin voted "to cut $500 billion from Medicare." This is based on his vote in 2017 for a nonbinding House budget blueprint that laid out Republican priorities, including cutting $487 million from the growth rate of Medicare over a decade. To make this cut, the House would gradually raise Medicare’s eligibility age, which is now 65, or lower than Social Security’s age for full benefits (which is now 66 and moving slowly to age 67). The Republican plan called for a "premium support" program, which means seniors would get a voucher so they could pick among private insurance plans or stick with traditional Medicare. PolitiFact in 2017 looked at a similar proposal from Senate Republicans — who called for a Medicare cut of $473 billion — and determined it would provide the program with 5.5 percent less than if Medicare continued at its current projected spending rate. Our ruling The Maine Democratic Party said Poliquin "voted to gut your retirement benefits." Technically, Poliquin did not vote to do anything to Social Security, although a discussion about cuts is likely. As he said in 2012 of Social Security, "The way to do it is raise the retirement age for new entrants and also slow down the rate of growth of benefits." Similarly, he voted for a budget blueprint that, while not binding, called for getting more insurers involved in Medicare, offering a "premium support" for it and gradually raising the program’s eligibility age. PolitiFact is not pollyannaish. There easily could be slices and dices, which is partly why we have rated claims that referred to that possibility — claims based on the tax and budget bills — as Half True. But "gut" is a strong word and, based on what is known, goes too far. We rate claim Mostly False.

pomt-15344	"Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/10/generation-forward-pac/did-bernie-sanders-vote-against-background-checks-/	As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut. "One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues," CNN’s Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O’Malley group. "Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods," said the attack, which first aired June 25. "Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns." Sanders’ record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire ("Bernie Sanders, gun nut") as well as conservative glee ("Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut"). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation. The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.) But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition: • In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House. • The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992. • After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time). • He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why. • The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it. According to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job. "He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down," Weaver said. "He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont." In April 1991, Sanders’ then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents. "Bernie’s response is that he doesn’t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont," Pollina said. "It’s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about." The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders’ own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us. "As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically," explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. "He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents’ preferences so does not make gun control a priority." "I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line – and angering both sides through the years," said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. "Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians." Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders’ 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half. Here are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position): Year Legislation Sanders’ Vote Result 1993 Imposes a five-day waiting period and background checks on firearm purchases, part of the Brady Bill Nay Passed 1993 Imposes instant background checks instead for firearm purchases, part of an amendment to Brady Bill Yea Passed 1993 Imposes an interim five-day waiting period while while waiting to put a instant background check system in place, part of Brady Bill conference report Nay Passed 1994 Bans semi-automatic assault weapons Yea Passed 1996 Repeals the semi-automatic weapons ban Nay Passed 1998 Increases minimum sentencing for gun crimes Yea Passed 1999 Creates "instant check registrants" and narrowly defines "gun shows," part of the Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act Nay Failed 1999 Imposes three day waiting period for guns purchased at gun shows, part of an amendment to the Gun Show Act Yea Failed 2002 Allows pilots and flight personnel to carry firearms in the cockpit Yea Passed 2003 Prohibits lawsuits against firearm makers for unlawful misuse of a firearm Yea Passed 2005 Prohibits lawsuits against firearm makers for unlawful misuse of a firearm Yea Passed 2006 Prohibits funds from being used to enforce trigger locks on guns Nay Passed 2006 Increases the burden of proof for the AFT to penalize law-breaking gun dealers, as part of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms reform bill Yea Passed 2007 Prohibits foreign aid funding restrictions on U.S. gun ownership, as an amendment to the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2008 Yea Passed 2008 Prevents the use of funds for anti-gun programs as an amendment to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Yea Passed 2009 Gives the District of Columbia seats in the House of Representatives and repeals the district’s ban on semi-automatic weapons Yea Passed 2009 Allows the use of firearms in National Parks Yea Passed 2009 Allows concealed and carry across state lines Nay Failed 2009 Allows firearms in checked baggage on Amtrak trains, as an amendment to the congressional budget Yea Passed 2009 Prohibits higher insurance premiums for gun owners, as part of an amendment to the Affordable Care Act Yea Passed 2013 Prevents the U.S. from entering the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty, as an amendment to the congressional budget Nay Passed 2013 Allows concealed and carry across state lines in states where the practice is not prohibited Nay Failed 2013 Lists all people prohibited buying a firearm in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Yea Failed 2013 Bans high-capacity ammunition magazines carrying more than 10 rounds Yea Failed 2013 Bans assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines Yea Failed Sanders’ moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike. Former NRA research coordinator Paul Blackman says the group doesn’t consider Sanders "an anti-gunner," and he’s received mixed marks from NRA ranging from a C- to F. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isn’t a "gun lobby lapdog." Experts agreed that on guns, Sanders’ views are to the right of his Democratic rivals. "When it comes to guns, he’s not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin O’Malley or Hillary Clinton," said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College. "Guns are not an important issue for him, because they don’t fit into the class-based framework that Bernie looks at politics through." Our ruling An attack ad said, "Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods." The Brady bill imposed a five-day waiting period for would-be purchasers of handguns. Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He did, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background checks. Experts noted Sanders’ votes were representative of Vermont’s gun owners and gun laws. Since the 1990s, his record on gun control is mixed. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-10686	An anonymous e-mail says that Hillary Clinton advocates communism.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/12/chain-email/hillarys-no-red-menace/	An anonymous chain e-mail maligns Hillary Clinton in the form of a "gotcha"-style quiz. The quiz lists six quotations, then asks which famous communist said it. Choices include Karl Marx, Josef Stalin, Mao Tse-tung and other Nazis, fascists and dictators. (We'll leave aside as a minor quibble the fact that communism and Nazism are completely different political philosophies.) Every quotation includes a "none of the above option." At the end of quiz, the punch line is that all the answers are "none of the above" — Hillary Clinton said those things! Get it? The problem with the quiz is that every statement is either taken out of context or edited to look worse than it is. In none of the circumstances was Clinton advocating communist-style government for the United States or socialistic economic policies. In some instances she was criticizing out-of-control government spending or the excesses of Big Business; at other times she was saying that complicated issues will require political consensus. Let's look at the quiz items one by one. • From the chain e-mail: "We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good." This is from 2004 remarks that Clinton made to a roomful of Democratic donors, some of whom paid $10,000 to attend the function, according to the Associated Press. She was discussing the need to end the Bush tax cuts in order to balance the budget. Her full quote was, "We're not coming to you, many of whom are well enough off that actually the tax cuts may have helped you, and say 'We're going to give you more.' We're saying, 'You know what, for America to get back on track and be fiscally responsible, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good. ' " • From the chain e-mail: "It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few, and for the few. ... And to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity." In this one, Clinton was giving a speech in May 2007 attacking the economic policies of the Bush administration. She slammed subsidies for oil and gas companies, tax incentives for companies that move jobs overseas, and excessive CEO pay, according to a report in the Concord (N.H.) Monitor . Notice the italicized phrases that were left out of the chain e-mail quote: "It's time for a new beginning, for an end to government of the few, by the few and for the few. Time to reject the idea of an on-your-own society and replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity. I prefer a we're-all-in-it-together society. " • From the chain e-mail: "(We) ... can't just let business as usual go on, and that means something has to be taken away from some people." Clinton was speaking at a forum on religion and public life hosted by CNN in June 2007. This quote was in reply to a question from a Catholic priest, who asked, "In an age in which there is, oftentimes, narrow and excessive individualism, how will you speak to our country about the need for sacrifice, restraint, when it comes to the critical issues of taxes, gun control, health care, and energy consumption?" Here's Clinton's more complete response about energy: "You know, we can't keep talking about our dependence on foreign oil and the need to deal with global warming and the challenge that it poses to our climate and to God's creation and just let business as usual go on. And that means something has to be taken away from some people." • From the chain e-mail: "We have to build a political consensus and that requires people to give up a little bit of their own ... in order to create this common ground." This quote is from the same CNN forum and question mentioned above, but on the health care issue. Clinton's full quote is a little more verbose and concerns the uninsured: "I think we could reach that agreement, and then we would have to start doing the hard work of deciding what we were going to do to make sure that they were not uninsured, because an uninsured person who goes to the hospital is more likely to die than an insured person. I mean, that is a fact. So what do we do? We have to build a political consensus, and that requires people giving up a little bit of their own turf in order to create this common ground." • From the chain e-mail: "I certainly think the free market has failed." This might be the most egregious of the quiz quotes, because it's taken from a long list of institutions that Clinton says have failed to help kids make good decisions. Clinton was responding to a question, again at the CNN forum, about how antiabortion and proabortion forces can work together to reduce abortions. Clinton said it was important for everyone to help teens make better decisions: "We have so many young people who are tremendously influenced by the media culture and by the celebrity culture, and who have a very difficult time trying to sort out the right decisions to make. And I personally believe that the adult society has failed those people. I mean, I think that we have failed them in our churches, our schools, our government. And I certainly think the, you know, free market has failed. We have all failed." • From the chain e-mail: "I think it's time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in (the) entire economy that they are being watched." Clinton's target here was oil companies. She alleged that they were gouging consumers by raising prices after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, according to a 2005 Washington Post story. "I think it's time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in our entire economy that they're being watched," she said in explaining her call for an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission. "I think human nature left to itself is going to push the limit as far as possible, and that's what you need a government regulatory system for: to keep an eye on people to make the rules of the game fair, to make a level playing field and not give anybody some kind of undue advantage." So is Hillary Clinton advocating communism? Hardly. The masked e-mailer hopes you might think so after reading a political tyrants' Hall of Fame list alongside truncated quotes about taking things away and the collective good. We give the mock quiz a failing grade, with extra points deducted for unabashed fearmongering. Its argument that Clinton advocates Marxism is not just False, it's Pants-on-Fire wrong.

pomt-10005	His proposed budget would "cut our deficit in half by the end of my first term."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/25/barack-obama/obama-promises-cut-deficit-half-four-years/	Defending his budget at a news conference on March 24, President Barack Obama repeated his claim that his plan would cut the deficit in half in five years. "Both under our estimates and under the CBO estimates, both the most conservative estimates out there, we drive down the deficit over the first five years of our budget," Obama said. "The deficit is cut in half. And folks aren't disputing that." Earlier in the news conference, Obama said he'd cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. So we'll look at the picture from four and five years out. According to projections in the Obama administration's proposed budget , released at the end of February, the yearly deficit would go from $1.75 trillion in 2009 to $533 billion in 2013 and $570 billion in 2014. So obviously, by the administration's estimation, the deficit would be cut well more than half whether you measure it until the end of Obama's first term (four years), or five years out. The Congressional Budget Office projections — released a month later — were not as optimistic. The CBO, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, projected the 2009 deficit at $1.8 trillion, and forecast it would taper down to $672 billion in 2013, then to $749 billion in 2014. Still, even those numbers support Obama's assertion that he'd halve the deficit. So technically, Obama is correct. But it's a bit misleading. When Obama says he will halve the deficit, he's comparing it to a 2009 deficit that is massive and far, far above the norm. It's a deficit fueled by a major recession (translation: lost tax revenue) and boosted by costly recession-fixers like the bailouts last fall and the economic stimulus package passed in February. For comparison purposes, we note that the deficit in 2008 was $459 billion (and less than half that the year before). So the deficit is expected to nearly quadruple in 2009. That's the number Obama promises to cut in half. "It’s true, but it's very misleading," said Brian Riedl, a research fellow in federal budget policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "It's true because they quadrupled the deficit this year and then they'll cut that in half." Riedl notes that Obama's projected deficits in four and five years will be "significantly higher" than deficits before the recession. "It's quite easy to cut that in half," echoed Jonathan DeWald, a spokesman for the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that specializes in analysis of budget deficits. Obama was quick to point out that he inherited much of this year's goliath deficit. And he's mostly right. The deficit began skyrocketing before Obama ever took office. In January, the CBO projected the 2009 deficit would balloon to $1.2 trillion. A worsening economy, the burden of the economic stimulus package, and projected spending in Obama's budget led the CBO in late March to revise its 2009 deficit projection to $1.8 trillion. So Obama can't claim that he inherited the entire deficit. But suffice to say the huge jump in the 2009 deficit is not a result of Obama's proposed budget. We note one other point. Although Obama's budget plan is expected to more than halve the 2009 projected deficit in four and five years out, after that, the CBO projects that deficits will begin to grow again, and significantly. The CBO's 10-year outlook predicts a deficit of $1.2 trillion in 2019. That's far more pessimistic than the Obama administration's projections, which Obama rightly attributed in the news conference to different assumptions about the future growth of the economy. "Now, none of us know exactly what's going to happen six or eight or 10 years from now," Obama said. "Here's what I do know: If we don't tackle energy, if we don't improve our education system, if we don't drive down the costs of health care, if we're not making serious investments in science and technology and our infrastructure, then we won't grow 2.6 percent, we won't grow 2.2 percent. We won't grow." And to be extra clear, deficits are one-year snapshots. They represent a revenue versus expenses picture for that year. In other words, Obama is not saying he will be cutting the national debt by half in four or five years. To the contrary, the CBO projects the running total of the country's national debt — which was around $7 trillion when Obama took office — will increase to nearly $12 trillion in four years. In summary, Obama is correct when he says the CBO predicts that under Obama's budget plan, the deficit would be cut in half in five year. But he's comparing it to a year we all hope is a major anomaly, which makes the dramatic-sounding achievement much easier. So we rule his statement Mostly True.

pomt-11891	"People who die from a home invasion make up a sad but minuscule .04% of all gun murders in the U.S. And over a third of them are killed by their own gun that the criminal has either stolen or wrestled from them."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/25/michael-moore/michael-moore-flubs-stats-people-killed-guns-durin/	Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore’s response to the mass shooting in Las Vegas was to propose rewriting the Second Amendment, providing a laundry list of statistics to support his arguments for increased gun control. Moore suggested his "proposed 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution" in an Oct. 4, 2017, Facebook post, three days after a gunman killed 58 and wounded 489 in a massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival. His recommendations included limiting the number of bullets a firearm magazine may hold, banning all automatic and semi-automatic guns, and storing guns outside of the home. "People who die from a home invasion make up a sad but minuscule .04 percent of all gun murders in the US. And over a third of them are killed by their own gun that the criminal has either stolen or wrestled from them," Moore wrote. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Polling shows that self-defense is the top reason most gun owners purchase their weapons, but we wondered whether Moore’s numbers were right. Do homicides during home invasions comprise 0.04 percent of all gun deaths in the United States? And are a third of those people killed with their own weapon? We attempted to contact Moore to learn what sources he used, but didn’t hear back. The figures we found in both cases are difficult to confirm, even for the experts. Elusive statistics Problem No. 1: The term "home invasion" isn’t necessarily used in crime-tracking data. Broadly, the term usually describes a break-in at a residence while the people who live there are present, or more specifically, when someone breaks into a home to rob or hurt the residents. Some jurisdictions use it and some don’t, but there is no universal definition or dataset. What would be called a home invasion is often reclassified as the eventual crime committed by the suspect — a robbery, a physical attack or so forth. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Violent Death Reporting System tracks the location, weapon and crime being committed at the time of a violent death. But there’s no distinction about whether it was during a home invasion, or with the victim’s own firearm. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Report and its Supplementary Homicide Report, which compile data voluntarily provided by local law enforcement agencies, track the number of homicides and whether another crime was being committed. Home invasion is not a specific category, however. Several experts on firearm statistics told us they hadn’t seen a recent study on either home invasions ending in homicide or who owned the weapon used, but Moore’s first point sounded somewhat reasonable. "Every year, there are about 100 burglary homicides in the U.S. If half of these were gun homicides, he would be in the right ballpark," University of Chicago Crime Lab co-director Harold Pollack said. "So the statistic isn’t wildly off base, but I haven’t seen a rigorous analysis. There’s no question that lethal home invasions are terrifying but rare events." When we checked 2015 FBI figures, for example, there were 13,455 reported homicides, and 102 of those happened during burglaries. That’s 0.76 percent of all homicides — but there was no mention of the term home invasion, or the weapon used to commit the homicide. It turns out there is one study that did come close to defining things the way Moore did, but Moore overstated the reported figure. A 2010 report from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics noted that "between 2003 and 2007, approximately 2.1 million household burglaries were reported to the FBI each year on average. Household burglaries ending in homicide made up 0.004% of all burglaries during that period." That’s about 86 people killed during a burglary annually, but the 0.004 percent is from all burglaries, not just ones classified as home invasions. Furthermore, the report’s 0.004 percent is 10 times less than the 0.04 percent figure Moore stated. The study also does not specify a gun was the murder weapon, but rather counts every homicide regardless of how it was committed. Shannan Catalano, a statistician at the Bureau of Justice Statistics, said the datapoint was actually only a side note in her larger report from 2010, but showed how few homicide-related burglaries there were overall. Moore appeared to take the figure from her study, she said, but for some reason got the percentage wrong. Catalano suggested it may have been a typographical error, but had no way of knowing Moore’s intent. Catalano’s broader study used data from her agency’s National Crime Victimization Survey, which uses statistical samples from a cross-section of addresses around the United States to estimate crimes. She said she will update the study in 2018, using the National Incident Based Reporting System. Like everyone else we contacted, Catalano also did not know of a statistic that supported Moore’s second assertion about a third of people being killed with their own gun during these attacks at home. Several studies show owning a firearm greatly increases the risk of unintentional gun-related deaths. Philip Cook, a public policy professor at Duke University, said if a statistic showing people killed by their own weapon in home burglaries exists, it’s not widely known. "I’m quite sure that it’s not part of any of the standard databases," Cook said. "So it must be a one-time study by someone, probably of limited scope." Our ruling Moore said, "People who die from a home invasion make up a sad but minuscule .04 percent of all gun murders in the U.S. And over a third of them are killed by their own gun that the criminal has either stolen or wrestled from them." While Moore has a point that guns are rarely used when someone breaks into a home, it is difficult to confirm. After interviewing several experts and agencies, we only found one study that came close to supporting Moore’s assertion about the number of home invasion deaths. Even then, the report’s author said Moore misstated the scope and specifics. Our sources conceded that the homicide rate during burglaries is a tiny fraction of overall gun deaths, committed during burglaries or otherwise. But none of them, including federal agencies that track crime, could independently verify Moore’s figures about the owner of the weapon used in those crimes the way he claimed. We rate this statement Mostly False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Michael Moore	None	None	None	2017-10-25T17:24:36	2017-10-04	['United_States']

pomt-01034	Since Gov. Nathan Deal office in 2011, the state’s rainy day fund has grown by 643 percent.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/27/nathan-deal/deal-accurate-rainy-day-fund-being-replenished/	Rebuilding the state’s reserve or rainy day fund is something Gov. Nathan Deal likes to crow about. In his 2013 State of the State address, the governor bragged that the rainy day fund had grown 226 percent since he took office in 2011. His staffers were all a-twitter about it then on, um, social media. The news this year, Deal said in his annual speech, is even better. The rainy day fund has grown a whopping 643 percent. It’s hard for most of us to get our minds around those kind of percentages. We knew it was big when the Dow Jones closed up 7.52 percent for 2014. When we heard the governor say the rainy day fund has soared 643 percent, our heads and the unflappable AJC Truth-0-Meter started spinning. First, a little background. Georgia, like other states, has a "rainy day" fund to carry it through tough economic times. The fund had $1.5 billion, or enough money to operate the state for 30 days, on July 1, 2007. But when the Great Recession hit, hurting Georgia harder than many states, the rainy day fund was drawn down to balance the 2008, 2009 and 2010 state budgets. By the end of the 2009 fiscal year, the state’s reserves had dwindled to $104 million. Most states were in the same boat. State rainy day funds collectively fell from $25.9 billion in FY 2007 to $10.4 billion in FY 2010, although they had bounced back to about $21.6 billion by last fall, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. (Note Alaska and Texas aren’t counted in those tallies because their large reserves skew the state averages.) "Since the Great Recession, states have done a relatively good job of rebuilding their reserves,’ said Arturo Perez, a financial analyst with NCSL. By the end of the current fiscal year, most states will have fund balances averaging about 5.8 percent of their revenues, Alaska and Texas not included, Perez said. At the low point, the average had dropped to 1.8 percent, he said. Georgia’s was at 4.5 percent at the end of 2014, Perez said. Now to check Deal’s calculations against state records. Georgia’s rainy day fund had $116,021,961 before Deal took office in 2011 and reached $377,971,440 by June 30, 2012, earning the governor a True rating from PolitiFact for his statement in the State of the State in January 2013. By June 30, 2014, the end of the last fiscal year, the fund had $862,835,447. Deal told lawmakers in his State of the State this month that being conservative had paid off. He said the 2014 budget was based on a conservative estimate that state revenues would increase 3.4 percent. Revenues were actually up 4.8 percent, and the difference went to the rainy day fund, the governor said. "Every budget cycle since I have been governor, we have added to that fund so that it has increased by 643 percent since I took office," Deal said. His numbers add up. The rainy day fund has increased 643 percent since Fiscal Year 2010, the year before he took office. What’s the right amount for tough times? The question that likely worries every family has been debated by officials at all levels of government. Rating agencies recommended in the early 1980s that states set aside 3 percent to 5 percent of their revenues in reserves for economic tough times. The Government Finance Officers Association more recently has suggested that states have 10 percent to 15 percent or two months’ worth of operating money on hand. Alan Essig, executive director of the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said state officials indicated they wanted 10 percent to 15 percent in reserves when the state raised the cap to 15 percent under former Gov. Sonny Perdue, he said. "If that’s the case, Georgia has some work to do before its reserves exceed 10 percent," Essig said. "Reserves equal to 10 to 15 percent would be somewhere between $2 billion and $3 billion." The other way to measure reserves to project how many days they could be used for government operations, and the current money would cover about 16 days, he said. In summary, the state had $1.5 billion in its rainy day fund and relied on it to balance the state budget through the toughest years of the Great Recession. The fund is not where it once was nor is it where it needs to be so the state is ready for the next economic downturn. But it is exactly where Deal said it is -- up 643 percent since he took office. We rate Deal’s statement True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2015-01-27T00:00:00	2015-01-14	['Nathan_Deal']
pomt-02766	Says Nelson Mandela "was a communist."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/11/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-says-nelson-mandela-was-communist/	It’s been almost a quarter century since the Cold War ended. But the recent death of Nelson Mandela has stirred up quite a few old ideological ghosts. When high-profile Republicans including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz released statements of praise for Mandela after his death on Dec. 5, 2013, they were deluged with negative comments by Americans who felt Mandela was either a communist, a terrorist or both. On Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor just hours after Mandela died, host Bill O’Reilly discussed Mandela’s legacy with former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. The exchange got the most attention for Santorum’s comment equating Obamacare with apartheid -- namely, that "we have a great injustice going on right now in this country, with an ever-increasing size of government that is taking over and controlling people’s lives. And Obamacare is front and center in that." In this item, however, we’ll be fact-checking a different claim -- the one by O’Reilly that preceded that statement. Mandela, O’Reilly said, "was a communist." Before looking into the claim, we will note that O’Reilly’s point was more nuanced than this fragment in isolation. O’Reilly said, "Nelson Mandela -- I spent some time in South Africa. He was a communist, this man. He was a communist. All right? But he was a great man. What he did for his people was stunning -- the sacrifices that he made. He could have repudiated and got out of that prison. He wouldn't do it. He was a great man. But he was a communist." So was he? We checked with seven scholars of Mandela and 20th century South African history, and most agreed that Mandela was -- at least for a while -- a member of the Communist Party. However, they added that the label is far from the sum of a very complex political leader. There has never been much question that the South African Communist Party was an ally of Mandela’s African National Congress. "The Tri-Partite Alliance -- the African National Congress, the South African Communist Party and the labor federation COSATU -- cooperated closely in the fight against apartheid," said Douglas Foster, author of After Mandela: The Struggle for Freedom in Post-Apartheid South Africa. But the question of whether Mandela himself was actually a member of the Communist Party has always been murkier. Stephen Ellis, a British historian based in Amsterdam, made waves in 2011 when he published a paper that concluded that Mandela had been a member of the South African Communist Party. The paper was controversial, in no small part because Mandela had suggested throughout his life that he was not. For instance, during Mandela’s trial for treason, the South African government accused him of being a communist. He had his lawyer challenge the accusation, and it was withdrawn, said Danny Schechter, author of Madiba A to Z: The Many Faces of Nelson Mandela. In a Dec. 7 column, Bill Keller of the New York Times quoted Mandela saying, "If by Communist you mean a member of the Communist Party and a person who believes in the theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, and who adheres strictly to the discipline of the party, I did not become a Communist." To Keller, this answer was "both evasive and perfectly accurate." By the time of Ellis’ paper, Mandela was too ill to be asked about it publicly. But among scholars at least, lingering doubts about Ellis’ finding were largely washed away the day Mandela died. Upon Mandela’s death, the South African Communist Party released a statement of mourning that revealed that, "at his arrest in August 1962, Nelson Mandela was not only a member of the then-underground South African Communist Party, but was also a member of our Party's Central Committee." Tom Lodge, a professor at the University of Limerick and author of Mandela: A Critical Life said Mandela "joined the SACP probably in late 1960, early enough to be involved in its decision to adopt a strategy of ‘armed struggle.’ It seems that he had second thoughts about his membership while touring Africa in early 1962." It’s unclear whether Mandela ever formally resigned, Lodge said, but "certainly by the late 1960s, the Communist Party no longer regarded him as a member." In its statement, the South African Communist Party called him "a great and close friend of the communists till his last days," a phrasing that suggests that he wasn’t actually a party member any longer. There is no indication he was a party member at the time he was elected president after being released from prison. So the weight of the historical evidence is that O’Reilly was correct to say that Mandela "was a communist." But scholars told us it’s important to leaven this with a few bits of context. • Mandela was not a communist ideologue. "Mandela is the least ideologically rigid leader I have ever encountered," said John Carlin, author of Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation. "He was the very opposite of a fanatic. He showed immense respect for all political points of view and never to my knowledge believed he had the answers to the problems of human life, much less the key to heaven on earth, as his Communist brethren might have done." Indeed, Carlin said, during Mandela’s 27-year imprisonment at Robben Island, he "had long and heated debates with the one big South African Communist Party figure imprisoned there, Govan Mbeki." Foster said that even if Mandela was officially a Communist Party member for a time, he would not have defined himself that way. "Nobody who has even a passing familiarity with South African history, and Mandela's role, would describe him as someone with mixed loyalties," Foster said. "He was a disciplined, true-blue member of the ANC through his entire adulthood." • For decades, there were few allies Mandela could have sought out in the fight against apartheid. At the time Mandela would have been a South African Communist Party member, all liberation groups (including the Communist Party) were banned. And within this small group of opponents of apartheid, only the Communist Party was multiracial. "The Communist Party in South Africa was attractive to some because it was the only nonracial party at the time for activists who didn't want to be defined ethnically," Schechter said. "For many years, the ANC was only for Africans, the Indian Congress for Indians and the Congress of Democrats for Whites." Indeed, Keller writes that the legacy of nonracialism was one of the most valuable legacies of Mandela’s alignment with the Communist Party, since it made racial reconciliation possible after the toppling of apartheid. (Keller also lists other, less positive legacies, including "remnants of Communist protocol and jargon (that) live on in the platform and demeanor of South Africa’s ruling party.") • The Communist Party – due in part to its long fight against apartheid – does not have the same negative connotation in South Africa that it does in the United States. Former South African President F.W. DeKlerk -- who worked with Mandela to end apartheid -- told Schechter that Communist Party leader Joe Slovo "played a pragmatic and crucial role in engineering the compromises that led to a political settlement. … All this ‘commie’ talk obscures more than it reveals." In fact, "half the members of the present cabinet in South Africa are party members," Lodge added. "It really isn’t an issue." Our ruling O’Reilly said that Mandela "was a communist." The weight of the historical evidence shows that O’Reilly is correct. For a time, Mandela -- despite his denials -- appears to have been a member not only of the party but also of its central committee. However, it’s worth noting that Mandela’s affiliation with the party or its goals was never a dominant feature of his ideology or message. We rate O’Reilly’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-04337	While she was mayor, Lois Frankel took a "police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/25/adam-hasner/adam-hasner-says-lois-frankel-used-police-chopper-/	Republican congressional candidate Adam Hasner has accused his Democratic opponent Lois Frankel of hitching a ride on a police chopper that rushed her to a party when she was mayor of West Palm Beach. The incensed female narrator in Republican Hasner’s ad "Gotta Go" says: "That Lois Frankel is something. She gave herself a 40 percent pay raise. Charged us for a police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party. But the worst part? Frankel spent over $13,000 in taxpayer money on a marble shower in a private bathroom with her own toilet. What a waste. "All that money right down the drain for her own personal use," says the narrator, who is revealed to be sitting on a toilet."When you gotta go, you gotta go but that’s just ridiculous." The claims in the ad are similar to an ad by the YG Action Fund, a conservative PAC which showed Frankel’s headshot inside a cartoon image of a helicopter flying near a mansion with balloons falling from the sky. We fact-checked a claim by the PAC that Frankel got a 40 percent pay raise while the city of West Palm Beach lost jobs. We rated that claim Half True because the pay raise was correct but the ad failed to accurately explain the jobs picture. We also looked at whether Frankel spent money on a marble shower. We rated that Half True as well. In this fact-check we will focus on Hasner’s claim that Frankel took a ride in the city’s helicopter to go to a dinner party. We aren’t weighing in on whether it was a good decision by Frankel to take that ride -- our role is to evaluate whether Hasner accurately portrayed it. Hasner and Frankel, both former state legislators who have each raised just shy of $3 million, are competing in the Broward/Palm Beach Congressional District 22. Frankel was mayor of West Palm Beach between 2003 and 2011. Helicopter ride featured in gossip column The ad cites an April 2005 Palm Beach Post article by gossip columnist Jose Lambiet. (He now writes a column for the Miami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida partner.) The article didn’t state the date of the helicopter ride but said "earlier this year" Frankel’s aide drove her during rush hour to a homeowner’s association meeting, where she said she was there "just to shake hands." About an hour later, a police chopper landed on the community’s golf course and Frankel was taken to a party downtown. The columnist described it as an affair thrown by "Clematis-area merchants ticked off about - you guessed it - roadwork." "What sounds like a party to you is work for me," Frankel said at the time. "I called in the helicopter with clear instructions that, if there was a public safety emergency, they wouldn't need to come. I don't make a habit of this." "I did see all the cars stuck down there. I was thinking: 'Maybe I should do this more often,' " she said. Lambiet wrote that Police Chief Delsa Bush didn't know about the mayor’s ride but said, "The mayor's the boss, and she's welcome to use the chopper. … The county commissioners have police escorts. Why can't the mayor?" Frankel interview with PolitiFact When we interviewed Frankel, she said that she never took a city helicopter to a personal party -- it was a work party. Frankel said around Christmas she went to a community party on one edge of the city but was also scheduled to host a party hosted by the city’s Downtown Development Authority the same night. "It was one of those things -- I was supposed to be at two places at one time," she said. We asked Frankel if she used the police helicopter to get to any other events. She said "Maybe one other time from a work event to another work event. I didn’t go up that often. I am pretty claustrophobic, hydrophobic." We noticed that Frankel said the helicopter ride occurred around Christmas time, but Lambiet’s column -- which simply said "earlier this year" -- was written April 3. Lambiet told us in an interview that he thought that the chopper ride was a few days before his column was published. The exact date of the ride wasn’t crucial to rule on Hasner’s claim but we thought it was important to try to pin down exactly which party Frankel had attended. Frankel’s campaign supplied us with two calendar entries for the mayor on Dec. 22, 2004. The first one states "5 p.m. Sharp! Ibis Tropical Cheers" and states that the event would end at six. The other calendar entry states that from 6 to 8 p.m., Frankel would host a holiday party at Wine Living and includes a contact phone number for the Downtown Development Authority. (Wine Living has since closed.) The calendar entries don’t specifically discuss the police helicopter. However, both calendar entries state "required to Arthur Apicella" in the police department. Frankel’s campaign says that Apicella was in charge of the helicopter at the time and has since retired. Our efforts to reach Apicella were unsuccessful. We interviewed Art Bullard, Frankel’s executive assistant at the time, who drove her to the event in Ibis. "That particular event, it was important enough that she made the decision to take the helicopter," Bullard said. "It wasn’t an everyday procedure. I think it happened maybe once or twice." Our ruling Hasner’s ad says that while she was mayor of West Palm Beach, Frankel took a "police helicopter ride to go to a dinner party." But Frankel says she never took the helicopter to get to a private party -- only in her duties as mayor. Public records we found appear to support that. The ad left open to interpretation whether that was a private party or a mayoral event. So for making that unclear we rate this ad Half True.

pomt-05333	George Allen and his colleagues in the Senate "turned the biggest surplus in the history of the United States into the biggest deficit in the history of the United States."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2012/may/15/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-claims-deficit-george-allen-helped-turn-/	Editors Note: On Dec. 26, 2011, PolitiFact Virginia rated as Mostly True a statement by Democrat Tim Kaine that Republican George Allen, during his term in the U.S. Senate from 2001-2007, helped turn the largest budget surplus in U.S. history into the largest deficit. Our ruling was largely based on raw federal budget numbers dating back to the 1930s. The Allen campaign recently told us that our rating did not give enough credence to what two economists said in the original story: The best way to compare deficits through history is to express them as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product at the time. We took a new look at the fact-check and concluded the Allen campaign is right. So we are changing our rating to Half True because there is still validity to Kaine’s claim, but his numbers need context. And we are providing a new analysis, which appears below: Democratic Senate candidate Tim Kaine says that Republican George Allen was a big spender during his term in the U.S. Senate from 2001 to 2007. "He (Allen) turned, and his colleagues in the majority in the Senate turned, the biggest surplus in the history of the United States into the biggest deficit in the history of the United States," Kaine said in a Dec. 7, 2011 debate between the two candidates. We should point out that when measured in raw dollar terms, deficits in the last couple years have easily been the largest shortfalls ever. This fiscal year alone it’s projected to be $1.33 trillion, according to the Office of Management and Budget. But Brandi Hoffine, a Kaine campaign spokeswoman, said Kaine was referring specifically to surpluses and deficits as they stood at the time of Allen’s term in the Senate. Allen supported each of about four dozen appropriations bills that came to the Senate floor during his tenure. Did a record U.S. surplus melt into an historic deficit during Allen’s time? We checked. Hoffine, in an email to us, correctly noted that Office of Management and Budget data shows the surplus hit $236 billion in fiscal 2000. The data also show the budget sank to a $412.7 billion deficit in fiscal 2004. One way is to look at the numbers, as Kaine did, are as measurements of surpluses and deficits in their current year dollars without adjustment for inflation. By that method, 2004 had the highest deficit on record up until that time. Fiscal year 2000, which ended a couple months before Allen arrived, had the highest surplus on record. In May 2001, the Congressional Budget Office had been projecting another banner surplus for fiscal year 2001 -- $275 billion. But in an updated August 2001 analysis, the CBO said the surplus that year was expected to be much lower -- $153 billion. The main reasons for the diminished outlook, the CBO said, were the sluggish economy (a recession hit in 2001), as well as the enactment of the Bush tax cuts in 2001, which Allen supported. The OMB also provides data measuring each year’s deficit or surplus in 2005 dollars that have been adjusted for inflation. When that’s done, the deficits during World War II were greater than the 2004 deficit peak during Allen’s tenure. For example, when measured in 2005 dollars, the deficit was $531.7 billion in 1943. In 2004, the height of the deficit during Allen’s term, the shortfall was $428 billion. So by that measurement, Kaine’s claim does not hold up. A third way to look at this -- favored by several analysts we spoke with -- measures surpluses and deficits as a percentage of the country’s gross domestic product in a given year. The comparison to GDP -- the market value of all goods and services produced by a country -- provides a gauge of a nation’s ability to absorb its deficit. In 2004, the U.S deficit was 3.5 percent of GDP, the highest level during Allen’s term. Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, noted the deficit was a higher percentage of GDP at other times, including under President Ronald Reagan from 1982 to 1986. The Reagan administration hit its high water mark in 1983 when the deficit was 6 percent of GDP. OMB tables show other periods -- including the early 1990s, World War II and the 1930s -- when the deficit as a share of GDP was greater than 2004. The 2000 surplus was 2.4 percent of GDP. We found one point, in 1948, when the surplus was bigger -- 4.6 percent of GDP, according to the OMB tables. Kogan said measuring the deficit by current year dollars, without taking into account for inflation and other factors, is "one way of looking at the story." "It’s not the best way. The best way of looking at the story is to measure deficits as a share of GDP," Kogan said. "The reason for that is numbers have vastly different meanings over decades." Kogan said most analysts compare deficits through history by measuring how they compare to a particular year’s GDP. But Kogan said that when measuring deficits in strict dollar terms and not adjusting for inflation, Kaine’s statement isn’t entirely off the mark. "As long as he (Kaine) meant through that date, through when Allen left the Senate, he’s literally correct," Kogan said. Michael Linden, director of tax and budget policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, said Kaine’s broad point that the surplus switched to deficits is correct. But Linden said he cringes when he hears historic comparisons using raw dollar figures. "Dollars are worth different things in different years," said Linden, who prefers measuring deficits as a share of GDP. Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said it’s not wrong using raw dollar tallies when comparing deficits over time. Ornstein, however, said he thinks it would be better to use dollars that have been adjusted for inflation. Our ruling Kaine said Allen, during his term in the Senate, was part of a Republican majority that turned the largest surplus in U.S. history into the nation’s biggest deficit up until then. Kaine relied on raw numbers that do show the surplus peaked a few months before Allen took office and then dove into a record deficit during Allen’s term. But analysts said Kaine’s numbers -- which are unadjusted for inflation and do not take into account the size of the U.S. economy at the time -- are a weak basis for historical comparison. Several analysts told us the best historical measure comes from looking at annual surpluses and deficits as a percentage of the nation’s GDP for a given year. By that gauge, although the U.S. had high deficits during Allen’s term, they were not close to record-setting. So Kaine’s statement is accurate in terms of raw numbers, but it frays when historical context is added. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-02710	"Kathleen Peters refuses to ‘take a stand’ to repeal Obamacare."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/dec/27/david-jolly/david-jolly-says-kathleen-peters-wont-take-stand-r/	The 13th U.S. Congressional District race is heating up ahead of the Jan. 14 Republican primary, with front-running candidates David Jolly and state Rep. Kathleen Peters taking swipes at each other in mailings and TV commercials. In the first flier we saw attacking Peters, David Jolly’s campaign paints the state representative from South Pasadena as being compliant with the Affordable Care Act. It shows Peters and Democratic challenger Alex Sink in a photo collage with President Barack Obama, with the words, "It’s Pinellas County’s worst nightmare! … Keeping Obamacare!" The mailing quotes Peters saying, "I do not think we should take a stand and say absolutely repeal it." In a Republican primary, the attack that a politician is pro-Obamacare -- or even just Obamacare-tolerant -- can be potent. We wanted to know if the flier is accurate in saying that Peters "refuses to ‘take a stand’ to repeal Obamacare." The magic word Peters has been a state representative since 2012 for House District 69, which includes Treasure Island, South Pasadena and Gulfport. We couldn’t find any public comments from Peters on the Affordable Care Act before she decided to run for the late C.W. Bill Young’s open U.S. House seat. At a Suncoast Tiger Bay Club forum in St. Petersburg on Dec. 6, Peters fielded a question from an audience member who asked what her position to improve health care was. "What I can tell you is that I don’t like the plan that we currently have to take care of affordable health care. And I don’t even think they named it appropriately, and I think it’s one of those wolves in sheep’s clothing when they call it the Affordable Care Act, because it is not at all affordable," Peters answered. "I do not think that we should take a stand and say absolutely repeal it. Not unless we have a plan and a proposal to replace it." She added she didn’t think pre-existing conditions should be a factor in obtaining insurance, and gave an anecdote about how she had previously had difficulties with insurance companies after a surgery. "Is it a problem? Yes, we have to address it," she concluded. "But we can’t just repeal it, we have to have a comprehensive plan ... something that’s affordable, that isn’t mandating down and forces people to not have choices." Jolly, who has been very vocal in his opposition to the law, has said he is using the flier as "a contrast piece," to illustrate how he wants to repeal the law and Peters doesn’t. The quote he chose, however, doesn’t include much context or any indication of Peters’ other talking points about Obamacare. Peters previously told the Tampa Bay Times she didn’t believe "this affordable care act is truly affordable," but didn’t change her message that some portions of the law -- such as not denying coverage to patients -- were worth keeping. "I don't think we can just go back to the way it was," she said. This point of view seems to largely fall in line with many Americans. A Gallup poll released on Dec. 6 found that only 30 percent of respondents wanted it gone entirely. The rest wanted to law kept, scaled back or expanded. We should note, though, that when the results are broken down by party affiliation, 68 percent of Republicans favor repeal. Peters seemed to change the tack of her arguments immediately after the flier was mailed out, posting a message on Facebook dealing with Jolly’s implications. She began clearly stating she supported repeal of Obamacare. "David Jolly is shamelessly attempting to tie Alex Sink’s support of this law with my position," she wrote. "I want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but at the same time, we have to have a viable option to replace the law." She has since solidified her position, saying during a Dec. 19 press conference that she supports the repeal of Obamacare. "I want to be very clear, I support full repeal of Obamacare," she said. "Jolly has misrepresented me on this issue." She also told PolitiFact Florida via email she is seeking to replace the law "with free-market based solutions" and added "there are several Republican alternatives that I am currently reviewing to cosponsor in the future." Her view seems to square with national Republicans who have advocated a "repeal and replace" strategy since 2010. Our ruling Jolly wanted to portray Peters as soft on Obamacare, in an attempt to win over conservative voters. His use of Peters’ quote, "I do not think we should take a stand and say absolutely repeal it" without context is designed to appeal to voters who want the law taken off the books entirely. Peters has repeatedly said she doesn’t support the law, but doesn’t feel it would be good policy to simply strip the Affordable Care Act off the books without addressing some of the problems in the health care system. Her stance lacked specifics before the mailing came out, but it was always clear she wasn’t a staunch Obamacare advocate. She repeatedly said or implied the law should go, so long as some provisions could be retained, such as helping people with pre-existing conditions get insurance. The mailer attempts to make it appear as if she supports the law, which she didn’t do even before clarifying her message. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-01223	In the 2014 elections, "the American people overwhelmingly said we don't want Obamacare … and we don't want amnesty."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/21/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-2014-elections-voters-made-clear-the/	The night before President Barack Obama was scheduled to announce that he was removing the threat of deportation from up to 5 million undocumented immigrants, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, launched a preemptive strike during an appearance on Fox News. Cruz told Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly that "it's incumbent on Republicans in Congress to use every single constitutional tool we have to defend the rule of law to rein in" Obama so that the president "does not become an unaccountable monarch imposing his own policies in defiance of the American people." Cruz went on to say that the election results demonstrated that on two issues -- health care and immigration -- the American public delivered a resounding blow in favor of the Republican position. He said: "You know, in elections that he liked, the president was fond of saying elections have consequences. Well, this last election there was no ambiguity. There were two issues that dominated this last election. Number one, Obamacare. And number two, amnesty. This was a referendum on amnesty. And the American people overwhelmingly said we don't want Obamacare. It's a disaster. It's hurting the American people. And we don't want amnesty. And I'm sorry to say the president is behaving in an unprecedented way. There is not in recent times any parallel for a president repudiated by the voters standing up and essentially telling the voters go jump in a lake, he's going to force his powers." We wondered: Is there data to back up Cruz’s contention that in the 2014 elections, "the American people overwhelmingly said we don't want Obamacare … and we don't want amnesty"? No one would question that the Republicans delivered a massive electoral victory in the 2014 midterm elections, and the party’s dominant position against both Obamacare and legalized status for illegal immigrants was hardly a state secret. "The poll that counts is at the ballot box," said Phil Novack, deputy press secretary for Cruz. "In 2015 Republicans will control more legislative seats nationwide than anytime since the 1920s. Across the country, Republican candidates were united with a message to stop Obamacare, to stop its continuing damage to our economy, and to stop Obama’s amnesty, and the American people delivered a clear mandate on these priorities." This was especially true in the competitive Senate races. We rated Mostly True the claim that every new Republican member of the U.S. Senate said they "will vote to repeal and replace Obamacare." So voters undeniably rewarded the party which plainly advocated the views Cruz highlights. Still, the evidence that voters cast ballots as they did because of those policy positions is a lot less clear. Novack said that "polls published before and after the election showed a majority of Americans in opposition to both Obamacare and Obama’s executive action on amnesty." However, the best way to measure how voters on election day actually felt -- which is what Cruz's claim refers to -- is to use responses to the national exit poll. Every two years, a consortium of media outlets collectively samples opinion across the country on Election Day, either as voters leave the polls or through a supplemental phone survey of those who voted early or by absentee ballot. The 2014 exit poll results are summarized here. Fortuitously for this fact-check, the exit poll asked about both Obamacare and illegal immigration. Did the American people say "overwhelmingly" that "we don't want Obamacare"? Exit poll respondents were asked to complete the sentence, "Do you think the 2010 federal health care law…," with one of three options. The most common answer -- 49 percent -- was that the law "went too far." But the other two options -- that the law "was about right," or that it "did not go far enough" -- collectively totaled 46 percent. That’s a pretty tight split -- so tight, in fact, that it’s within the margin of error. This question had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, meaning that, due to imperfect sampling techniques, there actually may have been slightly more Americans who think the law is "about right" or "did not go far enough." Either way, Cruz is wrong to say that the "American people overwhelmingly" opposed Obamacare on Election Day. At most, a small plurality opposed the law -- and maybe not even that. Did Americans on Election Day say "we don't want amnesty"? The term "amnesty" is one open to some debate. Many Republicans use it to describe any process that ultimately leads to legal status for the undocumented, while Democrats counter that Obama’s preferred course -- allowing illegal immigrants to apply for legal status only after certain hurdles such as fines and waiting periods are imposed -- is much more rigorous than no-fault "amnesty." We won’t referee this debate here, but the exit poll asked a question that sheds some light on the electorate’s view. The exit poll asked respondents to complete this sentence: "Should most illegal immigrants working in the United States be. …" with one of two options. "Offered a chance to apply for legal status" was chosen by 57 percent of respondents, while "deported to the country they came from" was the choice of 39 percent. (This question also had a 3-percentage-point sampling error margin, but the gap was so big that the error margin doesn’t come into play.) What this means is that voters in Election 2014 didn’t reject "amnesty." If you take the term to mean what Republicans say it means -- a path to legal status -- then voters actually supported that option by an 18-point margin. What is the most important issue facing the country? One more question sheds some light on Cruz’s claim. The exit poll asked respondents to choose the "most important issue facing the country today" from among four choices: foreign policy, health care, the economy and illegal immigration. Health care was the choice of 25 percent, and illegal immigration was named by 14 percent. Both of these options trailed the top choice -- the economy, named by 45 percent of respondents -- by a substantial margin. Even among the 25 percent who cited health care as their top issue, these voters were more likely to be Democrats -- 59 percent to 39 percent. This further weakens Cruz’s case that opposition to Obamacare drove the electorate. (Just 14 percent of Democrats in the exit poll said Obamacare went too far.) In other words, not only was Cruz incorrect in describing the voters’ policy preferences in Election 2014, but he was also off-base in saying that Obamacare and illegal immigration "dominated this last election." If anything dominated the minds of voters, it was the economy. Our ruling Cruz said that in the 2014 elections, "the American people overwhelmingly said we don't want Obamacare … and we don't want amnesty." Exit poll data shows that, at most, Americans were slightly -- not "overwhelmingly" -- against Obamacare, and even that edge is in doubt because the lead for the anti-Obamacare side is within the margin of error. Meanwhile, exit poll data also shows that voters, by a 3-to-2 margin, actually favored offering the possibility of legal status to illegal immigrants. We rate Cruz’s claim False.

pomt-14157	"You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2016/apr/29/amy-schumer/fact-checking-amy-schumers-welcome-gun-show/	Searching for a great gift for all ages? Look no further, Amy Schumer has the product for you. In a recent sketch on her Comedy Central show Inside Amy Schumer, Schumer and fellow comedian Kyle Dunnigan play infomercial hosts pitching viewers on the perfect "stocking stuffer": a handgun. A hopeful buyer laments that he can’t get a gun because he has a criminal record riddled with felonies. "Caller, you bite your tongue, you silly goose!" Schumer’s character says. "You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies, as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show." "If you go to a gun show, you can get an unlicensed seller to sell you a gun, no questions asked," Dunnigan added We’ve looked at similar claims before. Because this sketch is getting a lot of attention, we wanted to recap whether a felon can actually buy a gun on the Internet or at a gun show. This isn’t the first time Schumer has tackled gun issues; she has been a vocal advocate for stricter gun laws since a gunman killed two and injured many others at a showing of her feature film Trainwreck in a Louisiana movie theater in 2015. But it is her first time on the Truth-O-Meter. The 'gun show loophole' To be clear: The kind of transaction Schumer’s character describes is illegal. Federal law prohibits felons from getting a gun unless their rights have been formally restored. Felons can theoretically get around this obstacle, however, by buying guns from unlicensed sellers who are not required to conduct criminal background checks. This is sometimes referred to as the "gun show loophole," even though it refers to all private sales, and not everyone considers it a loophole. Schumer’s sketch was referring to this aspect of current gun law, said a spokesman for Everytown for Gun Safety, gun control advocacy group Schumer promotes at the end of the sketch. Anyone who repeatedly buys and sells firearms "with the principal motive of making a profit" is supposed to get a dealer’s license, whether they deal out of a brick-and-mortar store, a gun show, or online, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Licensed firearm dealers must run background checks on non-licensed buyers before selling them a gun. But the law does not require a dealer’s license for private hobbyists and others who occasionally buy and sell guns. If an individual buys a gun from someone who is not required to have a license, the purchaser does not have to undergo a background check. So a violent felon could buy a gun from a hobbyist over the Internet or at a gun show because he or she would not be subject to a background check. The purchase would still be illegal, because of the buyer’s felon status, but it would not create an immediate red flag. The same thing can happen at a gun show. There are a few important limitations on these sorts of private transactions. First, it is illegal for private sellers to transfer a gun to someone they either know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun, for example, if the seller knows the buyer is a felon. But private sellers "can give themselves plausible deniability by not asking the necessary questions," Garen Wintemute, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California Davis, previously told PolitiFact. So in the case of Schumer’s show, she and her co-host would not have that cushion of plausible deniability because the hopeful buyer told them outright that he is a felon. The giant "gun show" banner doesn’t make a difference. Second, private sales, online or otherwise, cannot take place across state lines, so the buyer and seller must be in the same state. And there are many restrictions on shipping guns, so the actual transaction is likely to take place in person, as opposed to the buyer entering credit card information online, and the seller shipping the gun to the buyer’s house. And third, several states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington — and the District of Columbia require background checks for all private gun sales. With all these restrictions, how many people actually buy guns without a background check? The truth is we don’t really know. The only statistics floating around are outdated and flawed. Professors at Northeastern and Harvard universities conducted a gun survey in 2015 that isn’t yet published. The national survey of 4,000 non-institutionalized adults found that 22 percent of the people who purchased guns — at gun shows, stores or elsewhere — underwent no background check, Matthew Miller, professor of Health Sciences and Epidemiology at Northeastern and co-director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, told us in January. When researchers excluded purchases between family and friends, that number dropped to 15 percent, which equates to approximately 5 million gun owners whose most recent purchase did not involve a background check. One more thing: Later in Schumer’s sketch, another hopeful buyer calls in to ask if he can get a gun even though he’s a suspected terrorist on the no-fly list. "You’re fine, sweet potato fry," Schumer’s character says. A March 2015 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office examined how many people applying for gun purchases went through the FBI’s instant background check system and also were on the FBI’s list of "those known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity." Between February 2004, and December 2014, 2,233 people on the list applied to buy a weapon. Of those, 2,043 were allowed to proceed. Our ruling Schumer’s character said, "You can absolutely get a gun if you have several felonies as long as you buy it on the Internet or at a gun show." The kind of transaction Schumer described is possible, though illegal, and far more complicated than her comment suggests. Federal law prohibits felons from buying guns. But with some effort, they could purchase a gun from private sellers over the Internet or at a gun show without getting caught, because private sellers are not required to run background checks. Schumer is doing a comedy bit, but compared with similar claims we’ve checked, her phrasing makes it sound like buying guns with a felony is easy and lawful. That is not the case. The context is significant. We rate her claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ca5b556b-81f3-4a7d-bf47-77c40966a6af	None	Amy Schumer	None	None	None	2016-04-29T14:28:17	2016-04-28	['None']
