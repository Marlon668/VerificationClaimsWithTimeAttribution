pomt-05445	A proposed U.S. Labor Department rule for children working on farms "would even ban youth from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/apr/26/tom-rooney/tom-rooney-farming-kids-screwdrivers-hoses/	Update (April 27, 2012): A few hours after our item posted about U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney’s claim related to a proposed child farm labor rule, the Department of Labor withdrew the rule in response to opposition from lawmakers and farmers. "The decision to withdraw this rule – including provisions to define the 'parental exemption' – was made in response to thousands of comments expressing concerns about the effect of the proposed rules on small family-owned farms. To be clear, this regulation will not be pursued for the duration of the Obama administration," the April 26, 2012 press release states, adding that the department will instead work with rural stakeholders to develop a program to promote safety. The Department of Labor’s announcement -- while good news for Rooney and others who opposed the rule -- does not affect our rating in this fact-check. Rooney failed to provide evidence that children working on farms would be banned from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose, as he claimed, and the Department of Labor specifically said those activities would not be prohibited under the proposed rule. --------------- Family farms are under attack by the feds, because the government is proposing a new rule that would restrict children working on farms, said U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla. Rooney, chair of a House Agriculture Subcommittee, cosponsored a bill to fight the rule change proposed last year by the U.S. Labor Department. Rooney wrote that the rule would "would threaten generations of farm tradition and culture....The language of the proposed rule is so specific it would even ban youth from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose." Does the proposal ban children from using such basic equipment as a battery-powered screwdriver to fix a fence or use a pressurized garden hose to wash a truck? That claim caught our eye because it sounded like simple tools that could be found in any home -- not just on farms. As we researched, we found the battery-powered screwdriver has become a symbol for politicians and farmers fighting the rule. When we searched the more than 10,000 comments submitted to the department, we found 177 mentions of "screwdriver". In Florida, Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam opposed the regulations. A letter signed by the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association said the proposal would mean kids couldn’t draw water for a bucket or ride an asparagus cart. Joy Goodwin, an agriculture education graduate student at the University of Florida wrote, "We believe it is more responsible to teach students to be safe, rather than to tell them, ‘Oh don’t do that, you might get hurt.’" Rule includes parental exemption The Labor Department wrote that the goal is to increase safety and provide parity between rules for children working on farms and non-farm settings. (Some of this background comes from our sister site, PolitiFact Tennessee, which looked at a similar claim from Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander.) For decades, a parental exemption has allowed children to do any job on a farm owned or operated by their parents. That means if Dad puts using a screwdriver or garden hose on the list of the kids’ chores, the feds won’t raise a fuss. The summary of the proposed rules states they "would impact only hired farm workers and in no way compromise the statutory child labor parental exemption involving children working on farms owned or operated by their parents." The way the department interpreted that exemption -- that farms had to be wholly owned by parents for kids to work -- led to an outpouring of angry letters from family farmers. In February, the department announced that it would rework that section by 2012 and any decision on a final rule would follow. That was welcome news to family farmers who believe that they -- not the feds -- should oversee their children’s work. Rooney’s press release doesn’t mention that the new rules wouldn’t apply to children who fall under the parental exemption. Also, there are separate rules for children who qualify for the "student learner exception" -- hired workers who are 14 and 15 could qualify to operate certain power-driven equipment and operate a tractor, if the tractor is equipped with seatbelts and rollover protection structures. Still, the rules leave lots of proposed no-nos for children working somewhere other than their own parents' farms. Children under 16 would be banned from harvesting tobacco, doing certain work with animals, and working from ladders or structures at elevations higher than 6 feet. Violators would face fines, and the government can stop shipment on crops. (We’ll address more of the thinking behind the restrictions in just a bit.) Rule doesn’t cite screwdrivers or hoses The proposed rule doesn’t specifically mention battery-powered screwdrivers or pressurized garden hoses. So we asked Rooney spokesman Michael Mahaffey for an explanation. He pointed to a section that states the rule would "prohibit operating and assisting in the operation of power-driven equipment and contain a limited exemption for student-learners." The rule defines power-driven equipment to include "machines, equipment, implements, vehicles, and/or devices operated by any power source other than human hand or foot power… Equipment operated by any source of energy, such as wind, electricity, fossil fuels, batteries, animals, or water, would all be considered ‘power-driven.’" That language is broad. And the concern about broad language isn’t only a Republican talking point. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control, said the proposal for power equipment "may be unnecessarily restrictive." The institute wrote that the rule "would prohibit the use of small handheld battery-powered equipment (e.g., a flashlight)" that could be safely handled by youth. If that ban remains, the institute suggested an exception for "student learners." Labor Department Secretary Hilda Solis said at a March Senate subcommittee hearing that the department has no intention of banning children from using screwdrivers. In response to a question from a senator, Solis said, "Some of the comments that you make about the use of powered screwdrivers and what have you, I think those are taken out of context, and they’re not what we’re proposing. So we do need to do a better job of communicating if that is what is being said out there." Solis said the department will "certainly clarify those areas you pointed out that I believe are misinterpreted." At a House appropriations subcommittee hearing later that same month, Solis debunked the claim again: "So I want to be very practical because we've heard some really outlandish things said in other committees that we would somehow regulate automated or battery-powered screwdrivers that -- nothing could be farther from the truth of what we want to do here." Later in the hearing, she added that the department’s goal was to prevent accidents that cause serious injury and even death. "We're not talking about battery-powered screwdrivers, we're talking about tractors. When talking about bins, we're talking about grain operation where children have been killed or have been maimed," Solis said. "We're also not talking about precluding educational program. We encourage that, we're not in any way trying to take away that particular part of the culture. I understand that my father was a farm worker, I know that." We couldn’t find a statement by Solis in which she specifically addressed garden hoses. But a department spokesperson said later that the department won’t ban children from using them. Child safety on farms As Solis emphasized at the hearings, the rules’ goal is to increase safety. A peer-reviewed article in the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics noted that while few adolescents are employed on farms, compared with other work, "the proportion of fatalities in agriculture is higher than that for any other type of adolescent employment." The rules specifically note that they’re aimed at preventing injury and death, citing specific examples. Some of the details in the rules are not for the squeamish, detailing gruesome deaths of youths chewed up in various kinds of machinery. Such concerns date to the turn of the last century and are recorded in the findings of the National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health, which routinely looks at promoting safe work conditions for young workers. "The reason the labor laws are in place is…because there have been kids who have been hurt," said Diane E. Bush, coordinator of the Labor Occupational Health Program at the University of California-Berkeley. "Most people think of the workplace as a safe place where young people are going to learn responsibility and it will have a positive impact on them. "It’s important to make sure they’re working in an environment where that’s going to happen, rather than ending up with a serious or even worse, a fatal injury." Our ruling Rooney said that a proposed U.S. Labor Department rule for children working on farms "would even ban youth from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose." He points to language so broad that even the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health raised concerns about it. But ultimately, it is up to the Labor Department to enforce the rule once it is final. Solis testified that the department has no intention of banning children from using screwdrivers, and her department says the same applies to garden hoses. The rule is a proposal at this point -- Solis has indicated that the power equipment section may need clarification. The proposed rule would limit the work children can do on farms, but Rooney and other critics omit that it won’t apply to children working on their own parents’ farms. Instead, they cite eye-popping examples of activities -- like using screwdrivers or garden hoses -- that they interpreted for themselves from the rules. Meanwhile, the department said specifically that’s not what they intend. The intention is to protect children from real-life cases of injury and death. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10833	"We're spending $1.6 billion for all of Latin America in terms of aid and assistance, a fraction of what we're spending in Iraq, the $500 billion we've spent there"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/14/chris-dodd/correct-although-money-not-yet-appropriated/	Dodd's assertion that foreign aid spending on Latin America stands at $1.6 billion dollars is accurate, albeit with the caveat that the money has yet to be appropriated. The amount he refers to is what has been requested by the administration for the upcoming fiscal year, subject to adjustments by Congress. The claim that the United States has spent $500 billion in Iraq is not entirely accurate, but it, too, is pretty darn close. Estimates vary on the precise amount spent since the 2003 invasion, but two of the most credible sources, the Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Budget Office, give the total as approximately $450 billion and $413 billion, respectively. Thus, Dodd's assertion that U.S. spending in Iraq has already passed the half trillion dollar mark is slightly exaggerated, but that's a quibble. His overall point that spending on aid to Latin America is only a small fraction of Iraq spending is very much on target.

pomt-07371	The federal debt is more than $14 trillion, "almost equal to the size of our entire economy," and "every child born today inherits a $45,000 share of the national debt before they take their first breath."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/may/05/jim-renacci/rep-jim-renacci-says-each-child-born-45000-share-n/	Since joining Congress this year, Rep. Jim Renacci of Wadsworth and other Republican freshmen in the House of Representatives have made cutting spending and reducing the national debt one of their priorities. Renacci discussed the need for belt tightening in a video he posted to YouTube on March 29 titled "Congressman Renacci Pledges Fiscal Responsibility." "The United States is currently more than $14 trillion in the red, which means that our debt is now almost equal to the size of our entire economy," Renacci says in the video. "To put it in context, every child born today inherits a $45,000 share of the national debt before they take their first breath." That sounds like lots of moolah for a newborn to pay, so PolitiFact decided to check out Renacci’s claim. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, the nation’s total outstanding public debt is currently $14.3 trillion, up from $14.2 trillion on the day Renacci made his claim. He is correct that the national debt exceeds $14 trillion. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Statistics estimates the nation’s Gross Domestic Product at $15 trillion in the first quarter of 2011, a number that only slightly exceeds the nation’s debt. So Renacci is also correct that the national debt almost equals the size of the entire economy. To determine the share of the national debt that would be allotted to each American, we divided the $14.3 trillion national debt by the 2010 Census’s current U.S. population figure of 308.7 million. That comes out to $46,323.29 per person, which is slightly higher than Renacci’s figure. Based on the information to this point, we ruled this statement True when we originally published this item in May 2011. Since then, a lot of politicians have made similar statements, resulting in additional fact-checking by our PolitiFact partners. PolitiFact Texas added an extra dimension to the issue by exploring what constitutes the national debt, breaking it down into to parts. We'll borrow from the explanation offered by PolitiFact Texas to explain: Intragovernmental debt refers to money owed by agencies within government to other agencies -- basically an internal accounting issue. An example: Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. Such money will have to be repaid, it’s presumed, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn’t affect credit markets. In contrast, public debt reflects money borrowed from outside sources -- giving it more of a connection to the economy, Josh Gordon, an analyst with the anti-deficit Concord Coalition, told PolitiFact Texas. "If your problem with the national debt is that you think it’s affecting the economy or interest rates or something like that, the only part of the national debt that affects the economy is the debt held by the public. That’s where the (U.S.) Treasury is borrowing money on the open market." So where does that leave us? Renacci's statement is accurate. The overall debt at the time he made the statement, divided by the population at the time, supports his number. But we know today that the public debt is what the government actually owes to those who have lent it money, and that is a good bit less than the total debt. That's important information that puts Renacci's claim into perspective, and on the Truth-O-Meter, that makes the statement Mostly True.

pomt-09554	"We passed without, frankly, the help of the Republican caucus, we passed 25 tax cuts last year, mostly aimed at the middle class and small businesses."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/02/david-axelrod/axelrod-claims-democrats-passed-25-tax-cuts-last-y/	With the recent Massachusetts Senate election redefining the political landscape in Washington, NBC's Meet the Press host David Gregory asked David Axelrod, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama, whether the president now needs to start moving more toward the middle. Axelrod responded that Republicans and Democrats ought to be working together on ways to stimulate job growth, but he said Republicans have not gotten on board even when it comes to tax cuts that Republicans have traditionally supported. "We passed without, frankly, the help of the Republican caucus, we passed 25 tax cuts last year, mostly aimed at the middle class and small businesses," Axelrod said. We were intrigued by the claim that Democrats passed 25 tax cuts last year, so we contacted the White House press office and asked for a list. And they gave us one, all from the economic stimulus package championed by Obama and signed on Feb. 17, 2009. We checked them out, provided sections and page numbers in the stimulus for reference, and added a brief explainer for some. If your eyes glaze over midway through, feel free to skip ahead to the bottom of the list where we'll pick up our analysis. Individual Tax Cuts: 1. "Making Work Pay" Tax Credit (Sec. 1001, Page 195). In tax years 2009 and 2010, the Making Work Pay provision will provide a refundable tax credit of 6.2 percent of earned income up to $400 for individuals and up to $800 for married taxpayers filing joint returns. 2. Increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit (Sec. 1002, Page 198). Go to the stimulus bill for all the details, but it essentially expands this benefit for the working poor. 3. Increased Eligibility for the Refundable Portion of Child Credit (Sec. 1003, Page 199). In 2009 and 2010, families who don’t earn enough to pay income tax would be eligible to claim the $1,000 child credit. 4. "American Opportunity" Education Tax Credit (Sec. 1004, Page 199). Increases the Hope Scholarship Credit to $2,500. 5. Refundable First-time Home Buyer Credit. (Sec. 1006, Page 202). This extended and increased the first-time home buyer tax credit from $7,500 to $8,000. 6. Temporary Suspension of Taxation of Unemployment Benefits (Sec. 1007, Page 203). This exempts from taxable gross income the first $2,400 of unemployment benefits. 7. Tax Credits for Energy-Efficient Improvements to Existing Homes (Sec. 1121, Page 208). This provides up to a $1,500 tax credit for qualified energy efficiency improvements. 8. Sales Tax Deduction for Vehicle Purchases (Sec. 1008, Page 203). This allows people to write off state and local sales taxes related to the purchase of a new vehicle costing up to $49,500. 9. Premium Credits for COBRA Continuation Coverage for Unemployed Workers (Sec. 6432, Page 348) 10. Economic Recovery Credits to Recipients of Social Security, SSI, Railroad Retirement and Veterans Disability Compensation Benefits (Sec. 2201, Page 336). This was a $250 payment for senior citizens, disabled veterans and disabled people living on Social Security benefits. 11. Computers as Qualified Education Expenses in 529 Education Plans (Sec. 1005, Page 202). This allows college students to write off the expense of computers and software, provided it's for educational purpose and not for games. 12. Plug-in Electric Drive Vehicle Credit (Sec. 1141, Page 212). Allows purchasers of plug-in electric vehicles to write off up to $5,000 of their purchase (depending on the power of the battery). 13. Tax Parity for Transit Benefits (sec. 1151, Page 219). This relates to an increased exclusion amount for commuter transit benefits and transit passes. 14. Health Coverage Tax Credit Expansion (Sec. 1899, Page 309). Small Business Tax Cuts: 1. Extension of Enhanced Small Business Expensing (Sec. 1202, Page 221). This is a temporary increase in limitations on expensing some depreciable business assets. 2. 5-Year Carryback of Net Operating Losses for Small Businesses (Sec. 1211, Page 221). 3. Extension of Bonus Depreciation (Sec. 1201, Page 220). This extends by a year election to accelerate the AMT and Research Credits in lieu of bonus depreciation. 4. Exclusion of 75% of Small Business Capital Gains from Taxes (Sec. 1241, Page 228). 5. Temporary Small Business Estimated Tax Payment Relief (Sec. 1212, Page 222). 6. Temporary Reduction of S Corporation Built-In Gains Holding Period from 10 Years to 7 Years (Sec. 1251, Page 228). Other Business Tax Cuts: 1. Advanced Energy Investment Credit (Sec. 1302, Page 231). This relates to properties designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as those that produce energy from the sun, wind, geothermal deposits, fuel cells, microturbines, or an energy storage system for use with electric or hybrid-electric vehicles. 2. Tax Credits for Alternative Refueling Property (Sec. 1123, Page 211). This is a temporary increase for alternative fuel vehicle refueling businesses. 3. Work Opportunity Tax Credits for Hiring Unemployed Veterans and Disconnected Youth (Sec. 1221, Page 223). This is a tax credit to provide incentive to businesses to hire unemployed veterans and "disconnected youth." That latter term is defined, in part, as young adults "not readily employable by reason of lacking a sufficient number of basic skills." 4. Delayed Recognition of Certain Cancellation of Debt Income (Sec. 1231, Page 224). 5. Election to Accelerate Recognition of Historic AMT/R&D Credits (Sec. 1201, Page 220). Grand total: 25. In all, tax cuts amounted to about a third of the cost of the $862 billion stimulus over the next decade. The biggest ticket tax cut was the first one on the list, the Making Work Pay tax cut that is expected to cost the government about $116 billion over two years. Interestingly, the White House did not include the Alternative Minimum Tax patch, which has been extended annually for years. But that accounted for another $70 billion for one year. Together, those two items account for the lion's share of the tax cuts in the stimulus. Which leads us to the question of whether all of these 25 qualify as tax cuts? "In a way this reminds me of Clinton's 'It depends on what your meaning of is is' comments," said Rosanne Altshuler, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "It depends on what you mean by tax cuts." "These are all provisions that cut your taxes," she said, "but most of them are temporary," designed to stimulate a floundering economy. Each of the tax provisions in the stimulus could have been broken into separate bills, said Bob Williams, also of the Tax Policy Center, and on their own could have rightly been billed as separate tax cuts. "They packed an awful lot into that bill," Williams said. "I think it's fair to say that various tax provisions in the stimulus could be considered tax cuts. I don't think that's being deceptive." We agree. But there's one other element of Axelrod's claim, that the tax cuts were passed without the help of Republicans. The stimulus passed the House with nary a Republican vote. And it passed the Senate with just three (though we note that one of them, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, is now a Democrat). So it's certainly fair to say the stimulus passed without the help of the Republican caucus. We find Axelrod's statement True.

pomt-00477	"Most of that money (made by the NFL) goes to the players."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/13/donald-trump/do-players-get-most-nfl-revenues-donald-trump-says/	President Donald Trump took another shot at the National Football League, the latest in his ongoing Twitter war against the NFL over some players taking a knee during the National Anthem to protest police mistreatment of African-Americans. On Aug. 10, Trump tweeted, ".....Be happy, be cool! A football game, that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy, is no place to protest. Most of that money goes to the players anyway. Find another way to protest. Stand proudly for your National Anthem or be Suspended Without Pay!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Is it true that "most of that money goes to the players," as Trump said? As it turns out, players do not make most of the money, although the players’ percentage is not far below 50 percent. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The revenue split between the players and the owners is negotiated through a collective bargaining agreement. The current agreement was negotiated in 2011, and it will be in force through 2021. According to the NFL summary of the current agreement, the "player share must average at least 47 percent for the 10-year term of the agreement." When we checked with the NFL Players Association, the players’ union, they confirmed that the current players’ share is 48.5 percent of all league revenue, including local revenue and media deals. Spokeswoman Erin Hayes added that the percentage "fluctuates between 47 percent and 48.5 percent, but right now it’s 48.5 percent." (The NFL did not respond to inquiries.) The NFL doesn’t release overall financial data, but media reports have estimated what the league’s 32 teams make by using data released by the Green Bay Packers, a publicly owned team that is required to release financial information annually. In 2017, the NFL ownership kept a little more than $8 billion in revenue for themselves, while the players took a little less than $8 billion, according to such accounts. The owners’ share was up by 4.9 percent, a rise largely attributed to a new, more generous contract for Thursday Night Football broadcasts. This is a substantial percentage, but it doesn’t meet even the most generous definition of "most," which would be anything higher than 50 percent. Trump’s statement "is wrong. Players do not receive most of the money," said David Berri, a Southern Utah University economist and a past president of the North American Association of Sports Economics. Daniel Kaplan, who covers the NFL for SportsBusiness Journal and SportsBusiness Daily, agreed that Trump’s assertion is incorrect and even suggested that the 47 percent figure may be high. Kaplan has previously written that the NFL’s revenue figures "are incomplete, as the league does not share every penny with the players, shielding hundreds of millions of dollars in areas such as stadium finance." Our ruling Trump said, "Most of that money (made by the NFL) goes to the players." According to the collective bargaining agreement now in force, the players are getting 48.5 percent of revenues, a number that can’t average less than 47 percent in the 10-year life of the agreement. That’s not peanuts, but it doesn’t meet even the most generous definition of "most." We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-06516	Says that "In 2009, I saved ratepayers around $500 million by persuading the Council to pursue a less expensive compliance mechanism if the City is required to treat Bull Run drinking water."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/oct/11/amanda-fritz/did-amanda-fritz-persuade-portland-city-council-sa/	Correction appended: An earlier version of the story incorrectly stated that the switch to UV had not saved ratepayers any money. The error does not change the ruling. Portland commissioner Amanda Fritz, running for another term, is proud that in her first year in office, she came out against a recommendation by the Water Bureau to build an expensive direct filtration system. Instead, she supported was to build a cheaper ultraviolet system that would zap cryptosporidium from the city’s drinking water. "In 2009, I saved ratepayers around $500 million by persuading the Council to pursue a less expensive compliance mechanism if the City is required to treat Bull Run drinking water," Fritz writes on her campaign literature. "I partnered with neighborhood and business advocates to get this done by arranging for a Council work session and public hearing, where citizens made clear that the less expensive option is more responsible. The result was a unanimous vote reversing the Water Bureau’s previous plan." We here at PolitiFact Oregon take these campaign claims seriously. Was it true that Fritz had single-handedly, with citizen support and a public hearing, persuaded the City Council to go against a recommendation by the Water Bureau? And did she in fact save ratepayers $500 million? Portland gets its drinking water pretty much untouched from the Bull Run watershed east of the city. It’s delicious and clean and we’re all very proud of it. However, we’re also under orders from the Environmental Protection Agency to protect the water we drink, following a cryptosporidius outbreak that killed at least 69 people in 1993 in Wisconsin. That means we need to do something about the open reservoirs where we store some of our drinking water and we have to treat against cryptosporidium, even though the last time we found any was in 2002. All the city commissioners think the federal mandate is unnecessary. But they’ve made plans to comply even as they seek a way out of some of the conditions. In 2009, the Water Bureau recommended meeting the cryptosporidium criteria with a $385 million filtration system that they argued would cost more, but be more versatile and forward-thinking in the end. Groups such as Friends of the Reservoirs and beer makers Rob and Kurt Widmer lobbied against the filtration system. They argued that if anything had to be done, why not opt for ultraviolet light, which would be cheaper to build at $100 million. City Council meeting records show that Fritz, along with commissioners Dan Saltzman and Nick Fish, voiced concerns about the cost. But Commissioner Randy Leonard, who oversees water, backed his staff, and at City Hall, it’s considered bad form to go against the commissioner in charge. Fritz and Saltzman went on record as opposed to Leonard. As the council vote neared, Leonard realized he didn’t have Fish either. Leonard agreed to go with UV, saying that he doesn’t think anybody "has ever accused me of being a bad vote counter." So is it fair for Fritz to hog the leadership limelight? We asked the two commissioners who also expressed doubts about filtration. They said it was absolutely fair. "She kind of pushed it; she called the question. It’s an accurate claim, for what it’s worth," Saltzman said. Fish said Fritz and Saltzman were on the same page, but, "I think she was the one who was the most outspoken on this one. Ultimately, she persuaded me that UV was the right way to go and … I became the third vote on UV." Fritz doesn’t have a lot of high-profile scores on her record as she defends her seat against Mary Nolan. So we can see why she talks about this "money save" a lot. On her city office blog, Fritz wrote Aug. 22 that "citizens pushed successfully to save $500 million in 2009, with my leadership inside City Hall …" In an April 15 re-election email to reporters, she said she felt "privileged to have been in the position in the first half of my term to save Portland ratepayers $500 million on water rates …" And in a 2010 profile, she relays this anecdote to then-Willamette Week reporter Beth Slovic: "I went home that evening having gotten this 5-0 vote," Fritz recalls, "and I said to my kids, ‘I saved the ratepayers $500 million today,’ and the answer was, ‘Well, that’s great, Mom. What’s for dinner?’" After our probing, we’re comfortable giving Fritz full credit on her persuasiveness. It’s not easy going up against the commissioner in charge of a bureau, especially if it’s Randy Leonard. Now, on to the savings. How does she estimate she saved ratepayers $500 million? After all, the difference between $385 million and $100 million is $285 million, not "around $500 million." Fritz said she takes interest costs into consideration, because the city would borrow money to build either system. She cites figures by the city’s budget office showing it would cost $180 million for the UV system and $700 million for filtration -- or an 80 percent add-on. There’s your "around $500 million" in ratepayer savings, she said in an email. But we think that calculation is inflated. Regular people don’t think in terms of what a big-ticket item like a house or car might really cost, over the long term, with interest. They don’t think that way about capital budget items on the council agenda, and government officials don’t present them that way either. But $500 million is bigger than $285 million. Second, Fritz’s grand persuasion hasn’t saved ratepayers anywhere near $285 million or $500 million yet. The ultraviolet system still is being designed, said David Shaff, the Water Bureau’s director. Shaff expects design work to be completed by the end of this year -- which is when the state is expected to weigh in on whether we need a system at all. (We will say, however, that her push resulted in water rates being lowered from nearly 19 percent to 12 percent in 2010-11, a savings of roughly $6 million that year. ) So the bottom line is that if the state gives the city a pass -- which might happen given that a year-long study has shown no evidence of cryptosporidium -- we may not spend anything. (Does that mean the state would save water ratepayers $100 million to $180 million, depending on how you calculate cost? There’s a thought.) Despite our misgivings about the millions saved, or to be saved, PolitiFact Oregon gives Fritz a Mostly True. She came from the political minority, challenged Leonard, and ended up with a 5-0 vote in her favor. The statement is accurate, with some additional information needed.

pomt-11071	"Under Emanuel, CPS has become the most understaffed school district in Illinois."	true	/illinois/statements/2018/jun/21/troy-laraviere/cps-most-understaffed-district-illinois/	Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s oversight of the Chicago Public Schools is shaping up to be a flashpoint in his 2019 reelection bid, especially after a recent Chicago Tribune investigation highlighted the district’s failure to protect students from sexual abuse by school workers. One challenger to Emanuel is Troy LaRaviere, the head of the Chicago Principals and Administrators Association and a onetime CPS elementary school principal himself who has long been a vocal critic of the mayor. LaRaviere, in a recent blog post, sought to connect the dots between the Tribune’s findings and staffing shortages at CPS. "Under Emanuel, CPS has become the most understaffed school district in Illinois," LaRaviere wrote, going on to suggest that key elements of a quality education, including student safety, are more likely to slip through the cracks with less staff around. LaRaviere’s claim about safety is speculation. But his assertion about staffing levels is something concrete and led us to wonder: Is CPS really dead last in the state when it comes to staffing? If so, that would seem to contradict a common narrative about an unwieldy bureaucratic bloat at CPS. So we decided to take a look. Not rock bottom, but very close To support his claim, LaRaviere pointed us to data from the Illinois State Board of Education listing the pupil-to-staff ratio for each district in the state. That figure includes teachers, administrators and professional staff like counselors, librarians and nurses certified by the state to work with students. The state dataset shows CPS has fewer staff members per student than all but two of the more than 850 school districts in Illinois. It was tied for second-to-last with Lincoln Way Community High School District in suburban New Lenox. In last place was a tiny elementary district in downstate Breese, 40 miles east of St. Louis. In 2016, the average student-to-staff ratio for all Illinois school districts was 11-to-one. At CPS it was more than 16-to-one. The state data also show that CPS’ ranking has worsened under Emanuel. In the 2010-11 school year, the last under former Mayor Richard M. Daley, CPS staffing levels were low but still better than 79 other districts in the state. In other words, LaRaviere’s claim checks out. Still, that raises a question: How did CPS staffing slip so far even as its spending per pupil outpaces the state average by $2,000? Double-take LaRaviere sees that conundrum as evidence CPS is wasting money because of unsound financial policies that drain resources to pay for adequate staffing. But experts also point to other, less politically fraught, explanations. Andy Crosby, a professor of public administration at Pace University in New York said urban districts are more likely to serve students from low-income backgrounds who may require additional resources to educate. Districts in large urban areas, he said, typically pay teachers higher salaries to compensate for increased cost of living as well. But he also pointed to U.S. Census data showing Chicago was far from the biggest spender among large urban school districts. In 2015, the data show, New York City spent roughly $22,000 per student while Chicago spent less than $14,000. Illinois data, meanwhile, show that Chicago’s per-student spending may be above average, yet there are many districts in the state that spend far more. Another factor to consider when weighing spending at CPS is the looming shadow of high pension costs. Prior to changes made by state lawmakers last year, CPS bore the entire expense of funding the employer share of pensions for its teachers and staff. All other districts in Illinois relied on state taxpayers to pick up their pension tab. Rebecca Hendrick, a professor of public administration at the University of Illinois-Chicago, suggested the pension overhang could be putting pressure on the district to lower operating costs to free up funds for pension payments. Those payments ramped up significantly during Emanuel’s second term as a consequence of years of contribution deferrals that began under Daley. Our ruling A recent Tribune investigation revealed CPS’ failure to protect students from sexual abuse by district employees. LaRaviere suggested staffing levels could have played a role in that scandal, saying that, "under Emanuel, CPS has become the most understaffed school district in Illinois." The correlation LaRaviere sought to make is impossible to prove. However, his claim about low staff-to-student ratios lies on firmer ground. Data from the Illinois State Board of Education show that last year CPS employed just one staffer—teachers, administrators and other trained professionals—for every 16 students. The statewide average was one per every 11. By that measure, CPS tied for second to worst in the state. Technically speaking then, CPS is not the most understaffed in the state as LaRaviere says. It is almost the most understaffed, a quibbling distinction that might bear relevance in math class or on the debate club but is besides the point for purposes of evaluating the credibility of his claim.

pomt-12083	Says former President Barack Obama "pardoned a traitor who gave U.S. enemies state secrets, he also pardoned a terrorist who killed Americans."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/30/katie-pavlich/did-obama-pardon-terrorist-and-traitor-katie-pavli/	Following news that President Donald Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, an Arizona county sheriff who was convicted for criminal contempt when he refused to follow a court order to stop profiling Latinos, a former foreign policy adviser to Barack Obama decried Trump’s pardon. "Obama used his pardon and commutation power to give a second chance to people who deserved empathy, not racists who showed none," Ben Rhodes tweeted. Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich came out in Trump’s defense. "Your boss pardoned a traitor who gave U.S. enemies state secrets, he also pardoned a terrorist who killed Americans," Pavlich replied in a tweet that was shared over 24,700 times as of Aug. 29, 2017. Trump retweeted it. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Pavlich did not respond to our requests for clarification or comment, although she was likely referring to Chelsea Manning and Oscar Lopez Rivera respectively, who Trump referenced in an Aug. 28, 2017, press conference. Neither of these individuals, however, were pardoned by the former president. As Trump said in the conference, Manning and Lopez Rivera were granted commutations, or shortened sentences. Manning was an Army intelligence analyst convicted of leaking American military and diplomatic information through Wikileaks in 2010. Manning’s 35-year sentence was the longest ever imposed in the United States for a leak conviction, but it was cut short at seven years when Obama commuted, or shortened, her sentence. A transgender woman in a men’s military prison, Manning attempted suicide twice. Lopez Rivera helped lead the Armed Forces of National Liberation, a Puerto Rican nationalist movement. The group’s most famous bombing, in 1975, resulted in four deaths, although no one was charged with carrying it out. He received a 55-year sentence for seditious conspiracy, attempted robbery, explosives and vehicle theft that was extended 15 years after conspiracy to escape. Lopez Rivera was the last remaining member of the Armed Forces of National Liberation still in prison. In 1999, he rejected President Bill Clinton’s conditional clemency offer. Obama shortened his sentence to 36 years. Pardon vs. commutation Pavlich acknowledged she conflated pardons and commutations on Twitter without apologizing or taking it down. "Ah, I see msm wants to squabble over pardon vs commutation (while also offering ‘unbiased’ opinions on the issue). Doesn't change the point," Pavlich tweeted on Aug. 28, 2017. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The Justice Department classifies both commutation of sentence and pardon as forms of executive clemency, which the president can constitutionally exercise on those who have committed federal crimes. A commutation reduces the severity of a sentence, while a pardon undoes the conviction, removing its remaining consequences. Those consequences include such civil disabilities as "restrictions on the right to vote, hold state or local office, or sit on a jury." But according to Margaret Love, a former U.S. pardon attorney, civil disabilities are restored automatically by most states anyway. Pardons significantly strip away the hundreds of other collateral damages that come with criminal records, affecting jobs, licenses, benefits and public contracting opportunities. These remain in place for sentences that have simply been shortened. Michigan State University law professor Brian Kalt agreed that pardons are more substantial. "But that doesn’t mean that one can’t compare them — if people think that the Manning or Lopez Rivera commutations were wrong, the fact that they were commutations and not pardons doesn’t make them okay," Kalt said. Arpaio’s pardon defies the norms of Justice Department clemency forms, as we’ve explained before. Trump sidestepped the Justice Department in pardoning Arpaio, who had not yet received or served a sentence. The Justice Department traditionally administers pardons after at least five years of serving time and expressing remorse. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Pavlich said Obama "pardoned a traitor who gave U.S. enemies state secrets, he also pardoned a terrorist who killed Americans." Obama did not pardon Manning or Lopez Rivera, instead issuing commutations, which alleviate punishment for, rather than grant forgiveness for, a federal crime. The legal consequences of each differ significantly, though both represent executive forms of clemency. Still, the difference here is not trivial. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05946	Nevada is No. 1 in unemployment, violent crime, car theft, divorce, robberies and foreclosures.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/26/no-casinos/nevada-no-1-unemployment-violent-crime-car-theft-d/	"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas" is a common advertising slogan for Las Vegas. And those who oppose the introduction of mega-casinos in Florida say they want those casinos -- and the problems in Nevada -- to stay there. In a "Leave it in Vegas" television ad that launched Jan. 19, 2012, the group No Casinos claims that Nevada is No. 1 in lots of rankings -- and not in a good way. Set to sinister music, the ad states: "Big gambling . . . They Say Florida's the Next Vegas. That Nevada's Number One . . . And its true. No. 1 in Unemployment. No. 1 in Violent Crime. In Car Theft. Divorce . . . In Robberies. No. 1 in Foreclosures. What happens in Vegas Should Stay in Vegas. Tell Our Elected Officials: Keep Big Gambling Out of Florida." The ad packs an emotional punch with photos of what appears to be a homeless man huddling under a blanket, a jail cell, the flashing lights of a squad car and a for sale/foreclosure sign by a house. We checked some similar claims about Nevada in the past by the CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce -- a group that opposes casino expansion. But the new ad by No Casinos includes two additional claims about Nevada -- car theft and robberies -- and it started airing during the state legislative session, in the heat of the debate about whether to pass a bill to allow casino resorts. No Casinos pointed us to a document from CQ Press that compares states on multiple rankings and is based on data from the census, Small Business Administration, FBI and administrative office of the U.S. courts. The document is the most recent version of the state ranking book, said Dan Gelber, South Florida chairman of No Casinos. Unemployment: Nevada’s unemployment rate was 13 percent in November 2011 -- placing it at No. 1 among states, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Crime: For the statistics about violent crime, car theft and robberies we turned to the FBI’s 2010 statistics which show the rate per 100,000 people. (The 2011 data is still preliminary.) Nevada’s violent crime rate was second highest in the country behind the District of Columbia. Nevada's rate for robberies was third, behind D.C. and Delaware. The rate for car theft was third, behind California and Washington state. (The District of Columbia isn’t a state so we won’t hold that one against No Casinos.) The CQ data cited by No Casinos was for 2009. It showed Nevada at No. 1 for violent crime, robberies and car theft. That data showed Florida at No. 8 for violent crime, no. 6 for robberies and 14th for car theft. Foreclosures: RealtyTrac, which tracks foreclosures, showed Nevada at the highest in the country for December 2011 with one foreclosure for every 177 homes. Divorce: CQ used 2009 data from the National Center for Health Statistics, which found that Nevada had the highest divorce rate among states reporting (6.7 per 1,000 population) -- and Florida was 9th. We corroborated the data through the National Center. We should note that six states did not collect information for 2009. Center spokesman Jeffrey Lancashire said the group no longer collects detailed divorce data because not all the states collect the information. The Census also measures marital status rates for each state. The census shows that Nevada had a divorce rate of 12.3 percent for males and 14.6 percent for females between 2005 and 2007. According to the census, Wyoming had a slightly higher rate of divorced males -- 12.6 percent -- but Nevada was No. 1 for divorced females. Another product created by the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2010 American Community Survey showed that Nevada had a 12.4 percent divorce rate for women -- placing it in a tie for 9th place with Tennessee -- and a 14 percent divorce rate for men -- ranking it first. Nevada vs. Florida We won't address whether gambling is to blame for these indicators. But it's important to note some differences between Nevada and Florida. As of mid-January there were conflicting proposals of what a casino expansion would look like in Florida: Some legislators wanted a limit to three casinos, while others wanted to allow Las Vegas-style slot machines in every horse and dog track and jai-alai fronton in the state. But while Las Vegas’ economy is heavily dependent on casinos, Florida already has a diverse tourist economy. David G. Schwartz, a professor at the University of Nevada, said that the current high unemployment in Nevada is due to declines in gaming and construction and "most of the foreclosures aren't because of people who live here gambling away their mortgages, they’re because investors got caught up in a bubble...." Dean Gerstein, principal investigator in a major federal study of gambling in the 1990s, said the influx of visitors to Vegas makes statistics for the state difficult to compare to elsewhere. "Florida is a very populous state, in contrast to Nevada, and it already has a very large tourism industry, most of which has nothing to do with gambling. So there’s a generic sense in which what might be big in Nevada, for good or ill, cannot possibly be as big in Florida," Gerstein wrote in an email. The goal of the ad here is to show that Las Vegas -- a city famous for casinos -- is in a state with high rates of crime, unemployment and divorce. Florida is now considering whether to allow mega casino resorts but it already suffers from troubling rankings in some of these areas -- fifth in foreclosures and tied for fifth in unemployment, for example. Our ruling No Casinos said Nevada is No. 1 in unemployment, violent crime, car theft, divorce, robberies and foreclosures. Nevada is at the top for unemployment, divorce and foreclosures. Based on 2009 data, Nevada was at the top for the crime measures, but 2010 data showed the state was near the top, but not no. 1. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-11787	Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee weren’t "even entitled to bring an expert witness on any aspect of the tax code that affects 100 percent of our economy."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/22/john-larson/did-house-committee-bar-democratic-witnesses-gop-t/	Critics of the House Republicans’ tax bill have not only gone after its substance, but its process. During a markup of the bill by the House Ways and Means Committee, one Democratic committee member -- Rep. John Larson of Connecticut -- gave a stemwinder of an indictment that gained some currency on social media. Comparing the House consideration of the current Republican tax bill unfavorably with the process that led to the landmark 1986 tax bill, Larson said that "no one was allowed to come forward. ... No one from the administration will even sit in front of us. We are the oldest committee in Congress, many would argue the most prestigious, and members on this side of the aisle aren't even entitled to bring an expert witness on any aspect of the tax code that affects 100 percent of our economy." When we took a closer look, we found that both parties have valid arguments to air. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., speaking at a House Ways and Means Committee markup of the Republican tax bill. The Republican case Republicans argue that the committee has addressed many of the issues in the bills in previous hearings this year, all of which included opportunities for the minority to call one witness. (For Ways and Means hearings, the majority typically picks a few witnesses and the minority chooses one; sometimes the majority and minority agree to jointly appoint a witness.) Here are four Ways and Means hearings from 2017 that addressed issues at stake in the tax bill, along with the minority’s choice of witness: • May 18, 2017: Subcommittee hearing on "How Tax Reform Will Grow Our Economy and Create Jobs." Minority witness: Steven Rattner, former leader of the Obama administration’s effort to revive the automobile industry. • May 23, 2017: Full committee hearing on "Increasing U.S Competitiveness and Preventing American Jobs from Moving Overseas." Minority witness: Kimberly Clausing, professor of economics at Reed College. • July 13, 2017: Subcommittee hearing on "How Tax Reform Will Help America’s Small Businesses Grow and Create New Jobs." Minority witness: Chye-Ching Huang, deputy director for federal tax policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. • July 19, 2017: Subcommittee hearing on "How Tax Reform Will Simplify Our Broken Tax Code and Help Individuals and Families." Minority witness: Eric Rodriguez, vice president at UnidosUS, a Hispanic research and advocacy group formerly known as National Council of La Raza. Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staffer on the House Rules Committee who now studies Congress at the Woodrow Wilson Center, said it would be typical for committees and subcommittees to debate bills and ideas with witnesses, and then hold a markup -- at which point new witnesses would not typically testify. In addition, it’s worth noting -- as the video of Larson makes clear -- there was one witness present at the markup, Thomas Barthold, the chief of staff of the Joint Tax Committee, the nonpartisan panel that does independent analysis of tax bills under consideration. The committee’s staff director is almost always invited to weigh in before Ways and Means when considering a bill the committee has analyzed. Wolfensberger said that, based on his own limited viewing of the markup in question, Barthold may have been a more effective witness for Democrats than they could have invited. "The Democrats were certainly aiming a fair amount of tough questions at him, which he seemed to be answering in a very professional and knowledgeable manner," Wolfensberger said. "I suspect they got more truthful and informative responses from him than they would have from partisan economists invited by both sides to put their best faces on the Democratic or GOP policy positions." The Democratic case That said, Larson also has some reasonable points to make. Daniel Rubin, a spokesman for the Ways and Means Committee’s Democratic staff, said that the earlier hearings had addressed theoretical possibilities for the tax bill, not the elements that made it into the bill the committee marked up. The bill that was ultimately considered was "much different than any of the outlines they had floating around earlier in the year," Rubin said. "Democrats, including Mr. Larson, I presume, are frustrated that we never had a hearing with expert witnesses on how a repeal of the (state and local tax) deduction affects local economies, or how capping the mortgage interest deduction would hurt local housing markets, or … how $1.7 trillion in deficit spending might or might not drag down the economy." Clausing, the Reed College professor who served as a witness for the minority, agreed. She said she testified "based on the prior legislative proposals, focusing in particular on the border tax, which is not part of this legislation." In general, she said, the process for the GOP bill has been "way too quick for changes of this magnitude. No prior tax major tax bill has been done in such a rushed manner, with so little time for deliberation and understanding." For instance, the official version of the bill was introduced on a Thursday, with markup beginning the following Monday. "This was not as egregious as, say, the Senate's handling of the health bill, which ignored the core committees entirely, but it was a real and major deviation from what we think of as the regular order," said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Richard E. Cohen, a congressional reporter and author of a biography of the late Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, said that both sides have raised fair points. "No doubt, the hearings were an opportunity to explore multiple aspects of the tax code, and it appears that Democrats had an opportunity to invite their own expert witnesses," Cohen said. "It's also true that those hearings were months ago before many details of the current legislation had been filed, and that the current legislation was pushed through the House on an unusually expedited schedule with minimal bipartisanship." Our ruling Larson said that Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee weren’t "even entitled to bring an expert witness on any aspect of the tax code that affects 100 percent of our economy." Committee Democrats did have an opportunity to invite witnesses to a series of earlier hearings on issues related to the tax bill. However, those hearings were held before the official version of the bill was unveiled, and the final bill included a variety of provisions that were not discussed in those prior hearings.

pomt-01687	Kasim Reed has kept every promise he made as a candidate.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/15/kasim-reed/cynics-beware-promises-appear-track/	Everyone knows those folks who want to get elected will make promises they later shrug off with the same speed as they hand off squirming toddlers during campaign season. So imagine the cynical overload when the AJC’s Truth-O-Meter read this absolute in a recent press release from Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed: "He’s kept every promise he made as a candidate, including re-opening the city’s recreation centers, reforming the city’s pension plan, standing up a force of 2,000 police officers and not raising property taxes," the release claimed. Reed’s press office couldn’t provide a list of his campaign promises. But those headline-grabbing pledges have been kept: Reed pushed a pension reform through City Council to help Atlanta pay off a $1.5 billion liability and save taxpayers $25 million a year. Reed used $4.3 million of that freed up cash to re-open 22 recreation centers shuttered in 2008 due to budget constraints. The city millage rate – approved by Council based on the mayor’s recommendation – has fallen during Reed’s tenure, from $10.24 for every thousand dollars of assessed value to $9.75. Atlanta’s police force reached 2,000 officers in October 2013, with Reed credited for the achievement by pushing for new positions and pay raises. "The mayor does give credit to the council for getting a lot of his ideas done and passed," said Reed spokeswoman Anne Torres. "He realized in order to get the city in the right direction, and fulfill his promises, he really had to get Atlanta on proper financial footing." We could nitpick since Atlanta had just 1,971 officers on the force this week, as it struggles with the same churn other local law enforcement agencies face. But PolitiFact Georgia wants to be more skeptical than cynical. So we dug into press coverage during Reed’s 2009 campaign and found smaller promises that need some explaining: Cut the amount the city spends on outside attorneys City records show Atlanta spent $12.8 million for outside counsel in the fiscal year 2014, which ended in June. That’s about 9 percent less than 2009’s $14 million bill. Re-open Fire Station 7 in West End The fire station remains closed. But a 2013 press release announced Reed’s plans to renovate the city’s oldest station. The city has spent $2.5 million so far on design work for the station, built in 1910. Torres said the fire department is preparing bids for the full renovation, expected to take a year once the city selects a contractor. Reduce employee overtime Employee overtime cost the city $12 million in OT in 2014, an 88 percent increase from overtime bill in 2009, the last year before Reed took office. Torres notes, though, that 2009 was a year of furloughs and layoffs because of the city’s financial woes. Reed’s promise was based on the 2008 tab, of nearly $18 million, she said. Looking at it that way, Reed cut OT by 39 percent. Cut the city’s IT budget The city budget shows a 13 percent increase in IT spending: $25,242,270 in 2009 and 28,544,187 for the fiscal year that began July 1. Hans Utz, the city’s deputy chief operating officer, said Atlanta had long put individual departments’ IT costs in those department budgets – not the overall information technology budget. That artificially inflated department budgets, Utz said. Starting in 2013, the city began shifting all IT costs to that department and saving by buying in bulk. The move increased the IT budget by $3.3 million but decreased other department budgets by $5.6 million – a $2.3 million net reduction, budget records show. So, would accepting those explanations mean giving Reed too much leeway to keep his promises? Not necessarily. Politicians tend to keep promises more than you might think, said Kerwin Swint, chairman of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. Blame – sigh – the media for implying candidates don’t at least try, according to Thomas Patterson’s 1993 book, "Out of Order," Swint said. It cites four studies of seven presidential campaigns and found once elected, presidents keep the promises they made as candidates. "In general, politicians try to keep their promises because it’s in their best interest to do so," Swint said. ""From their point of view, they can’t wave a magic wand and make things happen. There is a process, and that can seem like foot-dragging to critics." Or, we concede, to cynics. So while there is a window for promises we may not know Reed made when he ran for office, the pledges big and small appear at least in process, if not done. We rate Reed’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-11885	"Less than half of Texans ages 18-24 are registered to vote."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/oct/26/charlie-geren/charlie-geren-half-young-texans-registered-vote-tw/	After a study found Texas high schools neglecting their legal duty to help eligible students register to vote, state Rep. Charlie Geren took to Twitter to inform his followers about Texas’ lousy youth voter registration rate. Geren tweeted on Sept. 18, 2017: "Did you know less than half of Texans ages 18-24 are registered to vote?" We wondered about that. Asked about Geren’s basis for the claim, Payton Spreen in Geren’s office said the Fort Worth Republican relied on a Sept. 15, 2017, Texas Tribune news story. That story says many high schools have apparently failed to help students register, "and election turnout among young voters has remained chronically low — less than half of Texans age 18 through 24 are registered to vote"; the story otherwise referenced U.S. Census Bureau research reflecting on voter registration and turnout in 2016. The story highlighted a September 2017 report by the Texas Civil Rights Project and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, advocacy groups that address voter rights with a focus on racial and ethnic minorities. The groups found that despite a Texas law requiring high school officials to circulate voter registration forms to students, in 2016, just 198 of 1,428 Texas public high schools, or 14 percent, and no private schools had requested registration applications from the Texas secretary of state’s office, which supervises elections. According to the report, the groups calculated those compliance rates after the 2016 elections by requesting copies of all voter registration request forms submitted to the secretary of state’s office by high school principals. We’ve noted before that a Texas law--approved in 1983, a dozen years after the 26th Amendment reduced the U.S. voting age to 18 from 21--says that at least twice yearly, high school administrators must distribute voter registration applications to students who are or will be 18 years old or older that year. Schools aren’t required to collect filled-out forms though completed forms that get turned in must be forwarded to hasten registrations. Youth voting trended down--until 2016 Nationally, the registration and turnout of young voters has bounced around, according to post-election surveys taken by the Census Bureau in even-numbered years. Texas registration rates declined every four years from 2000 through 2012, bureau results indicate, but the 2016 rate proved an improvement: According to bureau data, young adults have consistently voted and registered at lower rates than others. We asked William Galston of the Brookings Institution’s Governance Studies program why that’s been the case. By phone, Galston said older Americans are more likely to register to vote and cast ballots because they essentially see the stakes as higher for themselves. "As you get older and get married and rooted in the community, as that process goes along, people tend to get more connected to politics," Galston said. Galston pointed us to a 2003 study by the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University and the Carnegie Corporation of New York that says young adults vote less frequently in part because high schools teach fewer civics classes than they used to. We also spotted a 2013 CIRCLE study that found, based on its national survey of nearly 4,500 18- to 24-year-olds, that respondents "who recalled high-quality civic education experiences in high school were more likely to vote." Galston said of young voters: "It’s not as if you have to move a mountain to get them involved. But you have to get them over a psychological hump." So, was Geren right about less than half of young Texans registering to vote? To analyze his claim, we reviewed the Census Bureau’s 2016 post-election survey results before seeking the latest registration data from a state agency. The sources, it turned out, supported conflicting conclusions. Census Bureau's 2016 survey The bureau gauges registration and turnout rates by supplementing its Current Population Survey (CPS), which surveys a probability selected sample of roughly 60,000 households. Since 1994, the survey also has inquired into citizenship data broken down since 2000 by age and state; a 2014 bureau study says citizen data "provides a more accurate reflection of the population eligible to vote." Then again, Geren’s tweet didn’t specify that he was focused on citizens. So we sought both estimates of young registered residents, regardless of eligibility, and registered citizens. In the main, the bureau’s 2016 survey results support Geren’s claim. That year, according to the results, an estimated 1.04 million Texas 18- to 24-year-olds registered to vote, making up 40.8 percent of all Texans in the age group, plus or minus a 3.2 percentage point margin of error. If you focus on U.S. and Texas citizens in the age group, the results indicate that 47.6 percent reported registering to vote--again, less than half. But this specific result’s margin of error of 3.6 percentage points makes it possible to speculate that up to 51.2 percent of Texas citizens in the age group registered to vote. Nationally, the survey results indicate, 50.8 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds and 55.4 percent of citizens in the age group registered to vote before the 2016 elections. A 2017 count of registered voters Asked about more recent registration data, a bureau spokeswoman, Julie Iriondo, told us by email the agency had nothing past those 2016 survey results. Closer to home, the Texas secretary of state’s office, which oversees state elections, replied by providing the number of Texas 18- to 24-year-olds registered to vote as of the date that Geren tweeted. Spokesman Sam Taylor advised by email that 1.68 million Texas residents in the age group as of Sept. 18, 2017, had registered to vote in advance of the Nov. 7, 2017 elections. That number seemed high in that it’s 62 percent greater than the comparable 1.04 million Texans estimated by the bureau after the 2016 elections. Similarly, we noticed, the state says that as of November 2016, 15.1 million residents were registered to vote, a figure 29 percent greater than the 11.7 million registered Texans then estimated by the bureau. Despite appeals to experts, we fell short of reconciling these contrasts though Taylor provided figures arguably accounting for some of the difference in young voter counts. In 2017, Taylor said, 341,635 18- to 24-year-olds registered to vote through the October registration deadline. He described another 137,641 tallied registered voters in the age bracket as on the state’s "suspense list." According to the secretary of state’s website, individuals on the list are still registered voters, though Taylor said in a phone interview that some may no longer live in Texas. Perhaps such voters weren’t picked up by the 2016 bureau survey. Estimating a 2017 registration rate Taylor told us the agency has no information on the share of young Texans registered to vote heading into the 2017 elections. We then made our own run by comparing the state’s tally of registered voters as of mid-September 2017 to several estimates for 2017 of the total number of residents aged 18-24--one by the bureau and two by the San Antonio-based Texas Demographic Center. The center’s Lila Valencia provided us with its 2017 population projections, each calculated in 2014: one assumes net migration into Texas at half the rate from 2000 to 2010 and the other assumes migration continuing at the 2000-2010 rate. The former estimate may be more precise, the center says, because Texas experienced unusually rapid growth from 2000 to 2010. The conservative migration projection suggests that 2.77 million 18- to 24-year-olds were living in Texas in 2017 while the less conservative estimate indicates 2.94 million Texans fell into that age group. In contrast, the bureau in 2016 estimated the state was home to 2.54 million residents in the age bracket. Upshot: Regardless of which of the three population estimates you consider, the state’s September 2017 count of 1.68 million registered voters aged 18-24 breaks out to more than half of 18- through 24-year-olds being registered to vote at that time. We’d caution, though. Because we mixed precise statistics and projected data to estimate youth voter registration rates, our results shouldn’t be considered exact. That said, if you use the center’s 2.77 million population estimate, it looks like 61 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds were registered to vote as of late September 2017. Comparing the state’s count of 1.68 million registered voters aged 18-24 to the bureau’s 2016 estimate of 2.18 million Texas U.S. citizens in the age group suggests that an even greater share of citizens were registered to vote about the time that Geren tweeted--far more than half. Our ruling Geren said less than half of Texans aged 18 through 24 are registered to vote. There’s a solid basis for this claim — a federal post-election survey in which 47.6 percent of 18- to 24-year-old Texans reported registering to vote. But we found more recent data and ways to crunch figures that suggest the described registration rate might exceed 50 percent. We rate Geren’s statement Half True.

pomt-11166	"Senator Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it! Now he says I should not have terminated the deal"	true	/new-york/statements/2018/may/24/donald-trump/schumer-once-opposed-iran-nuclear-deal-he-now-supp/	President Donald Trump posted on Twitter last week that Sen. Charles Schumer flip-flopped on the Iran nuclear deal. The tweet came two days after Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Obama deal — a move Schumer criticized. "Senator Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it!" Trump tweeted. "Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn’t really believe that!" Trump promised during his campaign to renegotiate the Iran deal, an agreement he opposed since its inception. Then-President Barack Obama announced the pact with five other countries and Iran to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities in exchange for lighter sanctions in 2015. Is Trump right about Schumer’s record on the deal? Schumer in 2015 A spokesperson for Trump referred us to comments Schumer made about the Iran deal in 2015. Obama announced the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or Iran nuclear deal, in July of that year. The agreement did not require a vote from Congress because it wasn’t a trade deal. Past deals, like the North American Free Trade Agreement, had to be approved by Congress before they were implemented. Instead, Republicans who controlled the Senate introduced a measure to reject Obama’s deal. Schumer came out against the deal about a month before the Senate voted on the measure. In a statement, he said he would vote against the deal for three reasons: • The U.S. could not unilaterally demand inspections of Iran’s nuclear sites at any time. • Iran would have more resources to develop nuclear weapons after a decade of lighter sanctions, Schumer argued. As we’ve rated before, Iran was not free to build nuclear weapons after a decade. • Iran would also have more money to expand its influence in the region. The U.S. State Department has labeled the country a state sponsor of terrorism. Schumer wanted to keep the sanctions on Iran and pursue a different path to denuclearization. "I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear power," Schumer said. A few days after his break with Obama, Schumer said the U.S. "should go back and try to get a better deal." He voted to reject the nuclear agreement but Republicans in the Senate didn’t have enough votes to send the measure to Obama. Schumer was one of four Democrats to support it. When asked after the 2016 election if he would support leaving the deal with Trump as president, Schumer told POLITICO he wanted to see how it played out for a few years and that "it would be wrong to repeal it now." Schumer in 2018 Schumer has been critical of Trump’s decision to pull out of the deal he once opposed. A reporter asked him earlier this month if he supported leaving the deal based on his position in 2015. "No. There are no reports that Iran has violated the agreement and to me, the greatest worries from Iran are not right now the nuclear side," Schumer said,"but rather what they’re doing in Syria, what they’re doing to arm Hezbollah with rockets." Schumer said he wants the U.S. to work with its allies to curb Iran’s influence in the region while maintaining the country’s nuclear restrictions. He clarified his position on the Senate floor a few days later. "Telling Iran, you continue giving missiles to Hezbollah, you continue sending troops to Iran, you continue your stuff with the Houthis, developing missiles, we’re going to put additional sanctions on you," Schumer said. "That to me is the smartest thing to do." Schumer also said he did not regret voting against the deal in 2015. "I didn’t think the deal was a good deal. Proud I voted no," Schumer said. "But at this time and this place for so many reasons, pulling out precipitously without our allies involved, does not achieve any of the goals we need to achieve and hurts Americans in different ways." Our ruling Trump said Schumer wants to keep the U.S. in the Iran nuclear deal after opposing it three years ago. That’s all true. Schumer came out against the Iran deal and voted to reject it in 2015. He disagreed with Trump’s decision to leave the deal this month, saying the U.S. should have threatened Iran with tougher sanctions alongside the nuclear restrictions. We rate Trump’s claim True.

pomt-09530	"A Democratic poll operation shows that Fox News is the most trusted news operation in the country."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/10/bill-oreilly/oreilly-claims-poll-shows-fox-news-most-trusted-ne/	Jon Stewart's first appearance on the O'Reilly Factor since 2004 was a mostly civil affair, with the most heated moments coming when the discussion turned to Fox News. Stewart, the host of the Daily Show who has been highly critical of partisan boostering on Fox News, told host Bill O'Reilly that Fox News is a "narrative-driven media arm" of the Republican Party. "Here's what Fox has done," Stewart said. "Through their cyclonic perpetual emotion machine -- 24 hours a day, seven days a week -- they've taken reasonable concerns about the president and this economy and turned it into a full-fledged panic attack about the next coming of Chairman Mao." O'Reilly said that was the narrative of two other Fox News hosts, Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck. When asked by Stewart if he really thought Fox News was nonpartisan, fair and balanced, O'Reilly said its hard news operation is, and that some of the other programs -- like his -- are opinion programs. And O'Reilly cited a poll to back up his point, "Are you shocked that a Democratic poll operation shows that Fox News is the most trusted news operations in the country. Forty-nine percent of Americans trust Fox News. Are you stunned?" It's a poll that Fox News executives are apparently quite proud of. Fox recently took out full-page ads in both the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal in which they took a poke at the slogan of competitor CNN with an ad that boasted, "The Most Trusted Name in News. More Americans Trust Fox News Than Any Other News Network." It's a survey conducted by Public Policy Polling. And as for O'Reilly's characterization of it as a Democratic poll operation, Public Polling Policy president Dean Debnam said that when it comes to polling work for political parties, the company deals exclusively with Democratic clients. The national poll asked 1,151 registered voters on Jan. 18 and 19, 2010, whether they trust each of the major television news operations in the country. And Fox came out with the highest percentage who said yes -- 49 percent. Here's how it broke down: Fox News (49 percent trust; 37 percent do not); followed by CNN (39 percent trust; 41 percent do not); NBC (35 percent trust; 44 percent do not); CBS News (32 percent trust; 46 percent do not); and ABC News (31 percent trust; 46 percent do not). But as with so many polls, there's lots of ways to slice numbers when you examine specific groups. For example, you could accurately say that among self-described moderates, Fox is also the least trusted network. It probably would be more accurate to say that Fox News is overwhelmingly trusted by Republicans. Together, Democrats and independents trust other networks more than Fox. Digging down into the numbers, there was a wide split along party lines. Some 74 percent of Republicans said they trusted Fox compared to just 30 percent of Democrats. All of the major broadcast networks, and CNN, have the majority trust of Democrats; but the major networks are all trusted by less than 20 percent of Republicans (and only 23 percent of Republicans said they trusted CNN). "A generation ago you would have expected Americans to place their trust in the most neutral and unbiased conveyors of news," Debnam said in a press release accompanying the poll results. "But the media landscape has really changed and now they’re turning more toward the outlets that tell them what they want to hear." We spoke to Debnam and he said it's fair to say -- based on the poll -- that "more people trust Fox news than trust anyone else." But he said that the numbers are propped up by strong Republican support. "Republicans trust Fox News by an astoundingly large percentage," Debnam said. In a blog posting that blasted the poll, Gary Langer, the director of polling at ABC News, argued the results were skewed because Republicans were overrepresented in the poll and young people were underrepresented. He further cited an October 2009 Pew poll that found more people believe Fox has an ideological slant than other networks. But the question wasn't whether Fox or any other news channel has an ideological bent. It's whom you trusted. You could think Fox has a conservative slant and still trust it. Langer points to another poll that runs counter to the one cited by O'Reilly. Performed in August 2008 by the Pew Research Center, respondents were asked to rate news sources on a scale from 1 to 4 (with 1 being "believe almost nothing" to 4 being "believe all or most"). In that survey, Fox got fewer 3s and 4s than CNN, NBC, ABC and CBS. But we note that the poll is more than a year and a half old. We also found one in November 2008, a Zogby poll commissioned by the Independent Film Channel which asked people to name the one network they trusted the most. Fox News came out on top with 39 percent; followed by CNN with 16 percent; MSNBC with 15 percent; and PBS with 10 percent. The major networks were each cited by less than 7 percent of respondents. But this survey only allowed people to pick just one choice. You couldn't say you trusted Network A and Network B. So that may simply mean that conservatives agree on Fox, but liberals split their votes among a number of networks. And one last one, we swear. A September 2009 survey by the Sacred Heart University Polling Institute found that Fox was named most frequently as the television news organization most trusted for accurate reporting. It broke down Fox News (30.0 percent), CNN (19.5 percent), NBC News (7.5 percent) and ABC News (7.5 percent). Fox News was also most frequently cited as the least trusted television news organization. What to make of all this? In a Time blog posting, James Poniewozik wrote this about the poll cited by O'Reilly: "I think what we're seeing here is that Fox viewers are more likely to believe that all news outlets are biased — and either they don't mind it, or they at least accept that such is the way of the world. And they either simply prefer to watch a channel they see as being biased in their direction, or they believe it is a necessary counterbalance to the (unacknowledged) liberal bias of all other TV news, or they believe other channels are hypocrites for denying being biased, or all of the above. Whereas the rest of the news audience either still sees neutrality as possible, or at least still values it as an ideal." Which brings us back to O'Reilly's statement. You may argue that Fox comes out on top because Republicans and conservatives really trust Fox while Democrats and liberals generally trust CNN and the major networks, but not as much as conservatives trust Fox. That's true. But O'Reilly said a Democratic poll operation showed that Fox News is the most trusted news operation in the country. And that's what it found. We rule his statement True.

pomt-01775	Says Jason Carter has "gotten David Axelrod to come down and be his campaign advisor."	false	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/29/nathan-deal/deal-wrong-axelrod-not-working-carter/	Gov. Nathan Deal was on radio recently to address allegations that two of his aides pressured the director of the state ethics commission to settle cases against his campaign. WSB radio’s Erick Erickson asked the governor what he thought of Democratic opponent Jason Carter’s call for an independent investigation. Deal said it wasn’t surprising "now that Carter has gotten David Axelrod to come down and be his campaign advisor." Axelrod, a longtime political strategist, is closely tied to President Barack Obama. He was campaign manager when Obama won the presidency in 2008 and followed Obama to Washington to serve as White House senior advisor. He left the administration in 2011 to become senior strategist for Obama’s successful 2012 re-election campaign. Deal is hardly the first candidate in this year’s elections to try to link an opponent to Obama, who has a low 42-percent job approval rating nationally, worse in Georgia. In the state’s GOP Senate race, for example, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston tried to tar opponent David Perdue by pointing out that a company with Perdue on its board of directors had accepted money from Obama’s stimulus program. Perdue, meanwhile, attacked Kingston for voting to put money into president’s Cash for Clunkers program. But in this case, Deal got it wrong. Axelrod isn’t working on Carter’s campaign. He’s running the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago. But AKPD Message and Media, a political consulting firm that Axelrod founded and sold in 2009, is working for Carter, a two-term state senator and the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter who was born in Georgia but grew up outside of Chicago. AKPD is doing media consulting for Carter’s campaign for governor and, as of the last disclosure reports, had been paid $67,908. The Chicago firm boasts of a successful track record for Democratic candidates. Jen Talaber, spokeswoman for Deal’s re-election bid, said the campaign wasn’t aware Axelrod had sold the firm five years ago. It was an "honest mistake," she said an email. But Talaber said the governor’s underlying point still stands. "Carter’s campaign team and consultants are Obama insiders, and his national fundraising list shows the Obama brain trust is in full force," she said. Bryan Thomas, communications director for the Carter campaign, said Deal’s claim about Axelrod "was no slip of the tongue. "Gov. Deal will do anything he can to distract from his ethical quagmire, including lie about his opponent," Thomas said. "It's not surprising that a governor who plays it so loose with the laws is playing loose with truth, too." Earlier this month, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution obtained a memo in which Holly LaBerge, head of the state ethics commission, said she was threatened and pressured by Deal’s office in 2012 to "make (ethics) complaints" against the governor "go away." The complaints included claims Deal improperly paid for use of a private aircraft for campaign travel and questioned his use of campaign funds to pay legal fees during his 2010 campaign. The ethics commission wound up dismissing the major complaints against Deal. He agreed to pay $3,350 in fees for technical defects to his campaign disclosures. Now, the Deal campaign isn’t the only one spreading word of an Axelrod connection. The Georgia Republican Party has a web page on "Chicago liberals," with images of Carter, Axelrod and Obama. It states: "Sadly, Chicago-style politics have come to Georgia. Atlanta liberal Jason Carter has hired Barack Obama’s trusted ally, David Axelrod." It goes on to say: "Liberals know they can’t hit Gov. Deal on jobs, the economy, or education. So they’ve resorted to attacking Gov. Deal’s character … Tell Jason Carter, Barack Obama, and David Axelrod we don’t need Chicago liberals running around Georgia attacking our conservative values. AKPD’s website touts the firm’s founding by Axelrod and has a quote from him on its homepage. We reached out to firm executives just to ask point blank if Axelrod were in someway connected to them or the Carter campaign. We heard back from Isaac Baker, a partner in the firm, who said Axelrod "does not work for our firm" and "is not involved in any way in the Jason Carter campaign." To summarize, David Axelrod is not working as a campaign advisor to Jason Carter. But the firm he founded and sold five years ago is. Talaber, Deal’s campaign spokeswoman, said the governor made an "honest mistake" when he said in a radio interview that Axelrod was working for Carter. But she said the underlying point still stands -- that Carter’s campaign team and consultants are "Obama insiders." That doesn’t change the fact that the governor was incorrect in saying that Jason Carter has "gotten David Axelrod to come down and be his campaign advisor." We rate Deal’s statement as False.

"Speaker Thom Tillis cut almost $500 million from education, causing crowded classrooms and forcing teachers to pay out-of-pocket for school supplies, while Tillis protected tax breaks for yachts and jets," the ad said. Tillis is running against incumbent Democrat Sen. Kay Hagan, whose campaign has also used the $500 million figure -- as have numerous media reports. We wondered if Tillis is responsible for such cuts. Where did the cuts come from? When we looked at North Carolina's education budget year to year, it has increased every year since Tillis became speaker in 2011. According to a document prepared by the General Assembly, the state education budget was $10.8 billion in the 2010-11 fiscal year and $11.5 billion for 2014-15. (These numbers are adjusted for inflation and include both K-12 and higher education spending.) Additionally, state expenditure per pupil for K-12 has increased since 2011 -- from $5,156 in 2011 to $5,395 in 2013. Education spending in North Carolina comes from a combination of federal, state and local dollars. State funding accounts for more than 62 percent of expenditures. So did Women Vote pull that $500 million cut out of thin air? No, but it's complicated. Each year, the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management creates a continuation budget, which is a tool that outlines how much should be spent to maintain the current service level, without cutting or adding services. The projection might be larger or smaller than previous years because it takes into account factors such as inflation, population growth and operating new facilities. Lawmakers are not obliged to match the continuation budget. For the 2013-15 budget, the state budget office proposed a continuation budget of about $23.6 billion for those two years to maintain the status quo across K-12 and higher education. The budget that state lawmakers passed came up to about $23.1 billion. In total, lawmakers allocated $481 million less than the the continuation budget suggested. (EMILY's List and Hagan's campaign pointed us to this when we asked about the ad.) That shortfall ended up dividing the political parties in North Carolina: Last year, Tillis took to the floor to push lawmakers to pass the budget, while Democrats bashed the bill primarily because they believed the education allocations weren't adequate. The bill passed 65-53 in the House and 32-17 in the Senate, with no Democratic votes in favor. It’s important to note that the Legislature’s choosing to fund at levels lower than the continuation budget is not a literal budget cut. In raw dollars, the state is spending more money than in previous years. However, Tillis’ critics say it has the same effect as a cut. "If you’re not doing what it takes to maintain the status quo, it’s a cut," said Hagan spokeswoman Sadie Weiner. Some other critics of Tillis’ education record have noted that state funding for K-12 education in North Carolina is about $500 million less than pre-recession levels. In the 2013-14 school year, public school spending was about $7.9 billion. In 2008-2009, it was $8.4, when adjusted for inflation. The budget affecting the 2014-15 school year eliminated 5,200 teachers, 3,800 teacher assistants and about $115 million for textbooks and instructional supplies, among other services, said Philip Price, CFO for the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. It also increases student-teacher ratios. The budget added a small number of new programs, but the vast majority of state education spending growth over the years comes down to rising healthcare and retirement costs. "That doesn’t help the students," Price said. "It doesn’t mean you get more teachers. It doesn’t change what is available to that classroom." Reductions in federal and local education spending -- as well as funding shifts due to rising charter school popularity -- could also be a major reason why schools feel as if their funds have shrunk, despite a steadily increasing state budget, said Terry Stoops, director of research and education policy at the John Locke Foundation, a North Carolina think tank that promotes limited government. He added that between 2010 and 2013, federal funding to North Carolina schools dropped by $337.6 million. But when the federal government stopped giving North Carolina schools stimulus funding, the state did not pick up the slack, Price said. The state's shrinking spending on classroom services is part of a trend that has been going on since the recession -- back to when Democrats controlled the General Assembly -- and can't be solely blamed on one speaker of the house, he added. A final note: The ad also claims that Tillis preserved tax breaks for yachts and jets. That refers to a Republican-backed tax bill passed in 2013, under Tillis' leadership. The bill preserved a $1,500 cap on sales tax for yachts and jets. Our ruling An ad attacking Tillis said he "cut almost $500 million from education." Literally, the ad is wrong. As North Carolina's Speaker of the House, Tillis helped pass a budget in 2013 that increased actual spending on education in comparison to previous years. But the budget spent almost $500 million less than what was requested to maintain the status quo, accounting for inflation and increased costs of various services. Additionally, the actual budget increase had a lot to do with rising costs of employee benefits, and not a lot to do with money that ends up in the classroom. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-07910	The U.S. loses more on tax breaks than it collects in personal income taxes.	true	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/01/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-us-tax-breaks-outweigh-income-tax/	U.S. Sen. Mark Warner says it’s time for Congress "to put up or shut up" in addressing the national debt. The Virginia Democrat, with Sen.Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga. is preparing a bill that would pare debt through a regimen of spending cuts and tax reforms certain to leave everyone in pain. Among the most controversial aspects will be proposals to change deduction guidelines for home mortgage interest and to phase in personal income taxes on health care benefits provided by employers. The bill will revive a comprehensive series of budget overhauls urged last fall by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, a panel of fiscal experts appointed by the White House and Congress. The recommendations were set back last fall when they failed to receive a super majority of votes needed on the bipartisan commission to advance them to Congress. Warner, in a Jan. 25 interview on Fox News, said ending popular tax breaks must be must be part of any formula to significantly reduce debt. "I don’t think that most Americans realize that we actually spend more on tax expenditures, or tax breaks, than we collect in personal income taxes each year," he said. "So that has to be on the table, also." Personal incomes taxes are the federal government’s largest revenue source, providing 45 percent of its tax receipts. Is Uncle Sam exempting more than he’s taking in? We checked. Warner’s office sent us data from the Office of Management and Budget that show the senator is correct. The spread sheets show during the last two fiscal years combined, the U.S. collected $1.85 trillion in personal income taxes and allowed $2.17 trillion in income tax breaks to individuals and corporations. During the current fiscal year, the U.S. is projected to take in $1.12 trillion in personal income taxes while allowing individuals and corporations $1.66 trillion in breaks. We wondered if Warner was stacking the deck by sending us spread sheets that compared the revenues from personal income tax payments to the money Washington forsakes in tax breaks to individuals as well as corporations. So we untangled the numbers. Computing data in a Dec. 21 report by the Joint Committee on Taxation, we found that individuals receive about 91 percent of the value of income tax breaks, with corporations getting the rest. That means during the last two fiscal years, individuals received a total of about $1.98 trillion in breaks for the $1.85 trillion in income tax they paid. Warner’s claim, in other words, holds true when compare you the income tax paid by individuals to the tax breaks they receive. The largest break to individuals is not having to pay income taxes on their employers’ contributions to their personal health care and health insurance premiums. That’s worth about $132 billion a year in taxes. The commission, whose work Warner wants to revive in his bill, recommended phasing out the break by 2038. Second biggest break is the net exclusion of pension contributions and earnings, worth about $119 billion a year.in annual taxes. The commission said the break should be examined and perhaps capped. The popular mortgage-interest deduction is worth $97 billion a year. The commission proposed that the deduction be limited to principle residences only and that eligible mortgages be capped at $500,000 instead of the current $1 million limit. The group also proposed a 12 percent nonrefundable mortgage-interest tax credit for all filers who own homes. Under the commission’s proposal, individuals would be compensated for some of the loss in tax breaks by lowering the rates charged in all income tax brackets. The commission recommended a long series of tax reforms, spending cuts and pro-growth policies that it said would reduce debt by $3.9 trillion by the end of the decade. The tax changes would lead lead to $785 billion in debt reduction. Let’s review. Warner says the U.S. gives up more in income tax breaks than it receives in income tax revenues. Anyway you dice the figures, he’s right. We rate his statement: True.	None	Mark Warner	None	None	None	2011-02-01T11:00:35	2011-01-25	['United_States']

pomt-06443	Says his proposed payroll tax cut "will mean an extra $1,500 in your pocket compared to if we do nothing."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/oct/21/barack-obama/obama-says-his-payroll-tax-cut-would-mean-1500-you/	President Barack Obama barnstormed Virginia this week, hoping to galvanize support for his proposals to create jobs and further cut payroll taxes. "What we are proposing," he told an estimated crowd of 1,300 at a high school in Emporia, "is that the payroll tax we passed in December gets extended, gets expanded, and that will mean an extra $1,500 in your pockets compared to if we do nothing." An extra $1,500 could come in handy. So we decided check out the president’s statement. First, a little background. The payroll tax is a federal levy taken directly from the paychecks of employed Americans. It’s mainly used to fund Social Security and Medicare. For two decades, the payroll tax meant a 6.2 percent deduction on annual earnings for most workers. There were limits to the total amount individuals could be required to pay. In 2009 and 2010, the levy applied to the first $106,800 of salary, meaning no one would pay more than $6,621. Employers paid a matching share. Last December, the levy was cut to 4.2 percent for workers as part of an agreement Obama worked out with Congress to extend income tax reductions passed during President George W. Bush’s administration that critics say favors high earners. The payroll tax reduction is in effect for the duration of 2011. Last month, Obama proposed slicing the payroll to 3.1 percent for workers next year as part of a $447 billion bill to spur to spur the economy called the American Jobs Act. To help employers, the president also proposed a 50 percent tax cut in the first $5 million of payroll costs for most small businesses. Obama is accusing congressional Republicans of blocking his package, which would be paid for by increasing taxes on people earning more than $1 million a year. He has vowed to pull out proposals in the Jobs Act -- including the payroll tax reduction -- and send them to Congress as individual bills. Now, let’s look into Obama’s statement that his payroll tax cut "would put an extra $1,500 in your pocket." We can do a rough assessment with some basic math. Our calculations will be based on median income -- the income level that’s exactly in the middle when all incomes are ranked from smallest to largest -- because, unlike the mean (or average), it’s not significantly influenced by a small number of very high earners. The median U.S. household income in 2010 -- the most recent year available -- was $49,445. Reducing payroll tax rate to 3.1 percent would mean a $1,533 savings next year compared to the levy they paid in 2010, when there was a 6.2 percent rate. That’s a little bit higher than the president’s estimate. The savings would be greater in Virginia, where the median household income in 2010 was $60,363. Such a family would pay $1,871 less next year than they did in 2010. If Congress doesn’t act on the payroll tax, then, as Obama noted, the rate will return to 6.2 next year. Now that we’ve made our computations, we’ll note two reasons why they’re imperfect. First, not all income is subject to the payroll tax, including interest income, dividends, capital gains, inheritances and Social Security benefits. Second, not all households include people who are working, and therefore, not all qualify for a payroll tax cut. This includes individuals and couples who are unemployed or retired. To gauge the impact of these factors, we turned to estimates by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. It concluded that the average national benefit for households that qualify for this year’s payroll tax cut, with rates set at 4.2 percent, is $934. The center did not do computations for Virginia. Robertson Williams, an economist with the center, told us the average national savings would increase to $1,446 per qualified household if the rate is dropped to 3.1 percent next year. According to the center, just under 78 percent of households -- are subject to payroll taxes and eligible for relief. The remaining 22 percent would see no benefit at all. "I think the president’s figures are reasonable," Williams said. Our ruling: Obama said this proposed payroll tax cut "will mean an extra $1,500 in your pocket." Since early September, he’s been using that number to describe average national savings for households that pay the levy. An economist at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center computes the actual savings would be $1,446. Of course, Obama was speaking to a crowd in Virginia, where incomes are higher than the national average and the savings from a payroll tax cut would be greater. The president’s statement is certainly in the ballpark and we rate it True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-10-21T07:45:00	2011-10-18	['None']
pomt-04125	"While President Obama says all options are on the table for preventing a nuclear Iran, Hagel says military action is not a viable, feasible, responsible option."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/08/emergency-committee-israel/pro-israel-groups-ad-depicts-obama-hagel-iran/	President Barack Obama’s nomination of former Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., as defense secretary is expected to create a hotly contested fight about his comments on Israel and Iran. Pro-Israel hawks have cast a portrait of Hagel as too soft on Iran and not chummy enough with Israel. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said a day before the Jan. 7 announcement that if confirmed, Hagel would be "the most antagonistic secretary of defense towards the State of Israel in our nation's history." The Hagel nomination comes two months after Obama won re-election amid much debate about Obama’s relationship with Israel. Obama still won the vast majority of the Jewish vote, but by less than 2008. The Emergency Committee for Israel, a pro-Israel group whose board members include high-profile conservatives Bill Kristol and Gary Bauer, aired an ad in December attacking Hagel, even before Obama officially announced his pick to replace Leon Panetta who is retiring. "Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel?" asks a disgusted sounding narrator. "President Obama says he supports sanctions on Iran. Hagel voted against them. Hagel voted against labeling Iran’s Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group. And while President Obama says all options are on the table for preventing a nuclear Iran, Hagel says military action is not a viable, feasible, responsible option. President Obama, for secretary of defense Chuck Hagel is not a responsible option." There are a lot of claims in that ad, but we wanted to check if Obama and Hagel disagreed about military options for preventing a nuclear Iran. We contacted the Emergency Committee for Israel about the ad and did not get a response. We also did not get a response from the White House. But in a press briefing the day Obama announced his nomination of Hagel, White House spokesman Jay Carney defended Hagel as a "staunch supporter of Israel" and "a supporter of the broad sanctions regime that this President has put into place against Iran... ." Hagel told a newspaper in his home state of Nebraska that critics have distorted his views on Israel and Iran, but he did not directly address whether he would favor striking Iran. Obama has said regularly that he leaves all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. Here’s a representative comment from the 2012 AIPAC conference: "I have said that when it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, I will take no options off the table, and I mean what I say. That includes all elements of American power: A political effort aimed at isolating Iran; a diplomatic effort to sustain our coalition and ensure that the Iranian program is monitored; an economic effort that imposes crippling sanctions; and, yes, a military effort to be prepared for any contingency." Hagel’s record Hagel, a decorated Vietnam veteran, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in Nebraska in 1996 and served two terms, including serving on the Foreign Relations Committee before he retired in 2008. Hagel’s experiences on the battlefront made him cautious about war. "I'm not a pacifist. I believe in using force but only after a very careful decision-making process. … I will do everything I can to avoid needless, senseless war," he said in an interview with Vietnam magazine. Hagel voted to give President George W. Bush the authority to go to war against Afghanistan and Iraq but was later critical of those wars, creating a wedge between him and the GOP, including a rebuke from former Vice President Dick Cheney. Hagel also drew fire for comments he made in 2006 to author and former State Department Mideast peace negotiator Aaron David Miller. "The Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here," Hagel said, but "I'm a United States senator. I'm not an Israeli senator." Miller recently wrote that accusations that Hagel is anti-semitic "is shameful and scurrilous." While some of Hagel’s views are out of sync with current U.S. policy, it won’t matter because Obama controls foreign policy, Miller wrote. Hagel on Iran The ad attacking Hagel cites a Dec. 13, 2012, article from the Washington Post leaving the viewer to believe that Hagel made that statement about Iran on the eve of his nomination. But the Post article recapped various Hagel comments -- including that particular one, which actually goes back to 2006. We did our own research and reviewed multiple comments Hagel made in speeches and interviews between 2005 and 2012. We found that Hagel repeatedly called on the U.S. to engage Iran in direct discussions and expressed concern that a military attack on Iran could lead to widespread counter-attacks. But his caution was at least in part borne from the fact that we were already engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. On CNN in April 2006, an interviewer asked Hagel if diplomacy failed, if the U.S. should pursue a military strike. Hagel’s response including these comments: "Well, first of all, I think we have to recognize that this Iranian issue does represent a real threat to the United States. ... unlike Iraq. This is a real legitimate issue. And I think, before we charge off in going off to another war -- we're in two of them now, in Afghanistan and Iraq -- we'd better think through this one carefully and clearly. I think it's going to require an engagement directly with the Iranians." Later in 2006, Hagel visited Pakistan. Pakistani Press International reported that Hagel ruled out any military action against Iran. "I do not expect any kind of military solution on the Iran issue," Hagel said, adding President George W. Bush and senior members of his cabinet had said the military option was not a responsible approach to resolving the issues. "I think to further comment on it would be complete speculation, but I would say that a military strike against Iran, a military option, is not a viable, feasible, responsible option."’ (This is the comment the ad directly quotes.) In 2012, Hagel still expressed caution about military intervention, but didn’t specifically rule it out. In a March 2012 interview with the news website Al-Monitor, Hagel said that we should not be locked into one of two options or "false choices." The interviewer then suggested as a false choice: "Bomb Iran or live with Iran with a bomb?" Hagel responded: "Exactly. We may eventually wind up with those choices. But I don’t think we’re there now. We’ve got some time, keep ratcheting up the sanctions, keep the world community with you. … You cannot push the Iranians into a corner where they can’t get out …You’ve got to find some quiet ways – and you don’t do this in the press or by giving speeches – to give them a couple of facing saving ways out of this thing so they get something out of this, too. And recognizing internally what’s going on in Iran; things are not going particularly well. Let that play out… So you work this thing on a number of parallel tracks." Hagel criticized the Republican presidential candidates, saying "they can hardly race to say who would bomb Iran first; it’s just amazing." In a September 2012, Hagel co-wrote a Washington Post op-ed that specifically included military options: "Our position is fully consistent with the policy of presidents for more than a decade of keeping all options on the table, including the use of military force, thereby increasing pressure on Iran while working toward a political solution. Since the consequences of a military attack are so significant for U.S. interests, we seek to ensure that the spectrum of objectives, as well as potential consequences, is understood." Our ruling The Emergency Committee for Israel said in an ad, "And while President Obama says all options are on the table for preventing a nuclear Iran Hagel says military action is not a viable, feasible, responsible option." Obama clearly has said all options are on the table. But the ad portrays Hagel’s comments as occurring in December 2012, he actually stated them in 2006. In the past, Hagel did repeatedly warn against jumping into another war and called for discussions with Iran, but the comments the ad cites were made when the United States was engaged in war in both Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2012 in an op-ed he co-wrote, Hagel called for "keeping all options on the table, including the use of military force, thereby increasing pressure on Iran while working toward a political solution."

pomt-02212	"Obama has proposed 442 tax hikes since taking office."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/apr/22/americans-tax-reform/obama-has-proposed-442-tax-hikes-says-anti-tax-gro/	President Barack Obama is no stranger to the charge that he likes to raise taxes. But a new report from an anti-tax group says he’s actually proposed raising taxes more than 400 times. "Obama has proposed 442 tax hikes since taking office," said Americans for Tax Reform in an April 14 press release. "History tells us what Obama was able to do. This list reminds us of what Obama wanted to do,’" said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, in the statement. The group released a list of 442 measures the group considered a tax increase, divided into sections for each fiscal year’s budget from 2010 to 2015. The report is based on an analysis of the budgets the Obama administration has proposed since taking the White House. Americans for Tax Reform is well known for opposing tax increases. The group promotes a famous pledge, which says politicians will oppose "any and all efforts" to increase income taxes and will also oppose "any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates." That means they don’t support any measure that brings more revenue into the government. We wondered if the group was accurate in how it was counting up Obama’s proposals. We’ve tracked Obama’s campaign promises on taxes, and while he has definitely proposed new taxes, we were suspicious that it was 442 separate tax increases. (Indeed, we track 24 campaign promises from Obama on the topic of taxes, a group that includes proposed tax hikes as well as proposed tax breaks.) So we decided to put Americans for Tax Reform’s number to our Truth-O-Meter. The list We started out with a close examination of the long list of proposals on their 15-page press release. Each fiscal year budget has its own section, stating the year of the proposal and the total number of measures for each year. The release does not elaborate on the specifics of each measure beyond briefly stating its purpose. We found there are plenty of measures on the list that would increase taxes. One example: Obama’s pledge to impose a so-called "Buffett Rule," which would set a minimum tax rate of approximately 30 percent on millionaires. Also included on the list are several tax increases on the oil and gas industry, either by eliminating existing credits for oil companies or through entirely new taxes, another pledge Obama made during his presidential campaigns. Many items on the list, though, struck us as either double-counted or not a tax at all. Here’s a summary of some of the problems we found. The list counts the same proposals multiple times. Americans for Tax Reform listed a measure each time it appeared in one of Obama’s budgets. As a result, 276 of the proposals on the list have at least one match somewhere else in the document. (We didn’t include proposals that have a similar but not identical wording to others on the list.) Obama did propose these measures multiple times, but it is misleading to count each time he included a measure in his budget as a newly proposed tax increase. For example, Obama has long proposed ending a special tax category, known as "carried interest," that allows hedge fund managers and other financial investors to claim lower tax rates than ordinary workers. But Congress has never signed off on getting rid of the special category. Americans for Tax Reform counts Obama’s idea four times on its list, because it has appeared in four budget proposals. But it’s really the same proposal. Removing duplicates eliminates about 159 of the proposals, cutting the total down to 283 proposed tax hikes. Americans for Tax Reform said it didn’t see these as duplicates, since Obama specifically proposed them each year in his budgets. "If President Obama proposes tax increases several times in several different budgets, he deserves full credit for doing so," said Ryan Ellis, the group’s tax policy director, via email. Some items aren’t tax increases. We noticed that the list includes several administrative changes to the tax code that aren’t tax increases. Here are a few examples: Require greater electronic filing of returns; Index all tax penalties to inflation; Make repeated willful failure to file a tax return a felony; Require e-filing by certain large organizations. Oddly, we found that a few measures included on the list were actually tax decreases, such as the proposal from the president’s 2015 budget to eliminate the telephone excise tax. We flagged 34 of the proposals on the list as ones that either wouldn’t raise taxes or would only do so through a penalty for failing to comply with the proposal. Americans for Tax Reform agreed that four of the items we found were not tax increases, including the repeal of the telephone excise tax. Ellis said they would adjust their total accordingly. But they did feel that 11 items, including indexing tax penalties for inflation, were tax increases because they would increase revenue to the government. The other items "fall into an area where reasonable minds can draw different conclusions," he said. The Americans for Tax Reform list also failed to account for other tax cuts that are part of Obama’s record, including nearly $220 billion in tax cuts that were part of the federal stimulus. We ran our findings by Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, and an expert on federal tax policy. He said it wasn’t useful to count tax proposals without any consideration for what’s in the proposal. "This whole matter of the number of tax hikes he proposed is silly," Toder said via email. "If someone raised my taxes 442 times by 1 cent each time or one time by $100,000, I think I would prefer the former to the latter." Our ruling Americans for Tax Reform said that "Obama has proposed 442 tax hikes since taking office." While the list accompanying the claim does contain some proposals that would have increased taxes, it overstates the total number by a significant amount. Our analysis suggests about 200 items should be knocked off this list, because it includes the same items Obama proposed in multiple budgets and some proposals that cannot be considered tax increases.

pomt-15009	Says Donald Trump’s "Make America Great Again" hats were made in China.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/oct/07/tweets/tweets-say-donald-trumps-make-america-great-again-/	Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was forced to address a widespread allegation of hypocrisy this week, and it had nothing to do with his former liberal ways or his company’s overseas investments. Much worse. Social media posts claimed his unmistakable, sometimes ironically worn "Make America Great Again" hats are not made in the USA. Here’s an example from Twitter, which was picked up by Occupy Democrats on Facebook: Made in China?! Say it ain’t so, Donald. Hold onto your plastic snap enclosure. It’s not true. The hat that launched a barrage of snarky social media posts after its July debut at a Texas campaign event has also launched a host of imitations. "The image you shared is not an official campaign product," Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told PunditFact in an email. "All product for sale on DonaldJTrump.com is made in the USA." Hicks confirmed a couple of other facts about the authentic Trump campaign hat, sold for $25-$30 in patriotic and camouflage shades at the campaign store. The hats are made by Cali Fame of Los Angeles, which makes the Cali Headwear brand. Trump’s hat is based on the Patriot 5 model, and no surprise, it’s been a bestseller this year, though not a bestseller of all time. Cali Headwear co-owner Brian Kennedy told us that hats his company made for Von Dutch and Ed Hardy sold better. Oh, and they are made in the USA. Kennedy’s company, which his family has owned since 1977, has been making this style since the 1970s. Trump has been wearing it and selling it on his golf courses for years, but it’s been big with the hipster market since the summer (well, so has the "dad hat," he said). "It’s just the same old story that what goes around comes around," Kennedy told us by phone from inside his factory, machines whirring in the background. "But there’s news every day on the hat," he added. From there, the hats are distributed by Ace Specialties LLC, a Lafayette, La., company that normally deals with gear for the oil and gas industry. Ace Specialties president and owner Christl Mahfouz said she had seen a similar meme on Facebook, "and that’s not even his hat." "Definitely everything on our side is made in the USA," said Mahfouz, who is also on the board of the Eric Trump Foundation, the philanthropy started by one of Trump’s sons for children with terminal illness. A few years back, before he entered politics as a candidate, there was more truth to claims that Trump gear was not made in America. Former Late Show host David Letterman brought out a number of buttoned shirts and slick ties from the Trump brand clothing line for Macy’s (which dumped him after his fiery statements about Mexicans in July) in a 2011 interview. Letterman pointed out that his ties and shirts were made in China, according to the label. At the time, Trump was supporting Republican Mitt Romney for president and had been accusing China of taking American manufacturing jobs. Trump smirked as the crowd cheered before he defended himself, saying "it’s very hard to get product that’s not made in China" because of the country’s currency manipulation. Our ruling Tweets aim to paint Trump as a hypocrite for hawking "Make America Great Again" hats with "Made in China" labels from his campaign store. Those hats are knockoffs. Trump has even trademarked the phrase "Make America Great Again." Trump’s hats are made by a California company that says they are, indeed, American made. We rate the claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-06756	Says "under our current sentencing laws, about 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/aug/23/michael-schrunk/trio-county-district-attorneys-say-only-quarter-fe/	Gov. John Kitzhaber recently announced the creation of a new commission to examine the state’s sentencing laws. Not long after, two advocacy groups released a joint report calling Oregon's Measure 11 ineffective and discriminatory when it comes to the state’s youth. Mandatory sentencing laws -- ever the point of contention -- are receiving renewed public attention. And in a recent guest column in The Oregonian, three county district attorneys -- including Multnomah’s Michael Schrunk -- offered some context, noting "this is an issue with which we have great experience and expertise." While expressing some disappointment that the governor was not including elected district attorneys on the commission, the three wrote "contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal. Under our current sentencing laws, about 75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison. They are put on probation in the community." That statistic caught the eye of at least one reader who asked PolitiFact Oregon to take a look. The DAs said they got that figure courtesy of Oregon’s Criminal Justice Commission, so that’s where we started. It didn’t take long before Michael Wilson, the commission’s economist, sent us a breakdown of felons and their sentences for 2010. At first blush, it looks like Schrunk and the other DAs -- John Foote of Clackamas and Bob Hermann of Washington -- were right. (It should be noted, nine others endorsed the letter, as well.) Of the 17,622 convicted felons in 2010, just over 4,000 were sent to prison. As a percentage, that’s about 23 percent. But, as Craig Prins, the director of the justice commission put it, "the simple answer isn’t always the most informative answer." There are a few caveats to consider before you go shouting that number from any rooftops. For starters, that 23 percent figure doesn’t include the 8 percent of felons who serve state time, but do it in local jails. Those 8 percent serve less than a year, but it’s still worth noting. Take that into account and at least 30 percent are serving state time -- just not necessarily in a prison. Next, it should be noted that there are different categories of felonies, and as you drill down into them, you start to notice that certain sorts of felons are more likely to receive time in a prison. Of the felons convicted of "person crimes" (think: robberies, assaults, sex crimes, murder and others), 43 percent go to prison, and another 3 percent spent time in a local jail. For felons convicted of property crimes, 30 percent wind up in prison and another 5 percent in local jails. The overall figure gets pushed down some by drug offenders who are sentenced to prison at a rate close to 8 percent with another 10 percent going to local jails for less than a year. The national rate for the same group is considerably higher, Prins said. In 2006, for instance, nationally drug offenders were being sent to prison about 40 percent of the time, according to a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. "In Oregon, we’ve always kind of prided ourselves on the fact that, policy-wise, it does not make sense to put such people in prison," Prins said. Same goes for people who commit lower-level property crimes. Is it worth spending $30,000 to incarcerate somebody who stole $1,000? Prins asked. The priority are those who commit violent crimes. And, indeed, if you exclude drug offenders from the equation, 33 percent of convicted felons serve time in prison while 7 percent serve time in local jails for a total closer to 40 percent. That’s not to say that drug offenses aren’t felonies -- but it’s still important context, especially given that the word "felony" can describe a number of crimes. There’s one last bit to consider: About 69 percent of all convicted felons wind up with probation. But that doesn’t mean they get off without serving any time behind bars, which seems to be an implicit part of the DAs’ critique when they note "contrary to popular belief, we do not lock up every convicted criminal." According to Wilson, about 63 percent of the offenders who received a probation sentence in 2010 received a jail sentence as well. The average stay, he said, was just over a month. Put another way, only 25 percent of convicted felons actually manage to avoid time behind bars as part of their sentence. Even then, Charles French, a deputy district attorney with Multnomah County who deals a lot with crime statistics, said he’d be surprised if those 25 percent don’t serve at least some time in jail, if even a night, after their arrest. "I think most people who commit felonies do serve time in jail," he said. "But most of them do not serve time in prison. And, frankly, the idea of a jail sanction as a condition of probation is reformatory, in theory." It’s important, he added, that the public has access to these sorts of figures, even if they require some context. "I think the more information the public has, the better." As for our ruling, the DAs were very specific in their statement that "75 percent of all convicted felons in Oregon do not go to prison." Technically they’re right, but the number of felons the DAs "lock up" is considerable higher and that’s an important piece of missing context. We’ll give this one a Mostly True.

pomt-09199	Says his opponent Dorman Grace brags on his Facebook page about receiving illegal campaign contributions.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/25/dale-peterson/candidates-squawk-about-chicken-farm-donations-ala/	One of the most talked-about political ads of the primary election season comes courtesy of a relatively obscure race: the Republican primary for the Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries. It's the tough-talking, rifle-toting Dale "Cowboy" Peterson who propels the ad to an instant classic. To date, the ad has been viewed more 1.2 million times on YouTube. In it, Peterson aims his most pointed verbal attack against Republican primary opponent Dorman Grace. "Dorman Grace brags on his Facebook page about receiving contributions from industries he would regulate. Bragging about receiving illegal money on Facebook. Who on earth would support such a dummy?" It's one thing to call your opponent a dummy. It's another to call him a cheat. And so we decided to check out Peterson's claim that Grace was guilty of taking illegal campaign contributions. And then bragging about it on Facebook. Campaign finance reports submitted to the Alabama Secretary of State, and viewable online, show that Grace has taken contributions from several "farms." Among them, deer and poultry farms. And on his Facebook page, Grace thanked some of the supporters who have contributed to his campaign, including some of the farmers in question. So are the contributions "illegal"? In 1998, the Alabama Legislature passed a law "to prohibit the Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Industries or a candidate for the office of commissioner from accepting campaign contributions from persons associated with businesses regulated by the department." The contributions to Grace have given rise to several complaints with the state Ethics Commission -- not by Peterson -- but the commission has yet to rule on them. He's no expert on election laws, Peterson said in a phone interview with PolitiFact, but this seems pretty cut and dry. "You can readily see that industries that we regulate, he's accepting money from them," Peterson said. End of story? Not necessarily. The Grace campaign says it has done nothing wrong because the contributions to the campaign don't come from industries regulated by the agriculture commissioner. Tullie Culverhouse, campaign manager for Grace, contends the law was intended to bar contributions from agencies regulated by the ag commissioner, such as fertilizer and pest control companies which have to come to the department for a permit to operate in Alabama. "Poultry farms are not regulated by the department," Culverhouse said. "They are serviced by the department. The only thing they do is serve the industry with disease control. This is frivolous." So those are the competing opinions of the two campaigns. We spoke with Glen Zorn, the assistant ag commissioner and Democratic candidate for the top agriculture job. Zorn doesn't think it would be accurate to say, for example, that poultry farms are "regulated" by the commissioner. He hasn't taken any money from any poultry farmers, he said, but he would. The law about not accepting contributions from "persons associated with businesses regulated by the department" has never been tested, and remains a gray area, said Jeff Webb, legal advisor to the Agriculture Commissioner. "We can go on anyone's property that is growing hens and make sure they are following all of the mandates to prevent outbreaks of infectious or contagious disease," Webb said. And so, he said, "There is an argument that they are regulated by us." But there's a pretty good argument in the other direction, too, he said. Ray Hilburn, Poultry Program Director for the Alabama Department of Agriculture, said he doesn't view the department's role as a regulator of poultry farms. "We regulate diseases," he said. "We do disease work. We make sure the birds are disease-free. But we don't regulate the poultry growers themselves, in my opinion." Ultimately, it appears the state Ethics Commission is going to have to decide whether these contributions were improper (and it seems unlikely we'll hear a decision before next month's Republican primary). But we think it's fair to say that when the state's poultry program director and the legal advisor to the Alabama Department of Agriculture say the law is untested and unclear, it's a bit of a gray area. And so we rule Peterson's statement Half True.	None	Dale Peterson	None	None	None	2010-05-25T20:09:53	2010-05-25	['None']

pomt-13620	"The director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/aug/12/carlos-beruff/fbi-admitted-it-cannot-properly-vet-middle-eastern/	Bradenton developer Carlos Beruff wants voters to know that he plans to be tough on national security and immigration, because right now the FBI has no way to guarantee America’s safety as refugees flood the United States. "Thousands of Syrian refugees are pouring into our country, thanks to President Obama," Beruff said in an Aug. 8 Facebook post. "This is an open invitation to acts of terror. Even the director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East." Immigration has been a major focus of this election cycle, with Republicans routinely calling for more restrictions to ensure security in the United States. But did James Comey actually say the FBI "cannot properly vet" people coming from the Middle East? No, he didn’t. Beruff is distorting a point Comey was making about a flaw in the vetting process, but he was reiterating the system in place was actually much better than it had been in years past. No guarantees When we asked Beruff’s campaign what Comey said and when, his spokesman sent us a YouTube clip of Comey speaking before the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21, 2015. A topic at the meeting was the thoroughness of background checks for refugees — specifically some 10,000 Syrian refugees slated to come to the United States. The Syrian refugee focus was much more specific than "people coming from the Middle East," as Beruff said. Let’s be clear: The United States can vet refugees through a process that involves the FBI, plus the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and other agencies. The vetting process can take two or even three years, in which refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Because of the overt concern about terrorism, Syrian refugees actually have to go through extra hurdles. Experts have told us repeatedly that refugee background checks are the most extensive security screening the country has for any type of visitor. At the committee meeting, U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., asked Comey if there was concern that the FBI could miss a potential terrorist infiltrator because intelligence databases may not contain complete information on every refugee. Comey agreed, saying the procedure isn’t perfect, because it relies on checking for criminal records or other nefarious activity. "We can only query against that which we have collected," Comey said. "If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but we are not going to — there will be nothing show up because we have no record on that person." So while the process is very thorough, Comey was saying he couldn’t guarantee there would never be a problem and no terrorist could ever slip through the cracks. That’s just the way it is. Comey noted that when the United States performed background checks on Iraqi refugees, they had a much larger database because of the American presence there over the last decade. Not having the same intelligence infrastructure in Syria has resulted in much less information with which to cross-reference an applicant. As Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson said during the same hearing that a refugee may have a criminal past that’s unknown, or may suddenly commit a terrorist act after entering the United States. But even with the pitfalls of admitting refugees from war-torn regions, Comey said, the process works and has been improving over the years. "The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago," Comey told U.S. Rep Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., later in the hearing. "The bad news is, there is no risk-free process." Comey was echoing concerns he voiced to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Oct. 8. "There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that," he told the Senate committee. "From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals. … I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps." He repeated that sentiment to the House Judiciary Committee on Oct. 22. "We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news," Comey said. "The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria." Our ruling Beruff said, "The director of the FBI said that we cannot properly vet people coming from the Middle East." Comey, while talking specifically about Syrian refugees and not all of the Middle East, has repeatedly said that admitting refugees has its challenges and that information gaps do exist. But he also has expressed confidence in the admission procedure and says it continues to improve. That makes it hard to argue Comey feels like the government’s process "cannot properly vet people."

pomt-08009	Says the claims that Texas faces a $27 billion shortfall "are flat-out false."	false	/texas/statements/2011/jan/12/talmadge-heflin/talmadge-heflin-says-claims-state-government-27-bi/	After State Comptroller Susan Combs said Jan. 10 that Texas lawmakers will have $72.2 billion in state revenue to budget for fiscal 2012-13 -- $15 billion less than what the state has budgeted for the two years ending Aug. 31, 2011 -- Talmadge Heflin of the right-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation cautioned against overreaction. Heflin’s same-date "legislative update," headlined "the myth of the $27 billion shortfall," points out that Combs declined to pinpoint a budget shortfall figure. The post by Heflin, a former Texas House member and past chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, closes: "This is not to say that the process of developing a 2012-13 state budget will be a walk in the park. But claims that Texas is $27 billion in the red are flat-out false." Flat-out for real? We wondered because news organizations including the Austin American-Statesman included the $27 billion figure in their analyses of Combs’ forecast. The Statesman’s Jan. 11 news article states: "The comptroller's estimate sets the limit for spending and would put the budget shortfall at $27 billion if the state were to maintain the same level of service in public education, health and human services, prisons and more." Similarly, the San Antonio Express-News quotes Scott McCown, executive director of the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, saying the shortfall is at least $26.8 billion--the difference between Combs’ predicted state income and at least $99 billion in state revenue needed to maintain the current level of services, given the state's growing population and rising costs, including that of health care. The newspaper quotes Rep. Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, saying that a shortfall of at least $27 billion is "in the ballpark" when looking at the money needed to provide the current level of services. In his update, Heflin writes that the $27 billion figure is "premised on the belief that the state should carry forward all current spending and assumptions regarding program growth." He adds that policy advocates touting the figure are simply tallying agencies’ wish lists; his post links to a Legislative Budget Board website compiling requests filed by more than 200 agencies. Heflin’s post continues: "But these requests are almost never fully funded -- even at the start of the budget process -- because they include many unnecessary spending items that appropriators recognize and quickly weed out." Seeking the basis of the $27 billion figure, we contacted McCown, who pointed us to his Jan. 10 statement saying that based solely on requests from several major agencies and expected formula-driven costs of higher education, Texas needs to spend $19.9 billion more in state funds in 2012-13 than what’s budgeted for 2010-11. That would bump the budget to $99 billion, McCown said, which exceeds Combs’ estimate of available state revenue by $27 billion. According to his statement, the center reached the $19.9 billion figure by adding up requested budget increases tied to population and cost growth made by five agencies -- the Texas Education Agency ($9 billion increase), the Texas Health and Human Services Commission ($8.3 billion increase), the Texas Department of Criminal Justice ($730 million increase), the Employees Retirement System ($576 million increase) and Teacher Retirement System of Texas ($908 million increase). It then added increases for public colleges and universities that would be driven by state higher-education funding formulas, McCown’s statement says. All told, the statement says, the selected agencies and education institutions account for 82 percent of state spending. Footnotes to the center’s summary of its calculations indicate that more than $8 billion in the identified education and health and human services funding is needed to replace federal stimulus aid used in the last budget but not expected again this year. Eva DeLuna Castro, the center’s senior budget analyst, said she excluded some of the selected agencies’ requests, such as one for staffing a health center for prisoners, that don’t reflect what the agencies are already doing. In an interview, McCown said those who question the shortfall "are not being honest. They’re trying to confuse the public . . . We’re short $27 billion to do what we’re doing. Obviously, if you don’t want to do what we’re doing, then we’re not short." According to the Statesman, state leaders including GOP Gov. Rick Perry are dismissive of needing to cover $27 billion in additional spending. Perry said in a Jan. 10 interview with the newspaper: "I'll let somebody else talk about that, because that's not reality." In the end, we suppose, the final budget and its impact will determine reality. But that’s down the road. For now, what legislative budget-writers have to go on are what they always have early in the process: State agencies’ self-reported funding needs. And for now, it looks like the cost to continue services as they are exceeds the $27 billion suggested by the CPPP's analysis, which did not consider all agency requests. Finally, we followed up with Heflin, who said in an interview that he composed his post before reading McCown’s numerical analysis. Heflin said he has no quibble with its methodology, but disputes the premise that lawmakers should maintain existing services. When "you know you don’t have the money, you know you have to trim back," Heflin said. He followed up via e-mail: "There was never a possibility of funding a current-services’ budget plus wish lists and growth." Our sense: Heflin’s statement rejects a shortfall calculation that seems a reasonable way to estimate how much it would cost Texas to keep up services. We rate the statement False.

pomt-02933	"This is the year Florida becomes a majority minority state."	false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/31/alan-grayson/florida-will-become-majority-minority-alan-grayson/	U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, drew fire for comparing the tea party to the Ku Klux Klan in a fundraising email just days before the Florida Democratic Party’s big conference in Orlando. At the conference, he continued his theme of portraying the GOP as "bigots" when he read a mock Republican Party conference agenda that included raising the Confederate flag. A less publicized part of his speech, though, seemed worth of a fact-check, and on a less incendiary topic: the changing demographics of Florida voters. "We go into an election next year with something very important happening in Florida this year. This is the year that Florida becomes a majority minority state, joining New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, California and Hawaii. Why is that important? Because it tells us what our strategy as the Democratic Party will be for next year ..." Grayson then continued to talk about how the Democratic Party represents a variety of people, including blacks and Spanish-speakers, and that the party will tap into that diversity during the 2014 election. The proportion of minorities in Florida -- particularly Hispanics -- is a key issue for both major political parties as they prepare for the 2014 election battle when Republican Gov. Rick Scott is on the ballot. Is Florida on track to become majority minority in 2014? A look at census data In this context, "majority minority" would mean that non-Hispanic whites represent less than half the population, while minorities -- blacks, Hispanics and other groups -- add up to more than half. We interviewed demographers, both in Florida and nationally, and all of them disputed Grayson’s claim. The evidence that Grayson’s office sent us from the census only showed that the percentage of non-Hispanic whites in Florida has shrunk since 2000. We looked up the most recent data on the census website, and it showed that 11 million non-Hispanic whites accounted for about 57 percent of Florida’s overall 19.3 million population, as of July 2012. So in Florida, minorities are about 43 percent. Census data showed a few states were majority-minority: Hawaii (77.2 percent minority), California (60.6 percent), New Mexico (60.2 percent) and Texas (55.5 percent). Census data and other evidence cited by Grayson’s office didn’t prove that the state is about to flip to majority-minority next year. But his staff told us they think Florida is clearly on its way. "The crossover point will take place earlier than projected, possibly as early as this year," said Grayson spokeswoman Lauren Doney. "We readily acknowledge that other people may view the data and reach different conclusions; only time will tell." University of Florida projections The census doesn’t make projections for changing demographics. For that, we turned to a 2013 study from the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Using the paper’s statewide projections, we looked at the non-Hispanic white population percentage through 2040. The percentage started with 57 percent in 2015 and then drops a percentage point or two every five years, until it hits virtually break-even in 2040. "We project the proportion of the population that is non-Hispanic white to decrease over time, reaching 50.2 percent by 2040," Stefan Rayer, a research demographer, who co-authored the report with Stanley Smith, told PolitiFact Florida. It’s highly unlikely that the percentage of non-Hispanic whites would drop from 57 percent to 50 percent by next year, agreed University of Miami demographer Ira Sheskin. "In fact, impossible," Sheskin wrote in an email. Florida’s future Hispanic population depends on a variety of factors that make projections -- particularly out to 2040 -- challenging. Those factors include whether immigration reform occurs, and the health of the economy in Florida, the nation and Latin America. "In the case of Florida -- particularly Miami -- Miami attracted a lot of immigrants recently from Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil," said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic Research for Pew Research Center. That’s a relatively recent phenomenon compared to the earlier waves of immigrants from Cuba, he said. "Whether or not immigration reform happens -- whatever the push and pull factors are in Latin America -- that can all shape what happens in Florida." Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew, pointed to Census data that shows that the percentage of minority residents in Florida has grown slowly in the past couple of years -- from 42 percent in July 2010 to 43 percent in July 2012. If the share of minority residents were to increase at half a percentage point per year -- the average of the last two years -- "it would take 14 years for Florida to become less than 50 percent white, not Hispanic." Our ruling Grayson said, "This is the year Florida becomes a majority minority state." The state is inching closer to majority-minority status, but in 2012, non-Hispanic whites still accounted for about 57 percent of Florida’s population. Based on our research and interviews with the experts, it’s highly unlikely -- one expert said impossible -- that Florida will become minority-majority next year. It’s possible that it may not happen for many more years. A University of Florida study projects it won’t happen before 2040. There are a variety of factors that could speed up or slow down that process, but we found no evidence to support Grayson’s claim that Florida will become majority-minority this year. We rate this claim False.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2013-10-31T14:03:05	2013-10-26	['None']
pomt-01043	"The right to vote in this country has never been intrinsically tied to citizenship."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/jan/25/ron-hayduk/professor-says-right-vote-us-has-never-been-intrin/	Extending voting rights to non-citizens is a hot topic from Burlington, Vt., to New York City to San Francisco. Supporters say allowing non-citizens to vote would give members of the community, including large numbers who pay taxes and own property, a voice in local political affairs. Opponents argue that extending voting privileges to immigrants would demean the value of citizenship and effectively disenfranchise legitimate citizen voters by diluting their vote. Ron Hayduk, a political science professor at Queens College, City University of New York, supported expanding voting rights in a commentary "Noncitizens voting? It’s only fair," published Jan. 1, 2015, in The Providence Journal. Hayduk helped found the Coalition to Expand Voting Rights, a group that supports extending voting rights to legal immigrants in New York City. A movement is afoot there and elsewhere to allow non-citizens to vote and to serve on local boards. A handful of cities and towns nationwide already allow immigrants who have legal residency status to vote in local matters. In stating his case, Hayduk made this provocative statement: "But what most don’t know is that the right to vote in this country has never been intrinsically tied to citizenship." When we asked him for his evidence, he referred us to "Legal Aliens, Local Citizens: The Historical Constitutional, and Theoretical Meanings of Alien Suffrage," a law review article by Jamin Raskin, professor of law at Washington College of Law at American University. In addition, Hayduk cited historical research he and a few other historians and political scientists had done. We read Raskin’s article, which was published in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review in 1993; seeking a range of views, we also reached out to eight experts in the field of voting rights. In his article, Raskin defined a citizen as "an inhabitant of a city or town or a member of a state." His piece traced American suffrage throughout history, noting that at various points non-citizens voted in more than 22 states. "It is true that in the 18th and 19th centuries lots of people who were not United States citizens were voting at every level of government," Raskin said in an interview. It is also true that not every citizen could vote during that period, namely women, children and free black men. (Hayduk’s research pushed the number of states and territories that extended voting privileges to non-citizens to 40. Rhode Island had no citizenship requirement to vote from 1762 to 1842.) According to Raskin, non-citizen voting played an important part in the building of America until it was undone by "xenophobic nationalism" following World War I. After the war, many states enacted laws to restrict voting rights. Since 1926, no state has allowed non-citizens to vote in state or federal elections. Rogers M. Smith, associate dean of social sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that during much of the mid-to late-19th century, Western states, in particular, allowed resident aliens who indicated they had applied for citizenship to vote, a policy aimed at encouraging European immigrants to move west. Like Raskin, Smith also noted that being a citizen didn’t guarantee the right to vote. He cited a Supreme Court ruling from 1875 that concluded that though women were citizens, they still couldn’t vote. (Women finally won the right to vote in 1920 through the passage of the 19th Amendment.) "Being a citizen didn’t give you voting rights," said Alexander Keyssar, professor of history and social policy at Harvard University. Robert Richie, executive director of FairVote, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that advocates electoral reform, emphasized that for decades, black Americans were not allowed to vote, despite being citizens. In addition, voting in America was limited to white male property owners, excluding scores of adult men. Children, too, are examples of citizens who don’t have the right to vote. "There’s not a connection between citizenship and suffrage," Richie said. Ultimately, of course, women, African Americans, and Native Americans gained the right to vote. We also contacted Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, for his take on Hayduk’s statement. "Citizenship has, in fact, been viewed by many as a requirement of voting," Spakovsky said in an email interview. "But there is no uniform answer because your eligibility to vote was determined by the states and territories – setting the qualifications for voting is a power handed to the states by the U.S. Constitution." And over our history, he said, states varied greatly on whom they allowed to vote. Under the Constitution, eligibility to vote in federal elections largely was left to states laws defining who gets to vote in state elections, according to Smith, of the University of Pennsylvania. Social movements over the years, however, brought about voting reforms that expanded access to the ballot for women, non-whites, non-Protestants, and the poor. In 1971, the voting age was lowered to 18 following Vietnam War protests. In the mid-1990s, Congress enacted laws making it a federal crime to knowingly register and vote in federal elections by falsely claiming to be a citizen. In the past two decades, several communities have granted non-citizens the right to vote in local elections, including a half-dozen towns in Maryland. Chicago allows non-citizen parents of school children to vote in school board elections. And several Massachusetts communities have moved toward so-called "resident" voting, according to Hayduk. New York City, too, is poised to take up legislation that would allow non-citizens who are in the country legally to vote in local elections. With more than 22 million non-citizens now living in America, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, both proponents and objectors to such policies say a lot could be at stake. Our ruling Professor Ron Hayduk said "the right to vote in this country has never been intrinsically tied to citizenship." We look to the words he used in making that statement. Intrinsic is defined as "of or relating to the essential nature of a thing" and never means, well, never. It’s clear that throughout the history of the United States, citizenship has not always been tied to voting, particularly during the expansion of the West, when non-citizens were allowed to vote. Conversely, at times in our history, citizenship was not tied to voting for those citizens who were women, Native Americans or African Americans. And in many places, citizens who are also felons are currently denied the But over time, voting rights have increasingly been tied to citizenship. Today, citizenship is a requirement for voting in national and state elections. At the municipal level, only a handful of communities allow non-citizens to vote, and only on local issues. Given this evidence, we find that Hayduk overstated his case by inserting the word "never." Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Ron Hayduk	None	None	None	2015-01-25T00:01:00	2015-01-01	['None']

pomt-00767	"Ninety percent of American workers don't own their own business."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/13/rick-santorum/90-american-workers-dont-own-their-own-business-ri/	Rick Santorum, a potential candidate for president in 2016, argues that the Republicans should focus more on people working for businesses than people who own businesses, if only because of simple math. Santorum said Republicans need to concentrate more on the concerns of ordinary voters. "I've made the central focus of what I've been out talking about the fact that 90 percent of American workers don't own their own business. They're actually working for businesses and that Republicans better have a message that appeals to their place in the world today and their opportunity to rise in society," Santorum said on CBS’s Face the Nation on April 5, 2015. We wanted to know whether Santorum is correct that 90 percent of the American workers do not own their own business. Matthew E. Bynon, a staff member at Santorum’s organization Patriot Voices, sent us a link to a policy brief, "The Causes of Racial Disparities in Business Performance," from the National Poverty Center. This 2008 article mentions in its introduction, "Roughly 1 in 10 workers owns a business," which are "13 million business owners." The report based its numbers on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The most recent census report Survey of Business Owners estimated the number of business owners as 20.4 million in 2007. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the labor force in 2007 was about 153 million people. So there were around 13.3 percent business owners, a little higher than Santorum’s source. A new census survey about business owners will be released in May. The economists of the Small Business Administration used more recent data from 2012 and found a slightly higher percentage of business owners as well. The SBA found that about 16 percent of people owned a business, said staff member Miguel Ayala. It’s important to note that the SBA based its 16 percent number on total employment of about 116 million people. If you use the entire labor force, both employed and unemployed, the number drops to 11.8 percent. So the SBA estimates the total of business owners in the United States to be 18.3 million people. The census found out that there were 20.4 million business owners back in 2007. We couldn’t help noticing that the data Santorum referred to does not match, because it says 13 million. So we asked Robert W. Fairlie, economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, for an explanation. Fairlie was one of the authors who wrote the study "Black-, Asian-, and White-Owned Businesses in the United States," which was used for the NPC policy brief Santorum referred to. Fairlie said there are different ways to define small business owners. Not all people who own a business do it as their main source of employment. "The 20.4 million businesses represents all business entities and not necessarily what someone does for their main job activity. If someone gets a little self-employment income, but mainly works as a wage or salary worker, then they would not get included in the 13 million number of business owners, but would get included in the 20.4 million definition," Fairlie said in an email. Our ruling Santorum said 90 percent of people don’t own their own business. Several sources show that Santorum’s number is close. However, there are different ways to count whether someone owns a business or not, and so the percentages are approximate. Overall, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-04216	"We have more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/nov/30/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-more-people-us-work-gr/	Supporters of environmentally compatible technology have been arguing of late that "going green" doesn’t only help preserve the environment, it adds to the nation’s employment rate. One of them is U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, who, in an interview published in The Providence Journal Nov. 18, said, "We have more people working in clean and green energy than in oil and gas in this country." To some, the green economy evokes images of people weaving rugs out of palm fronds, or growing their own vegetables. But an increasing number of studies are showing that developing environmentally sensitive products and services has become a growing and technologically sophisticated segment of the economy. But more jobs than Big Oil? We decided to drill down and see if Whitehouse was right. Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson said the senator’s source was a July 2011 report, "Sizing the Clean Economy," by the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, and the Battelle Technology Partnership Practice, a consulting firm that advises companies and governments on how to use new technologies to improve their operations. The study sought to calculate how many companies in the United States are involved in so-called green industries, how many people they employ and how much of an impact the field has on the national economy. In a summary of the report, Brookings said, "the clean economy, which employs some 2.7 million workers, encompasses a significant number of jobs in establishments spread across a diverse group of industries. Though modest in size, the clean economy employs more workers than the fossil fuel industry …" Brookings pegged the number of fossil fuel jobs at 2.4 million. The report noted that the "clean economy" is an emerging concept that can mean different things to different people. The Brookings report said it focused on firms that either sold products or performed services that provided a definable environmental benefit, such as companies that clean up hazardous waste or manufacture solar panels. "No effort was made here to count companies that adopt internal environmental goals, reform their processes to make them more environmentally responsible or even contribute to general public knowledge about environmental issues," the report said. "This study measures only employment in establishments that directly produce goods and services with environmental benefits." The survey began by taking an analysis from Dun & Bradstreet, which has developed a system to classify businesses on the basis of what they do or produce. Added to that database were similar lists developed the Pew Charitable Trust and the University of California at Berkeley. Brookings researchers then examined other sources, such as industry association membership lists, patent applications, lists of companies receiving grants, to refine the roster. It was a net that caught a wide swath of businesses, ranging from organic food farming to forestry, manufacturers of fuel cells and other types of energy conservation technology to mass transit, air and water purification to trash disposal to geothermal wind and solar power equipment manufacturers. Add up the employees in those businesses, the Brookings report said, and you get 2.7 million. In addition, a 2011 analysis by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics found that "businesses that produce goods and services that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources" accounted for 3.1 million jobs. But what about the other number in the comparison -- the number of employees in the fossil-fuel industry. Because that industry has been around for years, it has been widely studied and classified. Brookings got its 2.4 million number of oil industry jobs from a study by Moody’s Analytics, which counted jobs directly related to producing fossil-fuel based energy, and distributors and transporters, such as gas station employees. Now, if you watch any television these days, you’ve no doubt seen a commercial from the American Petroleum Institute that boasts of 9.2 million American jobs that are supported by the U.S. oil industry. That’s nearly four times the Brookings’ claim. But according to Petroleum Institute’s website, that includes not only people who work in the oil industry, but in industries that depend on petroleum to function. For example, because airlines need fuel to fly their jets, the Petroleum Institute counted pilots, flight attendants and ground crews as oil-related jobs. Counting only jobs directly connected to producing and distributing oil and natural gas, the Petroleum Institute came up with 2.2 million jobs -- 200,000 fewer than the Brookings count. Our ruling Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said more people in the United States work in green energy than in the petroleum industry. Whitehouse’s statement was based on a rigorous study by the Brookings Institution. A similar analysis by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics found the number to be even greater. We rate his claim True.	None	Sheldon Whitehouse	None	None	None	2012-11-30T00:02:00	2012-11-18	['None']

pomt-11940	"Under his leadership, Tallahassee reduced its carbon intensity by roughly 40 percent."	false	/florida/statements/2017/oct/12/andrew-gillum/gillum-campaign-changes-website-after-touting-fals/	Editor's note: This fact-check was updated at 5:35 p.m. to reflect a 2015 report about the city's electric use. The update does not affect the rating. For months on his campaign website, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum took responsibility for shaving Tallahassee’s carbon footprint in his short time as mayor. "Under his leadership, Tallahassee reduced its carbon intensity by roughly 40 percent," a post under the environmental issues page said. We wondered how Gillum accomplished this eye-popping statistic in just three years. But if you check the website now, you won’t find that claim. The Gillum campaign rolled back the talking point after PolitiFact Florida started looking into it, replacing it with a broader talking point that still leaves some questions unanswered. There is no evidence that supported a carbon cut of 40 percent under Gillum’s watch. In reality, the city has seen an estimated reduction in carbon emissions over the course of two decades. Gillum exaggerates role in carbon reduction City of Tallahassee officials collect data on carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon (in terms of weight) emitted per unit of energy consumed. The city, which provides electric service to residents, keeps track of how much electricity is produced and monitors what’s "coming out of the smokestacks" at power plants to figure out the carbon intensity each year, said John Powell, Tallahassee environmental services and facilities director. Under federal law, the city is required to report its findings on an annual basis. Data from the city includes the amount of carbon measured in tons and the net electric load. The net electric load, or the NEL, is the amount of energy produced plus the energy purchased off the grid and minus what the city sells to the grid for use outside of their system. The data shows that the carbon intensity has dropped around 40 percent since 1990. The decline has not been consistent, but has decreased overall. "We’ve implemented more efficient utilities and switched to cleaner fuels over the last two and half decades," Powell said. "We really have seen reduction in carbon intensity over that time." Susan Glickman, the Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a nonprofit advocate for sustainable energy policy, said there are other factors that could lead to a reduction in carbon emissions. For example, jobs in the coal industry have been declining since 1985. Because of this, a lot of utilities use more natural gas than coal, which is cleaner and cheaper. In addition, despite population gains, energy demand has gone down as appliances have become more efficient. The 2008 recession led to less energy being used. Gillum’s campaign changed the original claim on the website rather than defend it. "You brought it to our attention and we wanted to make sure it was accurate, so we made the change when you reached out," said campaign spokesman Geoff Burgan said. "We’re trying to get people the accurate information they need." The updated post includes more nuance about the decrease in carbon intensity from initiatives Gillum has enacted as mayor since 2014. "Over the last two decades,Tallahassee has reduced its carbon emission intensity by 40 percent, and under his leadership, has reduced the carbon footprint of electricity users in the city by 20 percent. The Mayor has worked both as Mayor and City Commissioner to implement and improve programs like free residential and commercial audits, low interest energy loans, and community outreach programs, as well (as) breaking ground on the new 120 acre solar farm that will triple the City’s solar energy capacity." We looked for information to support the modified claim that under Gillum’s leadership, Tallahassee’s carbon footprint really decreased by 20 percent. We didn’t find much to illuminate that claim before we originally published this check. After publication (and repeated queries to Gillum’s spokespersons), the mayor’s community relations coordinator emailed PolitiFact a 2015 document that said electricity consumption in the city had dropped over a 10-year period ending in 2013, before Gillum became mayor. The statistic was included in a report about the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed Clean Power Plan pushed by the Obama administration. "For the ten year period ending in 2013, the City’s residential customers experienced an estimated 21 percent reduction in the average electricity consumption," reads the 2015 report commissioned by the city. That overlaps with Gillum’s time as a city commissioner from 2003-14. (Tallahassee’s city commission is made up of four commissioners and the mayor. Every year, the commissioners and the mayor select a mayor pro-tempore.) So even though the city reduced its electricity use during that time, the drop can not be credited to Gillum. Further, recent data from the city shows that electricity consumption has gone down .1 percent from 2014-16, and the amount of carbon dioxide released has actually gone up 4 percent. It’s worth noting that Gillum has supported efforts to make the city greener. The most notable example happened in May when Tallahassee leaders, including Gillum, broke ground on a 120-acre solar farm located on Tallahassee International Airport land. The solar farm is expected to be completed by November 2017 and generate 20 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 3,400 homes, or 2 percent of the city’s current capacity. Our ruling A post on Gillum’s campaign website said, "Under his leadership, Tallahassee reduced its carbon intensity by roughly 40 percent." That claim has since been removed and replaced with a series of different claims. That’s because there’s nothing to support a carbon reduction of that size in his time as mayor, or on the city commission. In reality, the cut has taken place over the course of two decades and has dropped for a variety of reasons outside of Gillum’s control. We rate the statement False.

pomt-05595	"We've had the same leadership in the Travis County DA's office for 30 years."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/mar/30/charlie-baird/charlie-baird-says-travis-county-office-has-had-sa/	Charlie Baird, the former district and Court of Criminal Appeals judge challenging Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg in the May 29, 2012, Democratic primary, vows to bring a freshness to the local office responsible for prosecuting felony cases in the county. A Baird leaflet we spotted in early March says: ""We've had the same leadership in the Travis County DA's office for 30 years." Is that so? We recall that Lehmberg took office as district attorney about three years ago. So, how does Baird get to his 30 years of the office being under the same leadership? In an interview, Baird told us Lehmberg started working for the Travis County district attorney’s office before Ronnie Earle won his first term as DA in the 1970s. Baird also specified about 10 of Lehmberg’s deputies or section chiefs who he said had been with the office for an "extraordinarily long time." A day later, Baird called back to say that his leaflet statement was based only on the tenures of Earle and Lehmberg -- and not time served by any longstanding deputies. All righty, let’s count. Earle became the district attorney in 1977, the Austin American-Statesman noted in a December 2007 news article on his decision not to run again in 2008. According to Lehmberg’s biographical entry on the office’s website, she left private law practice to join the DA’s office in 1976. The entry continues: "Rosemary began her career with the district attorney working with the Grand Jury and then as a trial attorney in the 167th District Court, presided over by Judge Tom Blackwell. She later became chief of that court and then the chief of the Trial Division. She has served as the chief of the Career Criminal, Major Crimes and Public Integrity Divisions." The entry continues: "In 1988, Rosemary became director of the Family Justice Division. While director, she was a founder of the Travis County Children's Advocacy Center, now the Center for Child Protection... Rosemary served as First Assistant District Attorney from 1997 until 2009, when she was elected District Attorney. She took office in January 2009, the first woman district attorney in Travis County history." Our ruling The Travis County DA’s office had two elected leaders over 35 years, from 1977 through 2011. Earle was the district attorney for 32 of those years, leaving office after voters elected Lehmberg, who earlier held several leadership roles under Earle and, significantly, was his first assistant for a dozen years. Counting her time as the first assistant district attorney, it’s fair to say Lehmberg has been a key leader of the office for 15 years. However, Earle -- who is no longer there -- was the office’s leader most of the leaflet’s proclaimed 30 years. We rate Baird’s claim as Mostly False.

pomt-09729	"Husbands rarely beat up their wives. Single women get beaten up more."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/22/ann-coulter/coulter-says-husbands-rarely-beat-their-wives/	On his Fox News show, commentator Sean Hannity defended Rush Limbaugh, who was dumped by business partners bidding to buy the St. Louis Rams due to controversy about racial comments Limbaugh has made. Hannity brought on conservative pundit Ann Coulter, who argued the NFL has long been "easily very spooked by crazy left-wing hoaxes." "You'll remember a few years ago the loopiest hoax of all, the claim that men beat up their wives more on Super Bowl Sunday," Coulter said. She noted that in 1993, the NFL ran a public service announcement about domestic violence before the Super Bowl after some women's groups claimed violence against women spiked on Super Bowl Sunday. "The NFL not only believed it, and it was completely a fraud and completely insane," Coulter said. "The safest people in the world ... are married women." "Husbands rarely beat up their wives," Coulter told Hannity. "Single women get beaten up more." The popular myth about increased domestic violence on Super Bowl Sundays turned out to be based on extremely thin, localized data and was largely, and famously, debunked in a Washington Post story, "Debunking the 'Day of Dread' for Women; Data Lacking for Claim of Domestic Violence Surge After Super Bowl," written by Ken Ringle and published on the day of that 1993 Super Bowl game. So Coulter was on firm ground there. But we were curious whether she was right about her claim that "husbands rarely beat up their wives. Single women get beaten up more." Coulter goes into this subject in a little more detail in her book, Guilty: Liberal 'Victims' and Their Assault on America. The gist of the narrative is that liberals have created all kinds of "victim" myths to advance their agenda. In the second chapter, "Victim of Crime? Thank a Single Mother," Coulter takes aim at a 1994 Time magazine article written by Barbara Ehrenreich. The article claims that, "for a woman, home is, statistically speaking, the most dangerous place to be," but Coulter calls that "crazy wrong." Coulter leaves off Ehrenreich's next sentence, "Her worst enemies and potential killers are not strangers but lovers, husbands and those who claimed to love her once." Remember that last line as we get to the statistics. But first, here's how Coulter lays out her case in her book: "According to the U.S. Department of Justice crime statistics, domestic abuse is virtually nonexistent for married women living with their husbands. From 1993 to 2005, the number of married women victimized by their husbands ranged from 0.9 to 3.2 per 1,000. Domestic violence was about 40 times more likely among divorced or separated women, ranging from 37.7 to 118.5 per 1,000. Even never-married women were more than twice as likely to be victims of domestic abuse as married women. Evidently, the safest place for a woman to be is at home with her husband." The numbers cited by Coulter come from the Department of Justice's Bureau of Statistics report, "Intimate Partner Violence in the United States." The survey found that "on average from 2001 to 2005, both females and males who were separated or divorced had the greatest risk of nonfatal intimate partner violence while persons who were married or widowed reported the lowest risk of violence." Between 2001 and 2005, 1.2 out of 1,000 married women reported physical abuse by an "intimate partner" (in this case, their husband), versus 5.5 out of 1,000 among women who never married. In short, Coulter cites the numbers accurately. But she left out some important qualifiers included in the survey's fine print. A page about the survey's methodology states: "Caution is warranted when interpreting intimate partner violence and marital status in the (survey) because marital status may be related to a respondent's willingness or ability to disclose violence by an intimate partner. For example, a married woman may not view, may not wish to view, or may be unable to report the behavior of her partner as violent or criminal. That same woman, if separated or divorced, may view or may be able to report the same behavior as violent." In other words, a woman who is still married to an abusive husband may be less likely to report the abuse than a woman who has since divorced or separated from their spouse. In addition, the survey notes, "Marital status is based on the respondent's situation at the time of the interview, not necessarily at the time of the victimization. The survey is not able to determine whether a victim's marital status changed between the victimization and the interview, not necessarily at the time of the victimization." It stands to reason that at least some married women who reported physical abuse by their husband might have later gotten divorced or separated. Coulter also leaves out the Department of Justice statistics on homicides committed by a person "intimate" with the victim. Historically, most "intimate" homicides involved spouses (though in recent years, the number of deaths by boyfriends and girlfriends was about the same). Coulter accurately cites figures from the Department of Justice study on violence against women, but she draws conclusions that the authors of the study specifically caution against. And that's because women may be a lot less likely to report violence by someone they are still married to, and living with. And so we rate Coulter's claim Half True.

pomt-11815	"When we came into office, we saw that Missouri had 113,000 regulations. That’s more than 7.5 million words; it’s 40 dictionaries worth of regulations."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/nov/15/eric-greitens/greitens-makes-mostly-accurate-claims-about-missou/	In a Facebook post, Gov. Eric Greitens relayed the story of a small-business owner from Bolivar, Missouri. His business was forced to pay $1,500 a year for landline phones due to an outdated state regulation. "When we came into office, we saw that Missouri had 113,000 regulations," Greitens wrote in the post. "That’s more than 7.5 million words; it’s 40 dictionaries worth of regulations." The purpose of Greitens’ post was to launch NoMORedTape.com, his website that allows Missourians to crowdsource comments on laws and rules. On the site, constituents can voice their displeasure with any government regulations disrupting their everyday lives. Its goal is to remove unnecessary regulations, and keep rules that benefit Missourians. Forty dictionaries of regulations seems excessive. Let’s see how close Greitens’ claim is to reality. Regulations vs. statutes When the Missouri General Assembly passes a statute, its role in the lawmaking process is done. Now, to enforce the laws, that’s up to agencies in the executive branch. Regulations provide detail to statutes. According to Maura Browning, director of communications for the Secretary of State’s office, individual agencies have their own set of rules for creating regulations. Once they follow their process for making a regulation, it becomes part of the Code of State Regulations. There are 22 separate titles in the code, many with dozens of chapters under multiple divisions. These encompass the 113,000 regulations Greitens was talking about in his post. Title 4, the Department of Economic Development, alone has 369 chapters. When you go to the No MO Red Tape website, a George Mason University study pops up explaining where the large number came from. The university used a tool it developed called StateReg data, an algorithm that reads large regulatory documents. It processes words like "shall," "must," "may not," "prohibited," and "required" to indicate where there are legal restrictions or obligations in the Missouri Code of State Regulations. That tool concluded that Missouri has 113,112 regulations. "It would take an individual 418 hours, or 10 weeks, to read the entire CRS," the study said. Why that matters Greitens’ main goal with the No MO Red Tape website is to allow small businesses to thrive without interference from the government. Browning pointed out that regulations also restrict local governments, school boards, counties and other local entities. As of Oct. 31, Missouri citizens had submitted 4,226 commentsto No MO Red Tape for various regulations. Eighty-nine percent of the comments criticized regulations. Most complaints targeted the Agriculture Department, which received 2,175 comments. Conservation was next with 658, then Public Safety with 236 comments. Finally, the Health and Senior Services department received 201 comments. Before the website was established, constituents always had the option to complain to elected officials, said Lael Keiser, an MU political science professor. That’s part of the basic relationship between representatives and who they represent. No MO Red Tape just makes commenting more accessible. The governor’s goal is to reduce regulations. One way he could do that is through appointing new heads to the state’s agencies, Keiser said. Assuming the appointees share the governor’s view of less government interference, they’ll review the statutes and determine which regulations to throw out. You can view the comments constituents made on specific regulations here. How many words are in a dictionary? So how does 7.5 million words of regulations stack up in dictionaries? Greitens claimed the regulations would fill 40 dictionaries. That allots roughly 187,500 words per dictionary. We got no response from Merriam-Webster in our quest to find a definite number of words in one of its dictionaries. The Oxford English Dictionary’s fact page says the second edition’s entire text had 59 million words in just 336 pages. This figure dwarves the number Greitens used, but his office never clarified which dictionaries they were referring to. They also didn’t specify if "words" meant individual entries in the dictionary, or every word on the page. Our ruling In a Facebook post, Greitens said, "When we came into office, we saw that Missouri had 113,000 regulations. That’s more than 7.5 million words; it’s 40 dictionaries worth of regulations." The word count of the Oxford dictionary — 59 million — blows Greitens’ estimate of the regulations’ word count out of the water. We didn’t get a response from the governor’s office, so it’s unclear which dictionary he referred to, and whether "words" meant every word on the page or individual entries. Still, his point is valid: The Missouri Code of State Regulations is a huge document capable of filling many dictionaries. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-12841	The HIV virus has been "detected in Walmart bananas after 10 year old boy contracts the virus."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/06/cnnews3com/fake-news-claims-walmart-bananas-have-hiv-virus-ar/	Fake news is bananas by nature, but one particularly slippery claim is actually about bananas said to be infected with HIV. "HIV virus detected in Walmart bananas after 10 year old boy contracts the virus," reads the headline on a post we first saw on Feb. 6, 2017, from a website called CNNews3.com. Facebook users flagged the story as part of the social media platform’s efforts to stamp out fabricated news stories. The fake story, which is undated, said eight children younger than 17 had tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS in the month of March (it doesn’t say in which year). All eight allegedly ate bananas purchased at a Tulsa, Okla., Walmart store, with the boy in the headline developing symptoms within a week. The text falsely says Walmart stores are recalling bananas nationwide. The post included a contrived photo (shown above) featuring a red-streaked banana. The screenshot is made to resemble a breaking news alert from CNN. But the website is not the real CNN, and there is no epidemic of HIV-infected bananas. The story is instead a symptom of a long-running online infection of fake news stories about disease-ridden fruit. CNNews3.com is filled with several obviously untrue posts about libidinous gorillas and dubious Big Mac ingredients made up to look like news reports, as well as other headlines that could be construed as real without any indication otherwise. The site’s administrators did not answer our attempts to contact them, but it’s obvious that CNNews3.com is attempting to masquerade as the cable news giant with a similar name. For the record, HIV can’t survive outside the human body, so it’s not possible for the virus to live in a fruit like a banana. The CNNews3.com tries to cast doubt on this by noting researchers were puzzled by the banana-borne infections. Here’s what is true: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website that the virus cannot be spread by food. "Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus," the CDC says. This particular fake story is a variation on an Internet hoax that has been around for a few years. One version said the World Health Organization issued a warning about bananas being infected with HIV in India. Another said the South African government warned its citizens of a similar problem, then took down warnings to avoid a panic. This particular strain of the story can plausibly be traced back to one Facebook user’s photos of red-streaked bananas in November 2015. User Anna Aquavia claimed that her friend’s sister bought bananas in Nebraska that had been injected with HIV-positive blood. The photos are now gone, but you can see them at this Washington Post story. The Post credited the images to a Colorado woman named Amanda Andrys, who said Del Monte told her the red streaks were from a bacteria-induced disease called mokillo. Mokillo is more colorfully known as finger-tip rot, and can be a problem for banana growers. The disease doesn’t harm humans, but it does require banana growers to disinfect farming equipment. Once we peeled back the layers on this story, it was obviously a fake.

pomt-12182	"Barack Obama tweets sick attack on John McCain, says he should have died."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/28/blog-posting/fake-tweet-said-obama-hoped-mccain-would-die-brain/	A fake news story that claimed former President Barack Obama tweeted that he wanted U.S. Sen. John McCain to die from a brain tumor originally came from a parody website looking to troll conservatives. The headline on a July 20, 2017, post on DailyThings.world read, "Barack Obama tweets sick attack on John McCain, says he should have died." Facebook users flagged the story here and on NewsFeedHunter.com as being potentially fabricated, in an effort to cut down on fake news. The story included an image of a July 19 tweet from Obama that read, "John McCain is NOT a war hero. If there were any God in heaven, he would have died from that brain tumor." The post said Obama quickly deleted the tweet. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The story came on the heels of the announcement that McCain, R-Ariz., was diagnosed with a brain tumor called a primary glioblastoma. The American Brain Tumor Association said that a 2009 study showed almost 10 percent of patients may potentially live five years or longer. The 80-year-old is considering treatment options. McCain returned to the U.S. Senate for votes on Republican health care reform, most recently casting a deciding vote against a last-ditch "skinny repeal" bill to end the Affordable Care Act. But let’s be clear: This story is completely fake. There was no such tweet for Obama to delete. It was no doubt the product of any number of websites that allow you to create a fake tweet that appears to come from another account. The only thing Obama tweeted on July 19 were words of encouragement for McCain, whom Obama defeated in the 2008 presidential election. "John McCain is an American hero & one of the bravest fighters I've ever known. Cancer doesn't know what it's up against. Give it hell, John," Obama wrote. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com There is no record of another tweet from Obama’s account that day. The fake story originated the same day on OurLandOfTheFree.com, a parody website with hidden registration information. It appears to be affiliated with a network of websites run by liberal trolls who run fake news sites in an attempt to fool conservatives. The footer note on OurLandOfTheFree.com said that the site makes "no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it most definitely is not." It echoes the warning on its About Us page. Our ruling Bloggers wrote, "Barack Obama tweets sick attack on John McCain, says he should have died." The story and the tweet it described appeared on multiple outlets, but sprang from a website devoted to writing absurd stories about liberals in an attempt to fool conservatives. Obama’s only tweet about McCain’s brain cancer was encouraging. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-07-28T15:18:22	2017-07-19	['John_McCain', 'Barack_Obama']

In fact, she’s alive and well, and blithely shooting down Internet hoaxes claiming she was tragically killed in a burglary. The fake news item, which alleges Lewinsky was embroiled in an ongoing affair with former President Bill Clinton until her dying day, contains a photo which purports to show the former White House intern’s lifeless body being wheeled from the murder scene on a stretcher. The item is circulating on at least two satirical websites whose stated mission is to lure unwitting readers, especially conservatives, into mistaking its inflammatory hoaxes for truth. "We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative," reads a disclaimer on Freedom Crossroads, one of the spoof sites. "Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. "Reality is often in the eye of the beholder," it continues. "You won't find any of it here." The website includes a fake quote from a police chief who names the Clintons as possible suspects, in an article penned by fictional Freedom Crossroads Correspondent Louis Leweigh (wink wink). For her part, the real Lewinsky seemed to be having fun with her starring role in a fake news feature. Days after the stories first appeared online, she cheekily signalled proof of life in a Twitter post with a link to an article debunking the fake item. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling A number of fake news writers said former White House intern Monica Lewinsky had been tragically killed in a burglary and named the Clintons as possible suspects.

pomt-12753	During his campaign for president, Donald Trump "committed to honoring states' rights when it comes to marijuana legalization."	true	/california/statements/2017/feb/28/gavin-newsom/true-campaign-trump-said-states-should-decide-lega/	The Trump Administration signaled last week it could crack down on recreational marijuana in states such as California where voters legalized pot last November, marking a possible change from the Obama Administration’s more permissive approach. "There is still a federal law we need to abide by in terms of when it comes to recreational marijuana and other drugs of that nature," White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Feb. 23, 2017. "I do believe that you'll see greater enforcement." The next day, Democratic California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom urged Trump in a letter to follow the hands-off pot approach he claimed Trump had promised during his campaign. "A Quinnipiac poll released yesterday says that 71-percent of US voters (say) that the government should not interfere with states that passed legalized marijuana and during your campaign, you committed to honoring states’ rights when it comes to marijuana legalization," Newsom wrote on Feb. 24, 2017. Newsom also helped write California’s voter-approved ballot measure, Proposition 64, that legalized recreational marijuana last November. He is running for California governor in 2018. We wanted to know whether Newsom was right: Had Trump "committed" during his campaign to leaving recreational pot up to the states? Our research Newsom’s spokesman pointed to three examples during his campaign where Trump said marijuana legalization should be up to the states. In a television interview on July 29, 2016 with KUSA-TV in Colorado, Trump said: "I wouldn’t do that [using federal authority to shut down recreational marijuana], no … I wouldn’t do that … I think it’s up to the states, yeah. I’m a states person. I think it should be up to the states, absolutely." In a radio interview with WWJ Newsradio 950 in Michigan on March 8, 2016, Trump said "I think it certainly has to be a state — I have not smoked it — it’s got to be a state decision … I do like it, you know, from a medical standpoint … it does do pretty good things. But from the other standpoint, I think that it should be up to the states." At a campaign rally in Sparks, Nevada on Oct. 29, 2015, Trump said: "The marijuana thing is such a big thing. I think medical should happen — right? Don’t we agree? I think so. And then I really believe we should leave it up to the states. It should be a state situation ... but I believe that the legalization of marijuana – other than for medical because I think medical, you know I know people that are very, very sick and for whatever reason the marijuana really helps them - … but in terms of marijuana and legalization, I think that should be a state issue, state-by-state." Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Sparks, Nevada in October 2015 about marijuana legalization. Trump’s comment at the Sparks rally was also recorded in a Washington Post news article at the time with the headline "Trump softens position on marijuana legalization." A different view? Newsom’s spokesman did not include a fourth high-profile example where Trump discussed legal pot, one that somewhat contradicts Trump’s other comments on the topic. In an interview with Trump on Fox News on Feb. 11, 2016, host Bill O’Reilly described Colorado’s experience legalizing pot as leading to "... all of the dealers, all of the pushers are going to Colorado, loading up on the free pot because it’s legal, not free -- legal and then zooming around the country selling it. Does that concern you?" Trump responded saying he favors medical marijuana "100 percent." "But what you are talking about (with recreational marijuana), perhaps not. It's causing a lot of problems out there," Trump added. Trump doesn’t bring up states rights in this interview. But in his subsequent interviews, with the Michigan radio station in March 2016 and the Colorado television station in July 2016, he returns to his line that states should decide the matter. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has strongly opposed marijuana legalization. He told reporters on Feb. 27, 2017 that: "States they can pass the laws they choose. I would just say it does remain a violation of federal law to distribute marijuana throughout any place in the United States, whether a state legalizes it or not." Long before running for president, Trump voiced strong opinions on drug legalization. In April 1990 in an article in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Trump said the United States should legalize drugs and use the money collected to educate the public on the dangers of drug use. "We're losing badly the war on drugs," Trump said at the time, according to the article. "You have to legalize drugs to win that war. You have to take the profit away from these drug czars." Our ruling California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom recently claimed Donald Trump, during his campaign for president, "committed to honoring states' rights when it comes to marijuana legalization." In at least three campaign interviews, Trump said he thought the issue of legalizing marijuana should be left to the states. This wasn’t one of Trump’s high-profile promises like building a wall on the Southern border. And he did not address marijuana in his major campaign speeches. But he did make clear, multiple times, how he felt when asked. In a separate interview on Fox News, Trump expressed concern over legal pot in Colorado. But in two subsequent interviews he returned to his line that the matter should be decided by the states. In the end, Trump’s own words back Newsom’s claim. We rated it True.

pomt-15053	"Twenty-six men named William have been elected to statewide office and only seven women have had the honor."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/sep/28/ruths-list-florida/men-named-william-outnumber-women-florida-politics/	A pro-Democratic group has sent out the call that 2016 is the year Florida voters need to choose a female candidate. Ruth’s List Florida, which supports female political candidates, sent out an email that made its point by offering an unusual comparison: "Did you know that fewer women have been elected to statewide office than men named William?" read the email that reached our desk on Sept. 22, 2015. The email went on, "This isn’t right. More women than men vote in Florida, but 26 men named William have been elected to statewide office and only 7 women have had the honor. We have to fix this in 2016." Is it possible that in Florida’s 170-year history, only seven women have filled statewide office? And did voters pick 26 men named William? Get ready for a state civics lesson. The Williams Ruth’s List did not respond to our repeated inquiries by phone, email and even Twitter about how they came up with their tally, so we don’t know exactly what they counted. What we do know is that things can get considerably convoluted. Depending on whom you count and how, we found 30 men named William -- or possibly more -- who have held statewide office. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they were elected. We’re not going to go through every single one, but if you’d like to see all the ones we found, we’ve provided our list here. Keep in mind that a number of the Williams on our list were appointed to their post, rather than elected, as Ruth's List Florida said. We could confirm 14 different Williams were actually elected to office, although there could be more. While we know some were appointed, historical records for a few simply didn’t give enough detail about how they won office, especially during the state’s early history. Those men certainly could have won via election, but we just can’t tell. If we counted all the unknowns as being elected, that would total 22 Williams. Increasingly in recent years, Florida has moved toward appointments rather than direct elections. The state had six elected cabinet positions until 2003, at which point the roster was whittled to three. To give you a sense of how difficult counting Williams can be, consider Florida’s roster of U.S. senators: Depending on how wide you cast a net, there have been between zero and four Williams in the U.S. Senate. William James Bryan was appointed in 1907 to succeed a man who died, but then died himself less than three months later at age 31. He was succeeded in 1908 by another appointee, William Hall Milton, who served a year and did not run for re-election. Also appointed as a successor to a dead senator was William Luther Hill, who served four months in 1936 before leaving office without running for a full term. Finally, there’s current Sen. Bill Nelson, who has been in office since 2001 and was also state treasurer back when it was an elected position. But Nelson’s full name is Clarence William Nelson. Should we count him as a William just because he goes by Bill? There are other twists, such as two appointed and two elected Supreme Court justices, one of whom went by the middle name Glenn. Also, lieutenant governors are now elected as members of a party ticket, but were elected independently until 1889, so you can add two more Williams there. It’s entirely possible we’re missing some details here, such as a William who was elected state grapefruit juicer or state dog walker or some such. But we will concede that even if the total you come up with isn’t 26, it’s still way more than the number of women we counted. The women We counted eight different women who were actually elected to office, but we had to do some digging to reach that total. The Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University keeps tabs on women in statewide executive elections, providing a list for each state. The school said that in Florida, those women are: Name (Party) Office Years served Pam Bondi (R) Attorney general 2011-present Jennifer Carroll (R) Lieutenant governor 2011-2013 Alex Sink (D) Chief financial officer 2007-2011 Toni Jennings (R) Lieutenant governor 2003-2007 Katherine Harris (R) Secretary of state 1999-2003 Sandra Mortham (R) Secretary of state 1995-1999 Betty Castor (D) Education commissioner 1987-1993 Paula Hawkins (R) U.S. senator 1981-1987 Paula Hawkins (R) Public service commissioner 1973-1979 Mamie Eaton Greene Railroad commissioner 1927-1934 That appears to be nine — with Hawkins, the state’s only female senator, counted once — but remember a couple of points we’ve mentioned before. First is that there are fewer offices available, so some women have been elected to positions no one can seek today. Secretaries of state and education commissioners have been appointed since 2003, when the cabinet was cut in half to three spots. The Florida Public Service Commission chose three members by statewide election until 1979 (three were named William, by the way), but those positions are now appointed, too. Next is the caveat that lieutenant governors are elected on a party ticket, not independently. When Gov. Rick Scott won, Carroll won with him. For argument’s sake, we’ll count that as winning an election, but it’s worth noting the difference. Although she was the first female lieutenant governor, Jennings did not win by election and therefore doesn’t count for our purposes. She was chosen by then-Gov. Jeb Bush to succeed Frank Brogan, and took over in March 2003 right after Bush’s second term began. There have been other women in Florida’s offices, but very few were elected. Dorothy Glisson, for example, doesn’t make this tally even though she was the first woman to serve in a Florida Cabinet position. The longtime elections supervisor was appointed secretary of state by Gov. Reubin Askew in 1974 when her predecessor ran for Senate. And finally, keep in mind that women couldn’t run for office or even vote until 1920, so there are fewer decades from which to compile the list. Greene, who first got her seat as railroad commissioner because her husband died in 1927, became the first woman in Florida to win a state office when she ran for re-election in 1928. It’s hard to discern if a single-digit total, however you count it, means Florida is really lagging behind other states, though. Kathy Kleeman, the communications director at the Rutgers center, said because every state organizes differently, there’s no baseline for everyone to follow. Maine’s governor, for instance, is the state’s only statewide executive position. Georgia and North Dakota, meanwhile, have 13 positions that the center counts on its list. "All of this makes comparing numbers almost meaningless and percentages not a whole lot better," Kleeman said. "Still, seven — or even nine, as we show on our website — isn't very many in all those years, any way you cut it." Our ruling Ruth’s List Florida said that "26 men named William have been elected to statewide office and only seven women have had the honor." Because of changes in state government and elections, plus how officeholders came by their positions, it’s difficult to parse the exact count the group came up with. The total of officials we could confirm were elected and not appointed was 14 Williams (although there could be more) and eight women. That’s off from the numbers in the email, but the gist of the statement is still defensible. There have been many more men named William than women holding major elected offices in Florida.

Roughly every dollar spent by the state is matched by the federal government. During a March 2, 2015, presentation to the Reinventing Medicaid Working Group, the state's secretary for health and human services, Elizabeth Roberts, displayed a slide which said that nearly a third of all state tax dollars goes to Medicaid. "More than 30 cents of every state tax dollar goes to Medicaid," the slide said. It also contained a pie chart in which Medicaid is shown eating up 31.5 percent of those tax dollars. The slide lists the source as the state budget for the 2013 fiscal year. But on March 31, 2015, groups that want to create a single-payer health insurance system in the state challenged that statistic and others being used by the Raimondo administration in its push for Medicaid reform. The Rhode Island chapters of Physicians for a National Health Program and HealthCare Now said the actual percentage isn't 31.5 for fiscal 2013, but closer to 22. We decided to see who was correct. Because Roberts specifically mentioned "state tax dollars," for this fact check, we will only look at general revenue funds raised by the state, not federal funds shared with the state or restricted funds. When we contacted Roberts' office, spokesman Michael Raia said the source of the information was listed incorrectly. The 31.5 percent is based on the current fiscal year of 2015. According to data from the House Finance committee, this year the state is slated to spend $1.084 billion of its unrestricted money on Medicaid. That's 31.5 percent of the $3.445 billion in general revenue funds. (The state budget enacted that year totaled $8.78 billion, including restricted revenue and federal money for Medicaid and other things.) That made us curious. What were the numbers in 2013, the year cited incorrectly by Roberts? The Rhode Island Health Care Association, one of the groups questioning the numbers, referred us to the executive summary of Gov. Lincoln Chafee's budget for the 2015 fiscal year. Page A-5 listed $3.216 billion in general revenue for that year and page 71 of the budget's technical appendix says the Office of Health and Human Services (OHHS) actually received $772 million from the general fund. That would be 24 percent, close to what the critics claimed. But in the 2013 enacted budget, 20 percent of the state's Medicaid money was spent by other departments, including Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals (BHDDH) and the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF). That makes the 24 percent too low. When all of the state’s spending for Medicaid out of its general revenues is accounted for, the percentage comes out to around 31 percent. Our ruling Roberts said more than 30 cents of every state tax dollar goes to Medicaid. She cited a specific percentage of 31.5 percent and said it came from the 2013 fiscal year. It's actually from the 2015 fiscal year. But the percentage from 2013 is very close to that. Roberts may have gotten the source year wrong, but it turns out that either year produces the same result. We rate her statement as True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-07150	If today's economy was rebounding at the rate of the "Reagan recovery," it would have created the equivalent of 25 million new jobs and raised federal revenue by $800 billion a year.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/14/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-touts-scale-reagan-recovery-new-hamp/	During Monday’s Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., moderator John King drilled former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. on one of the most divisive issues on Capitol Hill: taxes on the wealthy. "Mr. Speaker, if you look at a poll in the Boston Globe just the other day, 54 percent of Republican voters in this state say they're willing to have higher taxes on the wealthy to help bring down the deficit. Are they wrong?" the CNN anchor asked. Gingrich responded that the real issue is whether raising taxes on higher-income Americans would create jobs. He then responded with striking claim about the recovery that followed the 1981-1982 recession, for which Gingrich and others credit the president at the time, Ronald Reagan. "The Reagan recovery, which I participated in passing, in seven years created for this current economy the equivalent of 25 million new jobs, raised federal revenue by $800 billion a year in terms of the current economy, and clearly it worked," Gingrich said. "It's a historic fact." Reagan’s signature policy was a cut of the top individual income tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent and the top corporate tax rate from 46 percent to 34 percent. It took effect in phases until fully in place in 1988. The recovery under Reagan was especially strong, but politicians and economists debate whether Reagan’s tax breaks, which were passed by a Democratic-controlled Congress, were the cause. Gingrich is hardly alone among Republicans who have used Reagan’s record to bolster their argument that tax cuts can improve the economy. We checked similar claims by U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois, one of several new House members elected with tea party support. We called a Gingrich spokesman for more information on how the candidate came up with his numbers. He did not give an immediate response. First off, we’ll note that Gingrich was elected to Congress in 1978, so it’s fair to say that he "participated in passing" the Reagan legislative agenda. (King was slightly off about the Boston Globe poll -- it showed 56 percent support for a tax increase, not 54.) We'll address Gingrich's claim in two parts, with the one about jobs first. Job creation statistics come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal agency. To get the net number of jobs created during a given period of time, you subtract the number of jobs held nationally at the starting point from the number of jobs held at the ending point. So the first question is, what are the starting and ending points? Since Gingrich was talking about a "recovery," we figured it would be fair to start the clock at the low point of the jobs picture. We’ve chosen January 1983 as what we think is a reasonable start date, and then picked January 1989 as the closing date, since that’s when Reagan left office. That leaves us with a nice, clean six-year period. Careful readers will note that this is not the seven years that Gingrich suggested. However, we think it’s the best way to measure Gingrich’s underlying point, and as it turns out, it doesn’t alter the outcome much. Using the BLS data, we found that the number of employed Americans grew from almost 89 million in January 1983, the start of the "Reagan recovery," to more than 107 million in January 1989, an increase of 18.2 million or about 20 percent.. But we still need to adjust this figure to fit Gingrich’s description -- that is, the equivalent number of jobs the Reagan-era recovery would have produced for America today. We adjusted the 18.2 million increase in jobs to account for the fact that today's labor force is 31 percent bigger and came up with 24 million jobs -- quite close to the 25 million Gingrich cited in the debate. So score one for Gingrich. What about the money figure? For this, we looked at the historical tables for federal revenue produced by the Office of Management and Budget. We also used the period of 1983 to 1989, though the figures in the OMB table refer to fiscal years rather than calendar years, so the timing is not exact. Between fiscal year 1983 and fiscal year 1989, federal revenue climbed from about $600.6 billion to $991.1 billion. That’s an increase of $390.5 billion over the period. As we did with the jobs number, we’ll adjust this increase to fit the current size of federal receipts. We found that revenue has increased by 2.73 times since the mid-1980s. Adjusting for the increase in revenues since the mid-1980s, it works out to slightly less than $1.1 trillion. But there’s one more step -- Gingrich had said that federal revenues had increased by today’s equivalent of $800 billion per year. So if you divide the $1.1 trillion number by the six years it covered, you get roughly $178 billion per year -- well below the $800 billion figure Gingrich cited. So on tax revenues, the actual amount is far lower than what Gingrich claimed. Where does this leave us? Gingrich got very close on the jobs number, but he was way off on the revenue figure. We’ll call it Half True. UPDATE: After we published our article, Gingrich's camp got back to us. R.C. Hammond, a spokesman, said that "Newt meant over $800 billion over the recovery, not annually." Because misstatements do not protect speakers from a low rating on the Truth-O-Meter, our rating stands.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-06-14T14:35:31	2011-06-13	['Ronald_Reagan']
pomt-08041	The city of Atlanta has $56 million in its reserves.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/04/kasim-reed/numbers-show-support-reeds-claim-about-atlanta-fin/	Federal, state and local leaders are constantly searching for every spare dollar or threatening to raise taxes to keep things running in this sluggish economy. So it surprised us when Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed made this claim when discussing his first-year accomplishments: "When I came in, the reserves of the city of Atlanta were $7.4 million," Reed said in a speech to the YMCA Hungry Club lunch forum on Nov. 30. "As I stand here ... the reserves of the city of Atlanta are in excess of $56 million." How did the city get this done? Are the city's numbers correct? Atlanta, like most governments, has several accounts to manage its finances. The main account the city uses to pay for most services (police, fire, parks and recreation) is called the "general fund." Some city services, such as water and sewer service, are paid through different funds. The general fund, which currently has a budget of about $560 million, is paid for through a combination of property taxes, sales taxes, business licenses, a hotel/motel tax it shares with state government, permits, court fines and other sources. Atlanta's budget year, which the city calls "fiscal year," begins July 1 and ends June 30. For the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2009, the city says it had a reserve fund of about $7.4 million. For the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010, the mayor says the city's general fund reserve is at least $56 million. Some city data show the total is $58 million, which drew Reed some praise from New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman in a Christmas Day column. So how does the city say it got there? It began in June 2009, when the City Council voted 8-7 to put $27 million in its general fund reserve and raised property taxes by about $240 for the average city homeowner. Then-Mayor Shirley Franklin and her staff felt the city eventually needed a rainy day fund of about $100 million to protect the city if the economy falters, in hopes of avoiding what happened in 2008, when Atlanta, after feeling the first ripples of the recession, laid off several hundred employees and cut back a host of services. Skyrocketing employee pension costs, falling revenue from the recession and some bad long-standing budgeting practices were found to be the primary culprits of the financial troubles at City Hall. A key moment in building its reserves took place in the early months of 2009. The Franklin administration was conservative in its estimates of how much it would receive in revenue during fiscal year 2010. It expected scores of property owners to appeal their assessments, said Duriya Farooqui, a top city official under Franklin who is now one of Reed's deputy chief operating officers. Lower assessments typically mean lower property values. Lower property values mean less paid in property taxes, which account for approximately 35 percent of Atlanta's general fund revenue. As a result of the conservative estimates, city officials say revenue was $13 million above expectations. A city spreadsheet for May 2010 offers a further glimpse into the mayor's claim. In addition to showing higher-than-expected revenue, several city agencies spent much less than budgeted. By the end of June, the following departments were under budget: The Police Department, by $4.6 million The Fire Rescue Department, by $1.355 million The Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Department, by $3.85 million General government operations were also down by $7.655 million. In many cases, city officials say some vacant positions were not filled. Atlanta said two departments, Corrections and Public Works, were over budget by a combined $2.6 million. Farooqui said Reed and his staff told department heads on track to spend less than budgeted to end the fiscal year at those lower levels. The city also got help from the federal government. The Obama administration gave Atlanta nearly $5 million in stimulus funds it used for job training, Farooqui said. Atlanta also re-examined its lease agreements and engaged in new spending practices, Farooqui said. By this past June, the end of the city's fiscal year, Atlanta officials reported a general fund balance of $68 million. City officials said they were able to add nearly $12.3 million to the reserve through principal and other interest payments. That includes the $27 million reserve, the higher-than-expected revenue and controlled spending. Under city guidelines, one-quarter of that money must be used for large-scale projects. Subtract that and Atlanta is left with about $51 million. Once you carry the $7 million in the reserve fund from fiscal year 2009, the reserve is about $58 million. City Councilman Howard Shook, chairman of the council's budget committee in 2008 and 2009, said he does not dispute the mayor's math. Shook said the city has tighter fiscal management, largely aided by Atlanta's new (albeit over-budget) Oracle computer system that better tracks spending. The councilman said the painful budget cuts in 2008 and the council's decision to raise property taxes in 2009 helped. "A lot of the most painful medicine was taken before the new administration came in," Shook said. Roger Lusby III, a certified public accountant, looked at some of the city's monthly budget spreadsheets at AJC PolitiFact's request. Lusby said Atlanta's numbers seem accurate, but he wanted to see more information about its reserves, how the city is handling its massive pension liability and how it manages its severance pay. Those and other factors, Lusby said, may give him a better idea of how solid the city's surplus estimate is. Lusby said he would reserve ruling that the city's claim is true until its books are audited by an independent firm, which city officials said is scheduled to be done early this year. "I think [Reed] is doing a good job, but I hope he's working with accurate information," said Lusby, managing partner of the Alpharetta office of Frazier & Deeter, a certified public accounting firm. The spreadsheets show Reed's claim seems on the money. But, as Lusby noted, the city's fiscal year 2010 books haven't been audited. Farooqui said "there is no reason to believe the numbers will change dramatically" after the audit. Since there's additional information that may come from the audit, we reserve the right to change the ruling if there is significant information that shows the city's numbers were on target or incorrect. For now, we'll be a little conservative here and rate Reed's statement as Mostly True.	None	Kasim Reed	None	None	None	2011-01-04T06:00:00	2010-11-30	['None']

pomt-11984	Says "No, I don't benefit, I don't benefit" from his tax proposal.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/28/donald-trump/donald-trumps-dubious-claim-his-tax-plan-wont-bene/	President Donald Trump, the only president in modern history to not release his tax returns (see our fact-check), said he would not personally benefit from his proposed changes to tax law. As he prepared to announce his proposal for a tax overhaul, he had the following exchange with an off-camera reporter. (Here’s the video ): Trump: "My plan is for the working people, and my plan is for jobs." Reporter: "You wouldn't benefit under your tax plan?" Trump: "No, I don't benefit. I don't benefit. In fact, very very strongly, as you see, I think there's very little benefit for people of wealth." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump reiterated that his plan was bad news for wealthy taxpayers like him later in his address in Indianapolis. "They can call me all they want; not going to help," he said Sept. 27, 2017. "I'm doing the right thing and it's not good for me, believe me." Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns makes this difficult to know with certainty. When we inquired, the White House reiterated that Trump would not benefit but did not offer any documentation. PolitiFact’s longstanding policy is that the burden of proof is on the speaker. We won’t back up a speaker’s assertion without evidence. In the absence of that, what is known about Trump’s taxes suggests that his assertion is highly dubious. To date, two portions of Trump’s tax returns have been leaked to the media. One consists of summary pages from state tax returns from 1995, which were sent anonymously to the New York Times in 2016. However, because these are state -- not federal -- tax documents, they don’t shed much light on this claim. The second and more relevant forms are the summary pages from his 2005 federal tax return, which were first reported in March by MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. Experts see three provisions in Trump’s proposal that could potentially benefit him. Scrapping the alternative minimum tax Trump’s tax plan would eliminate the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, which is a calculation that guarantees that certain higher-income taxpayers with large deductions pay at least a minimum amount of tax. "This framework substantially simplifies the tax code by repealing the existing individual AMT," Trump’s proposal says. A line in Trump’s 2005 tax return shows that Trump paid $31,261,179 that year for the AMT. That was a large portion of his total tax bill. Had it not been for the AMT, Trump would have owed only about $5.3 million in federal taxes that year. Even if that was an unusually large year for Trump’s AMT liability, he is precisely the type of taxpayer the provision was designed for -- someone who is wealthy and who takes a lot of deductions. So if the AMT were to remain in place, it would likely be an ongoing tax burden for him. Taxation of "passthrough" income Trump’s plan would lower to 25 percent the tax rate for "small and family owned businesses conducted as sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations." Collectively, these are referred to as "passthrough" income. This policy would represent a reduction from the current top rate of 39.6 percent. (An earlier version of the Trump tax plan envisioned the rate going down all the way to 15 percent.) In his 2005 tax return, Trump listed more than $67 million in income from "rental real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, etc." Even if the proposed changes didn’t affect that entire flow of income, some of it likely would, enabling Trump to keep more of it. An analysis using Trump’s initial 15 percent proposal that was published by the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee said that Trump would save about $28.6 million from the reduction of this "pass-through income" rate. Trump’s potential savings would be smaller -- though still substantial -- under the newer proposal of 25 percent. The estate tax Trump’s proposal also "repeals the death tax," which is what many opponents call the tax officially known as the estate tax. In 2017, estates worth less than $5.49 million are exempt from taxation, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. Above $5.49 million, the estate is generally taxed at 40 percent. Estimates of Trump’s net worth vary; in February, Forbes estimated that it was $3.5 billion. If that’s in the ballpark, then under current law, Trump’s estate could have to pay tax in the vicinity of $1 billion. In any case, since Trump’s estate at his death would almost certainly be worth more than the exemption level of $5.49 million, he would be a good candidate to owe some amount of estate tax, even if it’s not as high as $1 billion. Unlike the proposed changes to the alternative minimum tax and the taxation of "passthrough" income, the elimination of the estate tax would not be a change that Trump or his heirs could take advantage of immediately. Still, if the estate tax were to be eliminated permanently, that would likely offer the Trump family a substantial tax savings down the road. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Referring to his tax proposal, Trump said, "No, I don't benefit. I don't benefit." Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns makes it impossible to quantify exactly how much he would personally benefit from his policy proposals. But what is known about Trump’s past patterns of taxation and his income and wealth holdings strongly suggest that at least three proposed changes -- to the alternative minimum tax, to the tax on "passthrough" income, and to the estate tax -- would benefit Trump or his family either immediately or down the road.

pomt-15361	"Florida has reduced its carbon emissions by 20 percent since 2005."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/jul/07/gus-bilirakis/florida-has-reduced-its-carbon-emissions-20-percen/	Editor’s note: While researching this fact check, Rep. Bilirakis’ office on July 2, 2015, provided us with its research methodology using data through the Environmental Protection Agency’s Air Markets Program Data. Using this database, Bilirakis’ aides showed a 21.82 percent change in carbon dioxide tonnage emitted from Florida power plants between 2005 and 2012. PolitiFact was able to reproduce these results on July 2 when we followed their methodology, obtaining the same database numbers directly from the EPA website. We shared results with numerous sources who agreed the methodology was sound and the results illustrated Bilirakis’ point. We published the check with a Mostly True. Later that day, an EPA contact informed us the 2012 figure used in Bilirakis’ calculation was incorrect. The agency calculated percent change between 2005 and 2012 was 13.87 percent, not 21.82 percent. When we queried the database again, the figure we received was the number the EPA cited. Neither Bilirakis’ aides nor the EPA could explain the discrepancy. An environmental scientist with the EPA said there had not been a revision of the figures since 2013. The 20 percent figure has been used by Bilirakis and other members of the Florida Republican caucus since at least November 2014, although this is the first time PolitiFact has checked it. We are seeking an explanation for this discrepancy and will post findings when we have them. Republicans in Congress recently voted for legislation that would prevent the federal government from implementing new emissions regulations on power plants -- in part, some argue, because utilities are already cutting carbon levels on their own. U.S. Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Palm Harbor, said that HR 2042, known as the Ratepayer Protection Act, would protect states from costly rules that aren’t necessary. The bill would delay the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan, which aims to reduce nationwide carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 30 percent by 2030. The legislation also would allow states to opt out of the reduced emissions requirement. "The EPA’s proposal on this rule has drawn widespread concern," Bilirakis said in a speech on June 24, 2015, before the GOP-majority House passed the legislation along party lines. "It placed a heavier burden on Florida than other states, despite the fact that Florida has reduced its carbon emissions by 20 percent since 2005." Congressional fights over regulations are not new, but we did a double take when Bilirakis said carbon emissions were down 20 percent over the last decade. (A reader sent us his comment and asked us to check it.) We decided to check whether the data fuels his claim. Carbon dating the claim We need to make sure one point is clear: Bilirakis was talking specifically about electricity generating power plants here. That’s important to understand, because the context wasn’t immediately clear to us -- or to some of our sources. The EPA’s new emission goals, which won’t be finalized until August, target power plants for that 30 percent reduction, starting at 2005 levels. The guidelines are part of President Barack Obama’s larger Climate Action Plan to enforce lower levels of air and water pollution. Some states and electricity providers have sued the EPA, saying the new rules are unnecessary and expensive for utilities, and therefore consumers. Enter the House’s Ratepayer Protection Act, which would keep the 30 percent reduction guidelines from going into effect for power plants until the justice system rules whether the EPA plan is legal. Obama has vowed to veto the Ratepayer Protection Act if it passes. A Bilirakis spokesman backed up the 20 percent figure by looking at EPA carbon dioxide emissions data for power plants generating more than 25 megawatts of electricity, which are covered by the EPA threshold for the guidelines. That data showed that between 2005 and 2012, the latest year with complete figures, Florida had reduced its power plant carbon dioxide emissions by 21.8 percent. That seems like a small slice of data, but even experts who were for the stronger emissions regulations told us it’s a valid use of the numbers to back up Bilirakis’ point. Power plants in Florida affected by the Clean Power Plan really have cut carbon dioxide by that much, according to the EPA. Of course, our first reaction to this claim was that all sources of carbon dioxide emissions had receded, which also turns out to be the case, although not at as high a rate. Accounting for cars, commercial and residential use, and a whole range of petroleum products, the U.S. Energy Information Administration says Florida’s overall emissions total have dropped about 15.7 percent in the same time span. The agency told us it’s not hard to imagine the number continuing to drop in subsequent years, but the data doesn’t show a 20 percent decrease. A look at the overall data from the EPA, which is recorded and calculated a little differently, puts the decrease from all sources at about 13.4 percent. What’s driving the downward trend for power plants? Environmental groups point out that there are several causes. Part of the change is because of utilities switching from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas (usage is up 67.6 percent between 2005 and 2012 in Florida) as natural gas prices have fallen. Credit also can go to increased efficiency in everything from air conditioners to washing machines to refrigerators. Some of the new product efficiencies are the result of other regulations, like the federal push to switch to compact fluorescent light bulbs. And while Florida was the second-highest electricity producing state in the country behind Texas in 2014, it still imports power to meet demand. That means if a power plant in another state burns fuel to generate electricity to sell to Florida, those carbon dioxide emissions don’t go against Florida’s total. That may be skewing the use-to-emissions ratio a bit. Finally, critics of the House legislation point out there’s one more caveat to the data Bilirakis cited: There’s no guarantee the state will maintain that drop in carbon dioxide from power plants. "There is nothing to keep these emissions down to their current levels," said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, which opposes the Ratepayer Protection Act. "If natural gas prices went back up, folks would start running coal plants more and emissions would increase -- absent any CO2 emission regulations." Our ruling Bilirakis said, "Florida has reduced its carbon emissions by 20 percent since 2005." It may not be immediately clear from Bilirakis’ speech, but he’s only talking about carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that would be affected by the EPA’s Clean Power Plan. Those are the guidelines that would be put on hold by the bill passed by the House. EPA data show those Florida electricity generators have cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21.8 percent between 2005 and 2012. Overall carbon dioxide emissions from all sources didn’t decrease quite as much, dropping anywhere from 13.4 to 15.7 percent. Environmental groups also warned that the current reductions aren’t guaranteed. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate Bilirakis’ statement Mostly True.

"Believe it or not, this is a shark on the freeway in Houston, Texas. #HurricaneHarvy," read a tweet from @Jeggit on Aug. 28, 2017. The photo appeared to show a shark swimming in the street, as shown from the driver’s seat of a vehicle. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As of this writing, the image had been liked more than 36,000 times and retweeted more than 28,000 times. But it’s a fake image, which appeared to have been first circulated at least as far back as 2011. The photo turned up after Hurricane Irene struck Puerto Rico. It linked to an Aug. 25, 2011, photo on imgur.com showing the big fish swimming alongside what looks like an SUV. Then it came back in 2012, with social media users claiming it was taken in New Jersey during Hurricane Sandy. In 2015, this very same shark had already been spotted in Houston after severe floods. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Then it somehow swam to North Myrtle Beach, S.C., after Hurricane Joaquin later in 2015. So where did this really come from? The PhotoShopped image appeared to have taken the shark from a photo that ran in Africa Geographic in 2005. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com That picture showed a great white shark swimming behind a kayak, and folks on Reddit noticed the similarities back in 2011. Don’t believe this fish tale, because it’s a hoax that has been luring people for years. We rate it Pants On Fire!

pomt-05609	"The (Jackson) plan (for reforming Cleveland schools) lacks any data or methods proven to raise student achievement."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/28/ohio-federation-teachers/ohio-federation-teachers-says-cleveland-reform-pla/	When Mayor Frank Jackson introduced his plan to radically reshape Cleveland public schools, it was almost inevitable that the union representing Cleveland teachers would push back. Condemning the proposal as a crackdown on the collective bargaining rights of teachers akin to last year’s controversial Senate Bill 5, both the Cleveland Teachers Union and the larger group they belong to — the Ohio Federation of Teachers — spoke out. Jackson’s plan would possibly expand the school year or school day, set-up a merit pay for teachers, base layoffs on teacher performance and make getting rid of poor teachers easier. Seniority would no longer be the sole determining factor in layoffs and continuing contracts would end for new teachers and be limited for teachers already in the system. (On March 23, the Cleveland Teachers Union offered Jackson a counter-proposal which his administration is currently studying.) At a state board of education meeting March 12, Gov. John Kasich offered strong support for the Jackson plan. At the same meeting, Ohio Federation of Teachers officials hand-delivered a letter from the union’s new president, Melissa Cropper, to each member of the state board. Cropper’s letter and a news release OFT issued the same day both said the measure does nothing to benefit students and everything to attack teachers. "The plan lacks any data or methods proven to raise student achievement and should not be supported blindly," read Cropper’s statement in part. That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. We decided to study up on Cropper’s charge. First, we turned the Ohio Federation of Teachers officials for supporting evidence. Lisa Zellner, OFT’s director of communications, said the claims stems from the fact that many of the provisions in the plan pertain to the teaching contract. She said the union knows of no empirical studies or data that backs up Jackson’s specific plan. "It’s not about increasing student achievement," Zellner said. "It’s just about going after the teachers, it’s going after the contract." Even provisions that may have some support in educational research — for example, increasing the length of school days or the school year — aren’t spelled out enough in the mayor’s plan to know whether they would be effective or not, she said. Eric Gordon, CEO of the Cleveland Public Schools and the main architect of the Jackson plan, sees things differently. He said the plan is part of a broader strategy of district-wide reform known as the portfolio approach that is being tried in several dozen big-city school districts. And while Gordon conceded "there is no empirical study that shows the portfolio strategy is the one strategy" he said there is some evidence that some of the approaches in the Jackson plan have worked to raise test scores. For example, Gordon mentioned research that has been done by the Center on Reinventing Public Education. The non-profit group recently issued a report on a number of big city school districts trying reforms similar to those in Jackson’s plan. The group’s report looked at Denver schools, where many teachers voluntarily opted for a merit pay system instead of the standard teaching contract. Known as the ProComp program, it ties teacher pay to education levels and offers bonus pay to teachers who work in the toughest schools and whose students score higher on tests. Researchers at the University of Colorado found "significant and positive ProComp effects at both middle and high school for both math and reading, and the effects are larger at high school than middle school." The researchers cautioned, however, that it generally was the more effective teachers who opted into the program. Another approach tried in Colorado — a 2008 law called the Innovation Schools Act — gives school officials who opt into the program greater school autonomy and flexibility in operations and academic decisions. "The innovation schools are experiencing growth in test scores but many were exceeding state averages prior to being innovation schools," said a recent report from researchers who have studied the schools. The Baltimore school district — after working hand in hand with the union — implemented a reworked teacher contract largely based on teacher evaluations and student test scores. That contract only went into effect last year so it’s too soon to say whether it has improved student test scores. The Jackson plan also calls for increased learning time through either longer school days or a longer school year, a hot topic among educational academics. Research on the subject is mixed — a fact Gordon acknowledged. "Well, no one factor in of itself is a magic bullet solution," he said. "You are going to find time studies where it did work and time studies where it didn’t work." In 2005, Massachusetts became the first state to significantly expand learning time. It now has a program in several dozen schools that extended student learning time by about 25 percent. Test scores in those districts have risen by double the rate for English and math when compared to schools with normal hours and five times the rate in science. Additionally, a charter school program known as KIPP (Knowledge is Power Program) has seen results from providing as much as 60 percent more learning time in core subjects. However, additional time doesn’t always mean that student test scores rise. A $100 million effort in Miami schools to extend school hours by one hour and add 10 days to the school calendar hasn’t produced higher student test scores and is largely considered a failure. So where are we left on this issue as the bell rings and PolitiFact class is dismissed? Ohio AFT union head Melissa Cropper said Mayor Frank Jackson’s sweeping plan to improve Cleveland schools "lacks any data or methods proven to raise student achievement" as she labeled the proposal an attack on teachers. For PolitiFact Ohio, a key part of that statement is "lacks any." While the specific approach Jackson mapped out for Cleveland hasn’t been proven, it does clearly contain elements that researchers suggest may work — at least in some cases -- such as merit pay for teachers, greater flexibility for schools in how they go about their business and longer school days or school year. While the teacher federation leader’s statement contains some element of truth — there’s no specific study or data that proves definitively that Jackson’s approach will raise student achievement — it ignores critical facts about the successes that have resulted in some places that have tried some of the elements of Jackson’s plan. Those details could give a listener a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim by the Ohio Federation of Teachers rates Mostly False.

pomt-11641	"First indictment issued in Russian bribery case tied to Obama-era Uranium One deal."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/17/republican-news/no-uranium-one-investigation-has-not-led-indictmen/	Several news websites have reported that the investigation of wrongdoing involving Uranium One and Hillary Clinton bagged its first indictment. Facebook users flagged a post from a site called Republican News as suspicious and possibly fake. The website’s Jan. 13 headline said, "First indictment issued in Russian bribery case tied to Obama-era Uranium One deal." That post echoed similar reporting by the New York Post, which announced "there’s an indictment in the FBI probe of the Uranium One scandal," also on Jan. 13. The next day, The Hill repeated the Post report. There was an indictment, but the Justice Department doesn’t tie it to the Uranium One deal. Instead, the charges come out of a 2014 investigation of an American-based kickback scheme that defrauded millions of dollars from a subsidiary of the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom. The kickback scheme and Rosatom's 2010 purchase of a controlling interest in the Canadian company Uranium One were entirely separate. The kickback plan locked in contracts for an American firm to import Russian uranium. The other deal involved buying Uranium One stock. They involved different Rosatom subsidiaries and different activities. The news reports tied the two together, but none gave details on the connection. "The DOJ handed down an indictment in the Uranium One deal," Republican News said. "THIS is what the media was trying so hard to cover-up." But it provided no evidence. Let’s unpack this. The indictment Mark Lambert is the former co-president of Transport Logistics International, a Maryland company that arranged the transport of nuclear materials to the United States. According to the Jan. 12 indictment, between at least as early as 2009 and 2014, Lambert and his partner funneled money to a Russian official with Tenex, the company in charge of exporting Russian uranium. Through an elaborate kickback scheme, the Maryland firm got the contracts to ship Russian uranium to the United States. Tenex paid handsomely for the firm’s services, and the Maryland firm shared some of the proceeds with the Russian official. In short, Tenex paid for the bribery. Lambert’s indictment on Jan. 12, 2018, was just the most recent step in a long-running case against his company. That investigation made no mention of Uranium One. In 2014, the Justice Department charged Lambert’s business partner, the Russian Tenex official and two others (including the wife of the business partner) with bribery, fraud and money laundering. All told, about $2.1 million ended up in overseas bank accounts controlled by the Russian. For the record, the indictment of the Russian official said the scheme started in 2004. That’s six years before the Uranium One sale was on the table. Lambert’s business partner and the Russian had pled guilty in 2015. The Russian is serving a two-year prison term, and the business partner is awaiting sentencing. A Uranium One refresher In 2010, the Russian nuclear agency Rosatom wanted to become the majority owner of the Canadian firm Uranium One. Uranium One had holdings in the United States, so the deal had to win approval by a number of state and federal agencies. That group included the State Department, then led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Our summary of the case gives plenty of details, but the gist is some of the owners of Uranium One had given millions to the Clinton Foundation. One in particular gave the foundation between $1.3 million and $5.6 million while the sale was under review. On the 2016 campaign trail, candidate Donald Trump cast the donations as a payoff to grease the skids for approval. There is no evidence that Clinton had a hand in the vetting process, an undertaking that involved eight federal offices in addition to the State Department. Recently, Republicans have called for a fresh investigation of the matter. The Justice Department has made no official comment. The department recently allowed an FBI informant in the Tenex bribery case to testify before a Senate committee investigating the Uranium One transaction. It is unknown what if anything new that informant might provide. The indictment-Rosatom connection How does the recent indictment link to the Uranium One sale? Aside from the tie to Rosatom, not in any obvious way. The Maryland firm was in cahoots with Vadim Mikerin, a Russian national who was the general director of Tenam USA, the American arm of Tenex. Tenex is a subsidiary of JSC Atomenergoprom, which in turn is a subsidiary of Rosatom. Rosatom bought the controlling share in Uranium One through another subsidiary. There is no evidence that the kickback scheme that defrauded Tenex overlapped with Rosatom’s efforts to buy Uranium One. None of the news reports that claimed a connection provided any evidence. In fact, the New York Post article incorrectly said, "The federal investigation grew from charges that the Obama administration covered up an FBI probe of the uranium business — and thus allowed the Russian firm Tenex to buy a stake in Uranium One." But Tenex was not the buyer. As a subsidiary of Rosatom, its role was to export Russian uranium, a very different business activity. The Rosatom subsidiary that bought the stake in Uranium One was Atomredmetzoloto. Law professor Michael Koehler at Southern Illinois University School of Law is an expert on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has written about the Tenex prosecutions. He reviewed the indictment and saw no tie between the two matters. "Last week’s case concerns the same core conduct the Justice Department brought action on in June 2015," Koehler said. While any FBI investigation of the Uranium One deal lies behind a veil of secrecy at the department, Koehler said the idea that it might have spurred the latest indictment is "highly unlikely." Our ruling A website called Republican News said a recent bribery indictment is tied to the Uranium One deal. There was an indictment, but the Justice Department did not connect it to the sale of shares of Uranium One to Rosatom. The indictment was the latest step in a 2014 investigation of a kickback scheme that defrauded a Rosatom subsidiary. That investigation had already secured two guilty pleas. The reports that tied the indictment to Uranium One offered no evidence of a connection. If new information from the Justice Department emerges, we’ll revisit this. But for now, we rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Republican News	None	None	None	2018-01-17T11:51:47	2018-01-13	['Russia']

pomt-07576	"We don't need a separate (prescription drug) database ... Pharmacies already have a database in place."	false	/florida/statements/2011/mar/29/larry-ahern/freshman-house-member-says-pill-mill-database-isnt/	Republicans in Tallahassee are split on whether to implement a new database that would track the sale of some prescription drugs in order to better identify and prevent doctor shopping and prescription drug abuse. The statewide drug-monitoring database would allow pharmacists and physicians to track the sale of prescription drugs and pain medication in order to prevent patients from going doctor to doctor to acquire prescriptions. Law enforcement officials could use the database to spot doctors who were over-prescribing drugs or people who are trying to abuse the system. More than 30 other states already have some type of database. Florida approved its version in 2009, but the database has been stalled over a contract dispute over what private vendor would manage the system. That has given some Republicans a chance to second-guess the program. A bill moving through the House at the behest of Speaker Dean Cannon (HB 7095) would eliminate the database. Rep. Robert Schenck, chairman of the committee that sponsored the bill, argues that the database merely tracks the problem and doesn't stop it. The House bill would instead require tracking drug wholesalers to identify unusually large distributions of narcotics. It also prohibits doctors from dispensing those medications, leaving that to pharmacists. Gov. Rick Scott, meanwhile, has said he worries the database could be an invasion of privacy, and that he doesn't want Florida taxpayers to end up on the hook for a program that was established with the promise that it would never be supported by state money. Federal grants and private fundraising efforts have generated enough money to run the database for about two years. And Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, has offered to pay $1 million to help fund the program. Scott also announced March 28 a statewide law enforcement response to try to halt criminal distribution and abuse of drugs in Florida. A freshman legislator from Pinellas County, Rep. Larry Ahern, wrote a letter to the editor of the St. Petersburg Times with another reason to oppose the database: Florida already has one. Ahern, who runs a swimming pool remodeling business, was responding to an editorial from the Times urging Republicans to move forward with the database. "The Florida House has it right, and the Times gets it wrong," he wrote in a letter published March 25, 2011. "Pharmacies already have a database in place, and the transaction is recorded on the spot. They will question the person trying to fill another prescription so quickly, and not fill it or call the doctor. "We don't need a separate database with one already in place. The House bill will close pill mills without hurting legitimate doctors' ability to help their patients." Is the database that's caused such a fight in the Legislature overkill? Lori Weems, a lobbyist for the Florida Pharmacy Association, suggested we call a pharmacist to find out. Ron Haines, a licensed pharmacist since 1961 who works at an independent pharmacy in Tarpon Springs, told us there is no database like the one Ahern is suggesting. "I can't call the pharmacy across the street to ask if they filled a prescription for Mike Smith. They can't tell me." Records are kept by pharmacies, of course, but those records aren't shared, Haines said. Every pharmacy keeps a record of what they prescribe to patients, Haines said, and pharmacy chains like Walgreens, CVS and Publix link into company databases. So a Publix pharmacist might know how many times a customer has been to a Publix pharmacy, and for what. But the Walgreens database doesn't sync into the CVS database, or vice versa. Insurance companies also keep databases on their patients to track what insurance companies are being ask to help pay for. But none of those databases were created with the idea of trying to find people -- doctors or patients -- who are abusing the system, Haines said. "The databases we use store prescription records in the pharmacy. That's as far as it goes," he said. "There is nothing aimed at targeting bad doctors and doctor shopping. That's what we're after." Michael Jackson, CEO of the Florida Pharmacy Association, told us the same thing. "It is true that many of the major chain pharmacies have prescription databases that are shared under their corporate umbrella pharmacies however they are not interconnected with other pharmacies," Jackson said. "For example I may be a pharmacist working at chain "A" and a patient brings in their prescription to me. I cannot determine if that patient had a prescription filled at my competitor chain "B" located across the street that same day. In many cases I may ask the patient to provide me with their medication history and who has been their pharmacy providers but they may either not remember or for some reason elect to withhold that information from me." Ahern, in an interview, more or less conceded the point. He said what he was trying to suggest is that the state should explore ways to have the big pharmacies connect the already in-place databases together in a way that would allow law enforcement and pharmacists to look for trouble spots. He said using infrastructure already in place is better than creating a new system from scratch. "That would, in essence, solve much of the problems," he said. Ahern also pointed out flaws in the statewide monitoring program -- namely that health care practitioners would not be required to access the database before prescribing anyone medicine. And that pharmacists have 15 days to enter drug purchases into the system. "Where does that solve the problem?" Ahern asked. Ahern, for the record, is worried about privacy concerns in the database, and says he supports efforts to quell doctor-shopping. But he just doesn't think the statewide database is an effective tool in that fight. He also claimed in his letter to the editor that a database already is in place. There are many private-sector databases that collect information on prescription drug purchases, but those databases are not interconnected and were not created with the idea of reducing prescription drug abuse statewide. These individual store or company databases don't address the problem. So we rate this claim False.	None	Larry Ahern	None	None	None	2011-03-29T09:35:07	2011-03-25	['None']

pomt-13901	Says Donald Trump "literally has no plans to make higher education more affordable."	mostly true	/nevada/statements/2016/jun/28/roberta-lange/nevada-democrats-correct-attacking-donald-trumps-n/	What would Donald Trump do to lower the cost of higher education as president? Absolutely nothing, says Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman Roberta Lange, who along with fellow Democrats has constantly berated Trump in press conferences and news releases. Here’s what she said after a Moody’s report claimed Trump’s proposed economic policies would result in millions of lost jobs and a contracting economy. "He says ‘wages are too high’ and has literally no plans to make higher education more affordable," she said in a press release. So is it true that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has "literally no plans" to make higher education more affordable? After reviewing the candidate’s stated policy positions and various media appearances, we’re pretty confident in saying that Trump has no clearly defined plan to reduce the cost of higher education. Schooling Trump Higher education reform and student loan debt are not detailed on Trump’s campaign website — his "Issues" and "Positions" pages don’t touch on education outside of two short videos of the candidate promising to repeal Common Core. (The federal government is prohibited from directing states to adopt or not adopt the standards.) The Trump campaign didn’t return emails seeking comment, but the candidate has mentioned student loan debt and the rising cost of college on a few occasions. In a 22-second Twitter video from last year, Trump called student loan debt a "tremendous problem," but he only made a vague promise to "restructure" it and make college more affordable. Trump also indirectly addressed rising student loan debt during a question-and-answer session with students at Simpson College in Iowa, acknowledging it as a "huge problem" but identifying job creation and "great leadership" as ways to fix the problem. But other than a handful of interviews, Trump hasn’t described how exactly he’d make college more affordable. It’s a far cry from 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who in May 2012 released a 35-page white paper in part detailing his plans to reshape higher education policy. And 2008 GOP nominee John McCain also proposed several specific higher education policy changes on his campaign website. Trump’s likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, has spoken at length about her plans for higher education. She released her "New College Compact" plan in August 2015. The closest thing the Trump campaign has to a "higher education plan" was revealed in a Inside Higher Ed interview with Trump’s national co-chairman and policy director, Sam Clovis. Clovis said a Trump administration would focus on overhauling the student loan system by transitioning the responsibility for lending from the government to private banks, and floated the idea of basing loan eligibility on which majors college students pick. "If you are going to study 16th century French art, more power to you. I support the arts," Clovis said in a May interview. "But you are not going to get a job." So Trump’s closest thing to a higher education "plan" is returning to a system where private banks, not the federal government, would extend loans to students while requiring colleges to have more "skin in the game." As PolitiFact has previously reported, the federal government in 1965 took several steps to help more students attend college, including guaranteeing loans against default and promising a set interest rate to banks extending the loans to students. That changed in 2010, when Democrats approved a new law cutting out the bank subsidies and replacing them with direct loans overseen by federal agencies and funded by the U.S. Treasury. High-profile critics like Trump and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. D-Mass., have panned the change as generating profit on the backs of over-burdened college students, but it’s not clear that a shift to the old system or Trump’s proposal would make college cheaper. Our ruling Nevada Democratic Party chair Roberta Lange says Donald Trump "literally has no plans to make higher education more affordable." Trump hasn’t released any sort of traditional higher education reform plan — much less any details on how to make college more affordable — unlike Clinton, Romney and McCain. However, Trump has commented several times on the spiraling cost of student loan debt and said he doesn’t want the federal government making a profit on the backs of students. For Trump's lack of specifics, we rate Lange's statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/27d63b91-1b90-4ea9-9023-82f0ee09ff46	None	Roberta Lange	None	None	None	2016-06-28T13:59:30	2016-06-22	['None']
pomt-13165	"When Trump wanted to turn a taxpayer-owned building into an $800 a night hotel, (Congressman Jeff Denham, R-CA) helped broker the deal and bragged about it."	false	/california/statements/2016/oct/28/dccc-lgo/dccc-makes-false-claim-about-denhams-role-trump-ho/	A new TV ad by a Democratic campaign committee describes Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Turlock, as Donald Trump’s ‘Man in Washington DC.’ It says Denham was deeply involved in the GOP nominee’s development of Trump International Hotel in DC. Trump took time away from the campaign trail this week to celebrate the hotel’s opening. "When Trump wanted to turn a taxpayer-owned building into an $800 a night hotel, Denham helped broker the deal and bragged about it," the ad by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says. Denham is locked in a close race against Democratic challenger Michael Eggman for the 10th Congressional District seat in the Central Valley. Eggman and the DCCC have tried to tie Denham to Trump through several campaign ads in recent months. We wanted to know whether this eye-opening claim that Denham "helped broker" the hotel deal for Trump was true. We set out on a fact check. Our research Denham has long pushed for the sale and redevelopment of excess government properties. As chairman of the House subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management in 2011, Denham held a committee meeting in the Old Post Office. The partially vacant federal building about three blocks from the White House was costing taxpayers $6.5 million in upkeep at the time. He advocated for redeveloping that site, as well as others, to save taxpayers money. Trump’s development company, the Trump Organization, was selected about a year later to turn the property into a 250-room luxury hotel while preserving its historic nature. This is the ‘taxpayer owned building’ the ad refers to. To say, however, that Denham "helped broker the deal" is a far stretch. The Obama Administration’s General Services Administration handled the bids and selection process. GSA received 10 bids and described its process this way in February 2012: "After closely evaluating the submissions, GSA determined the Trump Organization proposal represented the strongest development team, best long term potential for the local community, and most consistent stream of revenue for the Federal Government." Dan Tagherlini, then-acting administrator of the General Services Administration, praised the 60-year Trump lease in 2013, as one that will "save millions of taxpayer dollars while restoring a unique and important historic asset," according to a McClatchyDC.com news article. Asked for evidence to back up the claims in the ad, a DCCC spokeswoman said it used news articles from Turlock City News and Time magazine along with a 2013 press release from Denham’s office. None of those, however, show Denham helped "broker" the deal. Denham’s campaign spokesman said the congressman "was not involved in the selection process" of the property’s developer. A GSA spokeswoman said Denham "did not vote on any legislation or make a recommendation related to the selection of the Trump Organization as the preferred developer for Old Post Office project." Denham told the Modesto Bee in August he supports Trump for president. We asked his campaign spokesman this week whether Denham continues to support the Republican nominee, and have yet to hear back. In this 2013 photo, Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Calif., testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington. AP Photo/Evan Vucci Bragged about it? Denham’s news release does show the congressman was pleased. It says Denham joined Trump Sept. 12, 2013 at the architectural and design unveiling of what’s now called Trump International Hotel. "I am pleased to see Trump International Hotel’s design unveiled today," Denham said in the release. "This is one of the projects that has been important to me in my efforts to generate economic growth and streamline federal processes, and as the chairman of the Economic Development subcommittee last Congress, I worked closely with the GSA on this project." $800 a night? The Time article shows rooms at the hotel were originally priced at $800 or more per night. Yet, the same article said "Rates will go down after the soft opening period, starting at about $472 a night. There were several rooms available early this week, with nightly rates from $588 to $668, not including local taxes, according to the hotel’s website. Our rating A TV ad by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says Rep. Jeff Denham of California "helped broker" a deal for a Washington DC hotel for Donald Trump "and bragged about it." In reality, Denham chaired a House committee that sought to sell or redevelop excess and underused federal properties, including the Old Post Office Trump later turned into a luxury hotel. While the congressman played a role the overall process, a federal agency under the Obama Administration, not Denham, selected the Trump Organization to redevelop the property after reviewing competing bids. Denham joined Trump at the hotel’s design unveiling in 2013 and said in a press release he was pleased the property was being redeveloped. But there’s no indication, and no evidence from the DCCC, that Denham had any direct role in choosing Trump as the developer. The DCCC advertisement greatly exaggerates Denham’s role in the process and falsely describes him as helping "broker" the deal. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

The mess, of course, is the state of employment. Non-farm employment fell dramatically over the last few years, and although the trend is reversing, the recovery is painfully slow. Or as Mandel spokesman Joe Aquilino said in a news release on Sept. 28, 2011, "Perhaps most staggering: during Sherrod Brown’s past decade as a D.C. politician, more than one out of every four jobs that has left America, left from Ohio. This is a shocking statistic. Sherrod Brown’s policies are not working for Ohio." Promising that this message will not go away, Aquilino said, "Simply put, Sherrod Brown will own these horrendous Ohio job numbers next year." PolitiFact Ohio is all for ownership, as is the print side of this operation, The Plain Dealer. That’s only fitting, because Aquilino says that The Plain Dealer is a primary source for the statistic. So let’s check out the components of Aquilino’s claim: The jobs picture The Plain Dealer on Sept. 5 published a Labor Day weekend story on Ohio’s loss of jobs over the course of a decade. The story focused heavily on a new report by Policy Matters Ohio, a liberal-leaning think tank that studies economic and social justice issues. Titled "The State of Working Ohio 2011," the report examined a number of economic measures, concluding that "wages are shrinking, jobs are elusive, and workers are being left behind." Aquilino cited this report as well as The Plain Dealer in his criticism of Brown. It is quite a day when a spokesman for a conservative Republican cites Policy Matters, and Aquilino appreciates this as much as anyone. Rest assured that Mandel disagrees with the group’s proposals to use tools such as more stimulus spending to turn things around. Aquilino also pointed to a chart that went with the Plain Dealer story. The chart listed a number of metrics related to jobs and wages over the course of a decade, none of them positive for a majority of workers, and said, "Between July 2000 and July 2010, Ohio lost nearly 600,000 jobs, accounting for more than one-fourth of all jobs lost in the nation." PolitiFact Ohio went back and checked the numbers with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They were correct: Ohio lost 590,300 jobs during that 10-year span when the nation lost 2.07 million. Keep in mind that these were net job losses, based on the number of people working at a given point in time. If 100 people lose their jobs at Company A, while Company B hires 20 people who were unemployed, the net job loss would be counted as 80. Also note the time frame measured in the September 2011 newspaper article -- a 10-year period from July 2000 and July 2010. This made sense for the newspaper story because a number of other measures being examined also came from this period and were not yet available for more recent months, according to a reporter and editor who assembled the data. It was a way to make sure that all the economic comparisons covered identical periods. Yet job numbers change month by month. So we moved the time frame forward, comparing 10 years worth of net job losses from January 2001 through December 2010, and then through January 2011, to see if the earlier measure was an aberration. It was not. Ohio’s job losses still represented about a quarter of those nationwide, with 570,400 Ohio jobs lost using one of the periods (out of 2.2 million nationwide) and 563,300 in the other (out of 2.1 million nationwide). However, the job picture has grown a bit rosier as 2011 progresses, even if it lags demand as more people enter the workforce. If the comparison were made using August 2011 as the end point, Ohio’s 10-year job losses would be 407,000. But wait a minute. Suppose Mandel, The Plain Dealer or anyone else wanted to compare Ohio’s job losses with the nation’s during that most recent 10-year period. Let’s see how Ohio stacked up: Ohio lost 407,00 jobs out of the nation’s loss of 531,000. That’s an astounding ratio -- and if you used it (you should not), you’d say that four out out every five jobs lost in the United States came from Ohio. How is that possible? We asked BLS, and the answer leads us to the problem with these comparisons: Data examining one state’s decline over the years is useful when examining trends, such as Ohio’s loss of its manufacturing sector (a primary focus of the Policy Matters study and The Plain Dealer story). But simultaneous events in just a few large states can bring the state-to-national ratios down or up and skew the comparisons. Take Michigan and California. Each lost more jobs than Ohio. If you compared their combined job losses during the most recent 10-year period available, their totals would actually exceed the nation’s job losses. That would be impossible, of course, were it not for the fact that some other states were gaining jobs during that time. Rick Perry will gladly discuss what some call the Texas miracle and how Texas added jobs, although we’ll leave it to PolitiFact Texas to assess whom should get credit. You can play with these numbers until your head spins. The point is that it really helps to understand what was going on elsewhere before using a single comparison to compare one state with the nation. So OK, Ohio lost a lot of jobs. Mandel cited a September 2011 Plain Dealer story that, for reasons mentioned already, used a job-loss measure ending in July 2010. We accept ownership; the data showed a trend that was correct, and the raw numbers were accurate. Is Brown to blame? Should Brown "own these horrendous job numbers," as the Mandel spokesman says? We asked Aquilino to specify what Brown did that contributed to the job losses. In an email exchange, he mentioned ongoing controversies over the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions; over the National Labor Relation Board’s power to tell a company whether it may open a factory in South Carolina if it believes the location was chosen to bypass unions in another state, and over efforts to change labor laws in a way that would make it easier for unions to increase membership. Brown also supports raising taxes on millionaires. Aquilino said entrepreneurs fear that each of these will damage the business climate or hamper their ability to grow and hire. Brown has refused to join Republicans in pushing back against these measures. We have little doubt that these fears are real. Business owners and managers have told as as much. But for the most part, these are prospective fears. While fear about the direction ahead may drive the election, Aquilino’s claim here relies on job losses as far as 10 years back. Aquilino had more on his list: Brown voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, casting what many consider to be the single vote that enabled the stimulus bill to pass. Republicans said it has washed $1 billion down the drain, but many economists say it helped pull the country out of a tailspin. Whether it was properly focused or partially wasted or could have achieved more is what’s still hotly debated. Brown also voted to revamp the nation’s health insurance laws, which Republicans say will create another drag on the economy. Although portions of it are already in place, the law’s main features won’t kick in until 2014. Brown has voted against free trade deals consistently, saying they lead to higher unemployment, but he has been on the losing side. While Republicans say positions like Brown’s slowed passage and stood in the way of growth, the most far-reaching trade bills were Clinton-era deals for trade with China and Mexico. They passed despite Brown -- and during a time frame preceding the job losses mentioned in the Mandel news release. Republicans have other raps against Brown: He backed the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, which required more stringent consumer financial regulation. Some businesses see these measures as creating bureaucracies that will stand in the way of hiring. So Brown has caused these job losses, yes? No, says Amy Hanauer, executive director of Policy Matters Ohio. It might seem odd to ask the head of a liberal think tank to comment on criticisms made by a conservative opponent of a liberal senator. But the Mandel campaign credited Policy Matters, of all organizations, with pointing out Ohio’s big job losses. What does Hanauer think? "I think the Ohio job loss is primarily due to the recession, which in turn is attributable to the housing bust, brought on by excessive deregulation," she said in an e-mail. "I think if we'd had more regulation of the financial sector we'd be in much better shape. In general, I'd view Sherrod Brown as appreciating the role of regulation in helping markets function better. Secondly, job loss in Ohio, particularly in manufacturing, stems from more reliance on trade with China and other low-wage countries. Here, Senator Brown is clearly among the strongest voices for a different approach." We are not taking Hanauer’s side, nor are we taking Aquilino’s. The blame game requires deeper analysis. For example, of the 10 years measured, Brown spent six and a half of them in the U.S. House of Representatives. It was under Republican control that entire time, with Dennis Hastert as House speaker. Brown and his fellow House Democrats simply lacked the power to pass anything the GOP didn’t want.. That changed in 2007, when Brown joined the Senate. That chamber’s Democratic majority has since taken the actions listed above. And if elections are about the future, voters will have their say in 2012 as to whether they think Brown or Mandel will offer a brighter one. That leaves us here: Aquilino’s claim on job losses over 10 years is pretty accurate, given the above-mentioned caveats. But he links 10 years’ worth of hurt to a lawmaker who spent more than half that time in the minority party, and that’s where the claim overreaches. BLS data shows that Ohio lost 190,900 of those jobs cited by Aquilino when Brown was a Democrat in a Republican Congress, affording him almost no power. Aquilino backs up the claim by listing recent laws or policies supported by Brown in the Senate. Yet the effects of most of those policies, whether negative or positive, are yet to come. The claim, while mostly accurate on the aggregate job losses, leaves out a considerable amount of information -- veering in large part toward inaccurate -- when saying Brown owns these horrendous numbers. That renders the claim in its entirety Half True.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2011-10-24T06:00:00	2011-09-28	['Ohio', 'United_States', 'Washington,_D.C.']

pomt-00153	"All across Ohio, steel mills are reopening."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2018/oct/24/donald-trump/facts-trump-and-ohio-steel-mills/	President Donald Trump said in his 2017 inaugural address that rusted-out factories were "scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation." Recently, the president claimed some of Ohio’s industrial jobs had since been resurrected. He said the United States was now "taxing the hell out of the dumpers" that were "hurting your steel industry." "All across Ohio, steel mills are reopening, and we are putting our coal miners back to work. One of the things we’re most proud of. ... When I came into office, steel was dead. Steel was dead. Now they're opening up plants, U.S. Steel, Nucor, they're opening up plants all over the country. Big ones. New ones. We're taxing the hell out of the dumpers. You know, we had the dumpers who were hurting your steel industry." Trump said at an Oct. 12 rally in Lebanon, Ohio. Trump was in town to support Ohio Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, who is challenging Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown. While Brown has been ahead in the polls, Ohio is considered a competitive state for Republicans following Trump’s strong win in the battleground state in 2016. We looked at whether steel mills across Ohio had, in fact, reopened. We found evidence of one idling mill reopening and a handful of steel companies making additional investments in Ohio. Trump’s claim of mills across the state reopening is exaggerated, but steel companies are making new investments. Ohio reopenings and investments Earlier this year, Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum, which he argued would protect American metals industries in competing with foreign imports. The White House did not respond to our request for comment. In Ohio, there are 7,700 iron, steel mill and ferroalloy manufacturing jobs as of Sept. 1, which is roughly the same amount as there were in January 2017. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "When you look at the employment numbers (in Ohio), you cannot find an increase in employment from the June imposition (of the steel tariffs) or from when the rumors started kicking around in January," said Ohio State University professor Ned Hill, an economist who studies American manufacturing. "The notion that there are hundreds of mills reopening or ready to reopen, there’s not much behind that," Hill said. We found several examples of steel mills reopening or expanding in the two years, both before and after Trump announced the steel tariffs earlier this year. In June 2018, Republic Steel announced plans to restart its furnace in Lorain, Ohio, after it had idled since 2016. It partially reopened in September 2018, bringing 80 new jobs to the city. The company credited the steel tariff. Republic Steel is also adding a shift at its Canton location. JSW Steel USA initially planned to restart the Mingo Junction electric-arc furnace in September 2018. On Oct. 11, the company said it would restart in a "matter of weeks." The furnace has been idle since 2009. Plans to reopen precede Trump’s tariffs. In January 2017, before the tariff, Charter Steel announced plans to build a new $150 million mill in Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio. In April 2017, Nucor Corp. announced it would invest $85 million to upgrade the rolling mill at its steel bar mill in Marion, Ohio. Many additional mills in Ohio are actively hiring workers, according to Hill. The active hiring started about three years ago for the first time since 1997. National numbers Foreign imports do have a role in the decrease in steel industry jobs over the past 50 years, but experts told us bigger factors in the decline are technological improvements and productivity growth. "The basic story is that one person can produce a lot more metal today than he or she could produce," a few decades ago, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, told us in March. We found data for employment in the primary metals-producing sector, which incorporates five subcategories: iron and steel mills, steel product manufacturing from purchased steel, aluminum production and processing, production and processing of metals other than iron and aluminum, and foundries. Nationwide employment in primary metals manufacturing bottomed out from 451,600 in early 2008 to 347,300 in early 2010 after the recession and global economic crisis. By the end of 2014, it had rebounded to 402,600 as a result of the Obama economic stimulus before falling again to 368,100 in January 2017 due to lower oil prices and a flood of imports, according to United Steelworkers spokesman Wayne Ranick. Employment has since risen to a projected 382,300 for September 2018, largely the result of trade policies that have stabilized the domestic market, Ranick said. Paul Nathanson, a spokesman for the Coalition of American Metal Manufacturers and Users, said that the tariffs were hurting U.S. steel-using manufacturers and that the tariffs raise the prices of both domestic and imported steel. "Manufacturers who use steel as a primary input to make parts for the automotive, aviation, energy, appliance, defense and other industries are losing business to overseas competitors who can make the same part for less because they pay global (lower) prices for steel and import that part into the U.S.," Nathanson said. Our ruling Trump said that steel mills were reopening across Ohio. While experts have mixed impressions about the long-term job growth from Trump’s steel tariffs, we found evidence of a handful of steel companies investing in their Ohio plants and at least one example of an idling mill reopening. We rate this Half True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-10-24T15:14:13	2018-10-12	['Ohio']
pomt-13582	Says Hillary Clinton is "proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take everybody's jobs, including low-income African-Americans."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/18/donald-trump/hillary-clinton-want-millions-illegal-immigrants-t/	On a campaign visit to West Bend, Wis., on Aug. 16, 2016, Donald Trump hit one of his favorite topics -- immigration -- and one of his favorite targets -- Hillary Clinton. Trump tried to reach out to African-American voters with various attacks on Clinton, including this one: "Now she's proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take everybody's jobs, including low-income African-Americans." Trump’s reference, however, is to advanced-degree international students who are legally in the United States -- and who are trained for top jobs in technology and science. Trump’s evidence To back Trump’s claim, his campaign pointed to this statement from the technology policy part of Clinton's campaign website: Our immigration system is plagued by visa backlogs and other barriers that prevent high-skilled workers and entrepreneurs from coming to, staying in, and creating jobs in America. Far too often, we require talented persons from other countries who are trained in U.S. universities to return home, rather than stay in here and continue to contribute to our economy. As part of a comprehensive immigration solution, Hillary would "staple" a green card to STEM masters and PhDs from accredited institutions—enabling international students who complete degrees in these fields to move to green card status. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. The Trump campaign also cited a Breitbart.com article published June 28, 2016, the day Clinton released the plan. The "staple" proposal would mean, the conservative site claimed, "university-trained foreign labor will drown the lifetime wages and career prospects of her college-indebted American supporters." Even that criticism refers to jobs sought by college graduates, not jobs held by people with low incomes. Other views Paula Dwyer, an economics columnist for Bloomberg, explained in a column that the automatic green card Clinton proposes would grant foreign graduates permanent U.S. residence and work visas. Dwyer noted that such proposals have had bipartisan support while also raising some concerns -- though not the type Trump raised. She wrote: President Barack Obama suggested the stapled green card in his first term, as did Mitt Romney in his 2012 presidential campaign. Silicon Valley executives have long advocated it to address what they claim is a shortage of qualified high-tech workers …. Clinton says it makes no sense for the U.S. to invest in the education of some of the world's smartest people, only to send them back to India, China and other countries to start companies and compete against the U.S. But critics of the influx of foreign students to the U.S. warn that, without safeguards, the policy would turn U.S. colleges into green-card factories that crowd out American students, drive down salaries and discourage U.S.-born students from STEM careers. So, there are some concerns about extending the stay of international students, who are not illegal immigrants but are studying in the U.S. on temporary visas. Regardless, these master’s and doctoral graduates in science, technology, engineering and math are not threats to jobs held by low-income workers. There’s also no evidence that Clinton’s proposal would apply to millions of people. The government’s latest quarterly report says 478,851 international students were studying in STEM fields at U.S. universities as of March 2016. And, of course, not all of them pursue advanced degrees or will want to remain in the U.S. after finishing their studies. Our rating Trump says Clinton is "proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take everybody's jobs, including low-income African-Americans." Clinton would "staple" green cards to the diplomas of foreign students in the United States who complete master’s or doctoral degrees in science, technology, engineering or math, extending their stay so that they could work in the U.S., particularly in high-tech jobs, after graduation rather than returning home. The green cards would be available to students who are already legally in the United States. And given their level of education and expertise, they would not be taking jobs of low-income Americans. Nor is the program aimed at millions of students. We rate the statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/65130cee-8948-4fca-8a6d-bee84a8dcf41	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-08-18T12:13:07	2016-08-16	['None']
pomt-12017	"Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/20/donald-trump/how-strong-job-growth-been-trumps-watch/	While presidential speeches to the United Nations usually focus on foreign policy, President Donald Trump began his by touting domestic accomplishments on his watch. "Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last Nov. 8," he said while addressing the General Assembly on Sept. 19, 2017. "The stock market is at an all-time high, a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time." We decided to check his assertion that "companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time." We found that Trump exaggerated the job growth (it's not unprecedented), but there is some truth to his point about companies moving back to the country. Overall job growth The most obvious way to look at this claim is to look at recent job growth rates. So we looked up month-to-month increases in jobs since 2011 -- the point at which the national economy started gaining jobs consistently after the Great Recession. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The monthly gains in red -- those since Trump became president -- don’t look much different from the types of gains seen under President Barack Obama starting in 2011. The highest monthly job gain under Trump -- 232,000 -- was exceeded in 28 separate months on Obama’s watch. Next, we looked at the specific job gains under Trump from February 2017 to August 2017. We compared that period to the February-to-August job gains under Obama between 2011 and 2016. Here’s what we found: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com This chart shows that the job gains under Trump were actually lower than each of the last six years of February-to-August job gains for Obama, except for one year -- 2012. This shouldn’t suggest that the pace of job creation this year is a disappointment. While one would expect big job gains in the immediate aftermath of a major recession as the economy catches up, seeing substantial gains this many years after the recession officially ended is far from guaranteed. In reality, August 2017 represented the 83rd successive month of month-to-month job gains -- easily a record. The longest previous spell of positive increases in monthly payroll employment was 48, in the period ending in June 1990, said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "It is surprising how long (strong job growth) has continued," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. At the same time, she added, "it's also disappointing that the gain in jobs hasn't also been accompanied by strong wages and productivity growth." Looking at 'reshored' jobs Another way of looking a Trump’s statement is not in terms of record overall job growth, but specifically about jobs created by companies moving their operations to the United States. Here, he has a stronger point. A group called the Reshoring Initiative has been collecting data since 2010 on "reshoring" -- a combination of U.S. firms bringing jobs back to the U.S., and foreign companies deciding to locate jobs here. Publicly, the group released data in May 2017 showing that "for the first time in decades, more manufacturing jobs are returning to the United States than are going offshore." Specifically, the group found a record-high 77,000 reshored jobs in 2016, bringing the total since 2010 to 338,000. Those gains, of course, took place under Barack Obama. But while the group hasn’t officially published data covering the period since Trump took office, we asked the group for their latest data, covering Trump’s time in office. According to the group, reshoring started going up substantially beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and has accelerated in 2017. Between 2013 and 2015, the average number of reshored jobs announced per quarter was about 17,000, Harry C. Moser, the Kildeer, Ill., group’s founder and president, told PolitiFact. Then, during the first three quarters of 2016, that number fell to an average of 12,000. Then it picked up. In the fourth quarter of 2016, it almost doubled to 22,000. In the first quarter of 2017, it almost doubled again to 40,000. And the preliminary number for the second quarter of 2017 is even higher, at 50,000. When we asked Moser if he had an explanation for such increases, he offered two, based on his discussions with company executives. One is a more favorable exchange rate for the U.S. dollar. The other is the expectation among businesses that Trump would cut taxes and regulation, and that he might erect tariffs or otherwise punish goods produced overseas. "You can never be sure, but in my professional opinion, a significant portion of the increase comes from the expectation of good things (from Trump) and a fear of bad things (from him)," Moser said. The corollary, he added, is that if Trump fails to deliver on these promises, those reshored jobs could evaporate. As we noted, these numbers haven’t been publicly released. So did Trump just happen to guess correctly in this case? Maybe not. Moser said he’d sent this data to the White House "through different channels, such as congressmen and semi-confidants, about eight times." So the reshoring data could have been what Trump was referring to. But the White House didn’t confirm to us that this is the interpretation he’d intended. A final point. When checking statements like this, we usually note that presidential actions do not necessarily have much of an impact on job numbers, which are often driven by broader factors, such as international economic conditions and technological change. However, in this case, an independent source has indicated that Trump’s promises -- rather than actual policies he delivered -- are what drove the companies to locate jobs in the United States. So for the purposes of judging this claim, it’s not unreasonable to say that Trump deserves some credit. Our ruling Trump said, "Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time." Overall, job growth is strong, particularly this long after the recession, but the gains are not much different (and maybe a little worse) than they were during the last six years of Obama’s tenure. However, there is evidence that the number of jobs specifically caused by "companies moving back" has increased under Trump, and one reason for this may be Trump’s promises, both of the carrot and stick variety. On balance, we rate the statement Half True. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-09-20T10:54:42	2017-09-19	['None']
pomt-02614	The average Georgia family makes $6,000 less than the average family did 10 years ago when inflation is factored in.	true	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/23/jason-carter/carter-target-family-income/	Anyone listening to the Republican governor’s State of the State address and the Democrats’ response left with a head-full of statistics. Gov. Nathan Deal’s numbers were upbeat about the state economy under his watch. The ones from the Democratic minority, not so much. Jason Carter, a Democratic state senator from Atlanta running for governor, gave the Democratic response. For a moment, it looked like the 2014 race for governor was in full swing. Among the claims by Carter, the grandson of former governor and President Jimmy Carter, was that Georgians have taken a pay cut over the past decade. "Adjusted for inflation, the average Georgia family in effect makes $6,000 less than the average family did 10 years ago," Carter said. Have families really taken that kind of financial hit? PolitiFact Georgia wondered. We deemed that a factoid worth checking. A Carter spokeswoman sent us a link to a U.S. Census Bureau report that she said was part of the basis for the senator’s comments. We looked at that report and found some very bleak numbers for Georgia -- reflected accurately in Carter’s comments. He actually was conservative in saying what’s happened to Georgia’s median family income. He said it was down $6,000. The U.S. Census Bureau report said it was actually $6,682 less in 2012 than in 2002, when inflation is factored in. In 2012 dollars, the median family income in that period fell from $54,803 to $48,121, the census report states. That brought Georgia down considerably in the state rankings for median family income, Carter pointed out. Carter uses terms "average" and "median" interchangeably, though technically they are not the same. Average is the sum of all income divided by the number of households, and median is just midpoint of all household incomes. Jeffrey Humphreys, director of the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia, said the outcome would likely be about the same under either calculation. "I doubt that the rankings (etc.) would be very different regardless of whether or not the median or the average family income is used," Humphreys said. Experts generally believe -- and officials in the governor’s office say -- that the fall in the median family income occurred because the epicenters of the last two recessions were industries that account for an above-average proportion of Georgia’s economy. Specifically, the dot-com, or 9/11, recession hit Georgia’s outsized information industry and air transportation industries. Then, Georgia got hit harder than the nation by the Great Recession and underperformed during the first years of the recovery because of its heavy dependence on construction and real estate development, Humphreys said. The state took direct hits in those industries and indirect hits in the large building materials manufacturing and forestry industries, he said. Humphreys prefers to look at per capita personal income data, instead of median family income, although, from each, essentially emerges a less-than-pretty picture. The per capita income data shows that Georgia began losing ground relative to the nation in 1997, Humphreys said. "Since then, we’ve seen an almost continuous slide of per capita income in Georgia relative to the U.S.," he said. Georgia dropped 15 places in the national rankings, from 25th highest per capita personal income in 1996 to 40th in 2012, Humphreys said. In 2012, Florida, Tennessee and North Carolina fared better than Georgia, with their per capita personal income ranking of 27th, 34th and 38th respectively. Alabama and South Carolina trailed the state, ranking 42nd and 48th respectively. Deal officials cite other numbers showing that the economy is improving. They point out that Georgia’s unemployment rate — while 40th for the nation at 7.7 percent in November 2013 — is still the lowest it has been in five years.

pomt-11231	President Donald Trump’s budget "threatened to cut $2 trillion from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid"	false	/new-york/statements/2018/may/04/hakeem-jeffries/did-trumps-budget-include-2-trillion-cut-medicare-/	During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump said he wouldn’t try to cut Medicare or Medicaid. But his federal budget proposal broke that promise, according to Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York City. "He can't talk about his own budget, where he threatened to cut $2 trillion from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid," Jeffries said about Trump during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, released the president’s federal budget proposal in February. The plan was met with little fanfare because Congress had already passed a two-year spending deal a few days earlier, making the presidential blueprint largely irrelevant. Like any other budget proposal, Trump’s showed where he wanted to spend money and where he didn’t. Did he want to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid by $2 trillion? Where’s $2 trillion from? Jeffries’ spokesperson did not get back to us with information supporting his claim. In a literal sense, Trump’s budget did propose about $2 trillion in savings from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid over 10 years. The majority of those savings — about $1.4 trillion — would come from Medicaid, according to projections from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Part of that would be a rollback of the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, which allowed states to offer Medicaid coverage to a larger share of low-income people. Trump’s budget would cut federal funding for the expansion, forcing states to either drop it or foot the bill themselves. About $530 billion in savings would come from Medicare and $25 billion would come from Social Security. Collectively, that totals almost $2 trillion. What experts say Beyond the raw numbers, though, these figures are misleading, experts told us. "Those numbers only count the ‘takes’ and not where the money is going," said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a non-profit budget analysis group. About $1.2 trillion of the savings from Medicaid and Obamacare would be redirected to block grants for states, Goldwein said. The federal government currently matches state Medicaid costs without a cap. Trump’s budget would use a formula to give each state a fixed amount for Medicaid each year. If costs go above that amount, states would have to cut services or bear the cost. The president’s budget would also repeal federal subsidies for Obamacare. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that replacing those subsidies with block grants would reduce the federal deficit by at least $133 billion over a decade. The net savings between all of Trump’s budget proposals affecting Medicaid and Obamacare was projected to be about $765 billion, experts said. "It’s impossible to apportion how much of that is Medicaid because we don’t know how states will spend their new grant," Goldwein said. "But I think it’s somewhat misleading to suggest Medicaid is being cut by $1.4 trillion when a large chunk of that money is really being reprioritized rather than eliminated." The proposed Medicare savings would have meant little to no change for beneficiaries, according to Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, a Washington, D.C., think tank. Trump’s budget would have reduced reimbursement rates for services, lowering the overall cost. The lower rates would not have changed the care received by people on Medicare, he said. Rather, it would force providers to charge the government less for services. "The Medicare cuts were for the most part reductions to payments to providers, and that latter category is something members of Congress from both parties have been working on for decades," Van de Water said. "The reason the U.S. spends more on health care is that we end up paying much more to providers than other countries." The same idea was included in Obamacare. The law included lower reimbursement rates for providers — something Republicans criticized as a cut at the time. But some of the projected savings will be spent elsewhere outside the program, Goldwein said. "For example, Medicare currently pays medical residents in the United States – not just those who serve the elderly, but all residents," Goldwein said. "The president’s budget would instead create a new program to pay those residents outside of Medicare." The net cut from the program would be $236 billion, according to Trump’s budget proposal. As for Social Security, experts agreed that Trump’s budget would cut the program by about $25 billion, or less than one-fifth of 1 percent. The savings would come from several proposals, the largest of which would cut retroactive disability benefits from 12 to six months. Altogether, experts say the net cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security in Trump’s proposal are closer to $1 trillion when you include the budgetary savings from repealing Obamacare. The amount would be lower without the cuts to Obamacare. Our ruling Jeffries said Trump’s budget threatened to cut $2 trillion from Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. The only way to get to $2 trillion in cuts is by counting some numbers and not others. Expert said the net cut would be closer to $1 trillion. We rate the statement False.

pomt-00268	"Health care premiums in North Carolina are now among the five highest states in the country."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/02/d-cole-phelps/does-nc-have-5th-highest-health-insurance-premiums/	Americans spend more on health care than comparable countries, according to a recent analysis. So it’s probably no surprise that the Pew Research Center found health care to be a top concern of voters, or that North Carolina politicians are talking about it ahead of the midterms. This November, Democrats hope to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature. Among them is D. Cole Phelps, an attorney running for state Senate in northeastern North Carolina’s District 1 against Republican state Rep. Bob Steinburg. On Labor Day, Phelps claimed in a Facebook post that health care premiums in North Carolina are among the most expensive in the country. "Health care premiums in North Carolina are now among the five highest states in the country — and rural health care is struggling," Phelps posted on Sept. 1. "Our opponent is protecting insurance company profits — not his constituents. As your state senator, I will fight for every person in Senate District One, including people with pre-existing conditions." Are health insurance premiums in North Carolina higher than those in 45 other states? PolitiFact reached out to Phelps for the source of his information. To support his claim, Phelps cited a recent WalletHub story, "The Best and Worst States for Healthcare." WalletHub, which looked at all 50 states and Washington, D.C., ranked North Carolina’s health care system 47th for overall care. The Tar Heel State ranked 45th for average monthly insurance premiums. But there’s a key piece of information that’s buried in the WalletHub story and that Phelps doesn’t mention in his Facebook post: WalletHub only looked at health care plans through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. It didn’t take into account premiums for insurance plans acquired through employers. More than 55 percent of Americans have employer-based health insurance plans, according to 2016 estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau. In North Carolina, employer-based plans covered 52 percent of all non-Medicare recipients during 2016, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health analysis organization. So, with that in mind, we wondered whether North Carolinians are paying some of the highest premiums for health insurance plans across the board. Here’s what we found for both customers in the ACA markets as well as on employer-sponsored plans. True, for ACA premiums When it comes to premiums for people with plans through the Affordable Care Act, Kaiser found that North Carolina had the seventh-highest average benchmark premiums in 2018. In 2017, NC had the second-highest. More than 478,000 people enrolled in such plans in 2018, KFF reports. However, the average benchmark isn’t an accurate reflection of what most customers pay, said Craig Palosky, KFF communications director. Though the benchmark shows the full sticker price, it’s "not what people who get tax credits would end up paying," Palosky said. " The distinction is important because the vast majority of marketplace customers do get tax credits – 87 percent nationally and 94 percent in North Carolina." The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, known as CMS, is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. David Anderson, a research associate for the Duke University Center for Health Policy, noted that the CMS risk adjustment formula found high average premiums in NC for 2017. At $501 a month, North Carolina in 2017 had the fourth-highest average premium in the individual market, Anderson noted. Erik Wengle, a research analyst for the Urban Institute Health Policy Center, said premiums for North Carolina’s most popular ACA plans are "frequently" among the highest in the country. North Carolina’s silver and gold ACA plans were both the fifth-most expensive in the country, he said. "We’ve found that competition is a large driver associated with lower premiums. NC hasn’t had as robust competition as other states," Wengle said. Blue Cross Blue Shield is the only insurer to offer ACA plans in all 100 NC counties, while Cigna offers plans in Wake, Johnston, Orange, Chatham and Nash counties. Another insurer, Centene, is expected to enter the Wake and Durham markets next year. Not true for employer-based insurance While North Carolina’s government-subsidized plans are on the expensive side, PolitiFact couldn’t find any evidence that NC’s non-ACA premiums are among the highest in the country. Kaiser examines employer insurance data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which collects data from insurance providers and is part of the U.S Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. KFF statistics from 2016 (the most recent year available) show that the average annual premium for a single employee was $5,717 — one of the lowest averages in the country. Add a "plus one" (spouse or child) to the employee’s coverage, and North Carolina still had one of the lowest average premiums in the U.S. Meanwhile, KFF found that premiums for employer-based family plans in NC were middle-of-the-road. Statistics from the 2017 MEPS show that the average employer-plan premium for an employee in North Carolina is slightly below the national average. For those plans, the annual North Carolina average was $6,348 a year while the national average was $6,368. So Phelps’ claim appears to be true for about 520,000 of North Carolinians on an ACA plan, according to CMS. Going by the latest Census estimates, that’s only 5 percent of North Carolina’s population. Our ruling Phelps said health insurance premiums in North Carolina "are now among the five highest states in the country." He has a point when it comes to premiums for ACA plans. Those plans, however, only affect a fraction of North Carolina’s population. Millions of North Carolinians have plans on the private market, and data show that private plans in NC aren’t among the most expensive in the country. On balance, we rate Phelps’ claim Mostly False.

pomt-01123	Says President Barack Obama's own administration has done five environmental impact assessments of the Keystone XL pipeline, "all of which have said it would have a minimum impact on the environment."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/04/john-thune/thune-says-keystone-xl-pipeline-has-minimal-impact/	Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said one of the first acts of the new Senate will be to force President Barack Obama’s hand on the Keystone XL pipeline. The controversial project has been in the works since 2008 and its current version involves a 875-mile pipeline that would run from Morgan, Mont., to Steele City, Neb. Building this link would allow 830,000 barrels of oil per day to move from the tar sands fields in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Supporters speak of improved energy security and jobs. Opponents say the pipeline will increase greenhouse gas emissions and increase the risk of water pollution from spills. Speaking about the pipeline on Fox News Sunday, Thune said, "We think the president ought to sign that into the law. His administration has done five environmental impact statements, all of which have said it would have a minimal impact on the environment, and his own State Department said it would support 42,000 jobs." We’ve looked at the jobs claim several times (the number of permanent jobs is about 50) and in this fact-check, we’re focusing on Thune’s comments about the environmental impact statements. Thune’s office sent us a list of five studies. All were conducted by the U.S. State Department, which has jurisdiction because the project crosses the border between Canada and the United States. Whether you see them as five separate studies depends on how you look at the environmental impact statement process. Before an agency issues a Final Environmental Impact Statement, it first releases a draft version. Citizens, businesses and interest groups then submit comments that may or may not shape the final report. The State Department ultimately produced two final reports on the Keystone XL pipeline. The first one from August 2011 was preceded by two drafts. The department wrote a second report, partly because it couldn’t meet a legislative deadline to grant final approval, but more fundamentally, because the pipeline project changed. It became shorter and took a different route to avoid a particularly environmentally sensitive area. That second report, released in January 2013, also initially appeared in draft form. So we have two final environmental impact statements, and three other draft reports. Thune’s office sees that as five studies. Others take a more nuanced view. James Coleman, a law and business professor at Calgary University told PolitiFact that while there were five documents, "they're all really draft and finalized versions of the same analysis." A divided administration So that’s the reasoning for or against five statements. Now, what do they say? Thune contended that Obama’s administration found that the pipeline would have a minimal impact on the environment. That is a fair paraphrase of the State Department’s findings. On the key issue of greenhouse gas emissions, the State Department’s final word was that the project was "unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands" in Canada. In short, one way or the other, companies in Canada would continue to extract oil -- meaning the rate of pollution was unlikely to grow simply due to the pipeline alone. But the administration has not spoken with a single voice. The Environmental Protection Agency tagged the State Department’s draft from April 2013 with the label "Environmental objections -- insufficient information." The EPA said, among other things, that the pipeline might have a bigger impact on greenhouse gas emissions than the State Department concluded. The focus here was on how fast oil would come out of the Canadian fields. Pulling oil from the tar sands is costly and even more so when you tack transportation costs on top. The EPA felt that the State Department had not looked carefully enough at the impact of the pipeline if oil prices fell. When oil prices fall, the lower shipping costs that come with the pipeline matter a whole lot more to keeping the enterprise viable. The State Department found that with high oil prices, the tar sands would be mined for oil, pipeline or no. Coleman told PolitiFact that finding is now in question. "The State Department’s analysis was predicated on its assumption that West Texas Intermediate would not fall under $75 per barrel and it is now under $55. At that level, State said things could change," Coleman said. The State Department concluded that with prices between $65 and $75 per barrel "higher transportation costs could have a substantial impact on oil sands production levels, possibly in excess of the capacity of the proposed Project." But with the pipeline, transportation costs drop and production would be higher. That would affect greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA also raised objections to the State Department’s examination of potential oil spills. Our ruling Thune said that the administration had done five studies that all found that the Keystone XL pipeline would have a minimal impact on the environment. The State Department produced five documents, but in reality, all were versions of the same analysis. The State Department did conclude that the pipeline by itself would have no significant impact on the extraction of oil from Canada. However, that was the finding of one government department. The Environmental Protection Agency raised questions, based on the price of oil. The State Department’s final analysis also included the caveat that the pipeline would have a minimal impact on tar sands extraction only if oil prices remained above $75 per barrel. Since then, oil prices have fallen well below that point. Thune’s claim overstates the number of separate studies the administration has done, glosses over the differences of opinion within the administration, and fails to account for the caveat included in the State Department’s analysis. We rate the claim Half True. Help fund PolitiFact's Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response.

pomt-07566	"Public sentiment in favor of collective bargaining and in favor of the unions has actually gone up as these governors, I think, have overreached and gone too far and tried to destroy the labor movement."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/31/george-nee/afl-cio-president-nee-says-public-support-growing-/	The spotlight was on public employee unions, their pensions and their very futures when two top union leaders appeared on Channel 12’s "Newsmakers" show March 20. George Nee, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, and J. Michael Downey, president of Council 94, the state’s largest public employee union, talked about the budget crises in Wisconsin and other Midwestern states, where governors sought dramatic cuts from unions and proposed stripping their rights to collective bargaining. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker threatened to lay off as many as 1,500 state workers by the summer if public sector unions did not agree to roll back benefits and collective bargaining rights. There was a stalemate for weeks as Democratic legislators fled the state to block a vote. Finally, Republicans found a way to approve a bill stripping the unions’ bargaining rights for all issues except pay. Nee said national polls show that as a result, "public sentiment in favor of collective bargaining and in favor of the unions has actually gone up as these governors, I think, have overreached and gone too far and tried to destroy the labor movement." We wondered if public sentiment in favor of unions is actually growing, so we asked Nee what polls he based his observations on. Nee had the union’s communications director send over some recent polls. A USA TODAY/Gallup Poll published Feb. 23 showed that 61 percent of Americans would oppose a law in their state similar to the Wisconsin proposal stripping much of employees’ collective bargaining rights. A total of 33 percent would favor such a law. A poll done by former Clinton political consultant Dick Morris and released Feb. 24, found 51 percent support Wisconsin Governor Walker’s "reforms package," while 47 percent were opposed. Questioned on specifics, however, voters gave a mixed message. By margins of more than 3 to 1, they favored making state employees pay more for health insurance and pensions. But they opposed the governor’s efforts to limit collective bargaining by a margin of 54 to 41 percent. A Pew Research Center poll published Feb. 28 asked respondents whom they favored in Wisconsin’s collective bargaining dispute: 42 percent sided with the unions, 31 percent with the governor, 9 percent chose neither and 18 percent said they didn’t know. A New York Times/CBS News poll, also published Feb. 28, found that 60 percent of Americans oppose efforts to weaken collective bargaining rights of public employee unions. (Only 33 percent of those surveyed viewed labor unions favorably, however, while 25 percent viewed them unfavorably.) A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll published March 2 reported that 62 percent of those surveyed said eliminating collective bargaining rights for public-sector workers over health care, pensions or other benefits would be either "mostly unacceptable" or "totally unacceptable." The Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a nonprofit research institute that says it believes in limited government, published a poll March 6 showing that Wisconsinites opposed their governor’s planned cuts in benefits, wages and union bargaining rights by a margin of 51 percent to 46 percent. The response to eliminating bargaining rights depended on how the question was worded. When framed as "limiting bargaining rights to help local governments," 47 percent were in favor, 50 percent opposed. When framed as "eliminating bargaining rights to ultimately dismantle public employee unions," 58 percent were opposed and 32 percent in favor. A nationwide Bloomberg National Poll published March 9 found 49 percent of respondents had a favorable view of public employee unions, while 40 percent had an unfavorable view. In Rhode Island, Brown University’s Taubman Center for Public Policy released a poll March 24 based on a random sample of 425 registered voters. The poll asked whether respondents favor or oppose taking away some collective bargaining rights from public employee unions. The response: 54 percent opposed, 40.6 percent in favor. We searched for polls or experts that might counter Nee’s assertion. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce had none. Nor did the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank. While all the polls Nee cited showed support for public employee unions and collective bargaining in the current disputes, none showed what Nee claimed: growing support since the Wisconsin battle. We learned from Nee’s staff that Gallup has been polling for public attitudes about unions every August since 1936. Those results showed that unions were much more popular decades ago, when a greater percentage of the private work force was unionized. Approval ratings ranged from 60 percent to as high as 75 percent in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1978, the approval rate dipped to 59 percent, where it has hovered until 2009, when it dropped to 48 percent. In 2010, public approval rose to 52 percent. The union poll always asked the same question: Do you approve or disapprove of labor unions? A more recent Gallup Poll, asked a different question: Whether respondents are more likely to say something negative or positive about unions. Results, released March 11, showed 34 percent would say something positive and 38 percent something negative. That poll may provide insight into how the public views unions in light of the Wisconsin labor dispute, said Gallup spokesman Eric Nielsen, but Gallup won’t know whether the public’s attitude overall has moved up or down until it does its annual union poll next August. So where are we? The annual Gallup polls show public opinion about unions in general is lower that it has been historically, although there was an upswing last year. Other polls do show the public seems to be siding with unions in the battle with Governor Walker. And the public supports the unions’ rights to collective bargaining. Nee seems to be right that public sentiment favors the unions in the Wisconsin battle. And there is evidence that support for unions grew from 2009 to 2010. But Nee overreached when he said support has grown as a result of the Wisconsin battle. We rule his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	George Nee	None	None	None	2011-03-31T00:00:01	2011-03-20	['None']

pomt-11178	"Taking into account inflation, the federal minimum wage is actually worth less than what it was worth 50 years ago."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/22/tina-smith/minimum-wage-worth-less-now-50-years-ago/	Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., took to Twitter recently to tout her support for a $15 minimum wage. In the tweet, Smith wrote that "one of the proudest things I did" as lieutenant governor serving under Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton was helping to raise Minnesota’s state minimum wage to $9.50 an hour. "Now, I’m proud to back a bill to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2024," she wrote, referring to a measure introduced by Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Patty Murray, D-Wash. Currently, the federal minimum wage is $7.25, though states can set higher levels if they wish — and a majority do, from a small amount more than the federal level to $11.50 in Washington state. In a threaded tweet, Smith gave some historical perspective on the minimum wage: "The federal minimum wage hasn’t been raised in a nearly a decade. Taking into account inflation, the federal minimum wage is actually worth less than what it was worth 50 years ago. And prices for everything from milk to prescriptions has skyrocketed." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wondered if Smith was correct, so we looked at the data. Back in 1968, the minimum wage was set at $1.60. That is equivalent to $11.76 in today’s dollars, which is well above today’s minimum wage level and an all-time high when adjusted for inflation. (We used the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator for this purpose.) Over the last 50 years, the situation in 1968 — greater purchasing power for the minimum wage than today — has been common, though not universal. By contrast, we only found seven years in which today’s minimum wage is able to buy more than a previous minimum wage could. (Those years were 1989, 1995, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.) Here’s the full chart, with the inflation-adjusted value of the minimum wage shown in red: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com All told, then, the minimum wage has been worth more than it is today for 86 percent of the time over the past 50 years, and less than today’s during 14 percent of that time. Our ruling Smith said, "Taking into account inflation, the federal minimum wage is actually worth less than what it was worth 50 years ago." Smith’s strict comparison with 50 years ago is accurate, and her comparison even holds for most years out of the past 50, suggesting that the year she picked is not an unreasonable choice.

pomt-05145	"There’s no wildlife" in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/jun/21/dave-weldon/theres-no-wildlife-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge/	We’re guessing most Floridians don’t know much about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, located about 5,000 miles away from us in Alaska’s northeast corner. But if we had to bet, we’d probably say it contains at least one thing. There’s gotta be wildlife, right? Wrong, says former U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon, the Republican newcomer in the U.S. Senate race. Weldon is vying with several candidates, including U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, to win the Republican nomination and run against incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson in November. One way Weldon really breaks from Nelson, he said, is he wants to drill for oil in the refuge to lessen dependence on foreign sources. (The refuge is commonly called ANWR and pronounced an-whar.) In an interview on Central Florida News 13’s Political Connections show, Weldon emphatically said there is no wildlife in the refuge. "We should be drilling up there," he said. "I don’t know why Democrats have been opposing that for years. I have been up there. There’s a ton of oil up there, and there’s no wildlife. We drill in something like 15 wildlife refuges in the lower 48. I just don’t understand why Democrats like Bill Nelson don’t want to drill up there. "I have gone up there. It’s like a moonscape. There’s no trees, there’s no animals. They call it the wildlife refuge, but there’s absolutely nothing up there. It’s just tundra, it’s ice. And in my opinion you can drill safely up there." A reader asked us to examine his comments about wildlife, especially after she found conflicting information right away on the refuge website that boasts of "42 fish species, 37 land mammals, eight marine mammals, and more than 200 migratory and resident bird species." So is the area more like a moonscape or a serengeti? For this fact-check, we’re focusing on a simple question: Is there wildlife on the refuge? For now, we’re staying away from the debate of whether wildlife would be affected by oil drilling in the refuge. Congress created the refuge in 1960 and expanded and renamed it in 1980. Part of the law required 1.5 million of its 19 million acres be set aside for possible oil and gas development, which would need congressional approval. Congress has never approved that. Several environmental groups urged Obama to declare the refuge a national monument so that it never happens. He has not. The refuge is about the size of South Carolina. Its tundra terrain is sometimes mountainous, sometimes forested, and sometimes plains. Located east of the Prudhoe Bay oil field, the refuge could possess one of the country’s largest untapped onshore supply of oil. (You can read more about that in this PolitiFact report, which examined Sarah Palin’s 2008 claim that ANWR drilling would affect "2,000 out of 20-million acres.") Weldon does have a point about there being no trees. While the southern part of the refuge, known as the boreal forest, is heavily forested, the greenery turns to shrubs and grass farther north. "This is a tundra biome, not a forest," said Alan Springer, a research professor at the Institute of Marine Science at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. "That fact hardly diminishes its intrinsic value as a pristine, unique ecosystem within the borders of the United States." The area eyed for drilling has "extensive vegetation cover that is nearly continuous, except for gravel bars along rivers, a few sandy dunes, and rocky beaches along the Arctic coast," said David Payer, the refuge’s supervisory ecologist since 2001 and a veterinarian. (Read more about wildlife in the refuge in this booklet.) Yes, there is wildlife Without question, there are animals in the refuge, even in the zone that most people eye for drilling, known as "1002." Weldon told us in an interview that is the location to which he was referring, but he’s still wrong about wildlife here. The Arctic’s long, dark winter isn’t conducive to a lot of wildlife, but several kinds of animal species stick it out during those months, Payer said. He points to Muskoxen, wolves, wolverines, Arctic and red foxes, polar and grizzly bears (they stay in their winter dens, but they’re still there), as well as a number of bird species, including ptarmigan and ravens. Lemmings and other small creatures live beneath the outer layer of snow, which acts as an insular blanket. During the few summer months, large congregations of animals gather and breed, particularly on the coastal plain, he said. Hundreds of thousands of migratory birds, including several kinds of imperiled shorebirds, come each year. The Porcupine caribou herd, estimated at 169,000 members, depend on the treeless tundra terrain of the coastal plain to raise their young, typically in June and July. Polar bears, a threatened species (not endangered), are hard to detect but can be spotted along the Beaufort Sea. "With regard to the lack of animals, he appears to be very uninformed," Springer said of Weldon. "There are indeed animals, and a lot of them." And that’s just those on the ground. There are a number of rivers, streams and lakes throughout the refuge that are home to fish, which Inupiat (Eskimo) people depend upon for sustenance. Marine life, such as seals and whales, exist in the Arctic Ocean. "We should give fish their due," Payer said. Our ruling Weldon acknowledged his overstatement in an interview with PolitiFact Florida but stood by his observations gathered from a congressional trip through the refuge in the 1990s. "There’s more wildlife in your backyard than that area where they want to drill," he said. We won’t argue with relative statements, but Weldon got it wrong when he said there is no wildlife in ANWR.

pomt-05378	Says he "is the only candidate in the race for Clackamas County Chair who will refuse to join the Public Employees Retirement System."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/may/08/john-ludlow/john-ludlow-only-candidate-race-refuse-join-pers-a/	Wilsonville businessman John Ludlow is in a four-way race for Clackamas County Commission Chair in next week's election. He says that he is the only candidate in the race "who will refuse to join the Public Employees Retirement System." Is he the only candidate in the race to make such a promise? Perhaps just as important a question: Are elected officials even able to decline joining the retirement system? The Public Employees Retirement System is a hot-button issue with critics who claim it eats way too much money, hurting taxpayers to benefit public employees. The retirement program is open to participating employers, from the state of Oregon to school districts and cities. We turned to Paul Cleary, the retirement system's executive director. He pointed to Oregon Revised Statutes 238A.100 (2): A person who is elected or appointed to an office with a fixed term ...may elect not to become a member of the pension program by giving the Public Employees Retirement Board written notice not later than 30 days after taking office. The trick here, says Cleary, is that for a person to decline membership, that person cannot have been a PERS member, ever. Ludlow is a former Wilsonville city councilor and served as Wilsonville’s mayor from 1989 to 1991, but received no retirement benefits from his time in public office. Ludlow, 63, says he has never been a member of PERS, and the Public Employees Retirement System confirms he is not a member. The other Clackamas County commission chair candidates are members of the Public Employees Retirement System. They are county Chairwoman Charlotte Lehan, county Commissioner Paul Savas, and state Rep. Dave Hunt. They cannot opt out. Savas said he never knew he could decline to join. He is the only candidate who will refuse, and who can refuse, to join PERS. We expect Ludlow to keep his promise if he wins, and we rate his statement True.

pomt-04789	"Mitt Romney says class sizes don’t matter."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/23/barack-obama/obama-ad-says-class-sizes-dont-matter-romney/	A new Barack Obama campaign ad titled "Children" attacks Republican Mitt Romney on education by painting him as out of touch with public school students and their families. In the ad, parents Kevin and Caroline say their children’s best experiences have been in the classroom. "But Mitt Romney says class sizes don’t matter," a narrator interjects. A photo of Romney appears, along with a Washington Times headline declaring "Romney downplays value of small class size." Many parents have long believed that small class sizes translate into a better education for kids. School districts often boast about having low ratios, which presumably gives teachers more time to focus on each student. Education Week, a well-respected independent journal, reports that most research supports the idea that small classes have benefits for students but that the smaller classes do not not automatically translate into better learning. Where does Romney stand on this? We decided to check his record. What he said The Washington Times story cited in the ad was about Romney's May visit to a Philadelphia charter school. He joined a roundtable of teachers and talked about his approach to education while governor of Massachusetts. "I came into office and talked to people, and said ‘What do we do to improve our schools?’ And a number of folks said, ‘Well, we need smaller classroom sizes -- that will make the biggest difference.’ So I gathered information across our state. We had 351 cities and towns. I said let’s compare the average classroom size from each school district with the performance of our students, because we test our kids, and we’ll see if there’s a relationship. And there was not. "As a matter of fact, the school district with the smallest classrooms, Cambridge, had students in the bottom 10 percent," he continued. "So just getting smaller classrooms didn’t seem to be the key." A teacher asked Romney for his views on class size. He mentioned work by the consulting firm McKinsey Global Institute comparing class size and student performance among several countries. Romney said the study found that "in schools that are the highest-performing in the world, their classroom sizes are about the same as in the United States. So it’s not the classroom size that’s driving the success of those school systems." He said factors such as parent involvement, motivated teachers and quality administrators were better drivers of success. Romney often cites McKinsey's research. His campaign pointed us to similar remarks Romney made in Orlando last September and in Nashua, N.H. in November. "I plotted the one versus the other, classroom size against student performance. And guess what? There was no relationship at all," he said in Orlando. The Obama campaign also cited his speech in The Villages, a retirement town in central Florida. Romney said Massachusetts data "showed that classroom size was not relevant in my state to how well the kids were doing." Finally, on page 216 of his book No Apology, Romney wrote, "in the United States, then, the effort to reduce classroom size may actually hurt education more than it helps." Romney’s campaign website makes no mention of class size but touts the importance of school choice and expanding access to "high-quality public charter schools." His campaign spokesman, Ryan Williams, pointed out that Obama’s education secretary, Arne Duncan, has also expressed skepticism about the emphasis on small classes. Our ruling Obama’s ad claims that "Mitt Romney says class sizes don’t matter." That's pretty much what he has said, saying that Massachusetts data "showed that classroom size was not relevant in my state to how well the kids were doing." We rate the claim True.

pomt-00449	"Red Alert: Major Signs of Voter Fraud Uncovered In Ohio."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2018/aug/20/americanjournalreviewcom/no-evidence-anyone-over-116-years-old-was-voting-o/	A website raised the specter of voter fraud in a hotly contested Ohio special election by saying dozens of people older than 116 are registered to vote in the district. "Red Alert: Major Signs of Voter Fraud Uncovered In Ohio," read the headline of the American Journal Review. But the facts are less sinister than the headline makes it sound. Here’s what you need to know. The post borrows heavily from an article posted on Breitbart by Eric Eggers, research director at the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit. Eggers wrote a story, which begins: "Republican Troy Balderson clings to a narrow margin in last night’s special election for Ohio’s 12th Congressional district, underscoring the impact voter fraud can have in key elections around the country," Eggers wrote. Eggers raised the prospect that people were impersonating dead voters, claiming that "72 voters over the age of 116 who ‘live’ in Balderson’s district cast ballots in the 2016 election." The Breitbart article links to a list of voter IDs of Ohioans whose birthdates are listed in 1901 or earlier. Eggers sent us the same information when we reached out to him. "Take into account the fact that there were 170 voters in the state of Ohio that were listed as older than 116," American Journal Review wrote. "These names still sat in Ohio’s 12th Congressional district’s rolls when the data was collected by GAI in August of 2017. "This is equivalent to 10 percent of the margin that Balderson is currently leading by, without provisional ballots. More than 72 percent of Ohio voters over 116 years old who are "living" in the district Balderson is running in voted in the 2016 election…" Considering the fact that the world’s oldest living person is 115 years old, and that the vote counts of the Democratic and Republican candidates were separated by roughly 1,700 votes the day after the election, we wanted to look into the allegation of the American Journal Review article that there were "major signs" of voter fraud. (At the time of this story’s publication, it appears that Republican Troy Balderson leads Democrat Danny O’Connor by 1,564 votes, but some absentee and provisional ballots still need to be counted. The results will be sent to the Ohio Secretary of State on Aug. 24. Balderson and O’Connor will face off again in November.) Indeed, there are 170 voters in the district listed with birthdays from 1901 or earlier. But the story builds a misleading impression by tying that fact to "voter fraud," where there is no evidence that dead people or people over 116 years old voted in the race. The story overlooks a plausible explanation for turn-of-the-century birthdays of 170 registered voters: Ohio didn’t require citizens to provide their dates of birth when registering to vote until 1974. Jan. 1 holds the spot The list of Ohio voters shows 170 voter IDs and corresponding dates of birth, all of which are listed as being in 1901 or earlier. But if you look closely, you’ll notice that almost all of the voters’ dates of birth are listed as one of three dates: Jan. 1, 1800, Jan. 1, 1900, or Jan. 1, 1901. The office of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted responded to several misleading stories about the special election in a press release. "State law has not always required Ohioans to provide their date of birth when registering to vote," they wrote. "Prior to June 1974, when House Bill 662 was passed requiring date of birth to register to vote, county boards of election used placeholder dates. This is why some registrations have dates like 1900 or 1800 listed." Husted doubled down in a tweet: "No one 116 or older is voting in Ohio elections. Voters who registered when DOB wasn't required have a placeholder date as their DOB. Often the year 1900 was used." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Outside elections experts said Husted’s explanation was valid. "Husted’s explanation is entirely credible and unremarkable," said Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School. The practice isn’t unique to Ohio. Other states have used placeholder dates of birth. In New Jersey in 2005, the birthdates of seven voters were listed as Jan. 1, 1880. A Brennan Center for Justice report concluded that the date "is most likely a system default for registrations lacking date-of-birth information." The fact that only 170 out of 8 million registered voters (0.002 percent of voters) in Ohio had incorrect birthdates is "pretty good," Levitt said. Our colleagues at Factcheck.org, debunking a similar article, actually spoke with some Ohio voters listed as 116 or older. "Although we couldn’t talk to everyone registered in the 12th District who was listed as being born in 1800 or 1900, we did talk to some of them and can confirm that they are living, breathing, eligible voters," Factcheck.org wrote. "Charles Hacker, of Mansfield, Ohio, is one of them. He registered to vote in 1973, according to the voter roll, and his birthdate is listed as Jan. 1, 1800. But he was actually born in 1944, he told FactCheck.org in a phone interview. He’s 74 years old." Our ruling An article from the American Journal Review claimed, "Red Alert: Major Signs of Voter Fraud Uncovered In Ohio," and went on to say that "170 voters in the state of Ohio that were listed as older than 116." The reality isn’t as fishy as the headline sounds. The story manipulates an oddity about Ohio’s voter database into a misleading narrative about voter fraud. While there are 170 voters listed as over 116 years old, that is almost definitely not their real birthdays. That’s because those voters likely registered to vote in Ohio before 1974, when they weren’t required to provide their date of birth. Because the voting record lacked these voters’ dates of birth, placeholder dates from 1800 and 1900 were used, the state’s Republican secretary of state said. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Correction Aug. 22, 2018: After we published this item, we heard from Eggers that his point wasn't accurately covered in this fact-check. As a result, we added additional information from Eggers and clarified the point of this fact-check, which was a suggestion made by some bloggers that Ohio's voter rolls were a sign of voter fraud.

pomt-11628	Says border fencing finished near El Paso in 2010 dramatically curtailed illegal crossings, local crime and drug smuggling.	half-true	/texas/statements/2018/jan/22/paul-sperry/commentator-el-paso-fencing-2010-drove-down-violen/	Conservative Paul Sperry highlighted fencing erected near El Paso a decade ago as evidence that President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall could enhance security. Sperry wrote in a January 2018 New York Post commentary that the fencing, described as completed in 2010, explains a dramatic decrease in violent crime in the West Texas city and plummets in illegal crossings and drug smuggling. We wondered about that after Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, promoted Sperry’s commentary on Twitter and Bob Moore, former executive editor of the El Paso Times, asserted in his own tweet that El Paso had low violent crime rates as far back as 2005 while illegal border crossings, Moore wrote, decreased for varied reasons around 2010 including the Great Recession. Sperry, whom we emailed without hearing back, wrote that once the fencing went up, illegal crossings and levels of violent crime and drug smuggling rapidly subsided and that since then, El Paso has consistently topped rankings for cities of 500,000 residents or more with low crime rates, based on FBI-collected statistics. We'd suggest that claims about any city’s safety rank be considered with caution. Such rankings are oft tied to FBI statistics that the agency counsels against using to rank or compare communities. We’ve also done several separate fact-checks noting flaws in claims about El Paso’s safety standing. On another front, it appears the fencing touted by Sperry was not finished in 2010. Ramiro Cordero, a spokesman for the Border Patrol’s El Paso sector, which takes in New Mexico, El Paso County and part of adjoining Hudspeth County, advised by email that from 2007 to approximately 2014, two types of fencing got built near the El Paso metro area: double-layered mesh 18 feet tall and mesh on movable barriers going up 22 feet. In 2009, David Aguilar of the Border Patrol specified at a U.S. Senate hearing that 626 miles of congressionally ordered fencing had been completed along the border. When fully built, Aguilar said, the additions would cover 661 miles from Texas into California, counting 115 miles each in New Mexico and Texas. Decreased ‘illegal alien’ apprehensions We explored each part of Sperry’s statement separately, starting with whether the new fencing greatly diminished border crossings. All along the southwestern border, it’s worth noting, apprehensions by the Border Patrol peaked in 2000 at 1.6 million (yearly total) and later generally declined starting around the time of the 2008-09 recession, Michelle Mittelstadt of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies worldwide immigration, has noted. Mittelstadt told PolitiFact in April 2017 that factors in Mexico had contributed to the drop-offs including lower birth rates, increased educational levels and an improved economy. In his commentary, Sperry wrote that according to Homeland Security data, "the number of deportable illegal immigrants located by the U.S. Border Patrol plummeted by more than 89 percent over the five-year period during which" the fencing between El Paso and neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was completed. Sperry said that when the El Paso fencing project "started in 2006, illegal crossings totaled 122,261, but by 2010, when the 131-mile fence was completed from one end of El Paso out into the New Mexico desert, immigrant crossings shrank to just 12,251. They hit a low of 9,678 in 2012, before slowly ticking back up to a total of 25,193 last year. But they’re still well below pre-fence levels, and the Border Patrol credits the fortified barrier dividing El Paso from Mexico for the reduction in illegal flows," Sperry wrote. We found that he accurately recapped government-posted tallies of "illegal alien apprehensions," which are generally used as a metric to measure illegal immigration. An exception: When we checked, the Border Patrol was reporting a slightly greater number of apprehensions in 2006, 122,656 making the 9,678 apprehensions in the sector in 2012 92 percent less than apprehensions in 2006. Unaddressed by Sperry: All along the nation’s southern border, according to the Border Patrol, apprehensions decreased each year from 2007 through 2011. That is, the agency’s pre-2017 low of 327,577 apprehensions in 2011 was down 69 percent from 1,071,972 apprehensions in 2006 and down 72 percent from 1,171,396 apprehensions in 2005. Border Patrol video singles out change in tactics Next, we reached out to the Border Patrol to ask about the fencing alone driving down apprehensions. We fielded no comment from Carlos A. Diaz, the agency’s Southwest Border branch chief, though he pointed us by email to a 2017 Customs and Border Protection video describing enforcement actions from 1992 through 2016 to stem illegal crossings. The El Paso portion of the video doesn’t mention fencing. Rather, it singles out the 285,000 apprehensions made in the El Paso sector in 1993--which a narrator says was the year that the Border Patrol implemented Operation Hold the Line at El Paso calling for the "forward deployment of agents and technology to high-traffic areas. "Focusing on prevention through deterrence," the narrator continues, "the strategy proved successful and apprehensions decreased over 70 percent" in the sector in one year "and in 2015, 14,495 apprehensions were made in the El Paso sector." That snippet led us to revisit federal tallies of apprehensions, which show both a post-1986 high of 285,981 apprehensions in the sector in 1993 and a 72 percent plummet to 79,688 apprehensions in 1994 though apprehensions increased the next two years, reaching 145,929 in 1996. In subsequent years through September 2017, the sector reported decreased apprehensions in 13 years and increased apprehensions in eight years; its 25,193 apprehensions in 2017 amounted to the sector’s third-most in a decade, possibly a reminder that economic conditions on both sides of the border, or unsafe conditions in parts of Central America, also can sway decisions to cross the Rio Grande. Other Border Patrol views When we asked, a couple of Border Patrol officers credited the El Paso fencing with enhancing enforcement. Doug Mosier, a Customs and Border Protection spokesman, said he’s worked as an El Paso-based agency public affairs officer since 1986. By email, Mosier said Operation Hold The Line "revolutionized the way that border security was conducted in terms of federal law enforcement prevention efforts." Mosier said Silvestre Reyes, later elected to the U.S. House, "had tried a similar strategy on a smaller scale when he was a Border Patrol chief in McAllen, Texas, and it worked well for that community." According to a 2013 El Paso Times news story, the approach instigated by Reyes, described as still in place, "called for the deployment of every available Border Patrol agent to different sites along 20 miles of the El Paso-Juarez border, roughly from Sunland Park, N.M., to the Zaragoza port of entry." Mosier elaborated to us: "So, as the chief of El Paso Sector in 1993, he essentially positioned as many U.S. Border Patrol agents as he could spare (approximately 250 agents) along a primary 20-mile stretch of border separating El Paso/Juarez, over a three-week period. The result was astounding, since illegal apprehensions immediately dropped by approximately 80-percent overnight. Crime and loitering also fell by the wayside in the downtown district, which was later substantiated in several surveys and polls taken by the El Paso Times, and the then--El Paso Herald Post. "At first the border community was in shock, but that soon gave way to widespread support which manifested in improved living conditions for residents in El Paso, and in some areas of N.M." The Times story said that after Hold the Line was implemented, Reyes went on to urge more strategic fencing. Mosier, asked to assess the effects of the fencing, said that when "primary pedestrian fencing (18-feet) was implemented in 2008, it provided effective infrastructure in much-needed areas of the border. It also improved USBP effectiveness by better directing illegal immigration into areas where Border Patrol had more resources to monitor traffic via technology, aircraft, combined with increased agent personnel. We said at that time, and still say today, that those combined resources, our strong working relationship with law enforcement partners, and the support by residents in El Paso were essential to the success of El Paso border security efforts," Mosier said. Cordero, who also told us he’s worked for the agency in the sector for 18 years, agreed the fencing helped reduce apprehensions but, he said, other enforcement activities and cooperation between law agencies and with Mexican authorities also mattered. Victor Manjarrez Jr. of the University of Texas at El Paso told us he was the sector chief when the fencing went up. By email, Manjarrez deemed the fencing a factor in driving down apprehensions along with increased Border Patrol personnel, expanded technology and infrastructure including lights and roads. "Although the pedestrian wall had a huge impact," Manjarrez said, "so did the increase in Border Patrol agents" driven by a 2004 congressional directive to beef up the agency. "I would disagree that the wall was the sole reason for the decline in criminal activity, but" it "was a MAJOR factor in improving the quality of life." El Paso crime Sperry wrote that FBI crime-rate information shows the fencing drove down crime in El Paso. In fact, Sperry wrote, El Paso before 2010 "was mired in violent crime and drug smuggling, thanks in large part to illicit activities spilling over from the Mexican side. Once the fence went up, however, things changed almost overnight." His commentary also said: "According to FBI tables, property crimes in El Paso have plunged more than 37 percent to 12,357 from their pre-fence peak of 19,702 a year, while violent crimes have dropped more than 6 percent to 2,682 from a peak of 2,861 a year." Moore countered in a post-publication tweet that El Paso’s violent crime rate was on the slide long before the fencing got built. Our search of the Nexis news database showed too that the El Paso County sheriff, Richard Wiles, told a U.S. Senate committee in 2009 that by that year, El Paso had been considered one of the country’s safest cities for a dozen years, "long before the new fence was built," Wiles testified. Moore, answering our request for more information, emailed us his spreadsheet suggesting that each year from 2000 through 2016, El Paso’s violent crime rate based on FBI data far trailed the average violent crime rate for like cities of 500,000 to 1 million residents. The FBI’s posted figures enabled us to confirm that El Paso’s violent crime rate trailed the national average for cities of 500,000 to 1 million residents from 1985 through 2016. The city’s rate also mostly decreased year to year, the figures indicate, though the city still saw 11 year-to-year increases with the biggest rate bump, 10 percent, occurring in 2008. Conversely, El Paso’s rate sank 10 percent or more 10 times in the 30 years including 1994, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006--all before the new fencing was mandated or fully installed--with the other big drops occurring in 1987 and 2013. Drug smuggling Sperry wrote that drug smuggling at the El Paso "border entry point has also fallen dramatically. In fact, since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half." "The year before the wall was fully built in 2010," Sperry went on, "the volume of illegal drugs confiscated by the feds along the El Paso border hit 87,725 pounds. The year after, the amount of drug seizures plummeted to 43,783 pounds. Last year, they dropped even further to a total of 34,329, according to Border Patrol reports obtained by The Post." We found slightly different figures. Regardless, a chart provided by Cordero showed that the dollar amount of illegal drug seizures in the El Paso sector substantially declined from 2007 through 2014, when the agency’s $35.2 million in seizures was more than 400 percent less than the nearly $151 million in seizures in 2006. While seizures escalated in 2015 and 2016, reaching $54 million, they declined to $39 million in 2017, the agency’s chart says. Drug Seizures, El Paso Sector, U.S. Border Patrol, Fiscal 2006 though Fiscal 2017 SOURCE: Email, Ramiro Cordero, agent, U.S, Border Patrol, El Paso sector, Jan. 18, 2018 We later ran these mostly reduced interdictions of illegal drugs past Sanho Tree, director of the Drug Policy Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, which calls itself "Washington’s first progressive multi-issue think tank." Tree said by phone he wasn’t aware of research on the effect of the El Paso fencing on drug smuggling. Yet generally, Tree said, declines in captured drugs don’t necessarily signal fall-offs in smuggling, which relies on frequent shifts in methodology extending to drones, tunnels, even catapults. "What you interdict shows you what you’re catching, it doesn’t show what you’re not catching," Tree said, adding that it’s hard to model the effects on smuggling of particular law enforcement tacks. Local police agencies didn’t engage with this fact-check. Sgt. Enrique Carrillo of the El Paso Police Department replied by email: "We are not commenting on this." Our requests to interview Sheriff Wiles went unfulfilled. Our ruling Sperry wrote that the fencing finished near El Paso in 2010 dramatically curtailed illegal crossings, local crime and drug smuggling. Such crossings evidently plunged after the fencing was built (though they later rebounded a bit) and it could be that drug smuggling fell off as well. Yet this claim fails to account for El Paso's violent crime rate trending down long before the fencing went up nor does it acknowledge other factors affecting security including a pre-1995 shift in enforcement strategy and stepped-up Border Patrol staffing. We give the fencing some, not all, credit and rate this statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-13013	Says Donald Trump "thinks stop-and-frisk is fine."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/dec/09/gwen-moore/us-rep-gwen-moore-d-milwaukee-says-donald-trump-th/	In a post-election interview that focused on incarceration and policing, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore was asked about Republican President-elect Donald Trump. And she made a claim about him and the controversial police practice called "stop-and-frisk" -- the practice of a police officer stopping and questioning a person, then patting the person down for weapons. Here was part of the exchange the Huffington Post had with the Milwaukee Democrat, according to an article posted Nov. 18, 2016: Question: Policing plays a huge role in our mass incarceration problem. Do you think policing could change at all under Trump? Moore: He’s shared a lot of stuff with us. He thinks stop-and-frisk is fine! (Former New York Mayor) Rudy Giuliani thinks it’s fine. And I don’t know where they’ll land in his administration. According to him, a lot of things he said and did were just Hollywood and bluster and now he’s going to be presidential. If stop-and-frisk was just part of the dog whistle he knew he needed to put out there to get all of the angry white men to come out of the rural areas to vote for him ― we don’t (know) if that was just something he said to get elected. So a lot of us are trying to be hopeful. So, where does Trump stand on stop-and-frisk? Trump statements As the campaign with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, entered its final weeks, Trump made headlines with comments about stop-and-frisk. On Sept. 21, 2016, at a Fox News-televised town hall at a church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, Trump called for wider use of stop-and-frisk to combat violent crime. An audience member had asked Trump how he would stop crime in the black community. Trump responded that stop-and-frisk would be one of the things he would do, adding: I think you have to [do it]. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive ….In New York City, it was so incredible the way it worked. Five days later, at the first presidential debate, moderator Lester Holt asked Trump what he would do to heal racial divides. Trump said: We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn’t be having it …. Moments later, Holt said: "The argument is that it’s a form of racial profiling" and Trump replied: No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn’t have them. These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn’t be — when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk. And later in the debate, Trump’s praise was more effusive when he said: In New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders …. Stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. Two parentheticals on Trump in the debate: He claimed stop-and-frisk was not ruled unconstitutional in New York. PolitiFact National rated the statement Mostly False. On his claim that stop-and-frisk "brought the crime way down" in New York City, the Washington Post Fact Checker observed: "Crime is affected by many factors, and New York’s decline in crime mirrored the decline in many other major cities at the time. Moreover, crime was declining for four years before Giuliani took office, and it continued to decline for 14 years after he left." It’s also worth noting that Trump’s support for stop-and-frisk goes back to at least 2013, when he said on Twitter: Stop and frisk works. Instead of criticizing @NY_POLICE Chief Ray Kelly, New Yorkers should be thanking him for keeping NY safe. And: If Stop & Frisk is struck down by the pandering NYC politicians, increases in crime & eventual terrorist attacks will be on them. We didn’t get a response when we asked Trump’s campaign about Moore’s claim. But we couldn’t find any statements indicating Trump has changed his position. Our rating Moore said Trump "thinks stop-and-frisk is fine." During the 2016 presidential campaign, less than two months before the election, Trump made a series of statements praising stop-and-frisk, repeating his claim that it reduces crime and saying the controversial police tactic should be used more broadly around the country. We rate Moore’s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/64fec69f-1f42-4623-a92a-ffab83b2c253	None	Gwen Moore	None	None	None	2016-12-09T09:00:00	2016-11-18	['None']
pomt-06754	"When lenders foreclose on homes, they typically suffer losses that exceed 30 percent of the value of the home."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/23/thaddeus-mccotter/thaddeus-mccotter-says-lenders-lose-30-percent-for/	First things first: You may not have heard of Thaddeus McCotter if you're not from Michigan. He's a Republican House member who's also running for the Republican nomination for president. McCotter wrote an op-ed for the National Review, published Aug. 16, 2011, laying out some of his ideas for restoring the nation's economic vitality. Some of his ideas are widely held by the Republican Party, such as reducing federal spending. But others are not: He suggests new regulations requiring banks to have 20 percent of their assets in the form of readily available capital. McCotter also has ideas for addressing the nation's foreclosure crisis: "Nearly 30 percent of homeowners have mortgages that exceed the value of their home. This is not necessarily their fault, as we have lived through the largest decline in home values in our history. Life savings have been wiped out. We need to take action to stop this devastation. When lenders foreclose on homes, they typically suffer losses that exceed 30 percent of the value of the home," McCotter writes. "Therefore, we need a voluntary program to offer homeowners a deal whereby, in exchange for reducing their mortgage debt to a level equal to 90 percent of home value, they would commit to pay their lender half of any future sale or refinance proceeds they receive." Such a plan would help lenders save on foreclosure costs and gain from future appreciation, he said. "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which currently own over half of home mortgages and are controlled by the federal government, should immediately make this offer to all their customers, and our bank regulators should adopt a rule assuring any bank that makes this offer to its mortgage borrowers that it will not suffer a reduction in the regulatory capital value of the mortgage. Any issues arising from implementing this proposal for mortgage-securities pools should be addressed so as to remove the obstacle," he said. "This plan will end the devastating foreclosure fever and stem the erosion of home values, once and for all." We can't say if McCotter's plan would work, but we were curious if foreclosures meant lenders suffered "losses that exceed 30 percent of the value of the home." So we decided to check it out. When you think about it, it's not an easy number to uncover, given the large numbers of transactions and lenders. A report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service summed up the situation like this: "Obtaining an estimate of foreclosure costs that can be attributed solely to the lender is difficult without proprietary data that is closely held by lenders and financial institutions. Many studies may provide a dollar value associated with foreclosure costs, but it is difficult to know how cost estimates were obtained without access to the proprietary data used in the studies." A 2008 briefing paper from Mortgage Bankers Association noted the many different costs lenders face in a typical foreclosure: lost principal and interest payments from the homeowner; continuing obligations for tax and insurance payments; costs for maintaining the property; lost service fees for handling normal mortgage payments; legal and administrative costs; costs for restoring the property to good condition for sale; and real estate commissions once the sale is complete. That's a lot of data to calculate as part of lender losses, and we found no national report that fully accounted for all of them. Having said that, there's still a good bit of evidence that suggests McCotter's number is likely right. It possible it's even too low. For one thing, the average sales price of foreclosures are running about 30 percent below the average sales price of non-foreclosure homes. RealtyTrac, publisher of the monthly U.S. Foreclosure Market Report, found that during the first three months of 2011, the average sales price of foreclosure properties was nearly 27 percent below the average sales price of properties not in foreclosure. That was unchanged from a 27 percent foreclosure in the fourth quarter of 2010 and up only slightly from the 26 percent foreclosure discount a year earlier. Daren Blomquist of RealtyTrac told us there are generally three reasons foreclosure properties fetch lower prices. The properties often are not in good condition. Lenders ask a lower price because they aren't as emotionally attached. And finally, buyers just expect foreclosure properties to be priced lower and won't pay the same price as a non-foreclosure property. Whatever the reason, those lower prices are in addition to the costs the lenders have to shoulder while the foreclosure is in process, which means McCotter's estimate very well could be on the low side. Another study we found looked at only the state of Massachusetts, but it looked at 20 years worth of data and controlled for the different types of houses sold. It concluded that foreclosure discounts are on average 27 percent of the value of a house. Again, this is a measure of prices, not a measure of what losses the lender actually realizes. McCotter's staff referred us to this study when we asked for evidence about his statement. Finally, the briefing paper from Mortgage Bankers Association said that lender losses could be 30 percent, or even more. "While losses can vary widely, several independent studies find them to be generally quite significant: over $50,000 per foreclosed home or as much as 30 to 60 percent of the outstanding loan balance." The report's conclusion also backed up McCotter's broader point: "For all the parties involved — the homeowner, the community, or the mortgage industry participants — foreclosures are a losing economic proposition. ... (It) is clear that lenders share the interest of homeowners and their communities to avoid foreclosure." In ruling on McCotter's statement, we want to be clear that we found no definitive national studies on what lenders lose when they foreclose on homes. Still, the evidence on pricing suggests that it could be in excess of 30 percent. Industry estimates also put the number at 30 percent or higher. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-13756	"We created 800,000 new jobs, we cut the unemployment rate almost in half and today New York State has more private sector jobs than it has ever had in its history"	true	/new-york/statements/2016/jul/22/andrew-cuomo/new-york-has-more-private-sector-jobs-ever/	During a press briefing in Ontario County earlier this month, Cuomo touted New York State’s economy. He cited labor force numbers when asked about a report on the START-UP NY program. The program produced fewer jobs in the past year than some would have liked. "You know that the economic development projects are working very well, and you know the economic development policy of the state is working very well because it’s in the numbers," Cuomo said. "This is all you need to know. We created 800,000 new jobs. We cut the unemployment rate almost in half. And, today New York State has more private sector jobs than it has ever had in its history, period, game over. It's working," Cuomo said. During a time when voters are split on the state’s direction, we checked the numbers to find out if Cuomo’s claim checks out. 800,000 new jobs Cuomo’s office says the 800,000 new jobs refers to those added in the private sector since he took office in 2011. New York State had 7,094,300 jobs in the private sector the month before Cuomo began his first term, according to the state Department of Labor. Since then, employment has mostly gone up each month, with the exception of nine months scattered across his two terms as governor. The latest number from the Department of Labor showed 7,889,000 private sector jobs as of May 2016. That’s just below 795,000 additional jobs in the private sector since Cuomo’s first month in office. So that part of his claim checks out. Cutting unemployment in half Cuomo’s claim about the unemployment rate being cut "almost in half" also refers to time since he took office in 2011. When he entered office, the statewide unemployment rate was 8.4 percent. That includes New York City, Long Island and the rest of the state. Although unemployment steadily climbed from 2011 to 2012, the governor correctly claims the unemployment rate is lower since he took office. By May, the unemployment rate had dropped to 4.7 percent, almost half what it was when Cuomo took office. More private sector jobs than ever Cuomo also claimed New York State had more private sector jobs than ever before in the state’s history. Much like the state’s population, the workforce has inched up over time. The state seasonally adjusts its jobs report, taking into account seasonal jobs like construction work in the summer and retail employment during the holiday season at the end of the year. Before Cuomo took office, the number of private sector jobs peaked at nearly 7.3 million in April 2008, when David Paterson served as governor. The nearly 7.9 million such jobs in May, as reported by the Labor Department, shows Cuomo’s claim to be true. There are now more private sector jobs in New York State than there has ever been before. There are also more people living in New York State than ever before, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. So the labor force has grown over time as well. Our ruling During a press briefing in Ontario County, Gov. Cuomo told a group of reporters that 800,000 jobs had been created, the unemployment rate fell by almost half, and the state had more private sector jobs than ever before. We reviewed data from the Department of Labor to check Cuomo’s claim. We rate it to be True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/25db535b-412c-4788-bbcd-ce9660d5c1e9	None	Andrew Cuomo	None	None	None	2016-07-22T13:19:20	2016-07-08	['None']
pomt-15284	"One of the reasons I believe we’re in trouble in Yemen is we lost the population on drone strikes issues. That’s what stirred up the population. That’s what is happening in Yemen."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/jul/26/lincoln-chafee/chafee-says-drone-strikes-drive-unrest-yemen/	Lincoln Chafee campaigned for president in New Hampshire last month proudly showcasing his foreign policy credentials based in large part on his opposition to the Iraq war. He also had some things to say about U.S. policy in Yemen. The targeting of al-Qaida terrorists with drones has killed militants and civilians in recent years. And many Yemenis have called on the Obama administration to end drone strikes, which Chafee refers to as "extrajudicial killings." "No more drone strikes," Chafee said in New Hampshire. "One of the reasons I believe we’re in trouble in Yemen is we lost the population on drone strikes issues. That’s what stirred up the population. That’s what is happening in Yemen." The New America Foundation has counted 114 strikes in Yemen, all but one since 2009, with 15 this year responsible for 57 deaths. The foundation bases this information on "credible news reports." Have drone strikes turned the Yemen population against the U.S.? Is that the main issue? We ask because there’s been heavy fighting in Yemen over the past eight months between Houthi rebels and Yemeni government forces backed by Saudi airstrikes. Cultural heritage sites have been destroyed. Food is in short supply. Rebels have chased the president from the capital city. And, according to a June 25 report in The New York Times, the warfare has displaced a million people. So why does Chafee place such a heavy emphasis on U.S. drone strikes? We asked Chafee’s spokeswoman, Debbie Rich, to provide evidence to support the candidate’s June 14 comments. An article provided by Rich from The Long War Journal, a respected source on the fight against terrorism, tells the story of a Yemeni provincial deputy governor, also the son of a prominent tribal leader, who was killed by a 2010 drone strike. At the other extreme, Rich also emailed an April 2014 Rolling Stone article, filled with the voices of Yemenis angered by U.S. drone strikes that have killed civilians. In addition, Peter Schaapveld, a British psychiatrist quoted in the Middle East Monitor, asserted that 99 percent of the people he met during a one-week visit to Yemen were suffering drone-related post traumatic stress syndrome. The fear of drones in Yemen, is "traumatizing an entire generation," according to a quote in Rolling Stone. However, other experts we talked to say that what was happening in Yemen had a lot less to do with drones and a lot more to do with the war between militant Houthis, who are Shiite Muslims, and the current government, which is backed by the U.S. and by neighboring Saudi Arabia — a Sunni Muslim nation. Bruce Riedel, a Brookings Institution scholar with high-level foreign policy experience, including work for the Obama administration in 2009, wrote an analysis of the situation in Yemen one day after Chafee spoke. Riedel’s analysis doesn’t include a word about drones. "It is safe to say that Yemen's civil war, the humanitarian catastrophe that it faces and the Saudi intervention in the country are not caused by drone strikes," Riedel told us in an email. "Yemen's problems are much more complex than a result of the drones." A more recent NPR clip provided by Rich, from January, includes comments from another Brookings Institution expert, Ibrahim Sharqieh, who asserted that U.S. drone strikes had contributed to instability in the country. But Sharqieh also blames the international community for ignoring the situation in Yemen over a two- to three-year period, not drones, when he talks about a solution to Yemen’s latest tumult. Another Yemen expert, Shaul Gabbay, a former professor at the University of Denver, asserts that it’s "a very large leap" to suggest that dissatisfaction with drone policy at the local level is an explanation "for what is happening in Yemen." "For example, the fact that Iran is interested in destabilizing Yemen from the much more important macro conflict, arising from the Shiite/Sunni conflict, does not have anything to do with the specific use of drones," he said. And while surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center in other countries, including Pakistan and Jordan, have documented strong opposition to the targeting of militants with drones, no public opinion surveys have been done in Yemen. And the director of Pew’s Global Attitudes surveys warns against making judgments about public opinion in the absence of a credible survey. Our ruling There is strong evidence that the U.S. drones in Yemen have antagonized many Yemenis who might have been allies in the fight against al-Qaida. But Chafee takes a big leap when he suggests that because of drone strikes "we lost the population" — especially when there are no public opinion polls to back him up. Others argue that a civil war, with little link, if any, to drone strikes, is what’s driving unrest in Yemen, pushing about one million people out of their homes. That makes more sense to us.

pomt-01741	Says U.S. Senate candidate Cory Gardner "blocked immigration reform" and "voted to deport our DREAMers."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/04/service-employees-international-union-committee-po/seius-spanish-language-ad-claims-cory-gardner-bloc/	Looking to mobilize Hispanic voters around immigration, the Service Employees International Union released Spanish-language radio ads in Colorado, California and Nevada criticizing select Republicans for the House’s failure to move a bill on the issue. One of them is Rep. Cory Gardner, the Colorado Republican challenging Democratic Sen. Mark Udall. "It’s simply unacceptable: (Reps.) Mike Coffman and Cory Gardner, together with the Republicans, have blocked immigration reform," the ad says, according to a translation provided by SEIU. "Worse yet, they voted to deport our DREAMers." We’re closely watching the Colorado Senate race, so for this fact-check, we’re just going to focus on Gardner’s immigration record. Blocked immigration reform? Notably, Gardner was one of the lone Republicans to stand and applaud President Barack Obama’s call for immigration reform in his 2014 State of the Union address. "I think we can all agree that the system is broken," Gardner said after the speech. So far the House has not acted, and prospects are dim for action before the fall elections. That means Gardner hasn’t had the opportunity to actually vote on legislation, making it hard to attribute any blame to him. It’s not as though he holds any leadership positions where he could have advanced legislation or held up the process. When senators introduced a bipartisan bill in January 2013, Gardner — who called on Republicans to take on immigration reform a day after winning reelection in 2012 — said the legislation was a beginning. "I am glad that our country is starting to have a serious conversation about how to repair our broken immigration system — it is long overdue," Gardner said in a statement. He made similar comments four months later as the immigration debate heated up. "Some people are slamming the bill, and I'm not one of them," Gardner told the Denver Post. "I think it's a good first step, but I don't know if it's 100 percent there." The Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill in June 2013 on a 68-32 vote. The package included $40 billion in border enforcement over the next decade and provided a 13-year path to citizenship for the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants. At this point Gardner said he "would not vote for" the Senate bill because it "moves the ball down the field without ensuring borders are secure." But he has continued to advocate for the House to put forth their own legislation. So Gardner might not like the Senate bill, but he has repeatedly called for the House to take up the issue. Voted to deport our DREAMers? In June 2012, the Obama administration announced a two-year moratorium on the deportation of some children brought to United States illegally by their parents. These kids — often called DREAMers, a nod to the DREAM Act that has failed to pass Congress — would instead be able to live in the United States without the immediate threat of deportation if they applied, met certain criteria and avoided criminal activity. A year later, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, introduced an amendment to a Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill that would block Obama’s ability to enforce this executive action. Effectively, the status quo prior to Obama’s maneuver would resume, meaning these children could once again be deported. The amendment passed, but the entire bill died in the Senate. A SEIU spokeswoman noted that Gardner voted for the King amendment. Gardner’s campaign, however, disagreed with SEIU’s characterization of it as a vote to "deport our DREAMers." Rather, a spokesman said the vote was a protest against Obama’s executive overreach. His campaign also noted that the text of the amendment did not direct DREAMers be deported and only addressed Obama’s actions. That stance appears to be backed up by Gardner’s rhetoric. During a July 2013 House immigration hearing, Gardner called the children of illegal immigrants "culturally American" and said they should be allowed to stay. "I believe members across the aisle can unite and agree that providing these children with some sort of immigration relief is the just and fair thing to do," Gardner said. "The children do deserve to have the opportunity to continue the American dream and we, as members of Congress, should have the compassion to provide them with this." More recently, Gardner said that children of illegal immigrants who join the military should be given citizenship. As we were researching the ad, the House once again passed a measure that — similar to the 2013 King amendment — would have ended Obama's deportation delay for DREAMers. Gardner was one of 11 Republicans to vote against the bill. Our ruling SEIU said Gardner "blocked immigration reform" and "voted to deport our DREAMers." While Republicans in the House have not moved forward on immigration, Gardner himself has repeatedly advocated for his colleagues to take up the issue. There are plenty of obstacles to passing a bill in the House, but Gardner does not appear to be one of them. Gardner did vote for an amendment that effectively would have ended Obama’s two-year delay in deporting certain children of illegal immigrants. However, he said that was a move against Obama’s unilateral action, and not the DREAMers. Indeed, he has actually called for permanent status for children brought to the U.S. illegally, including citizenship for those who join the military. We rate the statement from SEIU as Mostly False.

pomt-10007	Obama's proposed budget "doubles the debt in five years, triples it in 10 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/25/judd-gregg/judd-gregg-says-obamas-budget-doubles-national-deb/	You remember Judd Gregg, the Republican senator from New Hampshire tapped by President Obama to be commerce secretary. He was one of Obama's celebrated bipartisan Cabinet picks, but then withdrew his nomination in February, citing "irresolvable conflicts" with the Obama agenda. Conflicts indeed. This week, Gregg has appeared on several news programs lambasting Obama's proposed 2010 budget, saying it runs up so much debt "it basically will bankrupt our children and our children's children." In what has become a familiar talking point from Republican opponents, Gregg told Fox News on March 25 that Obama's budget "doubles the (national) debt in five years, triples it in 10 years." To check the claim, we relied on an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, released on March 20. The CBO, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, projects that the national debt will go from $5.8 trillion in 2008 to $11.8 trillion by the end of 2013; and to $17.3 trillion in 2019. By that count, Gregg's claim of doubling the debt in five years, tripling it in 10 years, is correct. But we think that's a little unfair. In January, the CBO projected the one-year 2009 deficit at $1.2 trillion. Remember, that's the 2009 fiscal year, which began in October 2008. That deficit was worse because of the recession, and grew because of a financial bailout plan in the fall. To be fair, we don't think Obama's record ought to be saddled with something that passed under President Bush. So let's add that $1.2 trillion that was largely started under Bush to the $5.8 trillion in national debt accumulated through fiscal year 2008. That comes to roughly $7 trillion. Under that scenario, the CBO's projections don't quite translate to a doubling of the national debt in 5 years ($7 trillion to $11.8 trillion). Nor does it fully support the claim that the debt would triple in 10 years ($7 trillion to $17.3 trillion). But it's not outrageously off either. In another item, we looked at Obama's claim that his budget plan would cut the deficit in half in five years. We found that while technically true, it is a bit misleading because it uses 2009's massive deficit as a comparator. Obama and others in his administration have cited this stat along with sentiments that we can't "pass on our problems to the next generation." This is a good time to note the difference between the deficit, a calculation of the difference between what the government takes in versus what it spends in any given year, as opposed to the national debt, which is a running tally of what the U.S. government owes. That's why it's possible that Obama is technically accurate when he says the CBO projects his plan will halve the deficit in five years; while the national debt will grow by $4.6 trillion over the same stretch. "It's the biggest transfer of debt onto future generations in American history," said Brian Riedl, a research fellow in federal budget policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. The Obama administration's projections aren't as dire as the CBO's. While the CBO projects the national debt to rise $9.3 trillion in 10 years; the administration projects it will grow by $7 trillion. In a prime-time news conference on March 24, Obama said the difference is due to the administration's slightly more optimistic outlook on future economic growth. Obama warned not to place too much stock in the "out years" of budget projections because "none of us know exactly what's going to happen six or eight or 10 years from now." And, he said, it's just his first of many budgets moving forward. As for Gregg's claim, we think that based on CBO projections, his numbers come up a little short of "double in five years, triple in 10." But they're not grossly misrepresentative of the CBO's projections, which we think is as fair a measure as any. And so we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-09027	As a senator, Barack Obama supported "an amendment that basically gutted the legal temporary worker program."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/07/john-mccain/john-mccain-said-barack-obama-voted-against-part-i/	Back in 2007, Congress came close to hammering out legislation to overhaul laws about immigration, but the deal collapsed in the Senate. Three years later, that failure is still being discussed and dissected. It came up again on ABC News' This Week, in a question for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Host Jake Tapper first showed video of a speech President Barack Obama gave on July 1, 2010. "Under the leadership of Senator Kennedy and Senator John McCain, we worked across the aisle to help pass a bipartisan bill through the Senate," Obama said. "And now, under the pressures of partisanship and election year politics, many of the 11 Republican senators who voted for reform in the past have now backed away from their previous support." "Senator, that's you he's talking about," Tapper said. "Why have you backed away from comprehensive immigration reform, which you spoke so passionately about in 2006 and 2007?" McCain responded, "I don't enjoy bringing this up, but the fact is, then-Senator Obama supported amendments which would have gutted the proposal that we had before the United States Senate, which he said he would propose, an amendment that basically gutted the legal temporary worker program." McCain phrases his statement a little awkwardly, but we wanted to know if it was true that Obama supported amendments that would have derailed the temporary worker program. It turns out we actually looked at this issue before; McCain made a similar charge during the election of 2008 as evidence that Obama was willing to engage in partisanship when it suited his purposes. Back then, he said Obama "voted for and even sponsored amendments that were intended to kill the (immigration overhaul) legislation." In his 2008 broadside against Obama, and again Sunday on This Week, McCain refers to a series of votes the Senate took in early June 2007 at a particularly sensitive time in the immigration debate. The following is a a recap of our previous reporting, but the history on those 2007 negotiations hasn't changed. The immigration issue scrambled the usual political divisions between Democrats and Republicans. President Bush supported comprehensive legislation and reached out to Democrats after they gained control of Congress in 2006. Some Republicans opposed the plan, criticizing the citizenship provisions as amnesty and saying that border security needed bolstering instead. Some Democrats, though, opposed it as well, because their allies in organized labor were against more non-citizens being allowed into the U.S.to work. McCain, together with the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., worked out a compromise measure that included several pillars: a path to citizenship for workers illegally in the country, increased border security, improved enforcement of employment law, and more visas for temporary workers. The Senate took up the compromise package, with supporters warning that it could be derailed by any amendments that changed its substance. On June 6, Obama proposed an amendment to end after five years a new merit-based system for awarding green cards that confer permanent resident status. The new system would have apportioned green cards based on the nation's economic needs and moved away from the existing system, which rewards family ties. A coalition of immigrant rights groups endorsed Obama's measure, saying the new system would discriminate in favor of immigrants with higher education and training in specialty occupations. But Obama's amendment was unsuccessful; the Senate rejected it, 42-55. Hours later, though, Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., offered an amendment to end after five years a different program, one that allowed more temporary workers. Dorgan said the program would bring in cheap labor through the back door and squeeze out American workers. Supporters of reform warned that the amendment could scuttle the deal, but the Senate adopted the amendment in a 49-48 vote, with Obama voting with Dorgan. The bill's supporters branded Dorgan's effort a "deal-breaker." Soon after, the legislation collapsed amid three failed votes to cut off debate on June 7, 2007. Obama was on the losing end of these votes, so he was voting to allow the bill to go forward. Immigration experts we spoke with in 2008 said that Obama was one of a host of senators who tried to influence the package, but was not a pivotal participant in the debate. Obama did, however, vote for Dorgan's amendment, which is what McCain was referencing. Among experts who wanted the bill to pass, we found mixed opinion on the importance of the Dorgan amendment limiting temporary workers. Tamar Jacoby, president of ImmigrationWorks USA, said that Dorgan's amendment significantly undermined a critical provision allowing more workers into the U.S. Jacoby's organization represents employers, who favored more temporary workers. "Everyone thinks that amnesty is the big debate," Jacoby said. "But whether or not we're going to have worker visas is an equally important debate." Obama's vote on the Dorgan amendment may not have killed the bill, she said, but it was "a profound misunderstanding of what reform was about." Another point of view, though, is that the Dorgan amendment was a minor bump in the road, and something that could have been stripped out later. That's the view of Frank Sharry, now executive director of America's Voice, a left-leaning, pro-immigration group. The Dorgan amendment, Sharry said, was payback for a successful amendment supported by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that would have removed confidentiality from applications for citizenship, to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants who were refused citizenship. Both the Cornyn and the Dorgan amendments would have come out later, before the bill could move toward final passage, he said. "The Cornyn amendment rocked the boat one way, and the Dorgan amendment rocked the boat the other way, so it was a rocking boat," Sharry said. He rejected the idea that the Dorgan amendment sunk the deal, and as evidence, he pointed to the fact that weeks later, the Senate tried again to revive the package. On June 28, 2007, the bill went down yet again when it failed still another cloture vote. Obama voted to move forward then, too. We should note that back when we looked at the issue during the 2008 election, we found McCain went too far in his rhetoric, and we rated his statement Half True. Here, McCain's statement is a bit more limited and therefore more precise. He said that Barack Obama supported an amendment "that basically gutted the legal temporary worker program." Clearly Obama did vote for a bill that would have curtailed the legal temporary worker program, an important part of comprehensive immigration package. Still, Obama did cast other votes to move the bill forward. We feel it's important to note that the vote was not a clear-cut refusal of the entire package. So we rate McCain's statement Mostly True.

pomt-10427	"The White House is won in the swing states, and I am winning the swing states."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/16/hillary-clinton/numbers-dont-add-up/	Facing long odds in her quest to win the Democratic nomination, Sen. Hillary Clinton has been making the case that she would be a stronger candidate in the general election because she has won primaries and caucuses in important states. "The White House is won in the swing states, and I am winning the swing states," she said in a speech in Charleston, W.Va. on May 13, 2008, after she defeated Sen. Barack Obama in the West Virginia primary. Clinton is right that a handful of swing states are crucial to winning the general election, but her math doesn't add up. First, a caveat: Just because a candidate wins a primary in a given state does not mean the candidate has an upper hand in that state in the general election. "That's the most important fact here," said Amy Walter, editor of National Journal's "Hotline," a political Web site. "Primary success in a state is no indicator of future success." That's because primary elections are very different than general elections. Primary voters tend to be more partisan and more active in politics, so candidates adapt their messages to appeal to them. In a general election, the candidates can usually depend on support from their own party, so they focus more on moderates and independents. Also, many states lean toward one party, so a victory or loss in a primary does not indicate how the state will go in November. For example, Obama lost Massachusetts to Clinton. Yet if he is the nominee, he is a strong favorite because Massachusetts has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1984. Still, Clinton argues that she is more popular with core Democrats, the white working-class voters who she says will be the party's base in the swing states. So let's examine whether she has indeed won more of those states. Pundits and campaign strategists generally agree that there are about 14 battleground states -- Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. For our purposes, we'll examine all except Michigan because Obama was not on the primary ballot there. But it's also important to point out that the candidates agreed not to campaign in Florida, and some Democrats don't consider the Florida results a valid measurement of Obama's strength in the state. Clinton has won the primaries or caucuses in six of them -- Florida, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Ohio, New Mexico and Nevada. Obama has also won six -- Virginia, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado and Washington. And he's favored to win Oregon's primary on May 20. So to recap the score: Clinton 6, Obama 6 (plus Oregon if he wins as expected). That doesn't sound like she's "winning" the swing states. She's exaggerating her strength in those states, so we find her statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-05-16T00:00:00	2008-05-13	['White_House']

pomt-10453	Rev. Wright said "that al-Qaida and the American flag were the same flags."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/30/john-mccain/to-score-a-point-mccain-misses-the-point/	For months, Sen. John McCain refused to weigh in on controversial statements made in sermons by Sen. Barack Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. McCain even chastised the North Carolina Republican Party for political ads that featured Wright. But after Barack Obama acknowledged to Fox News that "the fact he's my former pastor I think makes it a legitimate political issue," McCain took the opportunity to take his own swipe at the political pinata known as the Rev. Wright. In a news conference in Coral Gables, Fla., on April 27, McCain claimed that the Rev. Wright said "that al-Qaida and the American flag were the same flags." That's not exactly what Wright said. In his sermon on April 13, 2003, the one made famous on YouTube because he used the phrase "God damn America," Wright was making a point about Americans — and President Bush in particular — invoking God's name to justify the war in Iraq. "We can see clearly the confusion in the mind of a few Muslims, and please notice I did not say all Muslims, I said a few Muslims, who see Allah as condoning killing and killing any and all who don't believe what they don't believe. They call it jihad. We can see clearly the confusion in their minds, but we cannot see clearly what it is that we do. We call it crusade when we turn right around and say that our God condones the killing of innocent civilians as a necessary means to an end. We say that God understands collateral damage. We say that God knows how to forgive friendly fire." "We say that God will bless the shock and awe as we take over unilaterally another country, calling it a coalition because we've got three guys from Australia, going against the United Nations, going against the majority of Christians, Muslims and Jews throughout the world, making a pre-emptive strike in the name of God. We cannot see how what we are doing is the same thing that al-Qaida is doing under a different color flag — calling on the name of a different God to sanction and approve our murder and our mayhem." Wright never said the two flags are the same. His point is that the two are the same inasmuch as some from both sides use God to justify their cause. Now, that fuller context may not make people any more comfortable. But McCain's simplification of Wright's statement distorts its meaning. We rate McCain's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11511	"The majority of Georgians incarcerated in local jails have never been convicted of crime. They are simply too poor to pay their bail."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2018/feb/21/stacey-abrams/majority-georgians-jail-locked-being-too-poor-pay-/	Stacey Abrams says Georgia must change its criminal justice system so that people are not kept in jail just because they can't pay for bail. People with money "can artfully navigate the criminal justice system and maybe even avoid it altogether," but those who are poor are often overwhelmed by the system, said Abrams, a former Georgia House minority leader who’s running to become the state’s next governor. "The majority of Georgians incarcerated in local jails have never been convicted of crime. They are simply too poor to pay their bail," Abrams said on her campaign website. Is that true? Recent state data indicates that about 64 percent of people in Georgia jails are awaiting trial. It’s unclear how many of them could not pay for bail, but experts said this is the case for many people nationwide and in other states. Data on incarceration and convictions in Georgia jails As of December 2017, there were 37,340 inmates in jail in Georgia, according to county jail inmate population report published by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs. And 64 percent of them were awaiting trial, the document said. (A more recent population report with inmate data as of Jan. 4 shows a slightly lower inmate count, but the share awaiting trial remains 64 percent.) That tracks with a February 2018 report from the Georgia Council on Criminal Justice Reform. It said also that as of early 2018, 64 percent of all jail inmates were awaiting trial. Abrams’ campaign also pointed to 2015 data published by Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit group trying to end mass incarceration. Its data showed that more than 50 percent of people in Georgia jails in 2015 were in pretrial. Still, those statistics don’t necessarily back up Abrams' point because of her word choice. Claiming that "the majority of Georgians incarcerated in local jails have never been convicted of crime," is a broad claim that could be false depending on the interpretation of the word "never," said William Sabol, a professor in criminal justice and criminology in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University. For instance, if by "never" she meant "ever in one’s life," then that is likely to be an over-interpretation of the data in the report, Sabol said, because some individuals may have had prior convictions. The Georgia state report did not indicate how many people were jailed because they could not pay for bail. For this part of the claim, Abrams’ team referenced a national study. Several experts told us they did not have Georgia-specific data on individuals who could not afford bail, but did not dispute the likelihood of Georgia mirroring trends nationwide and from other states. "Data on other states indicate that a majority of individuals in jails (as opposed to prisons) are present due to failure to make bail, and so are awaiting criminal trial prior to sentencing," said Arpit Gupta, an assistant professor of finance at NYU's Stern School of Business who has researched the bail system and its impact on low-income defendants. "I don’t know about Georgia specifically, but it doesn’t surprise me that such a large percentage of incarcerated people — especially in local jails — are there awaiting trial because they can’t afford bail," said Nancy La Vigne, vice president for the Justice Policy Center at Urban Institute. Some states are eliminating the cash bail system, which is reducing their daily jail populations significantly, she said. A 2016 national report from Prison Policy Initiative said that most people who can’t meet bail "fall within the poorest third of society." "Examining the median pre-incarceration incomes of people in jail makes it clear that the system of money bail is set up so that it fails: the ability to pay a bail bond is impossible for too many of the people expected to pay it," the report said. "In fact, the typical black man, black woman and Hispanic woman detained for failure to pay a bail bond were living below the poverty line before incarceration." Using Bureau of Justice Statistics data and in 2015 dollars, the report said, people in jail had a median annual income of $15,109 prior to their incarceration, or less than half (48 percent) of the median for people of similar ages who were not in jail. Still, financial constraints aren’t the only reasons why some individuals remain in jail before conviction, said Sabol, the Georgia State University professor. "Some offenders are detained without bail or with bail set at very, very high amounts because they are perceived to be a danger to the community (preventive detention) or the seriousness of the crime was such that bail was denied," Sabol said. "That is a different issue from an inability to pay bail." In Georgia, bail may be denied under certain circumstances to individuals charged with felony offenses, but judges are legally prohibited from denying pretrial bail to individuals charged with a misdemeanor, said the report from the Georgia Council on Criminal Justice Reform. "Consequently, the crucial question for misdemeanants in Georgia is not whether they will get bail, but the amount at which it will be set," the report said. The council spotlighted a case involving the city of Calhoun and Maurice Walker. In 2015, Walker was arrested in Calhoun for public intoxication and spent six days in jail because he could not afford to pay the $160 fixed bail amount. Walker sued the city, alleging its bail practice violated due process and equal protection clauses under the Fourteenth Amendment. In 2016, a court issued a preliminary injunction ordering Calhoun to implement post-arrest procedures complying with the Constitution, and told the city it could not keep individuals accused of misdemeanors in custody only because they could not afford a monetary bond, the report said. The case is under appeal. Our ruling Abrams said, "The majority of Georgians incarcerated in local jails have never been convicted of crime. They are simply too poor to pay their bail." State data shows that the majority of people in county jails are awaiting trial. A criminal justice professor cautioned that claiming they "have never been convicted of crime" could be an overstatement, since some individuals may have had prior convictions. The state report did not indicate how many people were jailed because they could not afford bail. Yet experts told us that based on national trends, it’s possible that many Georgians in jail are there because they cannot pay for bail for current charges.

pomt-06366	Says the giant African land snail "carries human meningitis."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/nov/03/adam-putnam/florida-ag-chief-adam-putnam-says-floridas-giant-s/	Florida is now home to a slime-oozing plant-chowing snail the size of a teacup Chihuahua, and Adam Putnam wants to make sure that's temporary. The giant African land snail can grow up to 8 inches, live nearly a decade, devour indiscriminately, lay 500 eggs at a time and snack on stucco for the calcium to build its shiny brown shell striped with cream. It's a backyard horror and an agricultural nightmare. Putnam, the state's agriculture commissioner, also says it carries disease. The 1,000-snail invasion of a South Florida neighborhood became news in mid September. It's the biggest outbreak reported since the 1960s, when the state spent $1 million over the course of a decade battling three smuggled-in snails of a Miami boy that became 18,000. Last weekend, CBS News Sunday Morning featured the snails along with other invasive species, from Illinois' Asian carp (fish) to Georgia's kudzu (plant). Southwest Miami homeowners described the "disgusting," "slithery," "juicy" pests. Putnam explained the public threat. "With something like the snails we've got the trifecta," Putnam said. "It carries human meningitis, so people are concerned. It eats 500 different plants, so agriculture's concerned. And it eats houses, so homeowners are very concerned." Leaf- and stucco-chomping? Check. Just ask the snails' Miami neighbors. But disease-carrying? PolitiFact Florida decided to check it out. About that disease: Your brain and spinal column are protected by membranes called meninges. When they get inflamed, that's meningitis. Often there's a bacteria or virus that causes the swelling, but you might also hit your head, get cancer or take certain drugs and end up with the illness. Or get a fungus. Or a parasite. Around the world, giant African land snails are known for carrying a parasite, one that spends part of its life in rats, that can cause a rare form of meningitis. (Most people fully recover without treatment.) It's known as the rat lungworm, or Angiostrongylus cantonensis. Snails — and prawns and crabs and frogs — pick up baby rat lungworms from rat droppings. Other animals who chow down on tasty raw crab or frog legs or snail guts pick up the larvae and can end up with the brain infection. Animals can also get it from eating unwashed snail-slimed greens, or from rubbing snail mucus into their eyes or noses or mouths. That group includes humans. Who eats giant snails? Plenty of folks, if not so many in the United States. Just consider escargot, the tasty French preparation of smaller, corn-fed snails doused in butter, garlic and herbs. Their meatier big brothers are an important protein source in coastal Nigeria. You can order them in a New York restaurant for $10. But it's not cooked snails that are the problem — for the same reason most folks don't eat raw shrimp or raw meat in general, for that matter. You heat them first, to kill uninvited disease-causing guests. It's the undercooked or raw ones that can be a problem. And also other exposure to slime. Take two cases of meningitis in Louisiana: In one, an 11-year-old boy had eaten a small raw snail on a dare. In another, a 22-year-old had eaten two raw legs from a green tree frog — also on a dare. (Note to America's youth: Don't do dares!) Then there is Florida's infamous case of giant snail slime exposure last year, where an African holy man poured the stuff into mouths of followers hoping for healing. Instead, they got violently ill — though not of meningitis. In England, giant African land snails are novelty pets that live in terrariums and sometimes crawl on their owners. Where's the meningitis worry? Snails that don't have a chance to pick up baby rat lungworms can't give them to you. Pet snails that haven't lived in the wild don't carry the parasite, which require rats to complete their life cycle. No parasite-incubating rats, no rat lungworms. No snail-caused meningitis. The parasite is found in snails in the South Pacific, Asia, Australia and the Caribbean. It shows up in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, with sightings in Louisiana and Mississippi. Florida had its rat lungworm scare in 2003, when a gibbon at Miami Metrozoo suddenly fell ill. It could have been a sign the rat lungworm had made it into the state's rats, snails, frogs and shrimp. Or it could have simply been infected monkey food from overseas. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services dispatched a biologist, John Teem, to test snails around the zoo, said spokesman Sterling Ivey. He never found rat lungworm. He's tested some of the state's apple snails — an invasive species — and hasn't found rat lungworm. This year, when the Southwest Miami neighbors started to notice their garden snails seemed larger and more prolific than normal, Teem tested those, too. Even in the giant African land snails, he didn't find rat lungworm. The state health department doesn't track meningitis caused by the parasite. Neither do the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's exceedingly rare in the United States. Even in Hawaii, where the parasite's common, just five such cases in one year prompted academic study. On Sunday, TV-watchers saw Putnam, the state's agricultural authority, warn them on national television about the snail's triple threat: house-eating, plant-devouring and disease-carrying. He didn't mention the disease hasn't been found in the state — and where it's been found in America, it's exceedingly rare. Or that to get it, you've got to eat a raw snail or get its mucus in your eyes or nose or eat unwashed snail-slimed produce. Frequently, information sources point out that the giant African land snail can carry a meningitis-causing parasite. Putnam said, "We've got the trifecta," and said the snail "carries human meningitis." He leaves out some crucial details — most importantly, that the parasite that causes the disease hasn't yet been found in the state. And for that, we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-11729	"Update: van full of illegals caught voting at multiple Alabama polling locations."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/13/nofakenews-online/no-undocumented-immigrants-were-not-caught-voting-/	Democrats used another dirty trick in an attempt to defeat Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore by having undocumented immigrants vote. At least that’s what an article circulating on Facebook claims. "Update: van full of illegals caught voting at multiple Alabama polling locations," states a headline on nofakenews.online Dec. 12. Moore lost to Democrat Doug Jones in a special election to replace Jeff Sessions on Dec. 12. The Washington Post reported in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper. Facebook users flagged the nofakenews.online post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat misinformation. The article is deliberately false and comes from a website that claims to be satire. The article states that law enforcement stopped a vehicle containing 13 Hispanic men who had voted at Santa Recto Middle School. (We found no such actual school in Alabama.) The same men were spotted at multiple cities in Alabama and the State Election Integrity Board arrested 10 of them. All of the men but one were undocumented immigrants, the article says. "Investigators determined that the men were responsible for 'dozens of fake votes' around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak," states the article. However, there is no State Election Integrity Board in Alabama, John C. Bennett, a spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State told PolitiFact. "That does not exist, nor does anyone in the elections’ office have any arrest authority at all so that is super not true," Bennett said. The Secretary of State received no complaints through its online complaint reporting system alleging that undocumented immigrants had voted, Bennett said. While an Alabama election integrity board is fiction, something similar does exist on a national level: President Donald Trump formed the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity which aims to look for noncitizens on voter rolls. There have been some instances of noncitizens voting in some states, but actual evidence has shown small numbers among millions of votes cast nationwide. Nofakenews.com is affiliated with another fake news website America’s Last Line of Defense, among the biggest sources of fake news online. The author of these fake news websites is Christopher Blair who previously told PolitiFact that he designed his parody site to fool conservatives with fake stories most people would find absurd. However, we’re not sure given the misleading claims of Trump and others of widespread voter fraud that this would meet any reasonable definition of satire. The post appears to have been removed as we began fact-checking its accuracy. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-08786	Republican candidate for Georgia governor "dabbled" in birther conspiracy theories.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/20/liberal-bloggers/liberal-bloggers-say-candidate-governor-nathan-dea/	What a difference a day makes. GOP gubernatorial candidate Nathan Deal spent months during the primary convincing voters he's more conservative than his opponents. The day news broke that Deal clinched his party's nomination, liberal bloggers asked whether he was too far to the right. The most high-profile instance took place during a White House press briefing Aug. 11, when a correspondent from the liberal Huffington Post asked White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs about the election. "In the Georgia Republican gubernatorial primary, the winner in that race, Representative Deal, has actually dabbled in birther conspiracies," Sam Stein said. Deal? Dabbling in conspiracy theories that Obama is not a natural-born citizen? Birther conspiracies were discredited as far back as 2008. The notion is so closely tied to conservative extremism that many politicians won't touch it. During the primary, at least one of Deal's Republican opponents complained Deal went too far down the birther path. Deal needs to woo moderates to win in November. If his opponents tie him to the birther movement, they may damage his chances. For the most part, major left-leaning news outlets and bloggers avoid calling Deal an actual birther. Stein said Deal "dabbled" in birtherism. A liberal blog and news site, Talking Points Memo, classified Deal as a "birther-curious" politician who "dipped a toe in the birther pool." Dabble generally means to take part in something casually or superficially -- to not take it seriously. We will focus on claims that he did that with birther conspiracies. Deal's spokesman Brian Robinson said the candidate is in no way a birther, and he didn't dabble in the subject. "That is untrue. He did not dabble in birther conspiracies," Robinson said. "He is saying, 'I have no reason to believe you (President Obama) are not a natural born citizen. Just show it. That's all. We could put this to rest and move on," Robinson said. Deal's constituents were concerned, but Deal didn't focus on the issue, Robinson said. Deal's most widely-publicized brush with birthers took place in November, while Deal was still a congressman. A reporter asked in an online chat if Deal thought Obama was born in the States. "I am joining several of my colleagues in the House in writing a letter to the president asking that he release a copy of his birth certificate so we can have an answer to this question," Deal replied. Deal sent the letter in December, though no one else signed on. In January, one of his congressional staffers gave that scoop to a birther-sympathetic Web site. "P. Patriot" of The Post & Email, which describes itself as a web site of "citizen journalists" who "speak the truth without the restrictions or doctrinaire principles of Socialism and Marxism", said the letter showed Deal understood the "magnitude and gravity of the situation." The post's title: "Deal Challenges Obama’s Eligibility." At the time, whether the letter said what birthers claimed wasn't clear. No one released a copy. Last week, the Deal campaign gave one to PolitiFact Georgia. It's no birther manifesto. Deal wrote, "I accept your assurance you meet that requirement, and in no way intend to show anything but respect for the Office of President and for you personally." Deal said that his constituents were concerned about the President's citizenship. He asked where he could find a publicly available "birth certificate or other documentary evidence" that lays out Obama's case. So the letter bolsters the Deal campaign's claim that he is not a birther. But Deal's other statements muddy the waters. In a July 2009 video aired on MSNBC, Deal talked to liberal blogger and activist Mike Stark. Stark provided an unedited version to PolitiFact Georgia. "There’s been a lot in the news about Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Do you believe he was born in America and anyone who believes otherwise is a little bit cuckoo?" Stark asked Deal. "I wouldn’t say that. I have no idea where he was born at," Deal replied. Deal added this caveat: "I take his word for it. He’s the President and he’s sworn to tell the truth, so I assume that he has." Deal elaborated on his doubts to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a November 2009 article. He said he had "no reason to think" that Obama is not a legal U.S. citizen but the documentation "leaves many things to be desired." "It obviously does not have the signature of a doctor. Most birth certificates or even certificates of live birth have those kinds of verifications," Deal said. If Deal had a change of heart between November of last year, when he expressed these doubts, and December, when he told the president he had none, we found no evidence that he tried to make that clear to the public. Deal had a chance to clarify his position during a January GOP gubernatorial debate. Opponent state Rep. Austin Scott, now a candidate for Congress, accused Deal of "calling for childish things like the president to show his birth certificate." "I have simply asked the president, 'tell me where I can refer these constituent inquiries to a source that you think is credible so that we can answer their questions'," Deal replied. "I think that's a reasonable proposition and certainly something that I think the president should respond to. Although at this point he has not." In a February video posted on the Web, Deal distanced himself from birthers by saying "I'm not questioning his legitimacy as the president." But he did not say he accepted Obama's explanation. Instead, he said this: "I know that some folks have tried to to label this [Deal's letter] as politically incorrect. I want to tell you something. Political incorrectness is paralyzing our society. These kind of things deserve straightforward responses." So did Deal dabble in birther conspiracies? PolitiFact Georgia found no evidence that Deal is a birther. In fact, we found proof to the contrary. But Deal did give birthers the chance to think he was taking some of their theories seriously. Privately, in an unreleased letter, he told the President that he did "accept" Obama's assurances that he met the office's citizenship requirements. Publicly, Deal expressed doubts about Obama's birth certificate. The letter was only released now, so birthers were free to fill in the blanks. And it's clear they saw Deal as an ally. Deal said that all the letter did was relay constituent concerns to the President. But when he sent the letter, he lent birthers a credence that others would not. Birther claims were discredited by 2008. Deal still treated their claims as if they had substance in 2010. Yes, Deal dabbled in birther conspiracies. We rule this claim Mostly True.

pomt-07426	Says protesters at the Wisconsin state Capitol on the night the state Senate passed collective bargaining changes damaged the windshield of his car.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/apr/25/dan-kapanke/wisconsin-sen-dan-kapanke-says-protesters-capitol-/	By now we're all familiar with the scene in Madison on the night of March 9, 2011. That's when Republican state senators -- with their Democratic colleagues still in hiding in Illinois -- approved Gov. Scott Walker's plan to strip most collective bargaining rights from public employees. As Republican senators made quick work on the bill, word spread like wildfire and angry protesters streamed to the Capitol Square. The senators voted and headed out, taking care to avoid the crowd. Tensions were high, along with concern for lawmakers’ safety. In the weeks leading up to the vote -- and on that evening -- there were reports of death threats emailed to lawmakers (one woman has been charged) and other concerns, from protests at the homes of GOP lawmakers to reports of nails strewn in their driveways. A damaged windshield soon joined that list -- and quickly drew national attention. It came to light a week later when state Sen. Dan Kapanke (R-La Crosse) and an aide told several news outlets, including the Journal Sentinel, he was scaling back public appearances in his district out of concerns for his safety. In doing so, they cited vandalism to his car while it was parked at the Capitol. Did protesters damage the windshield of his car? In the wake of a newly released police report on the incident let’s rewind the tape. On the night of March 9, Kapanke’s car was parked in the Martin Luther King Jr. circle near an entrance of the Capitol, an area reserved for lawmakers. After the vote, police told Kapanke not to go to his car because the area was teeming with protesters, he said in an interview. An officer fetched the silver 2001 Honda Accord and delivered it to him at a nearby state office building. Kapanke headed home to La Crosse. On the road, he noticed something seemed wrong with the windshield. "As I was driving, and it was dark, I noticed something across my windshield. I thought somebody might have used a marker" to draw on the glass, he said in an April 9, 2011, interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin. The damage he noticed was a crack, and he decided to report it to Capitol Police. He filed the report one week later, March 16, 2011, when he was next in Madison. Kapanke said filed the report because authorities asked lawmakers to let them know if they experienced anything unusual. According to the report, an officer and two state troopers, including an accident reconstruction specialist, looked over the windshield that day. The Capital Times first reported April 5, 2011 on the police report. "I informed Kapanke after looking at the chip and the crack it looked to me like a stone chip and not someone hitting the windshield," Capitol police officer Chris Weiss wrote in the report. The troopers came to the same conclusion. The report also said police reviewed surveillance video of the parking area and saw no one damaging cars. The report says Kapanke, one of the GOP senators facing a potential recall, was informed of the findings and the case closed on the day it was reported -- March 16. But the public heard about the damage for the first time the following day, when the senator cited the damage while discussing plans to scale back his public schedule out of concerns for his safety. La Crosse Tribune reporter Chris Hubbuch inquired about the schedule changes on March 16, 2011, a few days after they were mentioned in a short email to local media outlets. In response, Kapanke’s office sent a new email that mentioned the safety concerns. Hubbuch said he followed up and Kapanke aide Rose Smyrski called him back and listed the broken windshield as among the matters that was causing concerns for the senator’s safety. "She said his window was broken," Hubbuch said. Hubbuch said he used the term "smashed" in his story, which he called an "unfortunate choice of words." "The implication to me was that somebody broke his windshield." Smyrski confirmed the conversation in an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin -- the decision to cancel the events was made "in conjunction with the threats." She cited the emails, nails "and then the broken window." It was the first time the windshield damage was cited in connection with the senator’s changed plans. But the La Crosse Tribune wasn’t the only one to hear the connection between the windshield and the canceled appearances. Smyrski was cited in several other spots including the Journal Sentinel on March 17, 2011 saying the damaged windshield and other intimidation led the senator to change his schedule. Kapanke told a La Crosse TV station in a story that aired March 17 that he was concerned for his safety. He reminded viewers of the Jan. 8, 2011 shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. "In light of what happened in Arizona with the congresswoman, you know you’re a little bit more cautious and so we canceled a couple of meetings," he told the TV station. "I want to be out with the people, I will still do that. I just won’t be quite as scheduled so people know in advance where I'm going to be at a certain time, I'm just going to go unscheduled if you will." The broken windshield story went national. Websites including the Drudge Report and The Weekly Standard picked up on the story using headlines such as "More Leftist Violence: Senator’s Property Damaged." Fox commentator Glenn Beck also weighed in. Innumerable bloggers also linked to or rewrote the news accounts. So let’s clear up this item. Kapanke reported the windshield damage to Capitol police a week after noticing the damage -- the next time he was in Madison. On the day he filed the report, police blamed gravel -- not protesters -- for the damage. Capitol Police told Kapanke their conclusion on the damaged windshield on March 16, 2011. Yet on that same day, and in the ensuring days, he and his staff publicly listed the damaged windshield -- blaming it on protesters -- as a rationale for scaling back public events in his district. Kapanke allowed the myth of the smashed windshield to run wild and uncorrected for almost three weeks after he knew it was not true. What we do know is that we smell something like smoke -- like a smokescreen. Pants on Fire.	None	Dan Kapanke	None	None	None	2011-04-25T09:00:00	2011-03-16	['Wisconsin']

pomt-00946	"Nine hundred people have been fired since I became secretary (of Veterans Affairs). We’ve got 60 people that we fired who have manipulated wait times."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/20/robert-mcdonald/va-secretary-claims-900-firings-60-related-wait-ti/	When Robert McDonald took over as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs in July 2014, the department was mired in a scandal over veterans’ health care, involving a whistleblower’s claims that VA employees had manipulated wait-time data. The controversy led to the ouster of McDonald’s predecessor, Eric Shinseki. So what has McDonald done to clean up the embattled department since he arrived? He offered some details during a Feb. 15 appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press. "We're making fundamental changes in the department in terms of leadership. We have held accountable about 900 employees who are no longer with us that were with us before I became secretary," McDonald said. Host Chuck Todd asked McDonald what he meant by "held accountable." "Nine hundred people have been fired since I became secretary," he said. "We've got 60 people that we fired who have manipulated wait times." That seems to be a pretty big house-cleaning. Did that many people really get fired? We decided to see whether 900 people were let go and whether 60 of them were ousted directly because of the scandal. "Nine hundred people have been fired since I became secretary" James Hutton, a VA spokesman, told PolitiFact that "personnel from a wide range of locations, across the spectrum of pay grades, have been removed. Some of the reasons include poor performance, absenteeism, among several others." Hutton provided a breakdown of the firings. There were 468 "removals" of regular employees. Most of these — 432 — were employees of the Veterans Health Administration, while 27 worked for the Veteran Benefits Administration and the rest worked in other, smaller offices. To get to 900, McDonald is also counting 487 "probationary" terminations. When most people go to work for the federal government, they first go through a one-year probationary period — a tryout, if you like. During that probationary period, it is much easier to let go of an employee who isn’t working out. After that, the rules covering firing are tilted more favorably toward the employee. This means that more than half of the firings under McDonald were terminations of probationary employees working at the department for less than one year. That’s important for a few reasons. Most importantly, this means that about half of the people let go under McDonald’s watch were employees who were just starting work as the scandal had come to light, or weren’t even there when it was going on. Also, this makes it unlikely that all 900 terminated employees "were with us before I became secretary," as McDonald put it in the interview. For that to be true, it would mean that not a single probationary hire under McDonald has been let go since he came on in July. Is it possible that Veterans Affairs, which has the second-largest federal workforce, did not fire a single probationary employee in the last seven months? We asked Veterans Affairs to elaborate but didn’t hear back on this point. It’s also worth noting that McDonald’s predecessor, Shinseki, fired 2,247 people during fiscal year 2013, according to multiple reports, including our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker, which awarded McDonald’s claim Four Pinocchios, their worst rating. Meanwhile, McDonald is on pace to fire about 1,730 people during his first year, in a department with 325,000 full-time equivalent employees. We take no position on what is the "right" number of VA employees to fire. Still, these termination statistics undercut the notion that McDonald came in and cleaned house. The 900 people let go may well have been part of the normal employee churn of a large government agency. "We've got 60 people that we fired who have manipulated wait times" If the first part of the claim has problems, the second part doesn’t appear to be true in the slightest. According to a Feb. 13, 2015, update on adverse employment actions since June 3, 2014, provided to PolitiFact by the House Veterans’ Affairs committees, 75 employees have received disciplinary, or "adverse employment action," related to patient scheduling, record manipulation, appointment delays or patient deaths. Disciplinary action ranges from a written statement of censure, called a "reprimand" or "admonishment," to suspension or dismissal. So far, 14 people were either removed, received probationary termination or resigned in lieu of removal. Another nine individuals have removals against them pending. The rest of the 75 individuals will have a written censure on their record (which can be removed after two or three years), were demoted, or will return to work after serving a suspension, the longest of which would be 60 days. McDonald also removed five directors and officers through new authority vested in him by the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act, a law passed in the aftermath of the scandal. Asked to explain the discrepancy, Hutton said the department has "proposed disciplinary action related to data manipulation or patient care against more than 60 employees nationwide. This takes into account the full range of accountability actions including admonishments, demotions, reprimands, and termination." In plain language: Sixty people weren’t fired as a result of the scandal; the secretary’s statement is incorrect. Our ruling McDonald said, "Nine hundred people have been fired since I became secretary. We’ve got 60 people that we fired who have manipulated wait times." He also said that those 900 people "were with us before I became secretary." While the data shows that 900 people have been let go under McDonald, half those dismissals were probationary employees, meaning they were just starting work as the scandal had come to light, or weren’t even there when it was going on. Looking at historical trends, the number of terminations looks pretty similar to ordinary personnel churn. More problematic is the claim that 60 people were fired in direct connection with the wait-time scandal. As of mid February, 14 employees had been ousted in one way or another due to the scandal, with another five directors or officers removed as well. Other employees were disciplined without being terminated. Still, the number of terminated employees is well below McDonald’s stated number. We rate the statement False.

pomt-04441	The Obama administration "called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/12/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-obama-administration-called-bashar-/	Three times during the vice presidential debate, Paul Ryan accused the Obama administration of being soft on Syrian president Bashar Assad. The administration, Ryan said, "called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people." He repeated the claim twice more in the 90-minute debate. We decided to take a closer look. First, some background. Assad’s family has maintained a tight grip on power in Syria for decades. As the Arab spring rippled across the region in early 2011, Syria began to experience unrest, with protests emerging both in the capital, Damascus, and Deraa, a relatively remote city near the Jordanian border. What happened in Deraa in March 2011 became the spark that ignited a widespread revolt that has now morphed into a bloody civil war. Several schoolchildren were arrested in late February 2011, accused of scrawling graffiti on a school that said "the people want to topple the regime," according to CNN. When residents found out that the boys were beaten and tortured in prison, they sought their release but were rebuffed. On March 18, security forces opened fire on protesters in Deraa, killing at least four, according to Human Rights Watch. "Within days, the protests grew into rallies that gathered thousands of people," according to Human Rights Watch. The comment Ryan referenced came just over a week after the killings in Deraa, on the March 27, 2012, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation, which included an appearance by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Schieffer asked Clinton how the situation in Syria was different than in Libya, where the U.S. took action against a repressive government. Clinton: "Well, if there were a coalition of the international community, if there were the passage of a Security Council resolution, if there were a call by the Arab League, if there was a condemnation that was universal, but that is not going to happen because I don’t think that it’s yet clear what will occur. What will unfold? There is a different leader in Syria now. Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he’s a reformer. What’s been happening there the last few weeks is deeply concerning. But there’s a difference between calling out aircraft and indiscriminately strafing and bombing your own cities, then police actions, which frankly have exceeded the use of force that any of us would want to see." The comments quickly drew criticism in some quarters. For instance, four days later, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote, "Few things said by this administration in its two years can match this one for moral bankruptcy and strategic incomprehensibility. … It was hoped that President Assad would be a reformer when he inherited his father’s dictatorship a decade ago. … Wrong. Assad has run the same iron-fisted Alawite police state as did his father," Hafez Assad. We will not judge the wisdom of what Clinton said, but rather analyze whether Ryan correctly characterized what she did say. Ryan did get the timing right. Though the conflict would eventually get much bloodier, Syrian guns had already killed several people in Deraa by the time Clinton made her comment. In fact, the show opened with a report from Tripoli covering the spread of the Arab spring, with the reporter saying that Syria’s government acknowledged that 12 people were killed, more than 200 wounded as protests and demonstrations spread across that country." As for invoking "Russian-provided guns," it certainly sounds plausible. Russia is Syria’s biggest supplier of weaponry, and Russia’s arms trade with Syria totaled about $1.5 billion, making Damascus Moscow’s seventh-largest client, according to Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center. Where Ryan may have gone too far was in saying that the administration "called Bashar Assad a reformer." While Clinton did use the word, she said, "Many of the members of Congress of both parties who have gone to Syria in recent months have said they believe he’s a reformer." So, Clinton didn’t exactly say that she, or the administration, was labeling Assad a reformer. Rather, she was referring to what other people -- namely "lawmakers" --"believe." Our ruling Ryan said the Obama administration "called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people." That’s not quite what Clinton said; instead, she was describing what she understood lawmakers’ views to be. Still, as a secretary of state speaking on national television, her decision to discuss such beliefs without knocking them down suggests that she lends them at least some credibility. On balance, we rate Ryan’s claim Half True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2012-10-12T11:39:49	2012-10-11	['Bashar_al-Assad', 'Barack_Obama']

Cliff Stearns, launched an investigation in September 2011 into Planned Parenthood by demanding that it provide years of information about its federal funding and its compliance with abortion restrictions. This didn’t sit well with Rep. Tim Ryan, a Ohio Democrat from Niles, who called the investigation a baseless, ideological attack on Planned Parenthood, which he described as a trusted provider of health care to millions of people, "many of whom would otherwise not receive vital services like pre-natal care, well woman exams and cancer screenings." Among those Planned Parenthood treats are the poor, according to Ryan. In a news release Sept. 28, he detailed just how those numbers are increasing in the United States: "These attacks come at a time when the poverty rate among women is the highest in nearly two decades and 1 in 5 women under 65 don’t have access to health care." We will leave the debate over abortion rights which is at the center of this flap to Ryan, Stearns and others. But PolitiFact Ohio took a look at Ryan’s claims about impoverished women without health care. The stats back up the first part of the claim -- that the poverty rate among women is the highest in nearly two decades. Ryan based his information on an analysis by the National Women’s Law Center of U.S. Census Bureau data. It shows that the poverty rate for women ages 18 to 64 rose to 14.5 percent in 2010, the highest rate in 17 years. Furthermore, the number of women it classifies as living in extreme poverty (with incomes less than half of the federal poverty level) checked in at 6.3 percent, the highest rate over the 22 years the measurement has been taken. What about the second part of Ryan’s claim; that 1 in 5 women (or 20 percent) under 65 don’t have access to health care. Ryan again relied on the National Women’s Law Center analysis, only what the organization more precisely stated is that the number of uninsured women between the ages of 18 and 64 rose to 19.7 percent in 2010. That figure counts only women who had no coverage of any kind, private or public, for the entire year. Ryan’s statement equates not having insurance to not having access to health care. While a woman, or any person for that matter, without health insurance finds it much more difficult or expensive to get medical treatment, there are places they can go, at least in an emergency. Many physicians will see an uninsured patient if they are dogged enough and the ailment severe enough, said Henry Aaron, senior fellow with the Brookings Institution in Washington, but that’s asking an awful lot of the patient. And non-profit hospitals are obligated to stabilize patients with serious conditions, he said, but perhaps not to provide follow-up treatment. "The whole thing is your treatment is delayed," he said. Those without insurance also find it more difficult to get simple check-ups and then to find a doctor who will write a prescription, Aaron said. They are often embarrassed to ask for charity or to run the risk of being refused. "(Being uninsured) just leaves barriers, psychological and financial, to acquiring health care," he said. Ryan reinforced that point when we contacted his office. "This economic barrier to health insurance obstructs many women from obtaining the most basic health care," he said. "While these women are legally guaranteed treatment to stabilize emergency conditions at some hospitals, this promise falls far short of the access to medical care most of us depend upon to stay healthy and safe. It's shameful that in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, we have allowed women to reach such a high level of poverty." Planned Parenthood is part of the safety net of health care providers for the indigent, said Tara Broderick, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Northeast Ohio. Less than 30 percent of its clients have health insurance. Those who don’t have insurance are billed on a sliding scale, she said. As for abortion services, nationally, only about 10 percent of Planned Parenthood’s clients receive an abortion or an abortion pill, Broderick said, and the percentage locally is even smaller. The 50,000 people (primarily women) who visited one of Planned Parenthood’s 13 offices in Northeast Ohio last year were more likely to receive non-abortive birth control assistance or medical check-ups such as pap tests, breast and pelvic exams and blood work for checking cholesterol levels or for evidence of diabetes, Broderick said. So, how do we rate Ryan’s statement? Before returning to Ryan’s statement, we note one other point Aaron made.There is a wide enough difference in the amount of health care that someone with insurance receives compared to someone without insurance that there is "something" about Ryan’s statement that conveys truth, he said. Politifact Ohio would agree. On Ryan’s first point about the rate of poverty for women, census data backs his assertion. On the second part he said 1 in 5 women age 18 to 65 don’t have access to health care. That differs from the census database, which said 1 in five do not have health insurance. That’s a point that needs clarification. And that also consistent with Ryan’s underlying point, that the number of women in poverty is at a high point, and that getting access to health care would be difficult for many women without services of agencies like Planned Parenthood. On the Truth-O-Meter we rate Ryan’s claim Mostly True.	None	Tim Ryan	None	None	None	2011-11-02T06:00:00	2011-09-28	['None']

pomt-06517	Says David Dewhurst accused Cruz of being a Red Chinese Communist.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/oct/11/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-david-dewhursts-camp-called-him-chin/	U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz bristled at two email blasts sent Oct. 4, 2011, on behalf of the front-running Republican for the seat, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. In a "memo" directed at Dewhurst the next day, Cruz’s campaign consultant, Jason Johnson, said: "Yesterday, your campaign distributed two emails -- signed expressly by ‘Dewhurst for Texas’ -- that accused Ted Cruz of being a ‘Red’ Chinese" Communist. Cruz’s campaign copied the note to "interested parties," meaning reporters and anyone else tuned to the pair’s rivalry Feel those not-so-good ‘50s coming back? Cruz’s camp sent us the two emails from Dewhurst’s camp. One was headlined "Red Ted Cruz shows his true colors, consistently stands with China against American interests" and signed by Steven Cheung of Dewhurst’s campaign. The email points out that Cruz opposes legislation offered in Congress to penalize China for propping up its currency. The email closes: "At a time when millions of Americans are without jobs, why does Ted Cruz consistently put the needs of China before America?" The other email, signed by Justin Hollis of Dewhurst’s campaign, has the subject line: "What Does Ted Cruz Have Against America?" Its text refers to Cruz’s opposition to the Chinese currency measure and also quotes from a Laura Ingraham interview of Cruz and a blog post by Texas Monthly’s Paul Burka about Cruz, a lawyer, acting as counsel to a Chinese company accused of patent infringement by an American. The email identically closes: "At a time when millions of Americans are without jobs, why does Ted Cruz consistently put the needs of China before America?" Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch told us that Cruz’s charge is false grandstanding compared with the issues raised by the Dewhurst blasts. The legislation opposed by Cruz would compel the Obama administration to levy tariffs and other penalties against China and other countries for having "misaligned" currencies, according to an Oct. 7, 2011, news post by the Wall Street Journal, amid concern that China holds down the value of its currency, the yuan, in an effort to boost the country's exports. Opponents have warned that approval of the proposal could lead China to launch a trade war. And what of the patent infringement case? Burka, in an Oct. 3, 2011, blog post, recaps a Sept. 28, 2011, post on the San Antonio-based Plaza de Armas blog stating that in his work for a Houston firm, Cruz appealed a ruling against a Chinese conglomerate in a patent piracy case brought by a Florida businessman. Nothing wrong with that in legal terms, the originating blog says, though in political terms, "the idea of a Tea Party darling (Cruz) representing an alleged patent thief against a geriatric American entrepreneur, at a time when the U.S. economy is in shambles and China is the largest international holder of American debt, has the whiff of trouble about it." Perhaps Dewhurst scores political points on these fronts. Per our review, neither Dewhurst email explicitly says Cruz is a Chinese Communist. Then again, we wondered if it’s reasonable to read the "Red Ted" subject line of one of them as anything but a claim that Cruz aligns with, or even is, a Chinese Communist. John Drogin, Cruz’s campaign manager, pointed us to a Dictionary.com definition of "red" as a "radical leftist in politics, especially a Communist." He also noted a Republican blogger’s post interpreting the "red Ted" label in the email as meaning Communist. "You know that ‘red’ is a clear euphemism for Communist and in the context of China," Drogin said. "Dewhurst's staffer's remark is even more obviously so." The "red Ted" reference might seem especially pointed because Cruz’s father fought alongside Fidel Castro and the rebels in Cuba before fleeing the island nation for Texas; he later decided Castro was not the leader he’d wished for, according to a January 2006 Austin American-Statesman news article. All told, it’s reasonable to take the subject line of one Dewhurst email as calling Cruz a Chinese Communist; the other cited email similarly depicts Cruz as siding with China over the United States, but doesn’t include the "red" label.

pomt-07200	"We have the best schools in the United States."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/07/charlotte-nash/best-school-district-claim-gets-red-marks/	Georgia officials sure do like to brag about where they live. DeKalb County has proclaimed itself the "greenest county in America." We reviewed that claim in December and rated it Barely True. Now comes this from Charlotte Nash, the new chairwoman of the Gwinnett County Commission. "We have the best schools in the United States," Nash said in her May 18 State of the County address. How could we resist doing our homework about this claim? Gwinnett government spokeswoman Heather Sawyer said Nash based her statement on Gwinnett County Public Schools winning the 2010 Broad Foundation Prize as the nation’s best large, urban school district. The County Commission, by the way, has no direct involvement in the management of Gwinnett’s public schools. The prize, which Gwinnett won in October, is considered one of the most prestigious awards in education. It also comes with $1 million in scholarship money for high school students. Fifty-one Gwinnett students received scholarships. The eight-member selection jury included three former U.S. secretaries of education. Some might question how a county with cow pastures is considered an urban school district, but it met the foundation’s qualifications in two key categories. Nearly 50 percent of Gwinnett students are eligible for free or reduced lunch (the Broad requirement is at least 40 percent). Also, nearly 70 percent of Gwinnett students are black, Latino or Asian(the Broad requirement is at least 40 percent). The foundation cited several factors for awarding Gwinnett. They included: Gwinnett outperformed other districts in Georgia in 2009 that serve students who come from similar income backgrounds in math and reading at the elementary, middle and high school level. In 2009, Gwinnett had one of the smallest reading achievement gaps between white and black students in the state. A larger percentage of black and Latino students outperformed students in comparable districts in reading and math. Gwinnett school officials provided us more information. It included: Nearly 60 percent of students who took Advanced Placement exams scored at levels that qualified the student to receive college credit. It holds an Aaa bond rating from Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s. Seventeen county high schools were named Advanced Placement honor schools. Jorge Quintana, the Gwinnett school district’s media relations director, noted that the county was a finalist for the Broad Prize in 2009. "The fact that Gwinnett was a finalist for the same prestigious award the year before indicates that the district has been successful in sustaining success over time," Quintana told us in an email. Those factors suggest Gwinnett gets high marks in Georgia. But is Gwinnett the best district in the country? "[The Broad Prize] certainly would put you in that category," said Dan Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, a 13,000-member organization that aims to assist the nation’s public schools. Still, Domenech, who said Gwinnett has an "excellent" reputation, said it is difficult to determine the nation’s best school system. "There probably isn’t a best school district in the country," he said. "There are a lot of good school districts in the country." The Washington Post compiles a widely discussed annual list that ranks the nation’s best public high schools in terms of college preparedness. In 2011, the Gwinnett and Fulton school districts each had six schools among the top 500 on the Post’s list, tying for the most in Georgia. Gwinnett was behind a district in Houston, Texas, (10 schools among the top 500), the Hillsborough County, Fla., district (nine schools among the top 500) and a district in Dallas, Texas, that had the top two schools on the list and an additional six among the top 500. The Post determines the ranking by dividing the number of Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate or other college-level tests a school gave in 2010 by the number of graduating seniors. Domenech suggested we use several criteria in our research, such as exams like the SAT, graduation rates, dropout rates and parent reaction. On the SAT exam, the average score for Gwinnett students (1,532) was higher than the state and national averages, but it was lower than the averages for Fulton and Fayette counties. The state Education Department recently released data outlining how each school district fared on the high school graduation tests. In Gwinnett, 83.8 percent of students passed all the exams, easily above the statewide average of 73.7 percent. Gwinnett finished behind the Cherokee, Cobb, Fayette and Forsyth school districts. Gwinnett, it must be noted, had more students than those other districts and is the state’s largest school system. The Gwinnett School of Math, Science and Technology in Lawrenceville had a 100 percent passing rate on four portions of the graduation test on English/language arts, math, science and social studies, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Monday. Nash has some reasons to brag about the schools in her county. Students, teachers and parents have reason to be proud. Nash, however, made a bold statement based on Gwinnett winning the 2010 Broad Prize for the best urban school district. Seventy-five districts in the U.S. qualified for consideration for the prize in 2010. That’s less than 1 percent of the nation’s 14,000 school districts. Her claim also omits some critical facts, such as Gwinnett’s average score in some key academic categories. The county was behind some other Atlanta-area districts. Also, Gwinnett had fewer schools than some other U.S. districts on the Washington Post’s list. As Domenech told us, it’s tough to say there is one school district that is the nation’s best. Under our guidelines, Nash’s claim rates as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Charlotte Nash	None	None	None	2011-06-07T06:00:00	2011-05-18	['United_States']
pomt-04734	Says the United States has "the world’s greatest health care system."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/30/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-united-states-has-worlds-gre/	As Gov. Chris Christie made his pitch Tuesday for electing Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, the governor ripped into the signature legislation of President Barack Obama’s tenure: health care reform. "Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the debacle of putting the world’s greatest health care system in the hands of federal bureaucrats and putting those bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor," Christie said during his keynote address at the Republican National Convention. Putting aside the debate over the health care reform law, Christie’s boasting made us wonder: Does the United States really have "the world’s greatest health care system"? The answer is not perfectly clear, but the findings of various studies have created a portrait of a United States where the health care system performs relatively well in certain areas and less so in others, as compared with other countries. In short, it’s a mixed bag. "We just don’t come out as the best," Robert Berenson, a health care policy expert at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, told us. In a separate fact-check, we evaluated Christie’s claim that the health care reform law is "putting those bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor." Now, let’s look at where the U.S. health care system stacks up internationally. To analyze Christie’s claim, we first turned to a fact-check from PolitiFact National, which issued a Half True on a similar claim by House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) that the United States has "the best health care delivery system in the world." As our PolitiFact colleagues noted, the World Health Organization has ranked the U.S. health care system as the 37th best out of 191 countries for "overall performance." WHO, which is part of the United Nations system, issued that ranking in its World Health Report 2000. The methodology behind that study has drawn a great deal of criticism, but more recent analyses also have shown the United States falling behind in certain categories. A study updated in June 2010 by the Commonwealth Fund found that the U.S. health care system ranks last or next-to-last when compared with six other nations for five performance measures, including access to care and efficiency. "The U.S. health system is the most expensive in the world, but comparative analyses consistently show the United States underperforms relative to other countries on most dimensions of performance," according to the study. In June, the Paris, France-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development released data on various health care indicators for 34 member countries, including the United States. As a share of gross domestic product, the United States in 2010 accounted for the highest level of health care spending among OECD countries. Yet the United States had fewer practicing physicians per-capita than in most of the countries. Compared to the OECD average of 3.1 physicians per 1,000 residents, the United States had 2.4 physicians in 2010. An OECD study released last year also presented a mixed picture on vaccination rates. The United States was above the OECD average for rates of flu vaccination for senior citizens. But the country was below OECD averages for the percentage of children vaccinated for pertussis, measles and hepatitis B. However, that same study also said the United States was "performing very well in the area of cancer care, achieving higher rates of screening and survival from different types of cancer than most other developed countries." For example, between 2004 and 2009, the five-year relative survival rate for breast cancer in the United States was 89 percent, marking the highest level among OECD countries. Berenson, the health care policy expert at the Urban Institute, said the United States is in the middle of the pack for the quality of health care services. "The US does relatively well on caring for seriously ill patients at risk of death and disability, such as treating car accident victims and life threatening illnesses for those with health insurance, but does relatively poorly on primary and preventive care, such as caring for patients chronic health conditions, such as diabetes," Berenson said in an e-mail. Our ruling In his keynote address, Christie claimed the United States has "the world’s greatest health care system." However, studies have suggested the quality of the U.S. health care system is a mixed bag. For example, the United States has fallen behind some other nations for access to care and childhood vaccination rates, but in terms of cancer care, the United States is outperforming most other developed countries. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-01190	"In 2012, 123 African-Americans were shot dead by police. ... Same year, 326 whites were killed by police."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/04/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-cites-faulty-data-claim-about-shootin/	Bill O’Reilly made headlines this week by offering his take on a silent Ferguson protest by a few members of the NFL’s St. Louis Rams, saying the decision of the players "connotes the fact that they believe, I guess, that white police officers shoot black youths all the time." That’s out of bounds of a fact-check. But O’Reilly did present some statistics in the same argument that several readers asked us to examine. "Let's take a good look at this plague of white cops acting violently against blacks, as (professor and liberal columnist Michael Eric) Dyson puts it," O’Reilly said on his Dec. 1, 2014, Fox News program. "In the past 50 years, the rate of black Americans killed by police has dropped 70 percent. In 2012, 123 African-Americans were shot dead by police. There are currently more than 43 million blacks living in the U.S.A. Same year, 326 whites were killed by police bullets. Those are the latest stats available." Later in the show, O’Reilly said of these numbers, "That's not an epidemic. It's not crazy. It's not a hunting-down of black youth." This is not the first time we have evaluated pundits’ half-truths comparing black and white deaths from police killings. Like the other cases, O’Reilly is citing available government statistics, but these numbers are shaky and don’t paint a complete picture. Lack of national data O’Reilly’s team used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s fatal injury reports database. A search in the system for fatal "legal interventions" -- deaths caused in the course of law enforcement trying to make an arrest or quell a situation -- confirms, on the surface, the numbers O’Reilly mentioned for whites and African-Americans. How does the CDC get the number? Primarily from causes of death listed in death certificates from coroners, medical examiners and physicians and demographic information provided by funeral directors. Figures are further supplemented by a violent death reporting system that includes data from 17 states. (Legal interventions include state executions.) But experts told us the data is likely incomplete because coroners and physicians are under no obligation to detail police involvement in the deaths that they encounter. "It is not known or certain that every death certificate indicates that the death was caused by law enforcement officer in every jurisdiction," said Samuel Walker, retired professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska-Omaha. Another database, this one maintained by the FBI, attempts to get at the same figure. But it’s no more solid. The FBI reports rely on self-reported data from a small chunk of the nation’s more than 17,000 law enforcement agencies. The lack of a national clearinghouse for fatal police killings "is a national embarrassment," said Geoffrey Alpert, a University of South Carolina criminology professor who specializes in high-risk police activities. "I’m sure one of (O’Reilly’s) researchers pulled a number from that database, but it’s just a convenient fact, as someone used to say," he said. More problems with O’Reilly’s numbers Beyond the lack of clear national data for these deaths, experts found more problems with O’Reilly’s citation of CDC numbers. O’Reilly’s reference of the number of whites killed in legal interventions does not strictly account for non-Hispanic whites. People who identify as Hispanic are also counted in the total of 326 deaths. Running the search again for whites but excluding Hispanics leaves 227 deaths from legal interventions -- substantially fewer deaths due to the absence of 97 white Hispanics previously in the mix (in the black category, two were identified as black Hispanic). "So if you are interested in people of color, what they list in the white data is too high," Walker said of O’Reilly’s figures. Additionally, the per capita rate of black deaths per 100,000 residents is .28, which is twice as high as the rate for white deaths of .13, Walker points out. Our ruling O’Reilly said, 123 African-Americans and 326 white people were shot dead by police in 2012. He referenced recent federal numbers but failed to mention their well-documented flaws. We have not found any experts who will vouch for numbers that purport to represent annual fatal shootings by police, as there are gaping holes within each dataset. Additionally, the number of white people fatally shot by police in 2012 is substantially off if you account for white Hispanics -- a group O’Reilly did not seem to have in mind during his rant about race relations between blacks and whites. O’Reilly’s statement contains an element of truth, but it’s not the full picture he makes it out to be. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-09229	Says that when he first ran for office in the late 1980s, "there were still folks who didn't have phone service. Soon I'd helped ensure that everyone in North Florida could access a dial tone."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/may/14/allen-boyd/boyd-says-he-helped-bring-dial-tone-north-florida/	In his re-election campaign for Florida's 2nd Congressional District, Rep. Allen Boyd, a Democrat from the North Florida town of Monticello, is quick to remind voters about his accomplishments that have helped their everyday lives. Like, say, when they pick up their phone and hear a dial tone. "I remember when I first ran for office, there were still folks who didn't have phone service. Soon I'd helped ensure that everyone in North Florida could access a dial tone," Boyd states in a commercial titled "Broadband," released by his campaign on April 23, 2010. Really? We wondered if it was possible that more than a century after the telephone was invented there were still that many people without access to a phone line. If so, was Boyd a key player in helping ensure that those phone-less folks got connected? Aaron Blye, Boyd's campaign communications director, referred us to the incumbent's campaign website, which offers this explanation of the claim: "In 1995, Allen voted for SB 1554, which brought competition to the telecommunications marketplace by ending a long-standing monopoly over local telephone exchanges, ensuring that telephone service was available to everyone in North Florida at a reasonable and affordable rate." Boyd started in the Legislature in 1989, a time when about 5.3 percent of Florida households did not have a telephone, according to 1990 Census Bureau numbers. By the 2000 census, the percentage had dropped to 2.2 percent. (It's difficult to calculate comparable coverage rates now because many people rely on cell phones.) We also dug up census figures on each of the 15 counties that make up Boyd's congressional district. In 1990, there were 16,362 households without phone service in those counties, but that number dropped to 8,871 by 2000. So the percentage of people without phones has definitely dropped. But how much credit should Boyd -- or at least the bill he supported -- get for that? His website attributes the growth in phone service to SB 1554, a 1995 bill that passed the Florida Legislature. He says the bill "brought competition to the telecommunications marketplace by ending a long-standing monopoly over local telephone exchanges..." It's indeed true that Boyd was one of 118 state representatives who voted for the House version of SB 1554. And yes, the measure helped to deregulate an industry that was dominated by 13 local phone providers in Florida, eventually opening the doors for long distance carriers and cable companies to sell local phone service. Boyd actively pushed for the bill's passage, said former State Rep. Scott Clemons, D-Panama City, who was chairman of the House Utilities and Telecommunications Committee, and the bill's main sponsor in the House. Clemons now serves as mayor of Panama City, which is part of Boyd's congressional district, and it's worth noting he has contributed to Boyd's campaigns. "Allen was sort of the go-to person on rural issues," said Clemons, in a phone interview with PolitiFact Florida. "He was pushing to make sure there was complete coverage in those areas. It was a component of the larger bill at hand." Still, we wondered whether it was Florida's law that brought more local phone providers to rural parts of Florida, or whether the increase was a result of sweeping federal reforms enacted by Congress a year later with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The 1996 law deregulated the phone industry in order to create a more competitive market place. It was the first time since 1934 that the rules regulating the telephone industry had changed nationally. "The '96 Act did the same thing [as Florida's law] essentially, but on a grander national scale," said Kirsten Olsen, spokesperson for the Florida Public Service Commission, a state agency charged with regulating utilities like phone, gas and electricity. So which law played a larger role in upping the ante for phone companies to invest in Florida, especially North Florida? The answer isn't so clear-cut, Olsen said. "It's very difficult to pinpoint which is most significant," she said. Her assessment was also shared by Tom Wacker, vice president of government relations for the National Telecommunications Cooperative Association, a nonprofit group representing more than 580 small and rural telephone cooperatives and companies. Wacker said the law made it possible for larger companies to sell off their lines in rural areas to interested smaller companies and start-ups. "You could argue that by selling off their territory, rural carriers took up the mantel and provided much superior service than those areas had experienced in the past," Wacker said. While it may be difficult to pinpoint which law was most significant to rural Floridians, annual reports from the Florida Public Service Commission indicate an increase in local phone providers from 13 to 52 by October 1996, more than a year after the state measure was passed. Today that number has increased to 327 local providers certified through the state as of December 2008, according to the most recent figures available. Still, the PSC report notes that initially new local service providers were more prone to set up shop in larger urban markets than rural areas. "Understand that in an open market, players come out of the woodwork," Olsen said. "But they're going after the low hanging fruit. They're trying to get the biggest bang for their buck, which is typically in a larger market." While local providers may have entered rural markets at a slower pace, Olsen said within 10 years of SB 1554 passing "those areas which may not have had access before were now primarily covered." There aren't statistics on whether the service is truly universally available because there are some very rural areas that remain without coverage, but by and large she said that anyone who wants phone access should be able to get it. So back to Boyd's claim. He said he "helped ensure that everyone in North Florida could access a dial tone." Yes, the percentage of households without phone service went down during the 1990s, from 5.3 percent in 1990 to 2.2 percent in 2000. And yes, Boyd voted for the state bill, which supports his cautious claim of "helped." (The campaign has not portrayed him as a leader on the effort, although one of his supporters has.) But the state bill was just part of the reason for the big increase in telephone coverage. The federal law also played a role in deregulating the market. So we find his claim Mostly True.

Real private sector wages under the previous Labor government grew by about 4.2 per cent, over five-and-three-quarter years. That's an annual average pace of about 0.7 per cent. The latest data available at the time Mr Swan made his claim shows under the Coalition, real private sector wages — from September 2013 to March 2018 — have grown by 1.2 per cent. That's an annual average pace of about 0.3 per cent, over four-and-a-half years. Mr Swan has overstated wages growth under Labor, and understated wages growth under the Coalition, although not excessively so. Alternative methods to assess the data produce similar, although not identical, results. Regardless, what is clear is that wages growth has been sluggish in recent years despite falling unemployment.

pomt-08154	On offshore oil drilling.	no flip	/florida/statements/2010/dec/03/rick-scott/while-others-waffled-rick-scott-stuck-his-oil-dril/	When it comes to the issue of offshore oil drilling, we've seen our share of flip-flopping politicians. Sitting Florida Gov. Charlie Crist was against oil drilling, then open to it, then fiercely against it. The new leaders of the Florida House and Senate, Rep. Dean Cannon and Sen. Mike Haridopolos, were pushing for drilling in state waters, then they weren't, and now at least Haridpolos wants the state to consider drilling one day. Then there's the reversal of President Barack Obama, who was ready to open more federal waters to drilling, and now isn't. All the flip-flopping got us wondering what position Florida's incoming Republican governor Rick Scott had staked out, and whether he's been consistent. Scott gave us an opening to use our Flip-O-Meter when the issue of oil drilling came up on Dec. 2, 2010, during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. "We need to become energy independent. We can't do drilling until we do it safely," Scott said. But, "you don't put in a moratorium. "Let's figure out how we can do it safely because we cannot afford to mess up our beaches or our economy. But I believe (with) the ingenuity of Americans, we will come up with a way to do that." How do those statements line up to comments Scott made throughout the campaign? We decided to examine three critical points -- Scott's comments in the days and weeks after the April Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico oil spill; his time visiting the communities affected by the oil spill in the Panhandle; and his comments ahead of the general election vote when he might soften his position to appeal to moderate voters. Back in May, after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, Scott was criticized by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink as still supporting increased oil drilling. As evidence, the Sink campaign pointed to both Scott's own campaign website and an interview he gave to the Palm Beach Post. Scott, on his website, advocated drilling offshore. "But we must ensure that Florida’s beaches are protected," he wrote. "As we explore the expansion of domestic drilling in the U.S., we must ensure that we have sound policies in place that ensure the companies drilling are doing so in an environmentally sound way and adhering to the strictest of safety standards." And to the Post, Scott announced opposition to a state constitutional ban on offshore drilling. "We need to protect our beaches, break our dependency on foreign oil and hold oil companies accountable when there are problems," Scott said. "As governor, I'll look to strike a balance between responsible exploration that takes every precaution and is far enough from our shores while holding oil companies accountable for their mistakes." Later in the summer, but still during his Republican primary against Bill McCollum, the issue resurfaced as Scott toured the Florida Panhandle to see the effect of the Deepwater Horizon spill. According to news reports, Scott cleverly avoided talking about his position with fishermen in the area, and instead asked them questions about their business. But he told a a business roundtable in Panama City: "My belief is that we have to continue to look at offshore drilling but we've got to do it safely. I think as a country and a state we've got to become as energy independent as we can." Scott tempered his comments slightly in an interview afterward, saying drilling won't happen in the "foreseeable future. ...We are not going to drill now. ...It's not safe. It doesn't make any sense." Lastly, we wanted to search his statements during the general campaign, to see if he moderated his position to appeal to a broader base of voters. What we found is that oil drilling rarely came up. Newspaper editorials cast Scott as pro-drilling -- charges Scott didn't deny -- but rarely did Scott speak about his position during the final weeks of the gubernatorial campaign. When the Deepwater Horizon spill came up during an Oct. 25 CNN/St. Petersburg Times debate, Scott used the event to criticize Sink for not being directly involved enough. But he didn't state his position on drilling (nor was he asked). We should note however, that the position on his campaign website has not changed since May. Let's review. In the days and weeks after the Deepwater Horizon spill, Scott maintained his support for offshore oil drilling so long as it can be done safely. He kept that position after meeting with Panhandle fishermen and businessmen who had been affected by the spill, and never changed his position through the election. Yes, he is guilty perhaps of being savvy enough to downplay a position that may not win votes in the Panhandle or potentially moderate swing voters, but that's not what the Flip-O-Meter measures. It looks for a consistent position. And in this case, the meter found it. So we're making a little history with this one: For the first time PolitiFact Florida rules No Flip.

pomt-08481	On implementing a sales tax.	full flop	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/12/doug-ainge/doug-ainge-once-argued-forcefully-sales-tax-now-he/	Back in the day (read: June 9, 2003), Doug Ainge, a current Democratic candidate for Oregon’s House District 30, argued forcefully for a sales tax in an opinion piece he wrote for The Oregonian. Here’s a bit of what he handed in for publication: "Almost every state has a sales tax and it does not hurt tourism or business development in any of them, just look around us. Are you not taking your children to Disneyland because California has a sales tax? Are you going to pass up a Mariners game because of Washington's sales tax? The trip to the Grand Canyon is canceled because of Arizona's sales tax? We must all wake up to the reality that it's short sighted and unjust to allow tens of thousands of people to gain from our great state and pay no tax. It is clearly past time to tax tourists, drug dealers, prostitutes and all other sectors of the underground economy. "We must lower the state's marginal income tax rate from 9 percent down to 5-6 percent. We must cap property taxes once again. Then we must institute a 5-6 percent sales tax, with all consumables exempted (i.e. food and medicine). The entire sales tax must be specifically dedicated to K-12 education." The article identified Ainge as a history, government and economics teacher at Banks High School. Seven years later, Ainge, the Oregon House candidate, is saying something a little -- OK, a lot -- different. Here’s the transcript of Ainge’s first television ad: "Right now, folks from Washington come down to Oregon to buy stuff. Why? No sales tax. In a tough economy, it makes things a little easier. But some politicians want to change that. Doug Ainge knows a sales tax is a bad idea at the worst time. Doug Ainge will fight tax breaks for out-of-state corporations and he’ll vote against a sales tax for Oregon. We voted nine times to stop a sales tax. Let’s vote one more time to keep it that way. Doug Ainge for state representative. No sales tax. No way." Well, the message couldn’t be clearer: Sales taxes are evil. Or something along those lines. We checked in with the campaign to make sure we weren’t missing anything. In an e-mail response, Eric Hagarty, Ainge’s campaign manager wrote, "Working families are already paying more than their fair share, and in an economy like this a sales tax would only make things worse. Republicans have chosen to cherry-pick statements that are nearly a decade old in an attempt to distract voters from the fact that Doug has the right answers for our economy, schools and government." We’re not so sure that an entire opinion piece in the state’s largest newspaper on the merits of a sales tax is cherry-picking, but that’s really neither here nor there. Ainge has gone from arguing for a sales tax (Disneyland doesn’t suffer) to saying he’d vote against one ("No sales tax. No way."). At PolitiFact Oregon, we call that a Full Flop.

pomt-04809	Says Jon Corzine "gave away 14 percent raises over 4 years and he stood on the front steps of the Capitol at a public-sector union rally and said, 'I will fight to get you a great contract.’"	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/20/chris-christie/chris-christie-blasts-jon-corzine-giving-away-14-p/	Nearly 3,000 miles from Trenton, Gov. Chris Christie couldn’t pass up an opportunity to knock his predecessor, Jon Corzine. The Republican governor appeared Aug. 9 at a campaign event in Bellevue, Wash., for GOP gubernatorial candidate Rob McKenna. Christie told the crowd public-sector union workers should pay their fair share toward pension and health benefits, and then criticized Corzine for giving away raises. "My predecessor's first negotiation with the public-sector unions, he gave away 14 percent raises over 4 years and he stood on the front steps of the Capitol at a public-sector union rally and said, 'I will fight to get you a great contract,’" said Christie, according to a video posted on YouTube. Corzine, a Democrat, did approve contracts providing 13 percent in raises over a four-year period for state workers. Corzine also spoke at a union rally where he vowed to "fight" for public employees, according to several news reports. But Christie’s criticism that Corzine "gave away" those raises ignores the fact that the contracts included a number of union concessions. First, let’s explain the events leading up to that union rally. For the first budget of his tenure, Corzine in 2006 proposed increasing the sales tax to help cover a budget shortfall. The governor also called for increasing the contribution to the state’s pension system. But instead of the tax hike, some Democratic legislators called for state worker unions to accept salary or fringe benefit givebacks. Another proposal was scaling back the proposed pension payment. On June 19, 2006, thousands of public employees rallied outside the Statehouse to show support for Corzine’s plan. According to several news reports, the governor made comments at the union rally similar to those cited by Christie. Star-Ledger columnist Paul Mulshine and Gannett New Jersey columnist Bob Ingle both quoted Corzine as saying, "We're gonna fight for a fair contract." The New York Times quoted the governor as saying, "I will fight for you." The final budget included the sales tax increase and a smaller pension contribution. Now, we’ll address the raises mentioned by Christie. Eight months after that union rally, the Corzine administration reached a deal with the largest state workers union for a new four-year agreement. Two other unions later agreed to similar deals. Those contracts, which went into effect in July 2007, provided a total of 13 percent in raises for each union. However, by claiming Corzine "gave away" those raises, Christie failed to mention a number of union concessions built into the contracts. For example, union workers agreed for the first time to contribute 1.5 percent of their salaries each year toward the cost of health benefits. The contracts also increased employees’ annual pension contributions by 0.5 percent. In response to our findings, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in part: "For goodness sake, the fix was in for that fight, and Jon Corzine was taking a ‘fall’ in the first round. Who was representing the taxpayers? Where was the adversarial collective bargaining relationship? And, finally, how many people do any of us know got those kinds of raises in those years? It was a ‘giveaway’ in the fullest sense, and that’s exactly what Governor Christie was saying." Our ruling At a campaign event in Bellevue, Wash., Christie said Corzine "gave away 14 percent raises over 4 years and he stood on the front steps of the Capitol at a public-sector union rally and said, 'I will fight to get you a great contract.’" Corzine did authorize four-year contracts with a total of 13 percent in raises, and vowed to "fight" for public employees at a union rally. But Christie’s criticism ignores how the contracts included certain union concessions. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-13801	Says Donald Trump is "against minimum wage."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/jul/19/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-erroneously-says-donald-trump-against-mi/	U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine says Donald Trump is no friend to working Americans. "He’s a 'you're fired' guy," Kaine said July 14 while introducing Hillary Clinton during a rally for her Democratic presidential campaign at Northern Virginia Community College in Annandale. Kaine, widely reported to be among three finalists Clinton is considering for vice president, ticked off a series of issues on which he said Trump has betrayed workers. Among his beefs, Kaine accused Trump of "being against minimum wage." "We want a ‘you’re hired’ president. It starts with fairness, equal pay for women, raising the minimum wage," Kaine said, drawing cheers from the crowd. Is Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, "against minimum wage," as Kaine says? The answer is complicated. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. But it should be noted that 45 states set their own minimum wage, and 29 of them set it at a higher rate than the federal level, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Fourteen states, including Virginia, have a rate that’s the same as the federal rate, while another seven states either have no minimum or set it at a rate lower than the federal level. In instances where the federal rate is higher than a state minimum or in states where there is no bottom rate, the federal wage prevails. In states where the minimum wage is set above the federal rate, the higher state rate applies. Trump’s stance on wages has been murky. During a November 2015 primary debate, said that wages are "too high" and hamper the U.S. in competing with other nations. When asked if he would back an increase in the minimum wage, he said, "I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is." At others times during the months after that debate, Trump said he didn’t understand how people could live on $7.25 an hour. Our colleagues at PolitFact North Carolina recently looked at a Clinton claim that Trump wants to get rid of a federal minimum wage. Her statement was rated True because of comments Trump made in a May 8 appearance on NBC’s "Meet The Press," when host Chuck Todd attempted to pin him down on his minimum wage stance. PolitiFact North Carolina noted that Trump began by expressing sympathy for minimum wage workers. "I have seen what’s going on, and I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour," he said. Trump said although he would like to see a higher minimum wage, he wouldn’t do anything, if elected, to make that a reality. "I would like to see an increase of some magnitude," Trump told Todd. "But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other." Todd asked whether the federal government at least should set a floor on wages and allow the states to go higher. "No," Trump replied. "I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do." We reached out to Clinton’s Virginia campaign to find out the source of Kaine’s claim that Trump opposes the minimum wage. We were pointed to a series of Trump statements that all said he thought the minimum wage should be set by states, not Congress. "On the minimum wage, I would like to leave it to the states because frankly, every state is different. Every state has different costs of living and everything else, and I would like to leave it to the states," Trump said in a May 9 interview on the Fox Business Network. "But I will tell you, $7.25 is pretty tough, and as far as I’m concerned I could see something happening there, but I would leave it to the states." Trump made a similar statement to Fox host Sean Hannity on May 12. "I really like the idea because it’s so different - you know, it’s a big country - it’s so different and the cost of living is so different, I like letting the states set the minimum wage," Trump said. In a radio interview on KVI in Seattle, Trump said again that states should set their own minimum wage, although he suggested that states that boosted their bottom wage might become uncompetitive with other states. "I actually think that the states should make the decision," Trump said. "Here's what's going to happen. … All of a sudden in some cases states are going to become non-competitive and they're going to start losing maybe jobs and losing business, and they're going to have to readjust. Otherwise, they're just not going to have anything." In the past, Trump has bristled at suggestions he opposes a federal minimum wage. In May, PolitiFact examined Trump’s claim that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., "lied" when she said he wanted to abolish the federal minimum wage. That was rated Mostly False. PolitiFact reached out to Trump to see if he merely had misspoken when he told Todd he doesn’t support a federal wage floor but did not hear back. We emailed the Trump campaign twice for comment on his position on the minimum wage but also did not hear back. Our ruling Kaine said Trump is "against minimum wage." We would have had no issue if Kaine had said Trump opposes a federal minimum wage. But the senator’s statement lacks that specificity. Trump repeatedly has said that Washington should not dictate a national minimum wage and that the matter should be left entirely to the states. So we rate Kaine’s unqualified statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c1236a3a-7db8-4ef1-9efd-60fa907ce4db	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-07-19T11:07:20	2016-07-14	['None']

pomt-14058	Says Virginia Republican "Scott Taylor has been convicted in at least four different courts across the country, at times failing to even appear, and having a warrant issued for his arrest."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/may/23/randy-forbes/randy-forbes-tells-half-story-about-scott-taylors-/	U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes recently mailed out an attack brochure in Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District accusing his Republican primary opponent - Del. Scott Taylor of Virginia Beach - of flouting the law. The flier has a picture of Taylor with a devil-may-care grin. "Scott Taylor is attacking Randy Forbes because his own record isn’t very clean," the brochure says. Underneath, Forbes makes four negative claims about his opponent’s personal and professional behavior. The first one says "Scott Taylor has been convicted in at least four different courts across the country, at times failing to even appear, and having a warrant issued for his arrest." The conviction claim is repeated on a Forbes-authorized website that says Taylor is "unfit for office." It has a photo of Taylor holding a superimposed sign - the kind that used to appear in identification photos of inmates - saying, "Scott Taylor RULE BREAKER." We wondered whether the congressman’s statements about Taylor’s court record are correct and complete. Forbes, in the brochure and on his website, provides no explanation of the verdicts and legal actions that he says went against Taylor. Footnotes merely list courts in four localities and case numbers. Dean Petrone, a Forbes media consultant, sent us a list of court actions against Taylor that were found largely in a LexisNexis search of Taylor’s background. We confirmed the records on our own. It turns out that Taylor, a former Navy SEAL, has a history of fast driving. And all of the court convictions that Forbes cites as evidence of his opponent’s unsuitability for Congress result from traffic tickets. Records show that Taylor got 12 speeding tickets from 1999 to 2013. Three of those citations were for reckless driving in Virginia, which means going 20 mph or more above the speed limit. Taylor’s highest rate of speed, in a 2006 ticket issued in Rutherford County, N.C., was 99 mph in a 65-mph zone. Ironically, Taylor also got a ticket in Norfolk in 2008 for impeding traffic, which means driving too slow. He was cited in 2007 for failing to yield the right of way in Virginia Beach. So there’s a total of 14 moving violations against Taylor and no record of any of the tickets being dismissed by a judge or resulting in punishments other than fines. Now, let’s get to the specifics of Forbes’ claims: "Scott Taylor has been convicted in at least four courts across the country … " Records show that Taylor was found guilty of driving violations by courts in five localities. Three of the courts were in Virginia: Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Northampton County. The other two were in Rutherford County, N.C., and Talbot County, Md. "at times failing to appear … " In seven instances, Taylor was found "guilty in absentia." That means he did not exercise his option to appear in court to dispute the ticket. The judges, in Taylor’s absence, heard the cases, found him guilty, and assessed fines and court costs. That’s different from "failing to appear," which means a person was supposed to show up in court and did not. This leads to the last part of Forbes’ statement. "and having a warrant issued for his arrest." Records show there was one time, in March 2004, when a judge charged Taylor with failure to appear and later issued a bench warrant for his arrest. This happened in Virginia Beach General District Court, shortly after Taylor had been cited for reckless driving. Scott Weldon, Taylor’s campaign manager, told us Taylor didn’t show up in court because he had been sent on a lengthy military training exercise. Records show that in June 2004, Taylor was cleared of the failure-to-appear charge. We should note that all but one of Taylor’s driving offenses occurred from 1999 to 2010. Records show he received his last ticket in November 2012 when he was pulled over in Talbot County, Md. If you’re wondering, we also examined records that would detail any problems with Forbes’ driving record and found no infractions. Our ruling A Forbes campaign brochure says, "Scott Taylor has been convicted in at least four courts across the country, at times failing to appear and having a warrant issued for his arrest." Taylor has been convicted in five courts. He was charged with failing to appear in court once, not multiple "times" as Forbes says. And there was one time, in 2004, when a bench warrant was issued for Taylor’s arrest. The problem is that Forbes, in setting up Taylor as lawbreaker, gives voters only half of the story. He contours language and images to suggest Taylor is no better than a criminal, but dodges actually saying so. Forbes doesn’t mention that all of Taylor’s convictions concerned driving violations, mostly speeding. He doesn’t mention that the failure-to-appear charge against Taylor was dropped later. Taylor, a former Navy SEAL, says he missed the 2004 court date - triggering the arrest warrant - because he had been sent on a lengthy military training exercise. There are no angels in this fact check. Taylor’s driving record is fair game for criticism. Forbes’ attack is partially accurate but skips important details. So we rate his claim Half True. Editors Note: An earlier version of this story gave the wrong highest speed for which Taylor has been cited.	None	Randy Forbes	None	None	None	2016-05-23T12:00:00	2016-05-13	['None']

pomt-07991	"The incoming Republican freshman class – well, it’s no ordinary group: nearly half of its roughly 80 members have never served in elective office before."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2011/jan/17/greg-walden/rep-greg-walden-says-nearly-half-incoming-republic/	Members of the U.S. House of Representatives as well as the chamber’s groupies love telling anyone who’ll listen how it is the "people’s house," a sometimes raucous and befuddling chamber of 435 members whose backgrounds and ideologies are a cross-section of the entire nation. This year especially, the preferred message is that your representative is probably like you -- hard working, honest, genuine, young and old, educated and not. He or she, the thinking goes, has come to Washington on a noble journey, the furthest thing from the most hated label of all - career politician. Republican Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon seemed to suggest all of that and more when he made this point while delivering the Republican weekly radio response on Nov. 13: "The incoming Republican freshman class – well, it’s no ordinary group: nearly half of its roughly 80 members have never served in elective office before." This theme has even more power this year in the wake of the Tea Party movement’s success and its assertion that Washington is the problem; that it’s populated by free-spending, self-serving career politicians. And as Congress gets ready for serious work it’s the fuel for Republican energy in the House. So let’s take a look at the numbers to see if the impression Walden paints holds up. When the House convened Jan. 5, 85 newly elected Republicans were sworn into office. (The total is different from Walden’s because some races were undecided when he spoke. Back then, not all Republicans had been declared winners. Also, Republicans claim 87 new members were sworn in. But two arrived at the tail-end of the previous Congress) Of the 85, 32 Republican freshmen never held a publicly elected office before, according to the National Republican Campaign Committee, which helps elect Republicans to the House. (Not every one of those 32, however, is a complete novice. At least three worked previously as congressional aides or at the White House, one is on the Republican National Committee’s executive committee and at least two raced unsuccessfully for other public offices in the past.) In real terms, that means 38 percent of the newest Republicans in the House never held elective office before. If you base the calculation on information known at the time Walden spoke, it’s still about 36 percent. Either way it’s a bit of a reach from "nearly a half,’’ as Walden suggests. By comparison, only one of the nine Democrats newly elected to the House could claim to be a political neophyte. Walden’s staff says he used two sources for his claim. A column in the website PoliticsDaily that flatly said - without offering any support or attribution - that 35 new Republicans came from non-political backgrounds. The second source was the National Republican Congressional Committee, which according to Walden’s office, said 32 had never held elective office before. The final number is 32. Does this really matter? Not really. As they say for the stock market, past performance doesn’t predict future actions. The same is true in Congress, where members often find themselves taking positions and votes that they did not envision while running for office. And that does nothing to diminish the truly diverse background of the incoming class of the 112th Congress. The new Republicans include Tim Griffin of Arkansas, a former assistant U.S. attorney; Robert Dold of Illinois owns a pest control business, was a White House aide and once managed an Internet data storage concern. There are farmers and surgeons and airline pilots. There is Michael Grimm of New York, who owns a health food store and was an FBI agent and Jon Runyan who, before arriving in Washington, was an All-Pro offensive tackle in the NFL. There’s alsoJames Lankford of Oklahoma, who worked as a religious youth camp director before winning election to the House. All of this is interesting and supports Walden’s claim that the new GOP class in the House brings considerable non-political experience. But the gap between 38 percent and Walden’s suggestion of "nearly half" is simply too wide. For this reason, we rate his claim Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00698	The projected revenue from the Mayweather/Pacquiao fight is "larger than the annual GDP of 29 different countries."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/03/jim-lampley/truth-about-claim-mayweatherpacquiao-fight-outearn/	The fight of the century this weekend between Floyd "Money" Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao was also the payday of the century. But did revenue from the boxing match at the MGM Grand Arena Saturday night surpass the Gross Domestic Products of nearly 30 countries? That was the claim made a couple of times during the HBO/Showtime pay-per-view broadcast. Ticket sales topped $74 million (more than the Super Bowl), organizers said, and another 3 million people were expected to fork over $100 to watch the fight at home. Add in other sources of revenue and Saturday’s event was projected to generate an estimated $400 million. That’s "larger than the annual GDP of 29 different countries," HBO boxing sportscaster Jim Lampley said during the live broadcast. We’re not sure where Lampley and event organizers got their information from -- we weren’t able to get in touch with him or someone from HBO -- but that figure is way off, according to the World Bank, which tracks global financial data for about 200 countries and territories. There are only six countries with an annual Gross Domestic Product of less than $400 million, according to the bank’s 2013 ranking. (GDP is the monetary value of all goods and services that an economy produces in a year and a standard measurement of an economy’s size). All six are tiny island nations. Here are their 2013 GDPs: Micronesia: $316 million Sao Tome and Principe: $311 million Palau: $247 million Marshall Islands: $191 million Kiribati: $169 million Tuvalu: $38 million The country with the seventh-lowest GDP is Tonga, with a GDP of $466 million, just surpassing the estimated revenue of the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight. For comparison, the United States had the world’s largest GDP in 2013 -- $16.8 trillion. We think one explanation for the large discrepancy with Lampley’s claim is the fact that the World Bank doesn’t have GDP data for 22 economies. But of the missing 22, most are territories of other nations -- for example the United States territory of Guam or the British territory of the Cayman Islands. Only six without a 2013 World Bank GDP are fully independent nations: Andorra, North Korea, Liechtenstein, Myanmar, Somalia and Syria. We looked up the most recent GDP estimates we could find for each country to see if any were less than $400 million, but we found that all six exceeded that amount: Andorra: $3.7 billion (2008 -- World Bank) North Korea: $28 billion (2009 -- CIA World Factbook) Liechtenstein: $4.8 billion (2009 -- World Bank) Myanmar: $64.3 billion (2014 -- CIA World Factbook) Somalia: $2.4 billion (2010 -- CIA World Factbook) Syria: $40.4 billion (2007 -- World Bank) So in total, only six countries have GDPs smaller than the revenue brought in by the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight. Our ruling Lampley said the revenue brought in by the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight was "larger than the annual GDP of 29 different countries." The match was estimated to generate about $400 million, which is a lot of money, to be sure. But only six out of the world’s nearly 200 countries have GDPs smaller than that, according to World Bank data. We’re KO’ing this claim. Pants on Fire! Correction: All 50 U.S. states have a gross state product in excess of $400 million. An earlier version of this fact-check was incorrect on this point.

pomt-07892	"All the money the Department of Citrus has is paid for by the citrus growers. You don't save dollars by eliminating the Department of Citrus."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/04/adam-putnam/adam-putnam-says-citrus-department-doesnt-use-stat/	At an Associated Press meeting Jan. 19, 2011, about the state's upcoming legislative session, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services Adam Putnam was asked about an idea floated by Gov. Rick Scott to merge two state departments: Citrus and Agriculture. Putnam wasn't sweet on the idea. "All the money the Department of Citrus has is paid for by the citrus growers," Putnam said. "You don't save dollars by eliminating the Department of Citrus." Government departments usually are funded, at least in part, with taxpayer dollars. So we wondered, is that not the case with the Department of Citrus? Is the entire department's budget paid for by the growers? Putnam spokesman Sterling Ivey explained via e-mail on Feb. 1: "Although it's a state agency, the FDOC is unique in that its operations are not funded through the state's general tax revenue fund. Florida's citrus industry pays its own way in the form of an excise tax placed on each box of citrus that moves through commercial channels." The department is well-known in the citrus-growing areas of Central Florida, but less so in other parts of the state. So Ivey sent us some background from the department's website. It was established in 1935 by legislative approval of the Florida Citrus Code. It's not affiliated with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The 12-member Florida Citrus Commission, appointed by the governor, sets the annual tax rate that growers pay. The department regulates every aspect of the industry, including research, production, fertilizing, maturity standards, harvesting, licensing, transportation, labeling, packing and processing. Ivey also sent us a link to the department's 2010-11 budget. We contacted Comptroller Debra Funkhouser, who has been with the department for 16 years, and she broke down the budget. The total is about $58 million this year. About 85 percent comes from the box tax, 9 percent from the federal government, and the remainder from interest and carryover dollars, she said in an interview Feb. 2. That breakdown does not fluctuate much, and the department has been funded that way for decades, Funkhouser said. Approximately 57 employees work for the department now, and none of its expenses -- including overhead and salaries – are paid from state tax dollars, Funkhouser said. She did confirm that the department has received only $10 million from state general revenues in its 76-year history, a one-time occurrence after crops were devastated by hurricanes in 2004-05. The box tax is assessed to growers, collected by the processors and remitted to the citrus department, she said. The tax for oranges, for example, is currently 25 cents for a 90-pound box. Does that mean the box tax is passed on to customers buying citrus? "I would have to say there is a correlation, just like the cost of farmers' fertilizer, just like the cost of harvesting that fruit. It's not a direct association," she said. An article in the Lakeland Ledger on Jan. 18, 2011, described a meeting about a month earlier between Ken Keck, the citrus department's executive director, and two officials from Scott's budget office. Keck said the officials discussed possible changes that included a merger with the Agriculture Department or another marketing agency, such as tourism, as well as privatization. "Citrus officials argued any proposed Citrus Department reform would not advance Scott's stated agenda of cutting taxes for Florida businesses and residents because none of their taxes go to the department," the Ledger said. "To the extent this is a general-revenue issue, this does zero for the state budget," Keck was quoted in the article. "It's unclear whether the governor is aware of that." The article noted that the department "contributes about $2 million annually to the state's general fund through a service charge levied on every state agency, (Florida Citrus Commissioner Jay) Clark said." We also looked at the "sunset review"-- routinely done of state departments to determine whether they should be retained, modified or abolished. The Senate Committee on Agriculture was the primary sunset review committee for the 2008 review. The sunset review recommended keeping the citrus department as a free-standing department because a merger would make it inefficient at a time when the citrus industry was facing challenges, including recovering from hurricanes. Putnam claimed: "All the money the Department of Citrus has is paid for by the citrus growers. You don't save dollars by eliminating the Department of Citrus." In fact, about 85 percent is paid for by the growers -- of the rest, about 9 percent comes from the federal government. So Putnam is correct that Florida won't save state taxpayer dollars by eliminating the department, but he's missing the context of the additional federal dollars. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-02800	"The economy bled $24 billion" due to the government shutdown.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/03/doonesbury/doonesbury-says-government-shutdown-took-24-billio/	Lest we forget that the deal that ended the October government shutdown provided only some breathing room and not a lasting fix, the comic strip Doonesbury reminded us that a second crisis is possible. On Sunday, Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau offered this conversation between disembodied voices coming from the White House. "Who’s calling please?" "Thirty extremists from gerrymandered districts. We’re going to take the economy hostage again and we’ll destroy it if we don’t get what we want." "But the last time you tried that, the economy bled $24 billion and you got nothing." The conversation ends when the caller is transferred to the Obamacare hotline where all lines are down and the call goes dead. Our interest is in the claim of a $24 billion hit on the economy from the standoff over Obamacare and the debt ceiling. Eventually -- once the final economic data is released early next year -- we'll have a good idea of how much of a hit the economy took from the shutdown. But for now, we have to estimate it. So how large are the most reliable estimates? We found that the $24 billion figure, which emerged when the shutdown ended in mid-October, still holds water, although it’s at the high end of the estimates. Trudeau told PunditFact that he relied on the estimate from Standard and Poor’s. Analysts there wrote on Oct. 16 that GDP for the fourth quarter would be 0.6 percent less than it would have been. That translates into $24 billion. The losses stem from consumers trimming their spending, delays in processing export and import permits, small business loans that got held up and dozens of other tiny but significant ways that private-sector activity crosses paths with the government. At the peak of the impasse, estimates of the economic impact varied. JP Morgan came in at the low end with a 0.2 percent drop in GDP, or about a $12 billion hit. Economists at Goldman Sachs and the consulting firm IHS thought it would be 0.5 percent. About five days after the shutdown ended, Moody’s Analytics produced a damage report. They also thought half a percentage point off of growth, or roughly $20 billion, was the right number. Moody’s went a bit further and warned that the impact was not limited to just the days that the government remained shuttered. "As long as lawmakers stay deadlocked over the direction of the federal budget, the economic recovery will not gain momentum," chief economist Mark Zandi wrote. "Consumers and businesses will remain on edge, holding back spending, investment and hiring." About a week after the government re-opened, the White House produced one of the lower estimates. The President’s Council of Economic Advisers looked at eight different measures of economic activity and came up with a figure of about 0.25 percent which would mean about a $14 billion loss in growth. The council said such a drop cost the country 120,000 jobs. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy research arm of Congress, summarized what was known as of early November but did not offer its own estimate. That report emphasized it will be several months before all the hard data is in that will allow a detailed accounting. Also in November, Bloomberg News surveyed over 70 economists and found that the consensus was the shutdown had trimmed fourth quarter annualized growth by about 0.4 percent, or $16 billion. By mid December, top-level budget negotiations between Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., are slated to produce a spending plan that will carry the country beyond the Jan. 15, 2014, deadline set in the deal that ended the shutdown. There have been encouraging signs of compromise but even if a plan emerges, it must still make it through the House -- which is where the trouble started last time. Our ruling Doonesbury, aka Garry Trudeau, said the government shutdown cost the economy $24 billion. That is based on the highest of the independent estimates. The others are lower. Three prominent forecasters, Goldman Sachs, IHS and Moody’s assessed the damage at $20 billion. A survey of economists set $16 billion as the most likely figure. There is broad agreement that the political impasse produced uncertainty that puts an ongoing, if unquantified, damper on growth. Trudeau likes to say he aims for verisimilitude and he achieved that with his use of a high but defensible estimate from an independent source. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-13552	The Hollywood celebrities endorsing Hillary Clinton are "in many cases celebrities that aren’t very hot anymore."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-clintons-celebrity-backers-arent-very/	Donald Trump mocked the size of Hillary Clinton’s crowds and the depth of her support at a packed rally in Tampa. Then he turned on Clinton’s celebrity supporters. "The only people enthusiastic about her campaign are Hollywood celebrities, in many cases celebrities that aren’t very hot anymore," he said. We were interested in his line that Clinton’s celebrity backers are "in many cases celebrities that aren’t very hot anymore." Believe it or not, there actually is data that addresses this question. Ever the dutiful fact-checkers, we dug in. (For the record, the Trump campaign did not respond to our requests for evidence, and though the Clinton campaign did respond, it did not address our particular question.) Clinton celebs still sizzling Clinton has received endorsements from at least 900 celebrities. With that volume, some "aren’t very hot anymore" (consider Laguna Beach’s Lo Bosworth and MC Hammer). But Hollywood royalty is largely on Clinton’s side. Trump specified "Hollywood celebrities," so we won’t count Clinton supporters like radio host Howard Stern or President Barack Obama. And because Trump focused on "enthusiastic" supporters, we’ll also limit our investigation to Hollywood celebrities who have campaigned or raised money for Clinton. With those parameters, we identified about 100 hardcore Tinseltown Clinton fans. The roster includes singers Beyoncé, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, Alicia Keys, Katy Perry and Demi Lovato (the last three of whom performed at the Democratic National Convention); and Oscar winners Meryl Streep, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Leonardo DiCaprio, plus George Clooney (who once defended a fundraiser he held for Clinton with this Half True claim) and Bradley Cooper (whose appearance at the DNC upset some American Sniper fans). Other celebrity supporters include Kanye West and wife Kim Kardashian (who got her selfie with Clinton in 2015), Heidi Klum, Magic Johnson and Elton John (who headlined a New York City concert for the Hillary Victory Fund and isn’t too keen on Tiny Dancer being played at Trump rallies). And as we said, you can actually gauge how hot these celebrities are. We consulted E-Poll Market Research, which collects data on almost 9,000 celebrities and measures whether people know and like them. The marketing firm had an E-Score for all but one person on the list (Orange is the New Black’s Dascha Polanco). Altogether, the 100 most enthusiastic Clinton celebrities averaged an E-Score of 86 out of 100. Two-thirds of the list scored above 90, with seven netting a perfect 100. (Because E-Score reflects both awareness and likeability, Kanye West scored a low 15 due to low appeal.) Katy Perry, a Clinton donor and campaign trail performer, tops Forbes’ list of celebrities with the most Twitter followers (92.1 million). A dozen other Clinton supporters also are on the list. Forbes also counts Perry and six other Clinton backers among the highest-paid celebrities of 2016. Ten Clinton celebs made it onto Vulture’s Most Valuable Movie Stars of 2015. And finally, half of People’s Top 25 Celebrity Hot List, as of Aug. 25, 2016, is backing Clinton. For a more qualitative take on Trump’s claim, we turned to Hollywood blogger Perez Hilton. "He’s dead wrong!" Hilton told PolitiFact. "Katy Perry is one of the biggest and highest-earning pop stars on the planet. Justin Timberlake just hosted a fundraiser for (Clinton). Meryl Streep and Barbra Streisand are legends. Trump himself is the one with D- and Z-list celeb support!" (Full disclosure: Hilton supports Clinton and has been photographed wearing a Hillary Clinton onesie.) Not many of the 100 total celebrity Trump endorsers have also appeared with him on the campaign trail (notable exceptions include former Indiana University basketball coach Bob Knight and several NASCAR drivers). Just one, Beth Chapman of A&E’s Dog the Bounty Hunter, gave to his campaign, according to our search. E-Poll Market Research did not have an E-Score on file for 13 of about 60 of Trump’s most prominent defenders. Randy Parker, a spokesman for the company, told us the Republican nominee’s list includes "some more obscure folk." "The fact that so many of (Trump’s) people aren’t even in our database shows that his people are really the ones who are not hot," Parker said. The Trump celebrities with E-Scores averaged a 64, with Walker, Texas Ranger star Chuck Norris leading the pack with a score of 99. Other high-scoring Trump celebrities include actors Lou Ferrigno (97), Randy Quaid (96), and Paul Sorvino (94). Of the Republican National Convention speakers, Scott Baio of Happy Days clocked a 91, while Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson scored a 78 and soap star and underwear model Antonio Sabato Jr. came in at 71. No enthusiastic Trump Hollywood celebrity appeared on the lists from People, Forbes or Vulture, though Trump supporter Caitlyn Jenner was named Just Jared’s Most Popular celebrity of 2015. Our ruling Trump said the Hollywood celebrities endorsing Hillary Clinton are "in many cases celebrities that aren’t very hot anymore." Trump has a point that out of hundreds of celebrities endorsing Clinton, some have faded. But the data doesn’t lie. Many prolific Clinton-backing stars remain popular according to several metrics: social media influence, earning potential, and popularity on celebrity news blogs and websites. Supporters like Katy Perry, Justin Timberlake, Meryl Streep and George Clooney are arguably the most visible and enthusiastic. Trump’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-10822	"21-million Americans could have a four-year college scholarship for the money we've squandered in Iraq. 7.6-million teachers could have been hired last year if we weren't squandering this money."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/20/mike-gravel/hes-high-then-hes-low/	Former U.S. Sen. Mike Gravel attacked the Iraq war during a recent debate by highlighting the increasing costs. "Stop and think," he said at Howard University on June 28, 2007. "When he's talking about the money we're squandering, 21-million Americans could have a four-year college scholarship for the money we've squandered in Iraq. 7.6-million teachers could have been hired last year if we weren't squandering this money." Gravel's campaign staff didn't respond to numerous requests for documentation supporting those numbers. They couldn't even say how much they think the Iraq war costs. But we researched the numbers anyway and found that in making his comparison he goes too high on one and too low on the other. Ruling? Half true. We interpreted his assertion to mean that the Iraq war budget would pay for the scholarships or the teachers' salaries, rather than both. The College Board puts the average cost of tuition for a four-year public university in 2006 at $5,836. Do the math: the sum exceeds $490.2-billion, much higher than even the highest estimate. The U.S. Department of Education reports the average teacher salary was $47,750 in 2005, the most recent year available. That produces a total of $363-billion, well below the lowest estimate. The Congressional Budget Office conservatively estimates the entire bill for the Iraq war since 2001 is $413-billion. The Congressional research did its own calculation to show that the price tag to date is $450.4-billion. So Gravel's comparisons are at once exaggerated and underestimated, but they are within the same range of the projected costs.

pomt-12057	"30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/08/blog-posting/no-30000-scientists-have-not-said-climate-change-h/	Climate change doubters have no patience for claims that the overwhelming number of climate researchers believe that humans are the driving factor. Facebook users flagged a recent article on the website News Punch that asserted much more disagreement in the scientific community than is commonly thought. "30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money," was the subheadline in the Sept. 2 story. That striking number of dissenting scientists has been around for many years and dates back to a 1998 petition drive conducted under the auspices of a climate change skeptic named Arthur Robinson. Robinson is a biochemist, conservative activist and four-time Republican congressional candidate in Oregon. Robinson believes human-driven climate change is a myth. Robinson’s Petition Project now counts 31,487 signatories. Before we get to who those people are, the key flaw in the News Punch statement is that the petition doesn’t say what the article claims. Here’s what people sign: For the purposes of this fact-check, the key sentence is, "There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate." The petition says nothing about hoaxes or profit motives. On its face, someone signing the petition need not believe that climate change is a hoax, nor that it has been perpetrated to make money. While some or even many who signed it might hold those beliefs, the petition itself doesn’t speak to either of those conditions. In terms of the mindset of the signers, the statement relies on speculation. Challenges to the petition There are many reasons to question what it means to have over 31,000 people signing this petition. First of all, the meaning of "scientist" is vague. The minimum requirement is a bachelor’s of science degree. That’s no guarantee that the person studied a science related to climate change, or that the person pursued a career in science. The petition’s website says that 12,715 signers hold "BS or equivalent academic degrees." When we look at the number of people with some sort of background in fields that tie directly to climate change, the petition website said, "there are 3,805 scientists trained in specialties directly related to the physical environment of the Earth." That would be about 12 percent of the total. There are, according to the site, 9,029 people with PhDs, which comes closer to meeting a higher bar for being thought of as a scientist. Based on the site’s figures, most of them don’t specialize in climate change, but they likely are more familiar with scientific methods. These important nuances get lost. A 2012 opinion piece in Forbes described the signers as "more than 31,000 American scientists from diverse climate-related disciplines." That’s way off the mark, unless you count veterinarians -- one of the degrees that qualifies you as a scientist in the petition project -- and physicians. We also don’t know much about when people signed the petition. The website tells us that thousands of signatures came in 1998 and 1999 when the petition was first circulated. It also says, "The majority of the current listed signatories signed or re-signed the petition after October 2007." The problem is, the scientific consensus on mankind’s role in climate change has grown over time. Even if more than half of the signers came after that date, it doesn’t mean that those who came before remain skeptical of climate change. There’s reason to think that opinions can shift. When the magazine Scientific American reached out to a random sample of 30 names on the list in 2006, it found "six said they would not sign the petition today, three did not remember any such petition, one had died, and five did not answer." We reached out to the publishers of News Punch and did not hear back. Our ruling An article on the News Punch website said that "30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money." The source is a well-known petition project. The key flaw is that the petition challenges the science, but it doesn’t cast human-driven climate change as a hoax aimed at making some people rich. That is pure interpretation by the website. The use of the word "scientists" is misleading, since a signatory need not be a scientist today and need not have done more than earned a bachelor of science degree in any field. The actual number of climate-related specialists is about 12 percent of the total. And these are not currently confirmed signatories as the list has been circulating since 1998. For all these reasons, we rate this claim Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-09-08T06:00:00	2017-09-02	['None']

pomt-09767	Medicare officials have treated Humana and AARP inconsistently on how they can communicate with seniors.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/30/house-republicans/medicare-aarp-humana-politics/	A controversial mailing from Humana to Medicare recipients has Republicans charging unfair treatment in the way the government handled private insurance companies versus the AARP. The House Republican Conference said the government is silencing Humana about reforms that would change Medicare Advantage, while the AARP — a notable reform supporter — gets off scott-free. "This week the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced it was investigating Humana for providing 'misleading' information regarding the administration's proposed cuts to Medicare Advantage policies — and prohibited other Medicare Advantage plans from providing similar information on how Democrat health 'reform' could take away their current coverage," the release said. "Yet the administration's edict prohibiting plans from communicating with their beneficiaries failed to include AARP, which sponsors a Medicare Advantage plan but has been a prime advocate of Democrats' government takeover of health care — quite possibly because AARP has been supporting a health care overhaul from which it stands to gain overall handsomely," the statement said. We wanted to investigate whether there were two different standards at work. We found that AARP and Humana actually have very different roles with Medicare plans. AARP makes money by licensing its name to a private insurer that offers a Medicare Advantage plan. Humana is a different private insurer that takes money from the government to provide an Advantage plan. Humana contracts with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in a program called Medicare Advantage. Often called Medicare's HMOs, Advantage is an optional program in which the federal government pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries. The program was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened, and Medicare Advantage actually costs the government more. President Barack Obama and groups like AARP have said it's time to bring the costs of Medicare Advantage in line with the cost of regular Medicare. Humana is the second-largest insurance company that handles Medicare Advantage, right after UnitedHealth Group. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that runs Medicare and is often referred to as CMS, recently announced it was looking into mailings that Humana sent to its Medicare Advantage and Part D patients. (Part D is Medicare coverage for prescription drugs.) "We are concerned that the materials Humana sent to our beneficiaries may violate Medicare rules by appearing to contain Medicare Advantage and prescription drug benefit information, which must be submitted to CMS for review," said Jonathan Blum, acting director of CMS's Center for Drug and Health Plan Choices. "We also are asking that no other plan sponsors are mailing similar materials while we investigate whether a potential violation has occurred." According to the CMS, Humana's mailing warned beneficiaries that they might lose benefits under health care reform, a claim that Democratic officials dispute. The Huffington Post said it has obtained a copy of the mailer and posted it to its Web site. The impact of health care reform on Medicare recipients has been a matter of considerable debate. We examined a claim by President Barack Obama that Medicare benefits would not be cut and found it to be Half True. Experts told us basic benefits would stay in place but that it's conceivable or even likely that Medicare Advantage patients could see reduced benefits. In a letter to Humana, a CMS official said that Humana's communication could be considered "misleading and confusing to beneficiaries" and might be construed as official Medicare communications. The House Republican Conference said CMS did not target the seniors' group "quite possibly because AARP has been supporting a health care overhaul ..." Our research shows, however, that AARP has a very different relationship with its members than Humana does with seniors on Medicare Advantage. Here's how it works: AARP lends its name to insurance companies to sell policies specifically for AARP members. The insurance companies then pay AARP a fee for the policies they sell with the AARP name. AARP calls these payments royalties. (Read our story for more details on AARP's royalties .) AARP does profit indirectly from selling Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplemental policies, and it uses that money to fund its efforts as a nonprofit advocacy group. AARP partners with UnitedHealth on its Medicare plans. UnitedHealth is the No. 1 seller of Medicare Advantage, with 16 percent of the market, followed closely by Humana with 14 percent of the market, according to Mark Farrah Associates. So when AARP mails seniors, it's using its own private membership list for communication. Humana, on the other hand, is mailing people using personal information it receives as a government contractor. UnitedHealth would be bound by similar rules. We find that the House Republican Conference is off base when it claims that the CMS and the Obama administration have two different standards for AARP and Humana. Humana is a government contractor for Medicare Advantage; the AARP is not. We rate the statement False.	None	House Republican Conference	None	None	None	2009-09-30T17:41:10	2009-09-22	['None']

pomt-09091	"Social Security, like I told you, is out of money. This year it is borrowing from the general treasury."	false	/texas/statements/2010/jun/24/michele-bachmann/bachmann-says-social-security-running-deficit-and-/	While Republican delegates chowed down on beef brisket at the Republican Party of Texas convention in Dallas, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota sounded a stomach-turning note. "Social Security, like I told you, is out of money," she said in her June 11 keynote address. "This year it is borrowing from the general treasury." Bachmann had hammered the point earlier in her speech: : "The Social Security payroll taxes have been our cash cow. And the dirty little secret is Congress has spent every last dime of Social Security money. Did you know that? I hate to tell you bad news." To back up the claim, Bachmann’s campaign sent us a March 24 news article in The New York Times, which said that this year, Social Security "will pay out more in benefits than it receives in payroll taxes, an important threshold it was not expected to cross until at least 2016." That’s according to the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan group that does number-crunching for Congress. On March 31, director Douglas Elmendorf wrote on the CBO blog that Social Security’s "primary deficit," not including interest the program earns on securities issued by the general treasury, will be $29 billion this year. Elmendorf predicted finances will improve temporarily as the economy recovers, but said "a longer-term decline in the trust funds’ financial condition is inevitable under current law, because the retirement of the baby-boom generation will cause benefit payments to increase more than revenues." In assessing the financial health of Social Security, it’s important to realize the program not only receives income from workers paying Social Security taxes, it’s also built up a big trust fund that it can tap when necessary. So even if income from payroll taxes runs short, Social Security can make up the money from the trust fund. The "trust fund" is more or less an accounting device — how the government keeps track of the money it’s authorized to spend on Social Security. In an interview with the New York Times, Stephen Goss, chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, outlined the immediate bind: The recession has put people out of jobs, some of them then applying for Social Security benefits sooner than expected. Fewer jobs also means reduced payrolls, meaning less in payroll taxes going to the government. Still, Goss pointed out, the trust fund has a $2.5 trillion balance, enough to cover benefits for about 25 years. Josh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that specializes in analyzing budget deficits, said that just because payroll taxes have fallen short of paying for benefits this year "doesn’t mean Social Security is insolvent, or out of money." And what of Bachmann’s second point, that Social Security’s borrowing money from the general treasury? At the Social Security Administration, spokesman Mark Hinkle said that even if benefit spending exceeds available revenue from payroll taxes, the program can draw on interest from money it’s invested in securities in the general treasury. Hinkle said: "We have all our trust fund dollars in special-issue treasury bonds that earn interest. We’re not borrowing from the treasury." John Rother, executive vice president of policy and strategy for AARP, a nonprofit advocacy group for senior citizens, said it’s actually the government that’s borrowing from Social Security because Social Security puts money into federal securities, enabling the government to spend the invested money. As the nation’s retiree population balloons, Social Security faces long-term financial challenges. In its latest annual report, issued in May 2009, the Trustees of Social Security and Medicare trust funds predicted that balancing Social Security’s finances over the next 75 years would require an immediate increase in the payroll tax by 16 percent, a cut in benefits by 13 percent, or some combo of the two. The trustees concluded that without reforms, benefit spending would exceed tax income starting in 2016, a deficit that could be made up by redeeming trust fund assets until the program’s funds are exhausted in 2037. That estimate is now outdated. Trustees, still reconciling how the recently passed health care law will affect projections, haven’t issued their 2010 report, which, judging by the CBO’s projections, could show significantly different numbers. Upshot: Bachmann may have a point in calling Social Security payroll taxes — a component of the program’s trust fund — "our cash cow." Yet when she claims in the same breath that Congress has spent "every dime of Social Security money," she’s wrong. Social Security isn’t yet out of money, nor is it borrowing from the general treasury, as Bachmann says. According to the latest projections, the "cow" won’t run dry until 2037. We rate her statement as False. Update: We stepped on a live wire with this article and, based on reader reactions, realize we could have been blunt that the so-called Social Security Trust Fund isn't a pot of money like, say, someone's personal savings account. Also, we could have been clearer about decisions that lie ahead to shore up Social Security. References to the trust fund are really references to an ongoing relationship between two parts of the U.S. government. Here's how reader Michael Brandl, a lecturer at the McCombs School of Business, summed it up in his note to us this morning: The Social Security system "will be in a deficit this year — that is because of economic slowdown, as you correctly point out. However, the 'trust fund' is not really a 'savings account' as one might think. As you correctly point out, the trust fund is made up of Treasury securities, which are paid with future tax revenues. So, the Social Security trust fund is made up of promises to repay ourselves!" There's an overarching concern here, past the statement we checked. Down the years, will the government make good on Social Security's investments in treasury securities? We're not wading into that — it also wasn't at issue in Bachmann's statement. Social Security is clearly a hot topic.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2010-06-24T06:00:00	2010-06-11	['None']
pomt-06488	Says the National Labor Relations Board told Boeing that it "can't build a factory in a non-union state."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/14/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-attack-barack-obama-over-boeing-plant-/	When Republican candidates want to fire up a crowd in New Hampshire, a reference to Right to Work generally delivers satisfying results. A Right to Work law makes it harder for unions to collect money from non-union workers. Unions hate these laws about as much as most Republican voters love them. At the Oct. 11, 2011, GOP presidential debate in Hanover, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney played to those values. Asked about his economic plan, Romney said one principle would be respect for the rule of law, and then he took a jab at the President Barack Obama and his administration. "We also have to have the rule of law. By that I mean, you can't have the federal government through its friends at the National Labor Relations Board saying, to a company like Boeing, that you can't build a factory in a non-union state. That's simply wrong and it violates the principle of the rule of law." We decided to examine this question: Did the NLRB tell Boeing that it "can’t build a factory in a non-union state." The Romney campaign told us the source of this statement was an April New York Times article about a complaint filed by the NLRB against Boeing. The complaint sought "to force Boeing to bring an airplane production line back to its unionized facilities in Washington state instead of moving the work to a non-union plant in South Carolina." About six years ago, Boeing was ramping up to build its newest passenger jet, the 787 Dreamliner. The company explored making all the planes at its factories in Washington state, but in 2009, it decided to start a second, smaller production line in South Carolina. The union plants in Puget Sound would make seven planes a month; the non-union facility in North Charleston, S.C. would produce three a month. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers complained. The NLRB’s general counsel tried to bring the parties together but failed. In April 2011, the general counsel’s office formally issued a complaint on the grounds that Boeing built its factory in South Carolina in order to punish the union. Top Boeing officials were quite open about the connection between the machinists union and the new factory. According to the filing,one executive told a newspaper that "the overriding factor (in transferring the line) was not the business climate. And it was not the wages we’re paying today. It was that we cannot afford to have a work stoppage, you know, every three years." In the eyes of the general counsel, this was a form of retaliation against the union for having conducted strikes in the past. As such, he argued Boeing violated the National Labor Relations Act, which prohibits employers from interfering with the right of workers to organize and to strike. The question is: Did Boeing act to get back at the union or did it have other reasons? "The whole thing boils down to motivations," said Nancy Cleeland, a spokesperson for the NLRB. "That’s the reason to have a hearing. To see what was going on." Cleeland’s emphasis on a hearing could sound like boring procedure, but it’s actually pivotal. Since Romney brought up the Boeing dispute to demonstrate his regard for the rule of law, it's worth looking at the legal process here. The NLRB has five board members. So far, they have played no role in this matter at all. The call for a hearing came when the general counsel of the NLRB, who acts independently of the board, filed a complaint because there seemed to be enough evidence to make it stick. Based on such a complaint, this case now sits before an administrative judge who has yet to make a decision. After the judge rules, that ruling will then go to the NLRB to be voted up or down or changed. In short, the law provides a process with checks and balances. Romney’s statement gets way ahead of that process, and it runs into trouble on another front. The complaint against Boeing is not based on the fact that South Carolina is a right-to-work state. We spoke to lawyers who think the complaint is well founded and lawyers who think it is utterly misguided, but they agree on this point. Stanford law professor William Gould, a former chair the NLRB, thinks the general counsel was wrong to move this complaint forward. By his reading of federal law, employers have the legal right to minimize exposure to strikes, and deciding to locate a plant in a place where unions are weak can be a strategy that passes legal muster. But Gould said Romney did "make an error of fact." "He’s wrong in suggesting that the general counsel’s reasoning applies peculiarly to union or non-union states," Gould said. Another labor lawyer, Jeffrey Hirsch at the University of North Carolina Law School, concurred. "This has nothing to do with geography," Hirsch said. "You could switch the states and the case would be identical." Both lawyers also said that if Romney is suggesting that the NLRB has done anything unusual, he’s completely wrong. "The NLRB has held in countless cases that employers can’t move to another facility for prohibited reasons," Gould said. A prohibited reason would be to punish the union. Even the spokesman for the National Right to Work Committee, Patrick Semmens, said the issue isn’t that South Carolina is a right-to-work state. "The more fundamental point is that it was a non-union facility," said Semmens, who still believed that Romney’s claim has merit. The third problem with Romney’s statement is that if the general counsel at the NLRB really wanted to block the factory in South Carolina, he could have asked for an injunction, which is allowed under the National Labor Relations Act. He did not. The factory is up and running, and Cleeland, the NLRB spokesperson, says Boeing now can tell the administrative judge that to shut the plant would cause undue economic hardship. There is of course political context to this story. Organized labor has more pull with Democrats than with Republicans, and the machinists union pressed hard to have its complaint move forward. Semmens with the NRWC said he thinks that pressure lies behind the NLRB action. Our ruling Romney claimed that the NLRB told Boeing that it "can’t build a factory in a non-union state." This presents a sweeping distortion of the NLRB's actions that is not borne out by the facts. An office at the NLRB has started a process that could, at the theoretical limit, result in a factory closure, but the NLRB as a whole hasn’t told Boeing anything. The office of the NLRB that moved the complaint forward could have asked for the factory to close while its complaint was pending, and it did not. The legal basis for the action centers on whether Boeing was trying to punish the union for being willing to call a strike, not that Boeing had opened a factory in a right-to-work state. Romney’s statement reflects reality in that a Democratic administration tends to give more weight to union complaints, and unions don’t like to see jobs flow to right-to-work states. But his words go far beyond what the NLRB has actually done. We rate his statement False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-10-14T13:52:21	2011-10-11	['None']

pomt-02312	"There are still more people uninsured today than when Obama was elected president."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/31/jack-kingston/kingstons-claim-about-number-uninsured-has-some-me/	Republicans have made the case on several different fronts why the federal health care law is not the cure for the nation’s health care problems, primarily from a policy perspective. Some are now using a numbers-based argument to contend it’s not helping as many Americans as the law’s supporters predicted. "There are still more people uninsured today than when (Barack) Obama was elected president," U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, a Republican from Savannah, said recently on the Fox News Channel. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if the congressman’s claim is correct. Obama, a Democrat, took office in January 2009. A year later, he signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, arguably the most sweeping rule changes on health care since Medicare was created in the late 1960s. Many Republicans mockingly called the law "Obamacare," a moniker that the president later said he would proudly embrace. Kingston, who is running this year for the U.S. Senate, voted against the health care law. Earlier this month, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said "there are less people today with health insurance than there were before this law went into effect." Our friends at PolitiFact in Washington examined that claim and found many problems with Boehner’s statement and rated it False. Kingston’s claim is different, primarily because of the different time frame he used, so we continued with our research. Health care data is difficult to determine. The Obama administration started its insurance marketplace accounts for enrollees to join, but sign-ups initially fell well below Congressional Budget Office projections. An estimated 6 million people have now signed up for health care through the marketplaces set up through the law, but that number is uncertain because individuals can purchase insurance outside of the marketplaces in Vermont and Washington, D.C. The open enrollment season ends Monday. One consistent statistic we found in several surveys showed there were more than 40 million Americans without health insurance in 2008, the year before Obama moved into the White House. Kingston’s office said the congressman based his claim on a recent nationwide Gallup poll on America’s uninsured. The poll shows 15.4 percent of Americans were uninsured during the first quarter of 2009. Currently, 15.9 percent of Americans are uninsured. The poll has a margin of error of 1 percentage point. Does that mean there could now be a smaller percentage of Americans uninsured, or that the percentage is basically the same between those two years? "Technically, you could say that they were within the margin, but that margin means the ‘09 number could be as low as 14.4 and the 2014 as high as 16.9 percent," Greg Dolan, a spokesman for Kingston, said in one email. The Atlanta-based U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also tracks how many Americans are uninsured on an annual basis. Their data is similar to the Gallup poll. In 2008, they found 14.7 percent of Americans were uninsured at the time they were interviewed. In 2013, the number of uninsured was barely lower, at 14.6 percent. The 2013 survey was done between January and June. It’s unclear when the 2008 survey was conducted. In 2009, the CDC survey shows 15.4 percent were uninsured when they were interviewed. We also looked at data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which also releases annual statistics on the health insurance status of Americans. In 2008, 14.9 percent of Americans were uninsured. A year later, the percentage of uninsured rose to 16.1 percent. In 2012, it declined to 15.4 percent. The actual number of Americans uninsured, according to the Census Bureau data, rose from nearly 44.8 million in 2008 to nearly 49 million in 2009. In 2012, their data shows just under 48 million Americans were uninsured. The Census Bureau data does not indicate whether there is a margin of error. Obama did take office amid the nation’s worst financial situation since the Great Depression. The unemployment rate rose from 6.1 percent in September 2008 -- when the crisis began -- to 7.8 percent in January 2009, adding about 2.5 million Americans to the unemployment rolls, with many of them presumably losing their health insurance. The unemployment rate rose to 10 percent by October 2009. Should Obama get a reprieve from Kingston’s criticism because of the economic meltdown? No, Kingston’s office says. Dolan said the congressman’s point is that the health care law is not dramatically reducing the number of Americans without health insurance. The Gallup poll, however, shows the percentage of those uninsured has declined from 18 percent at one point late last year to the current uninsured rate of 15.9 percent. "The numbers of uninsured skyrocketed in reaction to passage of Obamacare (in 2010)," Dolan said. "That they’ve settled out where they were before this disaster is not a positive sign for the initiative." So where does this leave us? Kingston said in a television interview that "there are still more people uninsured today than when Obama was elected president." Obama came into office facing some extraordinary economic circumstances with several million Americans losing their jobs and many of them losing their health insurance. Some might say the president should get cut some slack here. Kingston’s camp says the problem worsened as a result of the health care law. The congressman based his claim on a Gallup poll detailing the percentage of uninsured between the beginning of 2009 and now.

pomt-13001	Says Rex Tillerson "sued to keep a fracking project out of his backyard."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/14/watch-food-water/did-rex-tillerson-oil-ceo-and-secretary-state-pick/	Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, doesn’t have a problem with fracking until it affects him, says a consumer rights group. "ExxonMobil is a major player in the fracking industry, and #ExxonKnew climate change was a problem for decades, but covered up the evidence," reads a campaign letter from Food & Water Watch. "Tillerson infamously sued to keep a fracking project out of his backyard, but seems happy to profit off fracking in other people's backyards." For this fact-check, we wanted to know if the head of the largest natural gas-producing company in the United States really said no fracking way to a drilling project in his own neighborhood. Food & Water Watch is right about Tillerson’s participation in the natural gas litigation, though its account misses a few details. Fracking-caused noise and traffic was one of many concerns listed in the lawsuit. Tillerson’s lawyer also told the Wall Street Journal that Tillerson himself cared the most about property devaluation. And the oil chief dropped out of the lawsuit after receiving attention for it. In 2012, Tillerson, his wife and their neighbors in Bartonville, Texas, sued to block the construction of a 160-foot water tower in their luxury community. The tower would, in part, supply water for hydraulic fracturing — which injects pressurized water as well as sand and chemicals under shale rock formations to extract natural gas. The lawsuit contended the project violates the town’s zoning ordinance and will also be an "unbearable nuisance." "A water tower will have lights on at all hours of the night, traffic to and from the tower at unknown and unreasonable hours, noise from mechanical and electrical equipment needed to maintain and operate the water tower, and creates and (sic) unsafe and unattractive nuisance to the children of the area," the suit reads. "Furthermore, upon information and belief, (the Bartonville Water Supply Corporation) will sell water to oil and gas explorers for fracing shale formations leading to traffic with heavy trucks on FM 407, creating a noise nuisance and traffic hazards," it continues. In addition to joining the lawsuit, Tillerson sat for a three-hour deposition in May 2013 and protested the project at a town council meeting that November, according to the Journal’s report in February 2014. But the newspaper noted that Tillerson wasn’t "the most vocal or well-known opponent of the tower." That distinction belonged to the lead plaintiffs, former U.S. House Majority Leader Dick Armey and his wife. Environmentalists jumped on the story, with plenty pointing out the irony and hypocrisy but embracing Tillerson into their ranks. A former oil executive penned an open letter to Tillerson on NoFrackingWay.Us decrying the environmental impacts of the practice and wishing him "good luck with that fracking water tank." Credo Action, an online hub of progressive activists, dubbed Tillerson "the highest-profile anti-fracking activist in the world." And MoveOn.org offered Tillerson its "FrackingFighter" award. Under pressure and after a judge dismissed the claims, Tillerson dropped out of the lawsuit two months later in April 2014, the Dallas Business Journal reported. The Armeys and a few others continued to pursue legal action over the project, and the battle continued into at least November 2015, the last mention of the case we could find. Our ruling Food & Water Watch said Tillerson "sued to keep a fracking project out of his backyard." Tillerson joined a lawsuit that listed noise nuisance and traffic hazards among the plaintiffs’ many concerns, though he later dropped out of the litigation. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-09083	“If every small business in our state, on average, was able to create one new job we would cut our unemployment rate in half.”	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jun/25/frank-caprio/caprio-says-ri-jobless-rate-could-be-cut-half-if-s/	If you’ve heard Frank Caprio speak in the last few months, you’ve heard him talk about small businesses. At campaign stops and on his website, the Democratic candidate for governor loves to chat about the small businesses he’s visited, the hurdles they face and what he would do to help them if he’s elected governor. He tells the stories so frequently and consistently, reporters know his talking points by heart. Twice in 24 hours recently he repeated one of his favorites, promising voters that he would make Rhode Island’s "35,000 small businesses" his top priority if elected. Both times he capped that pledge with this mantra: "If every small business in our state, on average, was able to create one new job, we would cut our unemployment rate in half and go from one of the highest in the country to one of the lowest." That sounds easy. But is his math right? The facts on small businesses There is an ongoing debate in Rhode Island about what constitutes a small business, depending on whether you define it by the number of employees, total revenues or other factors. Caprio bases his calculations on the assumption that there are 35,000 small businesses. His campaign says it got that number from two sources. When we first asked them, they said they got that figure from the state Economic Development Corporation, which gets its data from the state Department of Labor and Training, which relied on state taxation figures to establish its fact sheet on small businesses. Several days later, a campaign spokesman said Caprio first got the number from a Cranston accountant named Anthony V. Ricci, who brought it to one of Caprio’s small business forums. Ricci told us he got to 35,000 by taking the tax filings from companies that had less than $2.5 million in sales per year (his definition of a small business) and factoring in several other calculations. We decided to go with the official sources. The problem is that both the EDC and the DLT peg the number at 32,372, not 35,000. And that’s all businesses, not just the small ones. Remove the 67 Rhode Island companies with more than 500 employees -- a common dividing line between small and large businesses -- and you’re left with 32,305. Caprio’s campaign defends the higher figure, saying that if you factor in other types of companies such as sole proprietorships, which don’t fall under the general small business classification, the number inches up. Thirty-five thousand, they say, is a fair estimate. But that number is still questionable because 6,490 of those companies are not easy to categorize. DLT spokeswoman Laura Hart said “the vast majority” of those 6,490 are "seasonal employers." According to state Tax Administrator David Sullivan, that number could also include holding corporations or LLCs with no employees. The point is, since it’s hard to know how many of them are functioning companies, it’s impossible to determine whether they’re capable of adding a worker, no matter how much the economy improves, or how much help a Caprio administration could provide. The Caprio team argues that if you put enough "wind at their back," those companies will add new workers. But is a holding corporation with no employees really going to hire someone new? We don’t think so. Subtracting the 6,490 questionable companies from the DLT’s original 32,305 leaves you with 25,815. Calculating the unemployment rate Still with us? Hang in there, we’re almost finished. As of June 9, when Caprio made his statement, there were 72,300 unemployed Rhode Islanders. The unemployment rate then -- it has since dropped -- was 12.5 percent. To cut that rate in half -- to 6.25 percent -- you would need to find jobs for 36,150 of them. But remember that Caprio’s claim is based on the assumption that there are 35,000 small businesses. Even if each of them adds a new worker, using the formula the state uses to calculate unemployment figures, the rate would drop to 6.43 percent, not quite cutting it in half. If you use the state’s number of small businesses, 32,305 -- which we still think is a stretch -- Caprio’s claim gets less accurate. The rate drops only to 6.9 percent. That’s a 44.8 percent decline. If you subtract those companies unlikely to add new employees, leaving 25,815 companies that might add workers, the statement is even further from the mark. In that case, the rate would fall only to 8 percent, a decrease of 36 percent. That’s a long way from a 50-percent drop. There’s one more flaw in Caprio’s logic. He is making an assumption that economists say is unrealistic -- that every new job would be filled by someone who is statistically counted as unemployed. It’s likely that some jobs would be filled by people from a separate group that economists track, those who are considered "discouraged workers," who are not included in the official number of unemployed. In a state with one of the nation’s highest unemployment rates, 25,815 new jobs sounds pretty good. But not as good as Caprio’s claims. Unemployment cut in half? Not quite. So we’re calling it Half True.	None	Frank Caprio	None	None	None	2010-06-25T12:01:00	2010-06-10	['None']

pomt-08327	Says Will Rasmussen falsely claimed he had lived in the West Linn district for about a year.	true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/29/promote-oregon-leadership-pac-oregon-house-republi/oregon-house-republicans-say-will-rasmussen-was-ca/	House Republicans recently put out a typical looking hit piece on Democratic candidate Will Rasmussen. The mailer features an astonished looking senior in a blue tank top next to the words, "What did Will Rasmussen say?" There are several grainy photos of Rasmussen in black and white. On the back, there’s something about him wanting higher taxes -- the usual stuff -- and about his falsely stating how long he’s lived in House District 37. The mailer reads: "Will Rasmussen only moved to our community one year ago -- but lied about it thinking he wouldn’t get caught. In fact, he told one local paper that he’d lived here almost twice as long as he really had and then didn’t fess up until they took him to task." Rasmussen, an attorney with Miller Nash, faces Julie Parrish in the general election. Rasmussen beat out two other Democrats in the primary. But in campaigning for the primary, Rasmussen gave a funny sounding answer in his March endorsement interview with Willamette Week. Asked how long he had lived in the district, he replied: "About a year. I moved here, I moved to the district to buy my first house last fall ...." WW reporter Beth Slovic later confronted Rasmussen with a record showing he closed on a West Linn condo on March 4. Rasmussen then said he had moved into an apartment in West Linn in September 2009. Voter records show he updated his registration to reflect the new condo April 2, 2010 -- a day after WW’s story. So let’s recap: Rasmussen moved to West Linn in September 2009. (A clerk at Clackamas County elections says he registered to vote at an address in West Linn in October 2009.) Seven months later, he tells a reporter he has lived in West Linn "about a year." Rasmussen’s campaign confirms the residency dates. His campaign manager, Christopher Edmonds, writes: "When Will interviewed with WW, he said he'd lived in district about a year and at the time he'd lived there about seven months. WW made a big deal out of nothing. Of course Will meets the residency requirement." Slovic says in response: "His 'about a year' statement unraveled with just two phone calls...How long he's lived in the district is not that big of a deal, given he meets the minimum requirement for residency. So why would he stretch the truth on something so trivial?" Why, indeed? Rasmussen does meet the constitutional residency requirement, which is to have lived in the district one year at the time of election. But that wasn’t the question. Seven months is nowhere near a year, no matter how much you stretch the word "about." The House Republican group said Rasmussen "lied." It's not possible for us to determine whether he made the misstatement deliberately, with the intent to deceive, but he definitely got the facts wrong. So we find the group's claim True.

pomt-02545	A friend’s sister "died from Obamacare" because Blue Shield "completely just pulled out of California."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/05/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-friends-sister-died/	Of all the reasons Republicans oppose Obamacare, none is more stark than death. Conservative pundit Ann Coulter on Feb. 2, 2014, offered what she called a "shocking and horrible" personal story on Fox & Friends Weekend illustrating lethal consequences of the health care law. Coulter told host Tucker Carlson that she woke up Saturday morning to an email from a friend who said her sister "almost died because of Obamacare." Coulter zipped through the backstory: The woman "had been thrown off her insurance plan, you know Blue Shield completely just pulled out of California." The woman tried to "get on Obamacare, (but) couldn’t get through the website." Then she got a fever, but she didn’t want to go to the emergency room without insurance. On Thursday, the woman went into septic shock, Coulter said, and went to the hospital. Coulter recounted the story in a Saturday speech. "I got up to my hotel room after the speech and my friend sent me an email saying, ‘My sister died from Obamacare,’ " she said. Carlson responded, "That is completely shocking." Coulter added that she asked her friend if she could tweet the sister's story, and "She said, 'Julie would be very happy for you to tweet this.' " We don't know the name of the woman (beyond Julie), the type of coverage she had or anything about her medical history, and Coulter did not respond to our request for more information. But the claim that someone "died from Obamacare" because Blue Shield "completely just pulled out of California" is something we can fact-check. It’s obviously misleading to say someone died from Obamacare in the same way someones dies from cancer or a car accident. Hospitals in the United States are required to treat patients whether they have health insurance or not. But more germane to this particular fact-check is Coulter’s assertion that the woman found herself without insurance because Blue Shield pulled out of the state of California. That did not happen. Blue Shield of California: Still in business Some insurance companies stopped writing health insurance policies in the individual market in California, but not Blue Shield of California. The not-for-profit insurer competes with for-profit insurer Anthem Blue Cross and Kaiser Permanente. It continues to be a big player in the individual marketplace, which is what we assume Coulter is talking about, as well as the state’s health exchange, Covered California. Like other insurers across California and the country, Blue Shield of California could no longer offer some health insurance plans because they did not include "essential health benefits" required by the Affordable Care Act. These plans could not be grandfathered in under the new law. Blue Shield of California sent letters to 119,000 customers in September notifying them their current plans would end "but we can still have you covered in 2014." PunditFact obtained a sample cancellation letter from the company. The letter explained Blue Shield would offer new plans that include the minimum health benefits required by the health care law, such as emergency services, prescription drugs and preventive care. If a customer took no action after reading the letter, he or she would be automatically enrolled into a new plan recommended by Blue Shield. This was meant "to ensure that no one experienced a lapse in coverage," said spokeswoman Mia Campitelli. The letters went to 57 percent of the insurer’s individual market customers, she said. For two-thirds of the people who lost their plan, the recommended option was more expensive, the Los Angeles Times reported. This scenario was similar for 300,000 Florida Blue customers last fall. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said affected customers were "going to lose their individual coverage because of Obamacare. Now those people next year, they don’t have health insurance." But PolitiFact Florida rated that claim Mostly False because they were not losing coverage unless they opted out. Most of these Blue Shield of California customers were given the chance to temporarily extend their old plan until the end of March 2014 because the state’s insurance regulator determined they did not give customers 180 days of notice. About 15,000 people decided to take the extension, Campitelli said. For a customer to be without Blue Shield coverage after getting the letter, he or she would have had to contact Blue Shield to cancel the recommended plan. Campitelli said the company would not have a number for how many people chose to drop Blue Shield until open enrollment ends after March. Trouble with the website? Coulter said her friend’s sister tried to get Obamacare but couldn’t get through the website. (That’s assuming she canceled her Blue Shield coverage.) But if the woman was looking for new coverage in California, she would not have needed to access the troubled federal marketplace, healthcare.gov. California is one of the states running its own insurance marketplace. Consumers are free to buy coverage directly from insurers, but if they want access to tax credits to offset the cost, they have to go through the exchange. Covered California was not as hampered by technical difficulties as healthcare.gov, though it has not been without its snags, particularly during the hectic leadup to the end of open enrollment for 2014 coverage. The marketplace extended deadlines to accommodate some shoppers, said California deputy insurance commissioner Janice Rocco, and about 500,000 people chose an insurance plan during the Oct. 1-Dec. 31, 2013, enrollment period. Our ruling Coulter said a friend’s sister "died from Obamacare" because she was "thrown off her insurance plan, you know Blue Shield completely just pulled out of California." We're not fact-checking whether someone died. We're looking at the circumstances Coulter presented. Blue Shield did not pull out of California, and the company did not leave people without insurance. In fact, customers were allowed to keep their existing insurance plans through March. If the basic facts of Coulter’s story are accurate, the woman in question elected to drop insurance coverage. Whatever the story of Blue Shield, saying someone died "from Obamacare" is incendiary and grossly misleading. Coulter’s claim rates Pants on Fire.

pomt-08681	"It's factually correct to say" that Jennifer Brunner inherited at least 18 lawsuits when she came into the office that were a result of Ken Blackwell’s "mismanagement of the 2004 election."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/10/maryellen-oshaughnessy/maryellen-oshaughnessy-overstates-number-lawsuits-/	Maryellen O’Shaughnessy was spot on when she said recently Ohio Secretaries of State are judged on their handling of presidential elections. O’Shaughnessy, a Democrat running for Secretary of State this November, then slammed Republican Ken Blackwell for mishandling the 2004 presidential election when he held the office. Republican state Sen. Jon Husted, of the Dayton area, is O’Shaughnessy’s opponent. "It's factually correct to say that Ken Blackwell had at least 18 lawsuits that were even carried over that Jennifer Brunner inherited when she came into the office as a result of his mismanagement of the 2004 election," O’Shaughnessy said in an Aug. 16 interview with WPKO/WBLL in Bellefontaine, a city in west-central Ohio, after a speech to local Democrats. Brunner, a Democrat, was elected in November 2006 to succeed Blackwell after he lost a gubernatorial bid that year. O’Shaughnessy told the radio station that, if elected, she would maintain the stability Brunner brought to the office. O’Shaughnessy’s comments put her on a long list of Democrats to criticize Blackwell. We wanted to check out her claim and asked her campaign for information about the lawsuits. A spokeswoman pointed to a letter Brunner wrote The Columbus Dispatch and a separate news story that appeared in The Daily Record, of Wooster. In a letter to the Dispatch published Feb. 18, 2007, Brunner said 21 lawsuits were pending when she took office. She did not say how many were related to the 2004 presidential election. The Daily Record story, published April 5, 2007, also said 21 lawsuits were pending when Brunner took office. The story made no mention of the 2004 presidential election. The portion of O’Shaughnessy’s statement that said Brunner inherited "at least 18 lawsuits" seemed solid. But there was no proof, within the evidence O’Shaughnessy’s office provided -- that those lawsuits were related to the 2004 presidential election. We checked with Brunner’s office, which provided a comprehensive list of all cases that Brunner inherited from Blackwell. It is not specific to the 2004 presidential election, Brunner spokesman Patrick Gallaway said. The list, last updated in January, shows Brunner inherited 18 cases when she took office, including one settled during Blackwell’s term with unpaid fees. Court documents showed 10 of the 18 cases are related to Blackwell’s administration of the 2004 presidential election. The others dealt with a myriad of issues, including campaign finance law and the use of electronic voting machines. To their credit, the O’Shaughnessy campaign acknowledged she was incorrect after we shared the records from Brunner’s office with them. "She misspoke about the ones that relate to 2004," spokeswoman Heidi Hubmann said. O’Shaughnessy clearly jumped to an inaccurate conclusion about Blackwell’s job performance in the radio interview. Her sources of information, two newspaper articles from 2007, do not support the meat of her claim – that Blackwell’s mismanagement of the 2004 election led to at least 18 lawsuits that landed in Brunner’s lap. Brunner’s records show that’s not true. We rate the statement False. Comment on this item.

But it is fake. "Hilary (sic) Clinton filed for divorce In New York courts!" read a headline on a Feb. 8, 2017, post on USANewsToday.org. Facebook flagged the post as part of its initiative to eliminate fake news from its news feeds. The story cited ChristianTimesNewspaper.com as reporting Clinton filed a divorce petition in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for Westchester County. We know the story isn’t real, because this exact same hoax has circulated online before. The ChristianTimesNewspaper.com, which was a website that trafficked in fake news, tried to sell people the exact same story on Nov. 10, 2016, after Clinton lost the election to President Donald Trump. The website, which now appears to be offline, did not carry a disclaimer identifying its news as fabricated. It did say it "does not take responsibility for any of our readers' actions that may result from reading our stories." Some minor details of the ChristianTimesNewspaper.com story have been changed, but USANewsToday.org — and several other fake news websites, as well — reproduced essentially the same story in February. USANewsToday.org is a clickbait site registered to an address in Macedonia, where fake news is a lucrative cottage industry. This mirrors a minor trend we’ve seen with fake news, in which a fabricated story that originally was posted weeks or months ago is suddenly resurrected and regains popularity.

pomt-00341	Says Minnesota U.S. House candidate Joe Radinovich has "spent his life running from the law, charged with 18 crimes."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/17/congressional-leadership-fund/joe-radinovich-running-law/	There are bad apples and then, says a Republican-allied PAC, there’s Democrat Joe Radinovich. His troubles run so deep that "he’s spent his life running from the law," says an ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC with ties to U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan. "Charged with 18 crimes," the ad’s announcer says of Radinovich. "Thirty traffic violations. Five times, Joe Radinovich had his driver’s license suspended. The cops even charged Radinovich with possession of drug paraphernalia. Fast times. Broken laws." Does this sound like a guy fit for Congress? Before you answer, let’s look at the veracity of the ad. Its sponsor, the Congressional Leadership Fund, wants to retain a Republican majority, and that means keeping Democrats like Radinovich, a former Minnesota state legislator, from winning the open U.S. House seat. Radinovich is running against Pete Stauber, a retired Duluth police officer and current county commissioner. What’s the count Radinovich’s campaign has said before that the candidate had a rough patch as a teenager, and newspaper clips suggest why. His mother was shot and killed in a family murder-suicide when Radinovich was in high school. Furthermore, PolitiFact can stipulate already that from the time he turned 18 until now, 32-year-old Radinovich has had more than 30 parking or driving citations resulting in pleadings or findings of guilt. We examined those already when the Congressional Leadership Fund launched a different ad. We rated the claim Mostly True rather than True because of the ad’s clumsy characterization that suggested Radinovich has been cited 30 times for not paying court fines. That number -- 30 -- accounted for underlying charges, not delinquent court payments. His offenses ranged from repeated parking meter violations to four speeding convictions. As for his delinquencies in paying court fines, we found the Congressional Leadership Fund was correct when it said Radinovich was referred to a state collections agency eight times. But what of the 18 "crimes" the newest ad cites? It’s a crime sometimes After asking the PAC for a list of offenses it was counting, we turned again to online Minnesota court records to check. We found that most of the 18 "crimes" counted in the new ad, with the exception of the drug paraphernalia charge from when Radinovich was 18, were already factored into the previous ad. That ad, however, did not go as far as characterizing Radinovich as a man with a life of crime. And that ad used a higher count, of 30, because it included parking tickets. The new list of "crimes" is smaller because it generally relates to driving -- speeding, driving without proof of insurance, obstructing traffic, driving on a suspended or revoked license. But were those 18 offenses really crimes? Most were catalogued by Minnesota courts as "petty misdemeanors," and that’s an important distinction in court, say Minnesota attorneys. "A petty misdemeanor such as traffic offenses are not crimes under Minnesota law," David Schultz, a visiting professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, told us in an email. "One might have broken the law but legally one is not a criminal." Minnesota statutes spell this out. "‘Crime’ means conduct which is prohibited by statute and for which the actor may be sentenced to imprisonment, with or without a fine," says Minnesota Statute 609.02. That can mean a felony or a regular misdemeanor, since a misdemeanor can result in a jail sentence of up to 90 days. But the statute defines petty misdemeanor as "a petty offense which is prohibited by statute, which does not constitute a crime and for which a sentence of a fine of not more than $300 may be imposed." Charles N. Nauen, an attorney for the Radinovich campaign, pointed out the statute in a letter to Minnesota TV stations, asking them to take the ad down because, he said, it smeared the candidate with false and misleading claims. But the Congressional Leadership Fund said the ad was still running. The PAC told PolitiFact that it used the word "crime" correctly because the word is commonly understood to mean breaking the law, whether that results in a prison punishment or not. "Crime" is defined in dictionaries that way, the PAC said. "Joe Radinovich’s admittedly long rap sheet is full of numerous violations punishable by the state -- in other words, crimes," said Michael Byerly, a spokesman for the PAC. Referring to a whimsical line in our last piece on Radinovich’s parking and driving record, he added, "As PolitiFact wrote previously about Radinovich, do the crime, pay the fine." The candidate’s crimes and misdemeanors So what about these 18 "crimes" alleged of Radinovich by the Congressional Leadership Fund? Where do they fit on the Minnesota crime-versus-petty-misdemeanor continuum? Looking at online records, the first thing PolitiFact discovered is that two of those 18 charges against Radinovich were dismissed in court. As for the remaining 16 charges, 12 were petty misdemeanors for such things as speeding, driving without a vehicle registration or license plates, obstructing traffic and failure to drive with due care. Four were straight misdemeanors, the kinds defined as "crimes" under Minnesota law. The last time Radinovich was accused and later convicted of one of these true "crimes," as defined by Minnesota statute, was in early 2007, when he was 20 and was caught driving on a suspended license, records show. If you were to use the PAC’s broader crime definition that includes petty misdemeanors, however, Radinovich’s most recent offenses were in 2017, when he was charged once for driving 69 mph in a 55 mph zone and once for failure to "drive with due care." The drug case As for the drug case, on Feb. 4, 2005, when Radinovich was 18, he was charged by Deerwood, Minn., police with failure to signal and possession of drug paraphernalia. The drug paraphernalia was related to marijuana, Radinovich’s campaign says. The teen initially pleaded not guilty. That summer, the charge, a petty misdemeanor, was dealt with in court with a disposition called "continued for dismissal." It is basically an agreement that no conviction on the charge would result if the defendant stayed out of trouble. Radinovich also was charged $100 in court fees for the case, records show. So did Radinovich stay out of trouble? The Congressional Leadership Fund suggests he didn’t. Radinovich’s first bit of fresh trouble after the drug charge came a month after the plea agreement: He was delinquent in paying the $100 in fees, records show. So the court several weeks later ordered that his driver’s license be suspended. It was reinstated four months later, a time that matches his payment of the fees, the court records show. During that driver’s license suspension, however, Radinovich drove anyway, records show. After being stopped two days after Christmas in 2005 for failing to stop at a stop sign, he was charged with driving under suspension, failure to stop at a stop sign and driving without insurance. He was 19 by then. The insurance charge was dismissed. Radinovich was fined $304 for the other offenses, and was late in paying, records show. He had his license suspended again in 2007, a week after turning 21, and this time was unlicensed for nine months. Regardless, the court docket says the drug-paraphernalia charge was ultimate dismissed, with "conditions met or expired." Our ruling The Congressional Leadership Found says Radinovich has "spent his life running from the law, charged with 18 crimes." The ad has a few elements of truth. But the numbers make it sound far worse than Minnesota law would allow. Most of Radinovich’s offenses were driving-related. Most were petty misdemeanors -- a legal distinction, for sure, but an important one in the state where voters who follow that law will decide this race. You could argue about those numbers. But by casting the candidate as someone who has "spent his life running from the law," the ad omits critical facts and takes liberties in characterizing a life with traffic and driving issues, not holdups and getaway chases. By the standards of the Truth-O-Meter, that gives the claim a rating of Mostly False.

pomt-12840	Says "109 people out of hundreds of thousands of travelers" were affected by the immigration executive order.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/06/donald-trump/president-trump-says-109-people-were-affected-trav/	President Donald Trump defended the rollout of his executive order restricting immigration from seven Middle Eastern countries in an interview before the Super Bowl with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly. In addition to repeating false claims about widespread voter fraud, Trump also brushed off criticism of how his travel ban was implemented. The order has been temporarily halted by a federal judge, with a protracted legal battle on the horizon. "I think it was very smooth," Trump said in part of the interview that aired Feb. 5. "We had 109 people out of hundreds of thousands of travelers and all we did was vet those people very, very carefully." "You wouldn't do anything differently if you had to do it over again? Some of your people didn’t really know what the order was," O’Reilly asked. "Well, that's not what General (John) Kelly said. General Kelly — who's now Secretary Kelly — he said he totally knew, he was aware of it, and it was very smooth. It was 109 people," Trump repeated. Trump and his administration have used this figure to downplay the effects of the order many times. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But it is not accurate. Trump severely understated the scope of his action. He was referring to the number of people who were in transit to the United States when the order was released and detained at airports. The story is more complicated and far-reaching than the frantic 24-hour travel period after the order’s release. The official estimate of the number of revoked visas alone is 60,000 — or almost 520 times the amount of people Trump claimed — and does not account for any refugees that were temporarily banned from resettlement. Travel ban refresher Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order suspends entry into the United States of most foreign travelers from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen for 90 days. This encompases refugees, visa holders and U.S. permanent residents, who may apply for waivers. (Read PolitiFact’s explainer for more context, and whether it’s really a "Muslim ban.") The order was halted after a week following court intervention. Here’s a timeline: • Feb. 1: The states of Washington and Minnesota sued Trump over the order, requesting an emergency restraining order. • Feb. 3: District Court Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush appointee, granted the restraining order, effectively halting enforcement of the executive order: • Feb. 4: Trump called the ruling "ridiculous" on Twitter. The State Department reversed its revocation of visas, and the Department of Homeland Security suspended implementation. The Justice Department filed a motion appealing the decision and seeking to reinstate the ban. • Feb. 5: The San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the Justice Department’s motion, but requested more briefs from the federal government and the states that sued. • Feb. 6: The Justice Department had until 3 p.m. (Pacific time) to respond to the ruling. The number of people affected is much higher than 109 The White House referred us to press secretary Sean Spicer's Jan. 31 comments that the 109 figure refers to number of the people who were "in transit at the time the executive order was signed." Obviously, a lot more people were affected than just those were traveling that night. Between Jan. 27 and Feb. 2, more than 1,200 people were denied boarding flights to the United States, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Another 87 received waivers to board their planes and enter the country during that time. A lawyer for the Justice Department told a federal court in Virginia that about 100,000 visas were revoked on Jan. 27. But the State Department pinned the number at fewer than 60,000 visas issued to nationals of the seven countries and said they are currently investigating the discrepancy, according to The Hill. A spokesperson for the State Department told PolitiFact that the 60,000 figure does not include refugees. We wanted to provide a sense of the possible scope of people who were affected, though it is a bit imprecise. The State Department provides reports on the number of visas issued by country for each fiscal year, but the details for each visa’s validity period and allowed length of stay vary. That makes it hard to know how many of the visas issued in the past year or two would have been affected by the executive order. Furthermore, the official numbers also include visas that would have not been affected by the order, such as diplomatic visas. Similarly, the department’s refugee processing center provides breakdowns of how many refugees are accepted in each fiscal year. But it’s not clear how many of them had yet to arrive in the United States by the time of Trump’s temporary suspension. With these caveats in mind, we tallied up the State Department’s annual visa reports and refugee admissions data. About 117,000 people from the seven countries were issued immigrant or nonimmigrant visas or admitted as refugees in the 2015 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 2014 to Sept. 30, 2015). Another 68,000 were granted immigrant visas or admitted as refugees in the 2016 fiscal year. (Data for nonimmigrant visas was not yet available). Here’s a breakdown: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In other words, the United States approved at least 185,000 people from the seven countries for visiting or residence in the last two fiscal years. On top of 60,000 valid visas affected by the order, there could be an additional 64,000 admitted refugees barred entry to the United States. That’s nearly 1,140 times as many people as Trump claimed. Our ruling Challenged about the rollout of his administration’s temporary travel ban, Trump said the process was "smooth" and affected "109 people out of hundreds of thousands of travelers." This refers to the number of people who were in transit when the ban was announced. It doesn’t account for people who tried to board flights to the United States (over 1,200) and were denied, for visas that were revoked (about 60,000 according to the State Department) or for refugees admitted (64,000 in the last two fiscal years). Trump’s narrow claim ignores the full scope of his order’s impact.

pomt-04017	"Ohio is doing better right now than the national average on all the (economic) numbers."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/feb/04/keith-faber/ohio-senate-president-keith-faber-says-all-ohios-e/	The opening day of Ohio's General Assembly last month brought questions about potential action by the legislature on a number of hot-button social issues. But the new Senate president, Keith Faber, a Celina Republican, told reporters he wants to keep the focus on the economy over the assembly's two-year term. "It’s pretty straightforward: Ohio is doing better right now than the national average on all the numbers — but better just isn’t good enough," he said. The start of a new year and a new term is a good time to take stock. PolitiFact Ohio wondered how Ohio stacked up on the economic numbers. We asked Faber's office which ones he was talking about. The answer: Unemployment and job creation. Employment figures are the true measure of the health of a state’s economy, economic experts have told us, which is why they are so frequently cited. We checked the numbers released last week by the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee. Its report showed the unemployment rate in Ohio was 6.7 percent in December 2012, which was more than a point below the national figure of 7.8 -- and down from the most recent peak of 10.6 percent in January 2010. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that Ohio's over-the-year jobs increase through December 2012 (up 90,700), was exceeded only by Texas (260,800), California (225,900) and New York (123,600). We found similar significant job growth in a fact-check a couple of months ago. That backs up Faber's statement. But because two figures are "both" and not "all" the numbers, we looked at more. Ohio's gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of economic production, totaled $484.0 billion in 2011, the most recent number available. That was 8th largest in the U.S., or above average, but failed to keep pace with growth nationally. On a per capita basis, Ohio's GDP of $41,920 was 33rd in the nation. Ohio also ranked 33rd in 2011 in per capita personal income, at $37,836, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. That was below the national average of $41,560. In median household income, the most recent figures show Ohio dropping precipitously. Ohio ranked 39th among the states in median household income in 2011, at $44,648, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That was a drop of 5.7 percent from a year earlier, or more than three times the national average. Ohio ranked 34th in median income the previous year, and 19th a decade earlier in 2000. The state's percentage of population living below the poverty line, at 15.1 percent in 2011, was almost unchanged from the previous year, the Census Bureau reported last September. The official poverty rate for the nation was 15 percent, also almost unchanged. Those numbers help to illustrate that Ohio was one of the half dozen hardest-hit states in the great recession. A recent analysis by JPMorgan Chase, though, says its economy is forecast to grow faster or as fast as the national economy in 2013 -- "paralleling the national recovery." Even so, while the analysis says "housing activity is forecast to gradually recover from current levels," it also says "home building remains depressed, as in most other states, and there is little indication yet of a housing revival in Ohio," according to data from the Census Bureau and Federal Housing Finance Agency. The growth in house prices lags the national trend. Where does that leave Faber? At PolitiFact Ohio, words matter. And "all" is a little word that covers a lot of territory -- too much to apply to his statement about the economy. Faber's point about Ohio doing better than average is backed up by what experts have told PolitiFact Ohio are key figures -- unemployment and job creation -- and they are the ones he cited. Other figures, however, show Ohioans have lost ground economically and trail national averages. Faber’s statement is partially accurate. But even allowing for political hyperbole, a statement that "all" of Ohio’s economic numbers are outpacing averages for the nation omits or overlooks important information. On the Truth-O-Meter, his statement rates as Half True.	None	Keith Faber	None	None	None	2013-02-04T06:00:00	2013-01-07	['Ohio']
pomt-10795	"The Iraq Study Group reported that (Saddam Hussein) had designs on reviving his nuclear program."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/09/fred-thompson/the-iraq-study-group-didnt-say-that/	During a Republican debate in Dearborn, Mich., on Oct. 9, 2007, Fred Thompson was asked to explain his previous comments about whether Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He replied that Saddam had used them against the Kurds and had nuclear reactors in the early 1980s. Thompson added, "The Iraq Study Group reported that (Saddam) had designs on reviving his nuclear program, which he had started once upon a time." The Iraq Study Group was a bipartisan panel created by Congress to recommend a better U.S. strategy in Iraq. The panel was headed by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Lee Hamilton, a former member of Congress who chaired the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In December 2006, the group released its report, The Way Forward: A New Approach, which recommended a new U.S. strategy. The 142-page report focused on the future of Iraq and did not address whether Saddam wanted to restart a nuclear program. So we find Thompson's claim to be False. It's possible that Thompson was referring to the Iraq Survey Group, a CIA panel that was formed to investigate whether there were weapons of mass destruction or the intent to produce WMDs in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The report found that Saddam did not produce or possess any weapons of mass destruction for more than a decade before the U.S.-led invasion, but that he "aspired to develop a nuclear capability — in an incremental fashion, irrespective of international pressure and the resulting economic risks."

pomt-07631	Say easing restrictions on selling alcohol on Sundays will result in more traffic crashes and fatalities.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/mar/18/georgia-state-senators/lawmakers-claim-sunday-alcohol-sales-proves-flawed/	Some Georgia senators opposed to a controversial bill aimed at relaxing alcohol sales laws on Sundays made an interesting case Wednesday. They argued there will be more drunken driving in Georgia on Sundays. "You’re going to have... more deaths, more injuries if we pass this bill," said Sen. Bill Cowsert, a Republican from Athens. Sen. Joshua McKoon, R-Columbus, cited a study that found an increase in crashes and fatalities after Sunday liquor sales were eased in New Mexico. Sen. Vincent Fort, who said access to liquor is already "prolific" in some neighborhoods, repeated McKoon’s numbers. "You do the math," said Fort, a Democrat from Atlanta. Georgians can drink alcohol at bars and restaurants on Sundays, but they can’t buy it at retail stores. A bill that sets the stage to allow retail stores to sell beer, liquor and wine on Sundays was passed by the Senate on Wednesday by a 32-22 margin. The bill still must be passed by the House, and Gov. Nathan Deal has indicated he would sign legislation allowing local communities to vote on whether to allow stores to sell beer, liquor and wine on Sundays. Our question isn’t whether the bill will pass. We wondered whether these senators are correct about the potential traffic impact of Sunday liquor sales. Drexel University associate professor Mark Stehr has done several studies on the impact of easing so-called "blue laws." In June, he released a study called "The Effect of Sunday Sales of Alcohol on Highway Crash Fatalities." That study focused on 13 states that either eased or repealed Sunday liquor laws between 1995 and 2005, using data from the federal government’s Fatality Analysis Reporting System. Those states were Delaware, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington. Stehr said other past studies have reached mixed conclusions, but said many of them were outdated, focused solely on one state and failed to consider other traffic factors. Stehr’s study noted that alcohol-related crashes increased in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia, when alcohol sales laws were eased. But those changes came in 1979 and 1984, respectively, before the now-familiar campaigns advising motorists not to drink and drive. Stehr used alcohol-related fatalities in nearly every state between 1990 and 2008. He recorded an alcohol-related fatality if either a police officer reported that alcohol was involved in the accident or if a blood alcohol test recorded any alcohol in the driver’s blood. His conclusion? Stehr found no clear evidence of an increase in traffic fatalities in states that repealed Sunday bans on alcohol. His research found no statistically significant increase in beer sales in those states, but a 2.9 percent increase in the sales of liquor. PolitiFact Georgia covered some of this ground in a Feb. 22 fact-checkon the potential economic impact of changing liquor laws in Georgia. "I think it’s unlikely that Georgia would experience much of an uptick," Stehr told us. Stehr found New Mexico was the only state that saw an increase (21 percent) in fatalities after changing its Sunday alcohol laws. As governor of Georgia, Sonny Perdue used New Mexico as a basis for his opposition to changing Georgia’s blue laws in a 2008 op-ed. He cited a study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (not conducted by Stehr) that found a 29 percent increase in Sunday crashes and a 42 percent rise in traffic fatalities after New Mexico changed its laws. University of Georgia economics lecturer Jason Rudbeck co-wrote a study that found (with the help of a group that supports changing Georgia’s laws) "no effect" in alcohol-related crashes and fatalities once New Mexico changed its blue laws. He observed New Mexico also raised its speed limit on some roads to 75 mph around the same time the Sunday sales laws were changed, a factor also noted by Stehr. Rudbeck said, and Stehr agrees, that many people who drink at bars and restaurants on Sundays wind up doing so at home when alcohol laws are charged, thus there is a lesser chance of alcohol-related wrecks. Stehr noted that federal data shows New Mexico was second only to Montana in the ratio of alcohol-related to all fatal traffic crashes between 1990 and 2008. The professor believes New Mexico was unique from other states he studied because of the speed limit increase, longer driving distances and a higher rate of drunken driving than other states, as shown by the federal data. In 2008, Colorado eased its Sunday alcohol sales laws. There, the number of drunken driving deaths on highways on Sundays declined, from 20 in 2009 to six in 2010, and fewer drunken-driving tickets were issued, state officials said. Most research shows there’s little evidence that there will be a major spike in alcohol-related wrecks and fatalities on Georgia’s roads if it changed its Sunday alcohol laws. Colorado, in fact, has found fewer wrecks after changing its Sunday alcohol laws. The New Mexico study cited by Perdue and McKoon has been criticized as flawed. PolitiFact Georgia found no irrefutable proof that easing Sunday alcohol restrictions "will result" in more traffic crashes and fatalities as some Georgia state senators argued earlier this week. We rate the senators’ claim False.	None	Georgia state senators	None	None	None	2011-03-18T06:00:00	2011-03-16	['None']
pomt-08053	"In the last five years, 28,000 people have been killed along the U.S.-Mexico border."	false	/texas/statements/2010/dec/31/lamar-smith/us-rep-lamar-smith-says-border-death-toll-28000/	Reacting to the fatal shooting of a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Arizona, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith of San Antonio said in a Dec. 15 news release that Brian Terry's death "is a sad reminder of the real-life dangers that Americans and our law enforcement agents face" in the southwestern United States. "In the last five years, 28,000 people have been killed along the U.S.-Mexico border," said Smith, a Republican who is the incoming chairman of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee. That tally has been mentioned by Smith before. In an opinion column that his office distributed Dec. 9, Smith wrote: "In the past five years, more than 28,000 people have been killed along the border because of drug-related violence." Smith did not say that "along the border" meant the Mexican side. But Texas Gov. Rick Perry did when he wrote in an article on his campaign website Nov. 30 that "the region of Mexico directly across the border from Texas has become one of the most dangerous places in the world, with more than 28,000 people killed since 2006." Where did this oft-repeated stat originate? The Mexican government, according to an Aug. 3 Associated Press news story that Smith's office sent us. "Mexico says more than 28,000 people have been killed in drug violence since President Felipe Calderón launched a crackdown against cartels in 2006," the AP reported. From a story CNN posted online the same day, we learned the number had been mentioned by Mexico's director of national intelligence during a summit hosted by Calderón. Soon after becoming president in December 2006, Calderón sent tens of thousands of soldiers and federal police to take on Mexico's drug organizations as they battle over territory and power, according to a New York Times Web page on "Mexican Drug Trafficking." Since then, drug-related violence has surged. While waiting for Mexican officials to respond to our inquiries about the 28,000 figure, we turned to the University of San Diego's Trans-Border Institute, which keeps tabs on the violence in Mexico. According to a January 2010 institute report, it's difficult to obtain definitive numbers on violence related to criminal activity by Mexican drug-trafficking groups. David Shirk, the institute's director, told us the Mexican government collects its data on drug-related violence from local prosecutors, who are asked to report any homicides associated with organized crime. Shirk said that the institute and others have requested access to the data but that Mexican officials have declined to release it. Regardless, Shirk said he knows Smith's statement that 28,000 people have been killed along the border is incorrect because that "is the total number of homicides associated with organized crime in all of Mexico, according to figures released by the Mexican government." Later, Ricardo Alday, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy in Washington, confirmed Shirk's assessment, telling us that all 28,000 deaths had not occurred in the border region. Alday did not offer further details. So, how many slayings did take place in border areas? Because the government won't share the bulk of its data on drug-related violence, the institute uses a different source for tracking the slayings: the Mexican media. Shirk and his colleagues analyze numbers from Reforma, a newspaper that keeps a running count of homicides related to drug trafficking broken down by state. The institute's January report says Reforma classifies killings as drug-related based on factors such as "use of high-caliber and automatic weapons typical of organized crime groups"; "execution-style and mass casualty shootings"; decapitation or dismemberment of corpses; markings or written messages on a body; and presence of large quantities of illicit drugs, cash or weapons. Shirk said killings of law enforcement personnel are included in Reforma's tally. According to the institute's data, there were about 25,000 drug-related killings in Mexico from 2007 through Dec. 17, 2010. Of those, about 45 percent occurred in the six states that border the United States: Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, Sonora and Tamaulipas. Among all the states, Chihuahua, which the institute describes as home to the "traditionally lucrative smuggling corridor of El Paso-Ciudad Juárez," had the most killings in the period, 6,966. Sinaloa, a Pacific coast state that does not border the United States, came in second, with 3,752 slayings. Those numbers from the institute cover drug-related homicides that have occurred since Calderón's crackdown began four years ago, the point at which the Mexican government starts its tally. In his statement, though, Smith specifies "the last five years," which begins in late 2005, a year before Calderon took office. We wondered whether adding the 2006 deaths would bring the border-area toll closer to 28,000. Nope, according to the institute's information. The data for 2006 through Dec. 17, 2010 put the drug-related homicide total for the six Mexican border states at about 12,000; that's less than half of Smith's figure. For another estimate of deaths related to the drug war in Mexico, we turned to Stratfor, an Austin-based global intelligence company that tracks the drug violence. According to a Stratfor chart, 27,240 people died in Mexico in drug-related killings from 2006 through Dec. 13, 2010. Scott Stewart, a Stratfor vice president, said the company does not break down its numbers by location. He also said that the company collects its information from a number of sources, which it declines to name. Meanwhile, as we researched the 28,000 figure, the Mexican attorney general, Arturo Chávez Chávez, announced an updated number of drug-related slayings in Mexico since Calderón's crackdown began. According to a Dec. 16 BBC news report sent to us by Smith's office, Chávez "said 12,456 people had been registered killed in drug-related violence so far this year, compared to 9,600 in 2009, bringing the total to 30,196 since President Calderón took office in December 2006." In a statement sent to us by e-mail, Smith cited the fresh number and pointed to a section of the BBC article that says "most of the killings are concentrated in certain regions, particularly the northern border states." "We should be concerned when drug-related violence takes the lives of more than 30,000 people in a neighboring country like Mexico, regardless of whether the killings are on the border or in the interior," Smith said. Then that's what Smith should have said in the first place. Instead, his statement that 28,000 people have been killed along the U.S.-Mexico border in the past five years fails a truth-test in a couple of ways. First, he misleads by failing to specify that all the deaths he is talking about were on the Mexican side of the border. Second, he claims the drug-related homicides took place in the border region, when the Mexican government says they occurred in other parts of the country as well. We rate Smith's statement as False.

pomt-11035	Says a progressive income tax proposal from Democratic governor candidate J.B. Pritzker "is wholly regressive."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/jul/02/evelyn-sanguinetti/illinois-lite-guv-calls-progressive-tax-idea-regre/	Illinois’ flat income tax, currently set at a rate of 4.95 percent for all individual taxpayers, is an outlier. The federal government, as well as most states that have an income tax, feature what is commonly referred to as a progressive tax system in which higher earners pay higher rates. Democrat J.B. Pritzker, the challenger to Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner in the November election, says he wants to switch Illinois to a progressive tax, though he has been vague about details. Rauner’s running mate, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Sanguinetti, recently ripped into Pritzker’s tax plan during an interview on a Fox News-affiliated talk radio station that serves the Illinois suburbs of St. Louis. Pritzker will "stick you with that progressive income tax which is surely to be an increase—not to mention the fact that it is wholly regressive," Sanguinetti told Marc Cox of KFTK. That is quite the oxymoron. Can a progressive income tax actually be regressive? We decided to check. Define ‘regressive’ The Illinois Constitution mandates a flat-rate income tax, and any move to try to change that would have to overcome difficult procedural hurdles in the state legislature as well as sharp ideological and political disputes. Republicans, Rauner among them, contend that taxing income at graduated levels would inevitably lead to an unfair and unnecessary tax increase in sheep’s clothing. Democrats, meanwhile, insist the change is critical to easing the burden on lower-income taxpayers and raising revenue to fund key services like public education. Pritzker backs a constitutional amendment to allow for a progressive tax. As a stopgap until that could be accomplished, however, the Democrat says he wants to raise the current flat tax rate—he hasn’t specified how much—but would make it "artificially progressive" by offsetting the increased cost for the non-affluent with enhanced tax credits. That’s where Sanguinetti’s up-is-down critique comes in. We asked a spokesman for the Rauner/Sanguinetti campaign to explain what she meant. He took a pass on explaining her thesis that "progressive" means "regressive," but it seems unlikely it was a slip-of-the-tongue because the campaign promoted audio and a transcript of the interview on its website. No less an authority than the Internal Revenue Service says a regressive tax pretty much means what it sounds like, too. The IRS defines it as a tax that "takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups." The spokesman, Justin Giorgio, did however weigh in on Sanguinetti’s contention that taxes would rise. "Lt. Governor Sanguinetti was simply saying that if J.B. Pritzker has his way, more Illinoisans will be paying higher taxes," Giorgio said in an email, referencing Pritzker’s constitutional workaround plan. Last December, we rated as Mostly False a similar claim from Rauner that calls for a progressive tax from Pritzker and his then rivals in the Democratic primary for governor were tantamount to advocating a "massive income tax hike." That fact check noted that a Pritzker spokesman had specifically ruled out anything that would raise taxes on middle-class families. It also highlighted how several states with graduated taxes had set rates for middle- and low-income earners below the flat tax rate Illinois now charges. As for Sanguinetti’s progressive-is-regressive scenario, economist J. Fred Giertz with the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois told us a plan like Pritzker’s wouldn’t qualify as regressive. "If lower income people pay a lower rate than higher income people, that by definition is a progressive rate," Giertz said. "The only way a regressive rate exists is if low-income people pay … a higher rate of tax." For the record, Giertz says Illinois’ current flat-tax system isn’t regressive either and could even be considered slightly progressive because it already includes some tax credits for low-income earners that enable them to pay a lower effective tax rate than those of higher income. Our ruling Sanguinetti said in a recent radio interview that Pritzker’s plan for a "progressive income tax" is "wholly regressive." A spokesman declined to explain what she meant by that. But the federal definition for a regressive tax makes her statement read like something straight out of Opposite Day. According to both the IRS and an Illinois economics expert, a regressive tax is one that takes a greater share of income from those who earn less than from those who earn more. A progressive tax, on the other hand, is one that requires higher earners to pay a higher rate than their lower earning counterparts. We rated as Mostly False Rauner’s earlier claim about an inevitable "massive" tax hike if a progressive tax system was implemented in Illinois. Sanguinetti takes that even further with her rhetorical head-scratcher, which is why we rate her claim False.

pomt-14569	"People think AIDS is done -- it’s not done."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/feb/09/bono/bono-hivaids-and-public-opinion-correcting-record/	Paul David Hewson is best known as Bono, the lead singer of the band U2. But he also is famous for his work to reduce poverty and disease, particularly in Africa. Over the years, Bono has met with presidents and billionaires and has enlisted mainstream retailers to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to combat AIDS. Bono was at the exclusive world economic forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month and pressed the need to continue making progress against AIDS. "The battle against AIDS is not a last decade issue," he told the Irish Times. "It’s going to be the next decade issue. We need to finish the job, get new companies, new interest. It’s kind of annoying and sometimes upsetting that these global health issues can become creatures of fashion. People think AIDS is done – it’s not done." That last sentence caught our eye. Does the wider public believe the deadly virus is "done" or anything approximating it? Kathy McKiernan, a spokeswoman for Bono’s One group, said Bono was being rhetorical, an argument we can see given the context of his remarks. "The comment was intended as a wake-up call that there is declining concern about the disease," McKiernan said. "It was not intended to be a literal, global comment that all people think the AIDS crisis is over." She added that Bono isn’t the only person to worry about shifting public attitudes. In 2009, Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said "many people think it (HIV) is no longer a problem." Polling trends are mixed The Kaiser Family Foundation, widely seen as a neutral source of health data, has followed American thinking on HIV/AIDS for many years. In 2012, Kaiser asked people to name the most urgent health problem facing the world. The largest number of people -- 41 percent -- said cancer. But then there was a second-tier group of diseases -- heart disease, HIV/AIDS, obesity and diabetes -- that were named by between 15 to 17 percent of the public. So HIV/AIDS ranked high but not the highest. In earlier surveys, more Americans thought AIDS was a bigger issue. In Kaiser’s 2004 poll, 36 percent picked HIV/AIDS as the most urgent problem, just a few percentage points behind cancer. In 2009, the fraction was 21 percent. To Jennifer Kates, director of global health and HIV policy at Kaiser, the trend is clear. Source: Kaiser Family Foundation/Roper Center for Public Opinion Research "The share of the public expressing concern about the epidemic has significantly declined over time," Kates told us. "This may be a function of three decades of HIV, of having successful treatments, of not seeing death as a constant, etc., but given that HIV is still a major global health challenge in low and middle income countries -- particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa -- and significantly impacts some groups in the U.S., this can also be seen as a potential disconnect and cause for concern." Work done by the Pew Research Center generally shows the same pattern. Pew put a broader question to Americans, as well as people in scores of other countries, about five dangers facing the world -- the spread of nuclear weapons, ethnic violence, AIDS and other infectious diseases, pollution, and the gap between rich and poor -- and had people pick the greatest one. In 2014, AIDS ranked at the bottom with just 7 percent. On the other hand, in the years that Pew has asked this question, AIDS had never placed high. In 2002, 11 percent of Americans said it was the greatest threat, slightly above pollution. As with all polling, everything depends on the question you ask. In 2014, when Kaiser asked people how important it was for the United States to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS in developing nations, 39 percent said it was a top priority and 47 percent said it was important, but not the most important. Compared with other health issues, HIV/AIDS ranked a few points behind improving children’s health, providing clean water and reducing hunger. To sum it up, Americans see HIV/AIDS as less of a threat than they once did, but they still recognize it as a global health challenge. Internationally, European countries such as Germany, France and Italy generally echo trends in America. They see other threats as more pressing, but HIV/AIDS has never ranked high compared to ethnic violence or the gap between the rich and the poor. Kates at the Kaiser Family Foundation noted that the media runs fewer stories about HIV/AIDS today. She said that likely drives down the sense that the virus is a threat. Our ruling Bono said that the "public thinks AIDS is done -- it’s not done." There's an obvious bit of rhetorical flourish in Bono's comments, but independent polling does show that the public sees AIDS as less of a threat both at home and overseas than it once did. However, people still rank it rather high on the global health agenda and believe America should continue to help developing nations deal with it. Bono’s broader point is well founded, but his specific claim slightly overstates the situation. On balance, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09610	"We definitely lost way more jobs in Texas this year than we gained — we lost 300,000 jobs in Texas alone this year."	true	/texas/statements/2010/jan/15/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-texas-lost-more-jobs-it-gained-2009/	Texas' job growth is a key tenet of Gov. Rick Perry's re-election campaign, and he sounded that theme again in Thursday's debate. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison tried to take him down a few notches. "And, oh, by the way, we definitely lost more jobs in Texas this year than we gained," she said. "We lost 300,000 jobs in Texas alone this year. That is not a record to be proud of." We couldn't let Perry sit on his laurels without checking Hutchison's claim. After clarifying that "this year" meant 2009, her campaign provided data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that showed Texas lost 271,700 jobs between November 2008 and November 2009. Perry's campaign didn't respond to our query — is Hutchison correct? — so we turned to the Texas Workforce Commission, which supplies the federal labor bureau with Texas' seasonally-adjusted employment numbers (farm jobs not included). Ann Hatchitt, the commission's director of communications, said Hutchison is right, and "there's certainly no problem in rounding that up to 300,000 jobs." The bottom line: Texas had a net job loss of 271,700 jobs, which means the state did lose more jobs than it gained. Nearly 300,000. That net job loss stands in contrast to 2007-08, when Texas led the nation in net job gains, as the Perry campaign frequently notes. Stay tuned for Jan. 22 when the commission updates its data with December's employment rate. And again in March, when number crunchers fine-tune their report. Until then, we rate Hutchison's claim True.	None	Kay Bailey Hutchison	None	None	None	2010-01-15T17:41:12	2010-01-14	['Texas']
pomt-04271	"We have more hospitals that are children’s hospitals than any other state in the union." 	false	/ohio/statements/2012/nov/05/bill-batchelder/william-batchelder-claims-ohio-has-most-childrens-/	Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder, up for re-election Nov. 6, 2012, recently sought the support of The Plain Dealer’s editorial board. During an endorsement interview on Sept. 18, 2012, the subject turned to healthcare in Ohio and the Medina Republican, among other things, noted the state’s impressive network of children’s hospitals was worth bragging about. For example, Ohio is the only state with a "flagship, world-class children’s hospital within two hours of every child living in the state," according to the Ohio Children’s Hospital Association. During the interview, Batchelder noted that "We (Ohio) have more hospitals that are children’s hospitals than any other state in the union." That got Politifact Ohio’s attention. The Buckeye State is large, but not as populous as, say, California, New York or Texas. So, could it really have more children’s hospitals than any other state? PolitiFact Ohio asked Batchelder’s office where the speaker got this information. The speaker’s spokeswoman, Shannon Boston, directed us back to the website of the Ohio Children’s Hospitals’ Solutions for Patient Safety, a non-profit organization that works to align the vision of all of Ohio’s children’s hospitals. And how many hospitals does it list? Eight. Boston contends that Ohio is tied with Texas and California, which also each have eight children’s hospitals according to organizations in those states similar to the Ohio Children’s Hospital Association — the California Children’s Hospital Association and the Children’s Hospital Association of Texas. But a closer look found that the hospitals listed on those websites to which we were directed for hospitals in California and Texas only represent a portion of all children’s hospitals in those states. These state hospital associations are member-based organizations and not every hospital is necessarily a member and listed on the websites. In fact, Angela Krile, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Children’s Hospital Association, when asked about Batchelder’s claim, said: "I have never heard that we have the most children’s hospitals but we do have the highest rated system of children’s hospitals in the country." The second part of her comment, about Ohio’s hospitals being highest rated, would indeed be noteworthy. But it is the first part of her comment that PolitiFact Ohio is checking for this article. PolitiFact Ohio checked with the National Association of Children’s Hospitals. Spokeswoman Gillian Ray directed us to a state-by-state list of children’s hospitals on its website. By its count, Ohio hardly has the most children’s hospitals in the country. Not even close. Here’s what we found: Rank State Hospitals Rank State Hospitals 1 California 17 5 Illinois 11 1 Florida 17 5 New Jersey 11 3 Texas 16 7 Massachusetts 10 4 New York 15 7 Ohio 10 The site includes the Shriners Hospitals for Children-Cincinnati and the Cleveland Clinic Children’s Hospital for Rehabilitation, two hospitals that are not members of the Ohio Children’s Hospitals’ Solutions for Patient Safety or the Ohio Children’s Hospital Association, which lists just six member hospitals. Ray said that the national list is all-inclusive, meaning it lists all the children’s hospitals according to their primary mission or duty: free-standing children’s hospitals, like Akron Children’s, specialty hospitals like Shriners in Cincinnati (which focuses on burn patients), or teaching hospitals, such as, Rainbow Babies and Children’s in Cleveland, which is affiliated with the medical school at Case Western Reserve University. For what it’s worth, Batchelder did get that endorsement from The Plain Dealer’s editorial board. But the organizations referenced by the speaker’s staff in support of his claim were not umbrella organizations that represent all children’s hospitals and their lists were far from complete. Even the two Ohio-based children’s hospital associations do not list the same number of hospitals, and neither lists every children’s hospital in the state. As an aside, there clearly appears to be a strong network of children’s hospitals in Ohio which draws the state high rankings in several areas of care, accessibility and amount of research taking place at the various institutions. But all that does not add up to having the most available hospitals of their kind as compared to other states, as Batchelder claimed. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.	None	William G.

pomt-09901	"Under the new and little known 'global justice' initiative," the Obama administration has ordered FBI agents to "read Miranda Rights to high-value terrorist detainees captured on the battlefield."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/14/republican-national-committee-republican/gop-claims-obama-has-ordered-fbi-read-miranda-righ/	The Republican National Committee recently put out a questionnaire called the "2009 Obama Agenda Survey" in which it asks Republicans to rate their agreement or disagreement with a number of so-called Obama administration positions. But it looks to us more like a push poll, a political technique in which the questions are written in a way that aims to convince the respondent of a particular political position. In other words, they are political statements masquerading as questions. We decided to fact-check two "questions" from the survey, and you'll see what we mean. One is the question/statement, "Do you support the Obama administration’s decision to offer $900 million to Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization, to rebuild Gaza?" We rate the truth of that one with another Truth-O-Meter ruling . But in this item we address this question: "Are you in favor of FBI agents reading Miranda Rights to high-value terrorist detainees captured on the battlefield as the Obama administration has ordered under the new and little- known 'global justice' initiative?" Implied in the question, of course, is that the Obama administration — in a "new and little-known 'global justice' initiative" — is ordering FBI agents to read Miranda Rights to terrorist detainees captured in Afghanistan or Iraq. You know the Miranda Rights: you have the right to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney, etc. The claim was first made by Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., who said that during a congressional trip to Afghanistan in May, he visited Bagram Air Base and sat in on a law enforcement and intelligence officer meeting in which officials talked about a new policy of FBI agents Mirandizing suspected terrorists at U.S. military detention facilities. In an interview with Fox News on June 11, Rogers, who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, said soldiers were confused and frustrated by the policy. “Yes, as shocking and unbelievable as it may seem, it is true that under the new administration’s 'Global Justice Initiative,' special agents of the FBI are administering Miranda rights to enemy combatants caught trying to kill American soldiers or our Afghan partners in Afghanistan," Rogers said in a June 12 news release. "These terrorist suspects are not accused of a common crime, they are suspected of acts of war against the United States and her allies," Rogers stated. "Miranda rights should not apply for dealing with enemy combatants." Rogers, a former FBI special agent who served in the U.S. Army, warned that applying criminal law on the battlefield hinders the process of gathering crucial intelligence. "This could have deadly results for the men and women fighting for America and our Afghan allies," he said. FBI and military officials, however, say Rogers is just wrong. "The real rumor yesterday is whether our forces were reading Miranda rights to detainees and the answer to that is no," Gen. David Petraeus, the U.S. military's Central Command chief, said on June 12. But according to a story in the Australian , Petraeus said the FBI was continuing the practice of reading detainees their rights in a limited number of cases where accused militants would face trials in civilian courts. Those sentiments were echoed in a more detailed June 12 letter sent by FBI director Robert S. Mueller III to U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, and forwarded to Rogers. "Regarding Miranda, there has been no policy change and no blanket instruction issued for FBI agents to Mirandize detainees overseas," Mueller wrote. "For years, FBI agents have been trained to analyze whether Miranda is appropriate to use on a case-by-case basis and to consider providing Miranda warnings if prosecution in the United States may occur. For detainees held in military custody overseas, approval by the Department of Justice is required before Miranda warnings may be given. "There are cases in which FBI agents have provided Miranda warnings to persons captured and held overseas, at Bagram and elsewhere. In those cases, a determination was made that a prosecution in ... court may be in the interest of national security and that providing Miranda warnings ... was therefore desirable to maximize the likelihood that any resulting statements would be admissible at trial. In practice, Miranda warnings have been provided to Bagram detainees in only a small handful of cases out of over 4,000 individuals detained and interrogated by the FBI." Mueller went on to explain that the "Global Justice" proposal is intended to improve collaboration between military and law enforcement officials relative to terrorists overseas. The proposal is still preliminary, he stated, and would "ensure, when possible that intelligence is gathered in a manner that best preserves future options vis-a-vis the individual terrorist at issue, including gathering evidence in a manner that ensures its integrity in the event a prosecution becomes the most desirable approach. Far from a policy change, the proposal would focus on the best way to manage and deploy interagency teams overseas, train the teams, and provide them forensic support. The proposal has never had any connection to changes in FBI policy on when Miranda warnings should be administered to detainees overseas." Rogers isn't backing off. In an interview with CQ Politics, Rogers said everything he saw at Bagram and has been told since is contrary to the assurances he got from Mueller. Rogers is moving ahead with an amendment to the intelligence authorization bill prohibiting government funds from being used to Mirandize detainees. But back to the "question" in the GOP survey, "Are you in favor of FBI agents reading Miranda Rights to high-value terrorist detainees captured on the battlefield as the Obama administration has ordered under the new and little-known 'global justice' initiative?" This one is a tougher call than it might seem. On the one hand, you have a congressman who says he heard what he heard. And we think that Rogers' history as a former FBI agent and member of the House Intelligence Committee gives him credibility. He knows the lingo. On the other hand, you have the FBI director saying there is no new policy instructing FBI agents to Mirandize detainees overseas. FBI officials acknowledge they have done so on a handful of occasions to preserve evidence in cases that seem likely to go to trial down the road. But they say that's not new policy. And, FBI officials note, they have to clear it with the Department of Justice before they do. And lastly, they say the "Global Justice" proposal which seeks more interagency cooperation overseas has never had anything to do with FBI policy on whether or not to Mirandize a detainee overseas. At the least, we can say the GOP question/statement is a bit misleading. It suggests every detainee captured in Afghanistan is read his rights. That has only happened in a small number of cases, and only with Department of Justice approval. And according to the military, that has nothing to do with the Global Justice proposal. And so we rule this one Half True.	None	Republican National Committee	None	None	None	2009-07-14T15:45:47	2009-07-07	['Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-01285	Attorney general candidate Brad Schimel "is in cahoots with Wisconsin Right to Life to make abortion a crime in Wisconsin."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/31/chris-taylor/republican-candidate-wisconsin-attorney-general-wo/	Surrogates joined the fray in the weeks leading up to the Nov. 4, 2014 election for Wisconsin attorney general, a race that is hot partly because Republican incumbent J.B. Van Hollen didn’t seek another term. The state Republican Party attacked the Democratic nominee, Jefferson County District Attorney Susan Happ, saying she took $180,000 in a "shady" land deal "from a man charged with multiple felony counts of sexual assault before she offered him a deferred prosecution." We rated that claim False. The GOP distorted the timeline of events. The effect was a highly misleading attack without evidence to back up the idea that the defendant got a sweetheart prosecution deal from Happ. On Oct. 24, 2014, state Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, took aim at the Republican nominee, Waukesha County District Attorney Brad Schimel. "Schimel is in cahoots with Wisconsin Right to Life to make abortion a crime in Wisconsin," Taylor told reporters in a conference call. The liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee made a similar statement in a TV ad. Let’s get to the bottom of it. Taylor’s evidence Taylor, a former public policy director at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, was criticizing Schimel for signing onto a legal paper issued by Wisconsin Right to Life. The Milwaukee-based Right to Life group says one of its missions is to make abortion "socially, ethically and legally unacceptable." The legal paper, issued in January 2012, argued against supporting a proposal to add a "personhood" amendment to the state constitution. It made these assertions: Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in the United States, could be overturned in the next seven to 10 years. That would pave the way for a Wisconsin statute, which predates Roe, to immediately make abortion in Wisconsin illegal in almost all cases. "Wisconsin unborn children will be best protected" by preserving that statute, rather than backing the personhood amendment. So, Wisconsin Right to Life was promoting a strategy, albeit a passive one, that it hopes would result in abortion being illegal in Wisconsin eventually. Seventeen attorneys put their signatures on the legal paper -- indicating, according to the paper, that they agree with its "content and conclusions." Among them were former Milwaukee County District Attorney E. Michael McCann, a Democrat; Milwaukee criminal defense attorney Gerald Boyle; and Richard Esenberg, president of the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, a conservative, libertarian public interest law firm. And Schimel. Taylor told us that Schimel’s endorsement of the legal paper means he is seeking to make abortion illegal because -- as is noted in the paper -- Wisconsin Right to Life has fought attempts to repeal the statute that outlawed abortion in Wisconsin. In other words, she said, Schimel agrees with the strategy to preserve the old statute with the hope that it will one day take effect again if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Wisconsin Right to Life sought the endorsement of district attorneys such as Schimel, she argued, because they would be the ones to enforce the statute outlawing abortion if it became law. Schimel, however, was the only district attorney among the 17 attorneys who signed the paper. One other prosecutor, Thomas Potter from the Milwaukee County district attorney’s office, also signed it. Schimel’s response On the day Taylor made her comments, Schimel said in response: "I respect the law of the land, and the law of the land is Roe v. Wade. That’s all there is to that. I’m pro-life and I make no apologies for that." When we asked Schimel’s campaign to respond to Taylor’s claim, Schimel, who has said he believes life begins at conception, issued a statement emphasizing that Roe v. Wade, and not the Wisconsin statute, is the controlling law. The statement also said Schimel has stated several times during the campaign that he would "not defy the law of the land," and that he would "defend Wisconsin’s laws the way they are written, but I will respect the law of the land from the (U.S.) Supreme Court." Our rating Taylor said Schimel "is in cahoots with Wisconsin Right to Life to make abortion a crime in Wisconsin." Schimel signed a legal paper by the group that argues that, under an old statute, abortion would immediately become illegal in Wisconsin if Roe v. Wade is overturned. But we’re not aware of any evidence that Schimel is actively working with Wisconsin Right to Life to make abortion a crime. And he has said he would not defy U.S. Supreme Court decisions such as Roe, which makes abortion legal. Taylor’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- our definition of Mostly False.

pomt-06685	Says U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget proposal "eliminates Medicare" in 10 years.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/07/joe-biden/vice-president-joe-biden-says-rep-paul-ryans-budge/	Addressing donors to President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign at a fundraiser, Vice President Joe Biden described stark choices for voters in 2012. He painted Obama as a strong leader, gutsy enough to order a covert raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound and to try for a big deal on debt reduction. In contrast, he said Republicans are headed the wrong direction on Medicare under the reform plan authored by Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee. "These guys have laid it out where they want us to be," Biden told attendees at the event in Tulsa, Okla., on Aug. 30, 2011. "Paul Ryan laid out their budget. Their budget eviscerates -- it eliminates Medicare. They say it doesn't. It makes it a voucher program. I call that eliminating Medicare in the next 10 years." The remarks -- reported in part on the ABC News website -- echo multiple Democratic attacks on aspects of Ryan’s deficit-cutting 10-year "Path to Prosperity plan. That resolution was passed in the GOP-controlled House in April 2011 but rejected by the Democrat-controlled Senate a month later. PolitiFact has not looked favorably on the accuracy of the Democratic charges on Ryan’s proposed transformation of Medicare, which he says is aimed at reducing massive federal deficits and debt. For example, the national site rated Pants on Fire a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee claim that "seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care because Republicans voted to end Medicare." And we rated False a Move.On.org email claim that the House Republican budget "abolishes Medicare within 10 years." So how do Biden’s comments fare? Biden minced no words, saying the GOP path "eviscerates" -- that is, guts -- the health care program for the elderly. Then he went further, saying it would be "eliminated" in 10 years. There is significance to the 10-year mark. The GOP proposal would, as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office noted, gradually convert the current Medicare program to a system under which beneficiaries received premium support payments that can be used to help pay for a private health insurance policy. Beginning in 2022, "all newly-eligible Medicare beneficiaries...would only have access to health coverage through private insurance plans, rather than through the current government-run Medicare program (i.e., traditional Medicare), or under a Medicare Advantage plan," a Kaiser Family Foundation study noted. That’s a fundamental switch. Medicare would "no longer provide coverage for medical care, but instead provide a "subsidy" toward the purchase of a private health insurance plan," the Kaiser study said. The CBO found that the change would save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for current levels of coverage, PolitiFact has reported from the CBO report. It’s important to note, the GOP resolution specifically exempts existing beneficiaries and future beneficiaries who are currently 55 and over. The vice president’s office gave us its view on Biden’s remarks. Medicare is a "system of guaranteed affordable health insurance for seniors. Preserving Medicare in its current form is a core Democratic value," the office said in an email. "If you replace the current system with vouchers, or premium support payments, then you are eliminating the principle of guaranteed affordable insurance and thus eliminating Medicare as we know it." Those last four words are very important -- and were missing from the original statement, the one that got the attention and that we are rating. Our ruling: Biden says Ryan’s plan "eliminates Medicare" in 10 years. In stating it that way in front of campaign donors, he strays from the "as we know it" qualifier even the president has used. The bottom line is that all seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year. The plan would reduce the growth in Medicare spending but not wipe out that spending. And current beneficiaries and those currently 55 and over would not be affected by the changes. It changes Medicare, dramatically, but does not eliminate it. We rate Biden’s statement False.

pomt-05791	Florida is "the largest dog-racing state in the country."	true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/24/maria-sachs/florida-no-1-state-greyhound-racing/	The Sunshine State has no shortage of unofficial nicknames. Is one the Greyhound Racing State? Animal-rights supporters and some lawmakers suggested as much during the 2012 legislative session. It cropped up in January, when Sen. Maria Sachs, D-Delray Beach, and Rep. Dana Young, R-Tampa, were garnering support for their proposal to allow dog tracks to stop racing dogs but keep their card rooms and slot machines. People don’t flock to these tracks for the greyhounds anymore, they said. "It’s a new Florida, and this is not what we need to be remembered for, as the largest dog-racing state in the country," Sachs said. "We are soon to be No. 3 in the country as the most populous state, and our culture does not look at mandated dog racing anymore." It’s unlikely greyhound tracks will be able to go dog-free anytime soon. A broader expansion of casino gambling has been sidelined, and Young and Sach’s bills have been idling in committees. Still, we wanted to know, does Florida really deserve the rep as the nation’s home for parimutuel dog racing? We consulted the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or ASPCA, which lobbied in support of letting tracks keep gambling without dog-racing. The nickname is deserved and then some, they said. No other state comes close. "It's always been the largest," said Ann Church, ASPCA lobbyist. For decades, greyhound racing was viewed as high-end, glamorous entertainment. It’s been in Florida since 1931. "It was firmly entrenched," Church said. "It was a destination event, going down to Florida and doing that." Racing enthusiasts say it still appeals. "There's still a demand and love and excitement for the sport out there," Gary Guccione, executive director of the National Greyhound Association, told the Tampa Bay Times in 2011. "I don't know that it's dying. Greyhound racing, in one form or another, has been around for thousands of years." Today, greyhound racing exists in just seven states, including Florida: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Iowa, Texas and West Virginia. None of those states has more than two active tracks. But Florida? It’s home to a whopping 13 of the nation’s 22 tracks. Locations are all over the state. There’s Derby Lane in St. Petersburg, Mardi Gras near Hollywood, the Daytona Beach Kennel Club and Poker Room, and Jefferson County Kennel Club in the rural North Florida town of Monticello. The ASPCA numbers match up with a Florida Senate committee analysis and information from Grey2K USA, a nonprofit organization that campaigns against greyhound racing. Commercial dog racing is illegal in 38 states, according to the group’s state-by-state comparison of dog-racing laws. Opponents and supporters can agree on one thing: Sachs’ claim that Florida is the nation’s largest dog-racing state is deserved. We rate it True.

pomt-03179	Fleeing Syria, "a million children are now refugees."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/03/john-mccain/mccain-says-million-children-are-refugees-syrian-c/	Most of the debate over a military strike on Syria involves broad strategic questions about stability in the region and defining clear goals for dropping bombs and launching missiles. But one strong supporter of the use of force brought in another factor -- refugees. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has long argued for greater military engagement in Syria on moral grounds, among other reasons. "It's shameful, while a million children are now refugees, " McCain said on CBS’ Face the Nation. We didn’t think McCain had the number of refugees wrong. We were simply struck that it was so high. In the past 24 hours, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, announced that the number of refugees had crossed the 2 million mark. For a country with a population of 22.5 million, that means close to 10 percent of its people are in camps or with families outside its borders. António Guterres, the U.N.’s High Commissioner for Refugees, called it "a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history." The UNHCR reports that more than half of the registered refugees are children. So McCain’s figure is accurate. If anything, it undercounts the scope of the turmoil. Peter Garrett with the British Red Cross said this only tallies people who have registered with the UNHCR. "We know there are people who will not have registered for support, for many reasons. They may be afraid of any form of authority or of registering their status," Garrett told CNN. The surrounding countries are strained to deal with the outflow. Lebanon has taken in more refugees than any other country, about 720,000. Jordan is not far behind with over half a million, followed by Turkey. In addition, the UNHCR reports said an estimated 4.25 million Syrians have been displaced inside their country. This would mean the conflict has forced nearly one out of every four persons from their homes. With almost all refugees dependent on international organizations for food, blankets and medical people care, the UNHCR is calling for $2.9 billion in aid to meet their needs. Over 1 million new people left Syria in the first five months of 2013. The UNHCR said if current trends continue, the refugee count will top 3 million by the end of this year. Our ruling McCain said the Syrian civil war has turned 1 million children into refugees. More than 2 million people have registered with the UNHCR as refugees and over half of them are children.

pomt-00585	The Convention Center "was sold as a building that would never cost taxpayers a dime."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/jun/07/patricia-morgan/rep-morgan-says-convention-center-was-sold-pledge-/	State Rep. Patricia Morgan of late has repeatedly criticized the state’s financial support for the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority, asserting that the entity has cost taxpayers more than $450 million, even though it was never supposed to cost them a dime. Last week, the West Warwick Republican, who represents a group calling itself the Republican Policy Group, convened a press conference and unveiled an investigative report on the subsidies, which totaled more than $30 million last year. This included $23 million for debt service. "Seriously," Morgan said, "it was sold as a building that would never cost taxpayers a dime and it continues to cost us money." Year after year, state budgets show, in addition to paying off the convention center’s debt -- its mortgage, so to speak -- the taxpayers have kicked in subsidies to keep the authority afloat. Since 1994, the state has allocated in excess of $450 million to the authority, which runs the Dunkin’ Donuts Center and Veterans Memorial Auditorium in addition to the convention center. That’s a big number and it made us wonder: Did someone really say this facility would never cost taxpayers a dime? If so, what were they talking about? So we asked Morgan for her sources. We also searched through The Journal’s archives and found someone who had made just such a statement -- Richard M. Oster. Oster, the heir of a family metals enterprise, had risen to the loftiest heights of the business world, serving as the chairman of the London-based Cookson Group PLC, a multinational company. In 1987, then-Gov. Edward DiPrete installed Oster as chairman of the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority. This made him the front man in 1989 for the campaign to sell the public on the need for a convention center, which was expected to cost $225 million. It was to be one of the largest economic development projects in Rhode Island’s history. Oster told The Journal such a facility would bring 500,000 visitors a year to the city, pump $60 million to $100 million per year into the economy and generate enough new tax revenue -- via hotel, income, sales and property taxes -- to offset the deficit from construction and operations. "This won’t cost the taxpayers one dime," Oster said in 1989. That was his clincher, the line he used after detailing a list of economic benefits. Morgan told us this was the quote she had in mind in her attack on the convention center’s finances. Morgan, however, did not talk about how Oster and the other proponents claimed that new tax revenue would make up for the taxpayers’ costs. Morgan’s repeated emphasis on costs without discussing new tax revenues drew criticism from Joseph R. Paolino Jr., the former mayor and another champion of the convention center. "I think she’s wrong," Paolino said. "I don’t think she truly understands the concept of the convention center and what a convention center is supposed to do for a community." Paolino, who refers to the late Oster as "one of the leading business giants of our community," says any analysis of convention center appropriations must consider tax revenue generated by convention center activity. This is the "real story," he says. He acknowledged that he doesn’t know how Oster’s projections worked out. But last week the Authority said its experts calculate that the convention center, the Dunkin’ Donuts Center and Veterans Memorial Auditorium have an average annual impact totaling $135 million and generate $10 million in state and local tax revenue across about 500 events — hockey games, conferences and musical performances among them. That’s the opposing point of view. Is it credible? We turned to Gary Sasse, who headed up the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council in the 1980s and is now director of the Hassenfeld Institute for Public Leadership at Bryant University. Sasse, who supported the project in 1989, says he believes the presence of the convention center has had some degree of multiplier effect on the local economy -- possibly enough to offset costs. But Sasse emphasizes that the actual numbers are important for this debate and there is no independent entity around to do the hard work of providing a trustworthy assessment. "Who is the independent scorekeeper?" he asks. "That’s the problem." Our ruling Morgan had her numbers right. And Richard Oster did famously tell the public that the center wasn’t going to cost the taxpayers a dime. But she failed to put Oster’s claim in context. Oster didn’t say convention center revenues would pay its bills. He was talking about the center’s overall economic impact. And, as Gary Sasse says, without an independent scorekeeper, we won’t know whether the center’s impact offsets its costs. As a result, we rate her statement Mostly True.

Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., was found dead in a garbage bin in Washington. DailyUSAUpdate.com, a known purveyor of bogus news stories, posted a story on May 20, 2017, with the headline, "Worse than Hitler! Trey Gowdy’s son found in a Dumpster in D.C.! Murders are being questioned!" Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fake as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake article said that Terrence Vaughan Martin Gowdy was found dead in a Washington dumpster. Rife with misspellings and grammatical errors, the post said the boy had disappeared from the Capitol building and was found in the trash receptacle at a Trump-owned hotel, possibly in an attempt to frame the president. It said two suspects named Hamil Lalahafa and Sanjay Gemtrapa were being questioned. There was no contact information listed on DailyUSAUpdate.com. The fabrication has been published in various forms on other websites, too. None of them seem very concerned with the fact that Gowdy’s two children are named Abigail and Watson. There also are no mainstream news accounts of anything happening to the chairman of the House Benghazi committee’s kids. The story first appeared May 20 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a well-known purveyor of fabricated news stories. The site’s goal is to goad conservative readers into believing fake posts in an attempt to illustrate their gullibility. "We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist," the site’s About Us disclaimer reads. "Names that represent actual people and places are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and do not in any way depict reality." TheLastLineOfDefense.org’s fake saga went on to say the suspects (whose names had changed) had escaped from U.S. Marshals and implied a link to the boy’s death to Hillary Clinton. There’s no evidence that anything actually happened to Gowdy’s real children, so that’s a plus. This story, however, is another creation of the fake news cycle. We rate it Pants On Fire!

Is Elmo a lobbyist? So says Sen. Jim DeMint, who is leading the charge to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. DeMint's Muppet rant was set off, in part, by a press conference on Feb. 16, in which Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., stood alongside a life-size version of Arthur from the animated PBS show of the same name, and blasted the Republican plan to eliminate CPB funding. Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said Republicans ought to be focused more on reviving the economy and less on "silencing Cookie Monster" and "laying off Bert and Ernie." DeMint, a Republican from South Carolina, responded with a blog post and an op-ed in the Washington Times in which he argued that Sesame Street would do just fine without federal funding. "Shows like Sesame Street are thriving, multimillion-dollar enterprises," DeMint wrote. "According to the 990 tax form all nonprofits are required to file, Sesame Workshop President and CEO Gary Knell received $956,513 -- nearly a million dollars -- in compensation in 2008. And, from 2003 to 2006, Sesame Street made more than $211 million from toy and consumer product sales. Big Bird will be just fine without his federal subsidies." That's a lot of Elmo dolls. So we decided to check DeMint's numbers, and to put his overall argument about Sesame Street solvency into some context. We got the 2009 990 tax form submitted by the Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit group that produces the show, and DeMint is correct. It shows Knell's salary at $806,990, with an additional $149,523 worth of other compensation. For the toy sales numbers, we have to go to the 2008 990 tax form. In a section on "other income," it reports "toys and consumer products" as bringing just over $211 million from 2003 through 2006 (nearly $53 million a year, on average). Now for some of the bigger picture. The 2009 tax form shows that Sesame Workshop brought in about $140 million in revenues in 2008, with government grants accounting for just over $14 million of that (roughly 10 percent). So would Sesame Street be "just fine" without that government money, as DeMint says, or would it "silence Cookie Monster," as Lowey said. They are probably both exaggerating. Sesame Street is a lucrative enterprise, and Big Bird isn't likely to jump ship to Nickelodeon if federal funds are eliminated. But some of the services Sesame Street provides might, according to a statement released by Knell, the Sesame president. "As a nonprofit organization which has a long history of building public and private partnerships, Sesame Workshop has benefited from the generous support of CPB [the Corporation for Public Broadcasting], which most recently provided critical grant support for literacy programs for 6-9 year olds, like The Electric Company," Knell said in a statement released Feb. 15, 2011. "CPB has helped support our work with military families to provide social and emotional coping skills for children of parents serving in Iraq and Afghanistan who have left family behind during deployment. It also has provided important funding for our work helping parents who have lost jobs or been displaced due to the economic recession to keep their families intact and positively motivated. Additionally, CPB has been active in helping transition video content into digital assets to be used in schools and distributed through web-based applications nationwide." With federal funding an annual and often highly political battle, Sesame Workshop and many other companies that get support from the CPB have tried to become increasingly less reliant on government support. According to a fact-sheet provided by Sesame Workshop, revenues from sales of its products "offset about two-thirds of the research and production costs associated with the Workshop’s educational programs. The remaining one third comes from a combination of philanthropic support, corporate sponsorship and government funding." "As a result of this financial revenue model," the fact-sheet says, "we are able to deliver each new season of Sesame Street to PBS with more than 93 percent of production costs covered by licensing activities or corporate sponsorships. In 2010, Sesame Workshop had total operating revenues of $136.4 million and total operating expenses of $136.5 million." Under different circumstances, Republicans might be cheering Sesame Street for making money "the good old-fashioned way" through merchandise sales instead of relying as heavily on federal handouts, said Steve Behrens, editor of Current, a newspaper and website about public media in the United States. Now, he said, that success is being used against it. It's so successful, the argument goes, it doesn't need the government's help. Sesame Street might be okay without federal funds, Behrens said, but other kids programs that are "less successful selling dolls" might not be. (Indeed, we're thinking that sales of Jim Lehrer plush toys may not cover the full cost of the NewsHour.) Particularly hard hit by elimination of CPB funds would be some of the independent programming that gives public broadcasting its identity, Behrens said. "The independent productions are almost all paid by federal money or foundations," Behrens said. "Foundations only pay for things they have a direct interest in. They want programs that reflect their interests and promoting their ideas...There are strings attached to every piece of money that comes in to public broadcasting. Except for the federal piece." "Certain things would disappear," Behrens said, "and the whole idea that it belongs to the public, there would be less reason to think that. It would be nice if some of the money coming in to public broadcasting didn't have so many strings attached to it." In an op-ed piece, Jonathan C. Abbott, president and CEO of WGBH, and Charles Kravetz, general manager of WBUR, argue the elimination of CPB funds would hit smaller, rural stations the hardest. "Each federal dollar provides critical seed money that public broadcasters leverage to raise more than six more dollars from local sources," they wrote. "As crucial as CPB funding is to stations in major metropolitan areas like ours, the situation is even more dire for smaller stations, where federal funding truly is the life blood." Charles Chamberlain, political director for liberal group Democracy for America, said the point of public broadcasting "is that the programs offered should not/must not be subject to the whims of corporate sponsors and the ups and downs of merchandise sales. The shows and programs on public TV are subject to the needs of the entire public. The public funds these important programs as an alternative to the privately funded model used for programing on network and cable TV because profit shouldn't be the driving force behind every single form of broadcast media, especially educational programing. "So the point here is not if Sesame Street can survive without publicly funding. The point is Sesame Street must stay independent of corporate sponsors or merchandise sales to retain its public educational mission and meet the full needs of the entire public," Chamberlain said. Again, we're fact-checking Sen. DeMint's statement that Sesame Street raked in tens of millions of dollars from toy and consumer product sales over a recent four-year period, a figure cited as backing for his larger argument that "Big Bird will be just fine without his federal subsidies." Federal grants make up less than 10 percent of Sesame Street's budget. Whether Sesame Street would be "just fine" without that money is largely in the eye of the beholder. It seems unlikely that cutting federal funds would spell the end of Sesame Street, though some argue it might cause the demise of some small, rural stations that carry Sesame Street. Still, as its own tax filings show, Sesame Street makes a lot of its revenue from non-government sources, much of it through the sale of toys and other consumer products. Toy revenue is just a portion of Sesame Street's budget and federal funding for Sesame Street is just a portion of the overall issue of federal funding for public broadcasting. But DeMint's figures on Sesame Street toy revenues are right. And so we rate DeMint's statement True.	None	Jim DeMint	None	None	None	2011-02-28T10:33:56	2011-02-16	['None']

pomt-11659	"Seventy four percent of Californians are absolutely against sanctuary state" policies.	false	/california/statements/2018/jan/09/travis-allen/no-californians-do-not-overwhelmingly-oppose-sanct/	Are nearly three quarters of Californians strongly opposed to so-called sanctuary state policies? That’s what GOP Assemblyman and candidate for governor Travis Allen claimed in a Jan. 2, 2018 interview on Fox News’ Tucker Carlson Tonight. "Seventy four percent of Californians are absolutely against sanctuary state" policies. Allen made a similar claim in a Washington Examiner op-ed in October 2017, calling the state’s opposition to sanctuary policies "overwhelming." The Orange County lawmaker has vowed to defund sanctuary cities if elected governor. Background on sactuary state California became a sanctuary state in October 2017 when Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law that limits cooperation between local law enforcement and federal authorities on immigration holds. The topic is controversial in California and nationally. President Trump has threatened to cut off funding to sanctuary jurisdictions. And earlier this month, Trump’s acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Thomas Homan, threatened to jail elected officials in sanctuary cities. "This isn’t the America I grew up in," Homan said in a separate Fox News interview, also on Jan. 2, 2018. "We got to take these sanctuary cities on. We got to take them to court. And we got to start charging some of these politicians with crimes." Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, a strong supporter of sanctuary policies, was defiant in response, telling the Sacramento Bee: "They certainly know where to find me." There’s no doubt some Californians oppose sanctuary policies. But we wanted to know whether 74 percent are "absolutely against" them as Allen claimed. We set out on a fact check. Our research Several polls have asked Californians about sanctuary policies in recent years. The four most recent we found all contradict Allen’s claim: • A November 2017 USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times survey found 53 percent favored and 29 percent opposed California’s sanctuary state legislation. Only 18 percent strongly opposed it, nowhere near the 74 percent Allen asserted. The survey asked "Do you favor or oppose the new law that says California law enforcement personnel will not hand over immigrants in the country illegally to U.S. immigration agents, unless the person has committed a serious crime?" • A March 2017 UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll found conflicting results depending on the question asked. It showed 56 percent supported and 44 percent opposed "local communities declaring themselves sanctuary cities and instructing local police and government employees not to automatically turn immigrants over to federal immigration officers when they are found to be in the country illegally." When asked about the topic in a slightly different way, 53 percent opposed and 47 percent supported allowing cities and counties the right to ignore requests from federal authorities to detain illegal immigrants who have been arrested and are about to be released. • A May 2017 Public Policy Institute of California poll asked more specifically about California’s sanctuary state legislation. It found 48 percent of adults were in favor and 42 percent were opposed. • A January 2017 Public Policy Institute of California survey showed 58 percent of likely voters "favor California’s state and local governments making their own policies and taking actions—separate from the federal government— to protect the rights of undocumented immigrants living in the state." Only 39 percent opposed. Outdated survey Allen’s campaign responded to our request for evidence after publication. See our update at the end of this fact-check for its full response. The lawmaker relied on a separate UC Berkeley IGS survey from September 2015. Results from that older survey do match up with the 74 percent figure Allen stated. It found 74 percent opposed the idea of local authorities ignoring a federal request to hold a detained person in the country illegally. The IGS survey asked essentially that same question in its March 2017 poll and found only a slight majority, 53 percent, opposed that idea. Jack Citrin, who led the IGS survey in 2015, explained the shift in Californians’ opinions to the New York Times this way, "Partisanship was much less a factor" in 2015, he said. "But now I would say in California, whenever you ask pretty much any political question that may have some connection to Trump, you get a huge, huge partisan divide." Recent polls show a majority of Californians disapprove of Trump and disagree with his policies, with the results falling along partisan lines. Mark DiCamillo, the current director of the IGS survey, said opinions on sanctuary policies, meanwhile, "vary according to how you frame the issue." Californians strongly favor cities having the ability to declare themselves sanctuaries and the option to not automatically turn over immigrants to federal authorities. But, as DiCamillo added, "just ignoring a federal request is not as popular, it’s very divisive." "There are nuances to the issue, in my opinion, that affect public opinion and how it’s gauged," he said. Our ruling Republican Assemblyman Travis Allen recently claimed "74 percent of Californians are absolutely against sanctuary state" policies. Allen appears to have based his numbers on a September 2015 survey. But much has changed since then: Donald Trump was elected president and recent polls show Californians’ opinions have evolved. Most importantly, we found four recent polls that contradict Allen’s statement. They show Californians generally favor cities having the ability to declare themselves sanctuaries. Two specifically found greater support than opposition for California’s sanctuary state law. We rate Allen’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE: A spokeswoman for Allen’s campaign responded to our request for evidence after we published our fact check. She confirmed in an email that Allen was referring to the September 2015 IGS survey. The spokeswoman described that poll as"the most accurate and appropriate to use" regarding California’s sanctuary state legislation. She claimed the March 2017 IGS poll "was biased" and "adds politics and inaccurate descriptions of sanctuary policies into the poll." Her statement did not address the other recent surveys that show a majority, or near-majority, of Californians support sanctuary policies. Our rating remains the same.

pomt-12865	Says "Meryl Streep just got fired from a major project for lying about Trump."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/31/blog-posting/no-meryl-streeps-anti-trump-rant-didnt-cost-her-ha/	Academy Award-winning actress Meryl Streep’s harsh political words during a speech at the Golden Globes made her a target for fake news purveyors, who are falsely claiming she lost a movie deal for complaining about Donald Trump. "Meryl Streep just got fired from a major project for lying about Trump," read the headline on posts on multiple sites starting Jan. 9, 2017. The posts were flagged as being potentially fabricated by Facebook, as part of its efforts to crack down on made-up Internet posts masquerading as true information. This one, keyed off Streep’s acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille Award for outstanding achievement at the Golden Globes on Jan. 8, is as fictional as any Hollywood creation. Streep did excoriate then-President-elect Trump’s policies and past actions in her speech, without ever mentioning his name. She said she was stunned when Trump imitated a disabled reporter, a claim Trump has falsely denied. Trump took to Twitter the next day to lambast Streep for criticizing him, calling her "over-rated" and a "Hillary flunky," again denying he mocked a reporter. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com The fake blog posts claim Streep’s speech was enough for Ron Howard to kick her off a reboot of the TV show Happy Days. That’s odd on its own, because Howard took to Twitter himself to chide Trump and defend Streep’s freedom of speech. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com The article is pretty light on most details, such as whether this was to be a TV series or a film, but Streep was allegedly going to play Mrs. Cunningham. Plenty of passages in the fake story — such as saying Streep "hasn’t worked a day since that movie about shoes with the cute girl with huge eyes" — hint that this is an attempt at humor. The story appears to have first appeared on a Jan. 9 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website that describes itself as being opposed to President Barack Obama and "whiny politically correct liberal masses." We therefore don’t suspect they were fans of Florence Foster Jenkins. The "About Us" portion of their site reads, "All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." But this disclaimer isn’t obvious on the story itself, and certainly isn’t apparent reading other websites to which the post was shared. For fans of the Fonz, we must also note that the suggestion of a Happy Days reboot (with or without Streep) also appears fake. There has been no verified report of any kind of reboot of Happy Days. RadioTimes.com wrote last year that series creator Garry Marshall said the show may one day be revived by Paramount, but there’s little to suggest that’s been greenlit. The only other mention of a new Happy Days series was a story that said Netflix was creating one, but that post, too, came from a fake news website trying to be funny.

pomt-03594	"Only three in 10 young Americans under 30 -- 30 percent under 30 -- have full-time work."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2013/may/13/ron-meyer/ron-meyer-says-30-percent-workers-under-30-have-fu/	Republican Ron Meyer, Jr., 23, recently announced on Fox News that he will challenge incumbent Democrat Gerry Connolly in the 11th District congressional race next year. Meyer had a quick answer for those who wondered whether he is too young to run: He’ll turn 25 shortly before the 2014 general election, which is the U.S. Constitution’s minimum age for holding a congressional seat. And should he win, Meyer said his youth would give him valuable insight into issues facing young Americans, including a lackluster employment outlook. "Only three in 10 young Americans under 30 -- 30 percent under 30 -- have full-time work," Meyer said while announcing his candidacy in a recent interview on Fox News. We wondered whether Meyer was correct. Meyer told us he based his claim on a February 2013 report about civic engagement among 18-29 year olds that was sponsored by the National Conference on Citizenship, Harvard University’s Institute of Politics and several other groups. One of the findings is that the Millennial Generation -- which the study defined as those born between 1983 and 1994 -- has been hit hard by the sluggish economy. Researchers, computing data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, looked at 18-29 year-olds and found "62.9 percent are currently working, of which 31.2 percent work on a part-time basis." Meyer interpreted those figures to mean that the remaining 31.7 percent who were employed had a full time job. But his interpretation "isn’t quite right," according to Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, a co-author of the report and lead researcher at CIRCLE, the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. She pointed out the study said that of the 62.9 percent employed, 31.2 percent held part-time jobs -- or slightly less than a third of those in the age group who are working. So when all Americans in that age group are considered -- those employed and those who are not -- about 20 percent have part-time positions and 43 percent have full time jobs, Kawashima-Ginsberg said. There’s another issue to consider. The figures were compiled using November 2011 data. Kawashima-Ginsberg ran new figures for us, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau. For March 2013, she came up with a similar result: 42 percent of people age 18-29 had full-time jobs. Of people 30 and older, 50.4 percent had full-time job in March, according to figures compiled by Kawashima-Ginsberg. Craig Copeland, a senior research associate at the Employee Benefits Research Institute, said economic changes have made it harder for young people to find jobs. But there’s another important factor to consider when looking at full-time employment among the 18-29 age group -- many of them are working part time until they leave college. "There is a significant percentage of those people who are (working) part-time for a reason, not because they can’t find a job," Copeland said. "If they’re working part-time, they’re most likely a college student." Over the last decade or so, the number of young people holding a full-time job has trended downwards, even before the Great Recession, Copeland said. The reason is that a higher percentage of that group has been going to college and because members of the Baby Boom generation are staying in jobs longer, Copeland said. But the recession, which ran from December 2007 to June 2009, certainly caused the percentage with full-time jobs to go down faster, he said. Copeland pulled annual average employment figures from the U.S. Census showing that in 2004, 54.1 percent of people age 18-29 had a full-time job and that dropped to 52.6 percent by 2008. By 2011 -- the latest yearly figures available -- the percent of 18-29 year olds with a full-time job was 45.6 percent, he said. Our ruling Meyer said that 30 percent of the Americans younger than 30 had full-time jobs, but he misinterpreted data in a report. The study actually indicates that 43 percent of the age group had full time jobs. While Meyer’s number is off, his point holds up: a smaller portion of 18-29 year olds hold full time jobs today that before the recession. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-01317	Says Charlie Crist wants felons who "commit a heinous crime" such as "intentional permanent disfigurement of a child, you walk out of jail, you immediately get to vote."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/27/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-charlie-crist-favors-violent-felon/	As part of his appeal to black voters, Charlie Crist has defended his record on making it easier for nonviolent felons to regain the right to vote. Crist and Gov. Rick Scott argued about restoration of civil rights during the Oct. 21 debate on CNN. "When I was governor, I brought restoration of rights back for nonviolent felons so they can have a chance to get a job," Crist said. "Sadly, under Rick Scott it's gone, and it's gone for at least five years, you can't even apply." That set off a testy back-and-forth exchange: Scott: "Here's Charlie's plan. You commit a heinous crime, as soon as you get out of jail, you get to vote. Stalk, you get to vote as soon as you walk out. You have intentional permanent disfigurement of a child, you walk out of jail, you immediately get to vote. That's wrong, Charlie." Crist: "That is fundamentally unfair. I said nonviolent criminals. You are lying again." Scott: "No, that's not true. Go to FactsforFlorida.com, Charlie. You want to look yourself, you can look it up. That's exactly what you did. And I completely disagree with that." Crist: "It's very unfair. Go to his site if you want to, but I would recommend that you go to FairShotFlorida.com instead, and you'll find out the truth. What he just said is absolutely false." Well, we recommend that if you want facts, go to politifact.com/florida. (We're glad you're here!) Does Crist want violent offenders to immediately regain their right to vote? In a word, no. Restoration of rights under Crist Since 1968, the Cabinet has held the power to restore rights to felons with various governors making changes to make it harder or easier. Those changes did not always fall on party lines: Democrat Lawton Chiles tightened the rules, while Republican Jeb Bush simplified the process, though advocates pushed for additional reforms. In April 2007 under Crist’s direction, Crist and the Cabinet agreed to relax the rules to make it easier for felons to regain their civil rights, including the right to vote. (Crist was a Republican at the time; he is now running as a Democrat to get his old job back.) Crist defended the move in a 2007 op-ed: "Some who favor the current system argue that restoring civil rights is somehow 'weak on crime,’ as if restoring the right to vote, to serve on a jury or to work lessens the punishment or encourages a person to commit new crimes. In fact, the opposite should be true. Giving a person a meaningful way to re-enter society, make a living and participate in our democracy will encourage good behavior." Under the 2007 changes, there were specific rules for three levels of offenders who could apply to get their rights back. All of them had to first finish the terms of their sentence, including probation and restitution. About 80 percent of felons were potentially eligible to quickly regain their civil rights without hearings, the Tampa Bay Times reported when the new rules were approved. The offenders convicted of more serious crimes, such as murders, had to take additional steps to apply to get their rights restored, including attending a formal hearing. • Level 1: Offenders convicted of less serious felonies such as burglary, DUI or selling drugs had cases reviewed for eligibility and the Clemency Board could sign off on restoring rights without holding a hearing. This was nearly automatic. • Level 2: Offenders included those convicted of aggravated battery, felony stalking, or trafficking in cocaine. An investigation was required to determine eligibility, and the board had 30 days to review the results, but the state did not hold a hearing. • Level 3: Offenders included murderers and sexual predators. Those cases required a more thorough investigation, and they had to appear at a hearing. There was another path for offenders -- at any level -- to get their rights restored. If they had completed all the terms of their sentence, including probation and paying restitution, and were crime-free and arrest-free for 15 years, they could apply to have their rights restored. We asked the state how many of the 156,000 restorations that occurred under the Crist rules fell into each category and were not able to obtain that information. Most of the offender records are confidential. Those felons who had their rights restored "could indeed be described as largely nonviolent," said Mark Schlakman, senior program director for The Florida State University Center for the Advancement of Human Rights. (Schlakman is a supporter of restoring felons’ civil rights.) But it’s likely that some committed a violent offense at some point, said a leading researcher of felon disenfranchisement. "I haven’t examined the Florida restorations enough to know if anybody with any violent arrest ever had their civil rights restored, but I suspect that’s the case," said University of Minnesota sociologist Christopher Uggen. In 2011, at the urging of Attorney General Pam Bondi, Scott and the Cabinet reversed the policy under Crist and set a minimum of a five-year waiting period for nonviolent felons. During Scott’s tenure through mid September, restorations have been granted to 1,589 people. We asked a spokesman for Crist’s campaign, Kevin Cate, if Crist wants to bring back the three tiers. "He will work with the Cabinet to bring back a fair and just process for nonviolent, reformed felons to regain their civil rights," Cate said. Scott says Crist’s policy included violent offenders Scott told the debate audience that felons who committed these "heinous" crimes could walk out of jail and immediately get to vote. But no one got their rights restored automatically as they walked out of jail. All offenders had to complete their sentences, including probation and paying restitution, before they were eligible. For even the lowest level of offenders, the state still had to review their cases for eligibility and the Clemency Board had to sign off on them. The state policy under Crist included a list of certain serious violent offenses, such as murder, that excluded felons from going through the faster process to get their rights restored without a formal hearing. But Scott spokesman Greg Blair noted that several violent offenses were not on that list -- leaving open the possibility that violent felons could access the faster process to get their rights restored. That includes battery or abuse of an elderly person, possessing or discharging a firearm on school property, threatening a witness, injuring or killing a police dog, resisting arrest with violence or animal torture. "You can ask a legal expert which of those are technically classified as ‘violent,’ though I can say with some certainty that nursing home abuse and battery on the elderly count. And resisting arrest with violence, that one’s in the name. So yes, violent criminals could receive restoration of rights under Charlie Crist," Blair argued. Our ruling Scott said that Crist wants felons who commit "a heinous crime" such as "intentional permanent disfigurement of a child" to walk out of jail and immediately get the right to vote. The Cabinet under Crist made it easier for felons to get their rights restored, but they didn’t regain those rights immediately after leaving jail. The offenders had to complete the terms of their sentence, including probation, to qualify. And then the Clemency Board had to sign off on the restorations. The most serious violent offenders had to undergo an investigation and hearing. The only kernel of truth here is that it is possible that some felons who had committed violent crimes got their rights restored, but it wasn’t immediately upon leaving jail. So we rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-10-27T15:49:53	2014-10-21	['Charlie_Crist']

Roskam was a key architect of last year’s congressional tax overhaul that struck the controversial Obamacare penalty for not having health insurance. Casten has made protecting and expanding health care access under Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, a top priority of his campaign. Republicans have been complaining about the effects of Obamacare for years, but Roskam is taking some wild swings with this attack on Casten. There’s a lot here to unpack, so to keep it simple this fact-check focuses on the ad’s unsubstantiated health care claims. "Doubling premiums" Veronica Vera, a Roskam campaign spokeswoman, said the ad connected the dots between Casten’s support for Obamacare and a federal report—itself containing a number of caveats—that found premiums sold to individuals on the federal health care exchange were 105 percent higher in 2017 than premiums for existing individual market plans available in 2013 before the exchange opened. If it happened in the past it surely then will happen in the future, Vera reasoned, and so to the Roskam campaign that means Casten backs a doubling of premiums. One obvious problem with that line of thinking is that the Roskam campaign could provide no evidence that Casten had ever said such a thing. What’s more, experts say a major factor behind recent premium spikes on the individual market was uncertainty over the law’s future given frequent attempts by Roskam and other Republicans, including President Donald Trump, to kill or weaken Obamacare. Even so, there is evidence in Illinois that the days of Obamacare sticker shock may be over. Illinois’ largest insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, has proposed a slight reduction in its premiums for Obamacare plans next year. It’s also important to note that most Americans obtain insurance through their employers, not Obamacare. Overall, premium hikes for work-based policies have been modest in recent years. For those who do rely on Obamacare, just a small share have been exposed to the full brunt of past Obamacare premium increases. Of the 15.2 million Americans who in 2017 purchased Obamacare coverage through the federal health care exchange, 8.2 million qualified for federal subsidies that cushioned them from increases, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care. Another 5.4 million Americans also purchased full-price individual insurance through the off-exchange plans that existed prior to Obamacare, according to Kaiser. "We’re really talking about maybe 2 percent of the population that’s paying full-price premiums for the individual market overall," said Cynthia Cox, a health reform and private insurance expert with the Kaiser Foundation. "It's important to think about these people because the ACA was intended to make insurance more affordable," she said. "But putting it into perspective, it's a relatively small share of the population." "Cutting current health care plans" Roskam’s other health care attack on Casten is also convoluted. The logic works this way: Obamacare shoppers had fewer options when picking plans for 2018, so that must mean that if Obamacare were expanded as Casten wants the options would narrow even further. "Expanding the ACA would mean limiting health care options for everyone affected," Vera wrote. That argument is riddled with holes. Obamacare plans didn’t exist prior to 2014, so any number of options offered on the exchange are a plus, even if pared back. A key reason for the reductions was uncertainty over the law’s future following the election of Trump, who demanded it be scrapped. And Obamacare also mandates minimum levels of coverage that did not exist prior to implementation of the health care law, which vastly expanded access to coverage for millions of Americans who previously had none, including those who didn’t qualify based on their health. "Before the ACA, if you had a pre-existing condition, there could be any number of plans to choose from, but you couldn’t get any of them," said Cox, the insurance expert with the Kaiser Foundation. Our ruling Roskam alleges that Casten supports "doubling premiums" and "cutting current health care plans" for Illinois families. Casten doesn’t support doubling premiums or reducing options—and Roskam’s campaign could point to nothing that said he did. The crux of Roskam’s argument centers on Casten’s support for expanding Obamacare options. Premiums on the federal exchange have spiked in past years, but Illinois’ largest insurer now says it expects them to go down slightly for 2019. What’s more, most Americans get insurance through employers, not Obamacare. But among those who do, most have been insulated from the full force of premium increases by federal subsidies. Health care policy has more wrinkles than a Shar Pei dog, and the complexity makes it easy for partisans to demagogue. Roskam’s claims are a clear example. They’re not just wrong, they’re absurd.

pomt-04478	Says opponent U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore ‘is Wisconsin’s most absent member of Congress, missing nearly 17 percent of the House votes in the second quarter of 2012.’	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/08/dan-sebring/sebring-says-moore-most-absent-member-wisconsins-c/	Republican candidate for Congress Dan Sebring chose a simple way to measure the performance of U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore in a hard-hitting radio ad: The roll call of votes. The ad includes an audio clip of Moore, a four-term member of Congress, screaming "Scott Walker, you gotta go, baby, ‘cause we don’t want you no more!" Sebring, who is challenging Moore for a second time, then reminds listeners in north shore Milwaukee suburbs that, due to redistricting, Moore is now their representative. Then he turns to the ad’s main point: "Gwen Moore is Wisconsin’s most absent member of Congress, missing nearly 17 percent of the House votes in the second quarter of 2012." Is Sebring right? His campaign did not respond to requests for backup, but Sebring, who runs an auto repair shop, elaborates on his website. The site says the attendance claim is based on data compiled by GovTrack.us, an independent site founded in 2004 that that follows legislation, tracks the voting record of individual lawmakers and -- among other things -- monitors missed votes by each member of Congress. GovTrack breaks down the missed votes into quarters while the congressional calendar runs on a two-year session, with lengthy breaks for holidays, the month of August, and -- typically -- re-election season. In the second quarter of 2012, GovTrack says there were 299 votes -- the most in any quarter in the current session. Moore missed 50 votes, or 16.7 percent, the site says. In the first quarter, Moore missed 23 of 151 votes, or 15.2 percent. In the third quarter it was 5 of 152, or 3.3 percent, which is more consistent with the first year of the term. In the second quarter, the one cited by Sebring, the missed votes easily put Moore at the top of the state’s eight-member House delegation. In the quarter, Republicans Paul Ryan, F. James Sensenbrenner, and Reid Ribble missed zero votes; Democrat Tammy Baldwin missed 21, or 7 percent; Democrat Ron Kind missed 12, or 4 percent, and Republicans Sean Duffy and Tom Petri missed one, 0.3 percent. But the numbers don’t tell the whole story. We asked Moore’s campaign to respond to the missed votes claim. Her campaign’s political director, Moore’s sister, Brenda, referred us to congressional chief of staff Minh Ta. Ta said Moore was dealing with a family crisis during the first part of this year. Her older sister, Yvonne, suffered a brain aneurysm and underwent surgery in St. Louis in early March 2012. Later that month, during rehabilitation, Moore’s sister suffered a stroke. In April, she was moved to Milwaukee, where she is in an assisted living facility. Moore was with her sister off and on throughout the surgery, rehabilitation and move, Ta said. Ta said he could not be more precise about the number of days Moore was away from Washington, but said it was a significant family crisis that extended over two months -- and over the first two quarters of the year. "She strives to make every vote as much as she can," Ta said. "Like every normal person, she’s got family crises and so forth." But what about the other part of Sebring’s claim, that Moore is the "most absent" member of the state delegation? You can use the GovTrack data to get a picture for the fulls session, which began seven quarters ago in January 2011. That’s a good point of reference, since it puts first-termers Ribble and Duffy on the same footing as the rest. Looking at the full session, Moore missed 112 votes, or 6.98 percent. If you take out the first two quarters of 2012, Moore missed an average of 3.4 percent of the votes in the other five quarters of this session. So, it’s clear Sebring did some cherry-picking by citing only the second quarter. But that approach still puts Moore at the top of the chart for this session of Congress. The next highest was Ryan, who is running for vice president. Ryan missed 42 votes (or 27.6 percent) in the third quarter. But even when that is factored in, he winds up at 3.09 percent missed for the term. Baldwin, who has been campaigning for a U.S. Senate seat, comes in at 3.03 percent missed votes for the session. Overall, the state delegation missed an average of 2.53 percent of the votes this session. That compares with the median of 2.5 percent for all of Congress, according to GovTrack. In her total time in Congress, starting with January of 2005, Moore has missed 5 percent of votes, also at the top of the charts. Ryan, Baldwin, Kind, Sensenbrenner, Duffy and Ribble all missed 2 percent, while Petri missed 1 percent. That, again, compares to the median of 2.5 percent, according to GovTrack. Our rating Sebring says Moore is the state’s "most absent" member of Congress and that she missed 17 percent of the House votes in the second quarter of 2012. Indeed, Moore missed nearly 17 percent of the votes in the second quarter. That is Moore’s worst quarter, but it also amounts to Sebring doing some cherry-picking of data. A longer period shows a lower percentage, but even that places Moore at the top of the state’s eight-member delegation. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-03517	In Miami-Dade County, "we spend at our school system over $20 million every year" educating recent immigrants.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/jun/03/carlos-curbelo/carlos-curbelo-says-miami-dade-schools-spend-more-/	In February as federal lawmakers including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, were drafting immigration reform, Miami-Dade school board member Carlos Curbelo sought a district report to shine a spotlight on the challenges immigration poses to the nation’s fourth-largest school district. Curbelo, a Republican political consultant who may challenge U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami, highlighted a key figure from the report while on Fox News with Rubio on May 24. Rubio has been trying to win over conservatives to the Senate’s immigration bill , which would create a 13-year pathway to citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. The bill allocates billions for border security and provides visas for high-tech, agricultural and low-skilled workers. Curbelo cited his school district as an example of the high costs posed by the current immigration system: "We spend at our school system over $20 million every year as a direct result of the broken immigration system. The federal government doesn't reimburse us despite the fact that it is their fault. Why? "Because, like you said, a lot of people overstaying their visas and in some cases the government lets families with children in, in the middle of school year, which imposes a burden on schools. So it can't just be the border. We all support border security, but it has to be a lot more than that." Curbelo’s comments didn’t distinguish between costs associated with legal or illegal immigration. Still, his figure caught our eye: do Miami-Dade schools spend more than $20 million a year educating immigrants? And how would that change if Rubio’s bill passes? The Miami-Dade school district immigration report The report that Curbelo drew his number from states that as a result of immigration reform, the district will need to increase English for Speakers of other Languages (ESOL) courses and invest in helping these students pass FCATs and graduate. The report calls on Congress to fully fund the cost of immigration for the schools, among other measures. The key part of the report is the district’s fiscal analysis. An average of 979 foreign-born students a month enter the school district -- or 11,228 for the 2011-12 school year. The report doesn’t identify what percentage are illegal, because federal law prohibits school officials from asking about students' immigration status. The district serves about 350,000 students. The district spent about $322 million on ESOL for about 47,700 students during the 2011-12 school year. That group includes the 11,228 foreigners who arrived that year, plus students who arrived in previous years and native born students whose families speak another language at home and need ESOL. The district calculated that it costs about $6,750 to educate an ESOL student -- or about $1,485 more than a typical student, largely for staff salaries. The district calculates a per-student cost for building and infrastructure of about $473. The district added the extra ESOL cost of $1,485 to the $473 building cost to get a total of $1,958.87 and multiplied that by the 11,228 foreign born students. That brings the grand total to $21,994,243. So it costs $322 million for all ESOL students. The $22 million that Curbelo cited pertained to the foreign students who arrived that school year. The education and building costs are paid for through state and local dollars -- the district analysis omitted federal dollars it gets for very specific uses such as tutoring. For 2011-12, Miami-Dade schools received about $14 million in federal Title III money for English Language Learners or recent immigrants, according to the Florida Department of Education. "We are very confident this is a very conservative analysis" of the costs of educating an immigrant child, assistant superintendent Iraida Mendez-Cartaya told PolitiFact Florida. School board member Raquel Regalado raised some philosophical issues about placing a number on costs. "The school district is one of a few places illegal immigrants receive services without being asked about their status," she told PolitiFact Florida. We don’t have any major quibbles with the district’s math here. But Curbelo used that $22 million figure to criticize our "broken immigration system." So if the Senate’s bill -- which Curbelo told us he generally supports -- passes what does that mean for the number of foreign born students in Miami-Dade and the cost to educate them? Curbelo, who was born in Miami and the son of Cuban exiles, told PolitiFact he isn’t certain how the student population numbers would change, but he believes that improvements to border security and changes in the visa system will make the flow more predictable. Immigration experts on future flows to Miami-Dade We sent the school district’s report and Curbelo’s claim to multiple immigration experts across the political spectrum to ask what they thought of the analysis and what -- if anything -- would change for the Miami-Dade schools if the Senate bill passes. First, one note about Miami-Dade: The dominant immigrant group -- Cubans -- have a special wet-foot dry-foot policy that allows them to become legal U.S. residents when they reach U.S. soil. Those interdicted at sea are returned to Cuba. That policy will remain in place, immigration experts told us. In 2012, about 30,000 of Miami-Dade’s 68,000 foreign born students were from Cuba. (The district has students from 170 countries.) "The data show that a little under 50 percent of the Miami-Dade foreign born students were born in Cuba," said Roger Rice, an attorney who fights for the educational rights of immigrants including winning a consent decree in Florida. Second, we heard disagreements among immigration experts about whether the Senate bill would lead to a higher number or fewer immigrants in the future. (As of late May the House hadn’t filed its version.) But most experts we interviewed agreed it would be difficult to predict how the law’s effects would trickle down to the future numbers of immigrant students in the Miami-Dade public schools. Some said the student population numbers may not change significantly, but their immigration status could change. Others said it could increase, though they couldn’t say by how much for one district. Steve Camarota, research director for the Center for Immigration Studies that lobbies for restricting immigration, said that he expects Rubio’s bill would increase the number of immigrant children in public schools. "The bill doubles roughly the number green cards from one to two million That could have a very big impact from number of kids in school," he said. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute who supports the bill, said that "the bill will probably not have a huge impact" on the number of immigrant school children in Miami-Dade. He disagreed with Curbelo’s speculation that the numbers will be more predictable. The number of illegal immigrants who come to the U.S. is driven by the economy -- not border security, Nowrasteh said, and that will still remain the case even if border security improves. "If the economy improves dramatically in Miami-Dade, thousands upon thousands will move to the area....," he said. "Who would have said in the early 1970s that Miami, which had a lot of urban problems and decay and people leaving, who would have said Cubans and the wave of immigrants were going to come here and revitalize Miami?" Some experts also said that the district’s analysis reflects costs but not benefits of educating children who will be able to get jobs in the future and pay taxes. The Senate bill would still leave the states and local governments to pay for the majority of the education costs -- as they do right now. There is some mention of grants in the bill for services such as immigration integration and citizenship classes, but it’s unclear if the district could get any such grants and how much money that would provide. Philip Wolgin at the Center for American Progress who supports the Senate bill, said for the immigrants who are already here who become legal their wages will increase and they will have more resources to support their children. "The idea will all education is we make investments in students now and later on in life they work and are able to pay into the system far more than they take out," he said. Though the Center for American Progress’s estimate shows a slight net decrease as a result of the Senate bill, "it's very very difficult to actually say these many are going to go to Miami." Our ruling When talking on Fox News about the challenges posed by immigration, Curbelo said "I'll give you an example, in our hometown, Miami Dade County. We spend at our school system over $20 million every year as a direct result of the broken immigration system." The more than $20 million a year figure is valid; it reflects annual costs for new students who need English for Speakers of Other Languages, or ESOL. The district spends additional money for existing students who need ESOL classes. Curbelo's comments also gloss over some of the complexity of immigration costs. We found differing opinion among experts as to what impact the law would have on school districts. Some said the costs would likely stay the same, other said costs would go up. Overall, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Carlos Curbelo	None	None	None	2013-06-03T10:19:21	2013-05-24	['Miami-Dade_County,_Florida']

pomt-07807	The federal government "can cut all of the non-military discretionary spending and not balance the budget."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/17/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-zeroing-out-non-military-discretion/	During a Feb. 14, 2011, interview with Fox Business News, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., told anchor Andrew Napolitano that balancing the budget cannot be done without touching sacrosanct areas such as the military. "The problem is that things are out of control, and unless you accept that you can have federal government doing less things, like unless you accept the philosophic principle that education should be handled by the states and localities, they don't know where to cut," Paul said. "Or unless you accept the principle that military spending will have to be cut. They don't have enough money to cut. They can cut all of the non-military discretionary spending and not balance the budget." He is making a dramatic point that even if Congress were to eliminate every non-military program except for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid (which are considered mandatory rather than discretionary), it still wouldn’t be enough to balance the budget. We should emphasize the sweeping nature of "discretionary" spending -- that is, spending that has to be funded by Congress every year. It includes all defense and homeland security spending plus virtually every major government program other than Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. It includes everything from the National Institutes of Health to the air traffic control system to Pell Grants for college students. For this year, it includes $507 billion for non-security and $908 billion for security spending. There are two other main elements of the federal budget: mandatory programs and interest on the debt. Mandatory programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are funded by formulas that cannot be pared back without specific action by Congress to rewrite those formulas. Interest payments are also considered mandatory. We reviewed the latest budget figures and found that Paul is correct. If you subtract out every last penny of non-security discretionary spending and simply add together security spending, mandatory programs and interest, the government is still projected to face expenditures of $3.309 trillion for fiscal year 2011. That’s a full $1.14 trillion more than the $2.17 trillion in taxes and other income the government is expecting to collect for 2011. So the government would have a trillion-dollar-plus deficit in 2011 even without spending anything on non-security discretionary spending. Now, Paul did say "non-military" rather than "non-security," which is a slightly different measurement, since the Department of Homeland Security and a few other security-related programs outside the Defense Department are categorized under the "security" heading. But the dollar amounts involved are not enough to make a difference in evaluating his statement. So we rate Paul’s statement True.

pomt-07582	Says none of the government programs targeted for elimination or severe cutback in House Republican spending plans "appeared on the GAO's list of government programs at high risk of waste, fraud and abuse."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/28/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-gop-budget-cuts-dont-targ/	Temporary spending bills have kept the government from shutting down while Congress tries to reach a long-term agreement for the current fiscal year, which ends in October. Disagreement over spending cuts created the impasse. Lawmakers have clashed over both the quantity and the quality of reductions. Rep. Dennis Kucinich raised the issue of accountability at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on which he sits. In the debate over the continuing resolution that would keep the government up and running, the House had supported amendments that would severely cut or entirely eliminate entities or programs which provide critical assistance to the most vulnerable Americans. Some of those amendments, he said, would eliminate funding for research and for programs needed to address pressing social and economic issues. "To my knowledge, none of these existing programs appeared on the GAO's list of government programs at high risk of waste, fraud and abuse." Kucinich said. The GAO is the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. Meanwhile, he noted, several Department of Defense initiatives that ranked prominently in the GAO high-risk report as programs that remain very susceptible to fraud and abuse remained untouched. Kucinich went on to ask U.S. Comptroller General Gene Dodaro if Congress can be sure that budget requests from the Pentagon reflect actual cost (short answer: no) and to quote an assessment by eight former defense officials that burgeoning budgets have brought weaker forces at higher costs. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at Kucinich’s claim about the GAO list. The high risk list is part of a 20-year-old program designed to "identify and help resolve serious weaknesses in areas that involve substantial resources and provide critical services." It has designated more than 50 areas as high risk since 1990, and taken more than a third off the list for improvement. "The 30 areas that we have on the high-risk list right now," Dodaro said, "represent tremendous opportunities to save billions of dollars and, if actions are taken appropriately, to improve the performance and accountability of the federal government." Our review of the list, and of reductions proposed to the continuing budget resolution, found that Kucinich was accurate -- there was no crossover, and none of the high-risk areas were marked for elimination. We also learned that the high-risk roster is not just a hit list of targets ripe for defunding. The program identifies areas in need of improvement, but not necessarily reduction or elimination, said Christopher Mihm, the GAO's managing director of strategic issues. Some of them could have direct impact on the budget, he said, but "it's not just a matter of 'If we fix it, the appropropriation will decrease.'" For example, the high-risk list includes the Internal Revenue Service's enforcement of tax laws. The net tax gap -- the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid -- was estimated at $295 billion. "You get 5 percentage points off that (through better enforcement) and you're getting real money," Mihm said (Collecting 5 percent of that $295 billion would yield nearly $15 billion for the government). Similarly, the GAO says the Interior Department is not reasonably sure it’s collecting its share of billions of dollars in oil and gas revenues from federal lands and waters. The GAO says more resources, not cutbacks, are needed for reforms. Kucinich put the Pentagon in a different category. The GAO and the Defense Department’s inspector general say it does not and cannot even track how or where it spends its money. The eight former defense officials cited by Kucinich, and other officials, recommend that Pentagon spending be frozen at current spending levels until it can pass audits of all of its programs, agencies, and contractors. Kucinich’s statement is factually accurate, and does not in this case require qualification. On the Truth-O-Meter it rates as True.

pomt-06131	Says murder is the chief cause of death for pregnant women.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/dec/26/kyleen-wright/anti-abortion-activist-says-murder-no-1-killer-pre/	Via Twitter, the president of the anti-abortion Texans for Life Coalition made this claim Dec. 6, 2011: "Murder #1 cause of death for pg women," meaning pregnant women. "Tragic." Kyleen Wright’s message pointed Twitter followers to a Houston Chronicle news article published that day about a Houston man charged with capital murder in the August 2010 stabbing death of a pregnant woman. Investigators had discovered records of calls and text messages between the man and the woman, the story says, indicating that he thought he was the unborn child's father and wanted her to have an abortion but that she had refused. We asked Wright to elaborate on murder being the primary cause of death for pregnant women. By email, she replied: "This is a story that keeps popping up. ... It’s the top cause, it’s one of the top causes, and then there will be the occasional story denying it’s a top cause." Wright guided us to an Oct. 26, 2011, Reuters news article about a study concluding that about three of every 100,000 women who are pregnant or have a child less than 1 year old are murdered and two of every 100,000 kill themselves, with roughly half of the women who died violently having had some sort of conflict with current or former partners. That facet, the story says, prompted experts to call for more thorough screening and follow-up for domestic problems during pregnancy check-ups. In the November 2011, issue of the Obstetrics & Gynecology medical journal, the researchers summed up: "Pregnancy-associated homicide and suicide each account for more deaths" than obstetric complications "including hemorrhage, obstetric embolism or preeclampsia and eclampsia." That’s not quite saying murder is the prime killer of pregnant women. Rather, the study suggests that homicide accounts for more deaths than specific individual complications of pregnancy. The study says the researchers determined that there were two suicides and 2.9 homicides among pregnant or postpartum mothers for every 100,000 live births from 2003 through 2007. Over the years, the study says, rates of death due to cardiac disease, infection and hemorrhage and other such medical causes have decreased but maternal mortality due to injury has remained constant. "Homicide and suicide are two important and potentially preventable causes of maternal injury," the study says. In an interview, the study’s lead researcher, Christie Palladino, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Georgia Health Sciences University, pointed us to a 2010 study led by Cynthia Berg of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimating that from 1998 through 2005, the U.S. death rate of women from all pregnancy-related complications was 14.5 per 100,000 live births. The study was described in the December 2010 issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Palladino told us that her study’s figures on slain pregnant and postpartum women were drawn from the National Violent Death Reporting System, a federal database including all records of violent deaths in 16 participating states. She noted that compared to the 2.9 homicides of pregnant and postpartum women per 100,000 live births, other research has found that 1.81 pregnant and postpartum women per 100,0000 live births die from hemorrhage, with fewer pregnant women dying from other causes associated with pregnancy, including cardiovascular conditions, thrombotic pulmonary embolisms, hypertensive disorders, infections, cardiomyopathy and amniotic fluid embolisms. Then again, Palladino said, her team’s study did not look into all possible causes of death for pregnant women; car wrecks, for example, were not included. By email, Palladino said that "while we can't say that homicide is THE #1 cause (of) pregnancy-associated mortality, our data when compared to other data on maternal mortality" points to the fact that homicide and suicide are "among the leading causes of pregnancy-associated deaths." Palladino also provided a federal study, published in 2005, concluding that the murder rate for pregnant and postpartum women was 1.7 per 100,000 live births. Murder risk factors for mothers, the federal study says, include being younger than 20, being African American and having late or no prenatal care. "Homicide," the authors wrote in the March 2005 issue of the American Journal of Public Health, "is a leading cause of pregnancy-associated injury deaths." But it’s not the leading cause, according to the 2005 study. The study drew on information covering 1991 through 1999 in the nation’s Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, which was established in 1987 to collect data on all reported deaths that occurred during pregnancy or within a year of pregnancy. And of all the period’s 7,342 reported deaths of women (some of which occurred more than a year after the woman gave birth), 4,200 were due to medical complications during pregnancy or a year afterward. Nearly 880 of the deaths occurred due to motor vehicle accidents and 617 women were murdered, the study says, and unintentional injuries, suicides and other causes accounted for nearly 500 deaths. In this review, then, murder trailed vehicle accidents and medical complications as a cause of death. Additional perspective may be in order, the researchers indicated, in that the prevalence of homicides involving pregnant and postpartum women is "similar to national statistics on homicide among all women of reproductive age (regardless of whether they are pregnant or not)." In 1999, the study says, homicide was the third-leading cause of injury-related death for all U.S. women (pregnant or not pregnant) of reproductive age, 15 to 44 years of age, after deaths caused by motor vehicle accidents and suicide. For such women in 2008, the latest year of available data, homicide ranked behind motor vehicle accidents, poisonings, malignant tumors, suicides, poisonings and heart disease among causes of death, our check of a CDC database indicates. We’re ready to rule. The Palladino study, suggesting more pregnant and postpartum women die from murder than any single medical complication, gives Wright’s claim an element of truth. But murder trails medical complications combined as a cause of death and it’s also behind vehicle wrecks. Wright’s statement is Mostly False.

pomt-04522	"One of the first states in the union to pass a voter ID bill was Rhode Island, 85 percent Democratic legislature."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/oct/03/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-says-rhode-island-was-one-first-states/	Little Rhody got a national shout out on ABC’s talk show "The View" on Sept. 27, 2012. That’s when subtle-as-napalm conservative pundit Ann Coulter used Rhode Island’s 2011 voter-identification law to rebut the charge that such legislation is a Republican scheme to steal elections by making it harder for poor and minority voters to vote. "One of the first states in the union to pass a voter ID bill was Rhode Island, 85 percent Democratic legislature," she told cohost Joy Behar, after Behar suggested that Republicans were pushing voter identification not to stop fraud but to reduce Democratic turnout. "And who pushed it?," Coulter asked. "A black Democrat in the House, a black Democrat in the Senate. That's a fact!" Democrats in individual states, and nationally, have sought to discredit voter-identification initiatives, charging they are part of a Republican strategy to make it harder for people who have historically favored Democrats to get the paperwork they need. As Coulter’s counterpunch showed, Rhode Island’s voter identification law, passed last year, has emerged as a Republican talking point to dispute accusations of partisanship. In this item, we will check Coulter’s claim that Rhode Island was a leader in voter-identification legislation. We will examine the second part of her statement in a separate item. Rhode Island, where 83.5 percent of the state’s legislators are Democrats, is an exception to the national trend on voter-identification, but, despite what Coulter claimed, it is far from being "one of the first" states to pass such legislation. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, as of Sept. 5, 2012, 31 states had enacted some form of voter identification law. At least 12 did so between 2003-2010, well before Governor Lincoln Chafee signed Rhode Island’s law in July 2011. Which state actually was the first is unclear. For the modern era, it appears the first state to require voters to verify their identity appears to be South Carolina, in 1950, said Jennie Bower, a senior fellow who researches the issue for the council. Rhode Island isn’t even the first state in New England to require identification; Connecticut did it in 1993. Our ruling Ann Coulter said Rhode Island was one of the first states to enact voter-identification laws. It isn’t. At least a dozen states had such laws earlier, making Rhode Island closer to the middle of the pack. We rule her statement False.

pomt-07750	"Twelve percent of the garbage collected in those SOLV cleanups, by volume, is plastic bags."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/feb/26/mark-hass/mark-hass-says-plastic-bags-made-12-percent-debris/	The pitched battle over Oregon’s proposed plastic bag ban -- and accompanying 5-cent charge on paper bags -- is ripe for misused and invented facts, figures and claims. Already, we’ve knocked down one assertion that the ban would install a tax on paper bags. Well, during a Feb. 8 hearing, Beaverton Democrat Sen. Mark Hass -- one of the biggest cheerleaders for the ban -- made a few of his own assertions that had us doing double-takes. One of them was that "12 percent of the garbage collected in those SOLV cleanups, by volume, is plastic bags." SOLV, for the uninitiated, is a statewide conservation nonprofit. In addition to other efforts, the group organizes river and beach cleanups throughout the year. We went to SOLV’s website to see what we could dig up. We couldn’t find much in the way of overall numbers, but we did find a breakdown of the sort of trash the group’s volunteers had collected during their Fall Beach and Riverside Clean-up. Among the detritus were cigarette filters, plastic bottles, caps, cans, food wrappers, rope, straws and -- yes -- plastic bags. All told, 5,851 pieces of litter were found at the group’s 19 beach and two river cleanup sites. How much, then, did plastic bags account for? The breakdown didn’t give any sense of relative volume, though, so we could check only by percentage. By our math, 4 percent, given 245 bags were collected. That’s quite a ways away from Sen. Hass’ 12 percent figure. Next, we called SOLV and spoke with Rachel Pecore, a program coordinator there, and we asked if there were any more-comprehensive numbers about the debris SOLV has found over the years -- a number that included more than just the previous fall’s cleanup. She said she wasn’t aware of any, but she cautioned us about putting too much stock in the composition breakdown on the group’s website. As it turns out, some 7,000 volunteers participated in the fall cleanup, but only 232 of those volunteers actually participated in filling out data cards on the debris they collected. "Volunteers have an option of completing a data card of what they picked up," Pecore said. "It is not a scientifically rigorous process. They’re estimates." Pecore then pointed us in the direction of the Ocean Conservancy, a far-reaching conservation group that keeps better numbers. In fact, she said, SOLV gets the data cards from the group and reports its findings back. We looked at Ocean Conservancy’s 2010 study of marine debris, "Trash Travels." According to that report, about a half-million volunteers participated in a worldwide cleanup that covered 108 countries and 45 states. All told, volunteers reported some 10,240,000 pieces of debris, of which 1,126,774 piece were plastic bags -- roughly 11 percent. As for Oregon specifically, the group found that of the 6,881 pieces of debris collected in the state, 890 bits were plastic bags. That’s about 13 percent. We’d yet to find the 12 percent figure Hass had referred to at the hearing, so we gave his office a call. The senator told us a SOLV program coordinator had given him the 12 percent figure. He said he’d follow up in an e-mail, and, true to his word, he did. Hass forwarded us -- along with a few other bits and pieces -- an e-mail he received from Diana Bartlett, a SOLV program coordinator. In the e-mail she notes that the Ocean Conservancy’s 2009 marine debris report shows that 12 percent of the trash collected by volunteers was made up of plastic bags. We checked the report and she’s right. Hass also noted that the 2009 report offers a state-by-state breakdown that says cleaners found 13.4 percent of their sample in Oregon was plastic bags (172 of the 1,281 pieces collected). Hass ended his e-mail with this: "I’m happy to defend anything I’ve said on this issue -- and take my lumps if it’s out of context or outdated." So, are there any lumps to give? In the Feb. 8 committee hearing Hass said. "Twelve percent of the garbage collected in those SOLV cleanups, by volume, is plastic bags." None of the sources gave a sense of relative volume. One discarded sofa (yes, SOLV volunteers found a brown plaid sofa on the beach one year) is more volume than 172 plastic bags. And Hass wasn’t exactly right. He cited SOLV’s cleanups but the organization doesn’t gather reliable numbers. Ocean Conservancy, the group that actually produced the figure Hass used, did report that plastic bags made up 12 percent of its marine debris collection in 2008 and 11 percent in 2009. That percentage jumped to 13.4 percent in 2008 and 13 percent in 2009 when Oregon was considered alone, according to Ocean Conservancy reports. It seems to us that Hass attributed his 12 percent figure to the wrong source. That said, the 12 percent figure seems to jibe with the general range the two most recent reports offer. With that in mind, we rate this claim Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	Mark Hass	None	None	None	2011-02-26T06:00:00	2011-02-08	['None']

pomt-09133	After J.D. Hayworth "was voted out of Congress, he became a registered lobbyist" who was "paid thousands by a Florida corporation to lobby the very committee he used to serve on."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/15/john-mccain/mccain-accuses-hayworth-earning-thousands-lobbyist/	Less than two years after losing the 2008 presidential election, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is embroiled in a tough Republican primary against former Rep. J.D. Hayworth. In one recent TV ad, McCain attacks Hayworth for claiming to be an outsider. The ad shows a limousine driving by a fancy building and then an unflattering black-and-white clip of Hayworth sharing the screen with an airborne corporate jet and floating paper money. "J.D. Hayworth says he's an outsider, but after he was voted out of Congress he became a registered lobbyist," the narrator intones. "Hayworth was paid thousands by a Florida corporation to lobby the very committee he used to serve on." We decided to check to see if this description is accurate. First, the add is correct that Hayworth was voted out of office. He lost in the landslide of 2006 to his Democratic challenger, Harry Mitchell. Now for the lobbying claim. By law, all registered lobbyists must periodically file disclosure forms with the U.S. House and Senate, and we were able to locate two filed by Hayworth. In February 2008, Hayworth filed a form serving notice that he would be a paid lobbyist for the Wealth Transfer Group, based in Altamonte Springs, Fla. A separate but related form filed two months later disclosed that Hayworth was paid $10,000 by his client. The forms also say that Hayworth's subject areas for lobbying would be tax and copyright issues. The tax issue falls squarely within the jurisdiction of the House Ways and Means Committee, which used to count Hayworth among its members. Based on contemporary news accounts, it's likely that the Wealth Transfer Group hired Hayworth to lobby against possible restrictions on patenting "tax reduction strategies." These are approaches to limiting one's tax liability that are so unique that they have been granted patents by the federal government. The Wealth Transfer Group owns -- and has defended in court -- a patent on a technique for limiting the tax liability on certain kinds of stock options. The company's website says that the company only works on estates exceeding $10 million. In 2007, the Wall Street Journal reported that the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants "wrote leaders of several congressional committees urging them to limit tax-strategy patents. These patents 'undermine the integrity, fairness and administration' of the tax system and are 'contrary to sound public policy,' the institute said." The forms cited here were the only two related to Hayworth included in the congressional disclosure-form database, which is considered definitive. So the Wealth Transfer Group gig appears to have been his only lobbying job after leaving Congress. And in the grand scheme of Washington lobbying, having one client for a couple months that paid $10,000 is pretty small peanuts. Still, these forms show enough information to make McCain's ad accurate. Hayworth was indeed a registered lobbyist, he worked for a Florida company, and he said he would be lobbying on tax issues, which meant targeting his old colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee. We rate McCain's ad True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2010-06-15T11:02:40	2010-06-07	['United_States_Congress', 'Florida']

pomt-02048	In Texas, "a faceless hospital panel can deny life-sustaining care, giving you only 10 days to find another facility for your mother, dad, or young child, even if the patient is conscious."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/may/30/texas-right-life/texas-law-gives-hospital-panels-sway-over-cutting-/	UPDATE: On May 29, 2014, we rated as Mostly False a claim by Texas Right to Life that in Texas, "faceless" panels can judge whether to continue a person's care. But we initially misreported a word in the group's statement. Texas Right to Life's ad referred to "life-sustaining" care -- not "life-saving" care, which is what we wrote. Our correction of our error leads us to conclude the group's claim accurately tracked a portion of the law. Consequently, we are changing our rating to Half True. An ad targeting a Republican state senator opened with what sounded like a heartbeat and a wailing siren in the background as the narrator read words displayed on screen: "If your loved one is in the hospital, you may be shocked to learn that a faceless hospital panel can deny life-sustaining care, giving you only 10 days to find another facility for your mother, dad, or young child, even if the patient is conscious." A moment later, the narrator said: "This actually happens to families across Texas." Death panels, Texas style? Group cites 1999 law In 2013, state Sen. Bob Deuell, a Greenville physician, unsuccessfully proposed changes in a 1999 law that had created a process for situations when there is no advance directive from a patient regarding an end-of-life decision and there’s disagreement between the primary physician and a patient's family over continuing treatment. Texas Right to Life, which describes itself as the state’s oldest "pro-life" group, opposed Deuell’s proposal and also created the ad, which it publicized in a press release. Deuell ultimately lost his 2014 runoff for the GOP nomination to challenger Bob Hall. Asked the basis of the ad claim, spokeswoman Melissa Conway emailed a statement from John Seago, Texas Right to Life’s legislative director, referring to Section 166.046 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, which states that a hospital review committee may align with a primary physician on cutting off or continuing a patient’s life-sustaining care. If a panel agrees on ending such care, the patient or person responsible for their care has 10 days to acquire another physician or move to another facility before the hospital is no longer obligated to provide care, the law says, though a court shall extend the 10-day period if it finds a reasonable expectation a physician or facility that will honor the patient's desires will be found with the added time. The law defines "life-sustaining" treatment as treatment that, based on reasonable medical judgment, sustains the life of a patient without which the patient will die. "The term includes both life-sustaining medications and artificial life support, such as mechanical breathing machines, kidney dialysis treatment, and artificial nutrition and hydration," the law says. By email, Seago pointed out the law is silent on who should serve on a review committee nor, he wrote, does it require participants to be identified to the affected family. Seago also said Texas Right to Life, which has advocated for patients, has attended review meetings in which not all committee members were revealed. Seago urged us to reach out to lawyers including Jerri Lynn Ward of Lakeway, near Austin, who said by email that none of her clients--among them, Andrea Clark, whose 2006 dying drew news coverage--knew the names of committee members before review proceedings began. "I would call that being faceless," Ward said. Other views To our inquiries, others including lawyers, physicians and advocacy groups for hospitals and doctors told us the ad claim misrepresents how the Texas law has been carried out. The Texas Hospital Association, which describes itself as the political and educational advocate for more than 430 hospitals and health systems, said the claim misrepresents elements of such extremely rare hospital committee reviews. By telephone, Carrie Kroll agreed that "at the end of the day, the hospital can say no, we’re not going to provide care." But review panels aren’t faceless, Kroll said, in that individuals on the panels meet with the families or guardians challenging a physician’s judgment. Also, Kroll said, most hospitals provide patient "liaisons" to guide families and loved ones through the reviews. The Senate-approved version of Deuell’s failed 2013 proposal mandated such liaisons during reviews, according to a Texas Medical Association summary emailed to us by association spokesman Steve Levine. On another front, Kroll said, "we’re not talking about life-saving care. In most of these instances, it’s a situation where the person is dying. They are not going to walk out of that hospital even if they are conscious. They’re in the end of their life--maybe minutes, days, hours… But they’re not somebody who has gone in for a knee replacement and the hospital is just tired of dealing with them and is going to kill them, as an example," Kroll said. Hospital association spokesman Lance Lunsford, asked how often review panels must resolve such disputes, emailed us a summary of a 2012 association survey of 212 hospitals and hospital systems. In 2011, according to the summary, the review process was initiated 21 times at 16 hospitals or systems. The group’s survey for 2010 identified a single review that year, the summary says, and its survey for 2009 indicated the process was initiated twice in two systems. Kroll put us in touch with Jeanine Graf, medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, who told us she has served on that hospital’s bioethics committee for at least 15 years. Once a year or every other year, Graf said by phone, the committee decides a child’s care should end because more care would be futile. Otherwise, Graf said, "we’re just prolonging their deaths." "It’s not a faceless committee," Graf said. "The family comes to the committee," which consists of nurses, physicians, religious officials and an ethicist, "and pleads their case. There’s no anonymity. We identify ourselves." Also, Graf said, she has never seen a patient in such circumstances who was aware of their surroundings. "They are often the sickest patients who are expected to die no matter what we do," she said. After a panel decides more care is unwarranted, usually after a meeting that runs several hours, the family is given at least 10 business days to act, Graf said. "It very rarely comes to that 10-day clock," Graf said. "The person may die in the interim." For the medical association, Levine similarly challenged the description of the review committees as "faceless" and said the "rarely used dispute resolution process is used only for terminally or irreversibly ill patients." Levine suggested we consult attorney Thomas Mayo, an associate professor of law at Southern Methodist University. By email, Mayo told us that since 1998, he’s been part of a statewide working group that regularly discusses the relevant law. By telephone, Mayo suggested the law is more complex than the ad indicates. "Is it possible a conscious person could be denied life-sustaining treatment because of the actions of a committee? I guess… in the sense the ethics committee has to be consulted and if it is consulted and agrees with the (primary) doctor, then this doctor after a period of time is not obligated to provide that treatment." Mayo later emailed, calling the statement "mostly wrong. There is no ‘faceless hospital panel,’ ... and consciousness isn’t the issue. Although the statute doesn’t specify that" the "patient should be diagnosed with a terminal or" an "irreversible condition in order for this law to apply, that does appear to be the case as a matter of medical practice within the applicable standard of care." Mayo urged us to contact Robert L. Fine, a Dallas palliative-care physician who told us he’s advised legislators about the law on behalf of his employer, the Baylor Health Care System, and the state medical and hospital associations. By email, Fine expressed skepticism about any physician or review committee employing the law to judge the condition of anyone not terminally or irreversibly ill. "I don’t know of a single hospital ethics committee that would let that happen," Fine said. Affected patients are "not going to be cured," Fine said. "When these cases come up… it’s always when a patient is terminal or irreversibly ill; typically" when they’re suffering; often when there is "division within the family"; and only when an attending physician says further treatment is inappropriate, Fine said, often because the nursing staff is urging that decision. Fine also said: "I can’t promise you there’s not some rogue hospital or committee out there. But the question would be why isn’t the family taking that" result "public?" Group stands by claim Next, we ran what the medical community was telling us past Seago, who replied by email that nothing disproved what the law allows to occur, including the "faceless" panels. Seago pointed out, too, the law doesn’t limit review panels to considering cases involving terminally ill patients. "Our ad was about the law and instead of looking at the law you are trusting the testimony of doctors," Seago emailed. Our ruling Texas Right to Life said in Texas, "a faceless hospital panel can deny life-sustaining care, giving you only 10 days to find another facility for your mother, dad, or young child, even if the patient is conscious." This claim accurately tracks a portion of the law and we see how one could construe this scenario. The law doesn't specify how hospital review panels should be composed or run. But doctors and hospitals insist the law has been carried out in ways not acknowledged here. For starters, the rarely convened review panels aren’t faceless; committee members are reportedly introduced at the reviews. Also, consciousness is not an element of the law. Finally, the law permits courts to add to the 10 days provided for families to find an alternate facility, which the ad doesn’t mention. We rate this claim, which is partly accurate but leaves out important details, as Half True.

pomt-07523	Virginia was named "best managed state, best state for business and best state to raise a child" while I was governor.	true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/07/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-virginia-named-best-managed-state-b/	Democrat Timothy M. Kaine launched his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign on April 5 by touting his record as Virginia’s governor. Kaine said Virginia was named the "best-managed state, best state for business and best state in which to raise a child" during his term from 2006 to 2010. (Virginia law bars governors from serving consecutive terms). We wondered if Kaine had his facts right. We turned to Governing magazine. Since 1999, it has been publishing a report by the non-partisan Pew Center on the States that grades each state on the strength of its management. Under Kaine in 2008, Virginia was one of three states to earn an "A-" grade, topping the rankings alongside Utah and Washington. The Pew report does not assign one-to-50 rankings to the states, meaning Utah and Washington can also claim to be "best managed." Virginia’s reputation for well-managed government hardly begins with Kaine, however. Each of the four governors who preceded Kaine also claim credit for having run the best-managed state. That includes Republican George Allen, who is also running for Senate in 2012. The state earned the best grades in Governing in 2005 when Democrat Mark Warner was governor and in 1999 under Republican Jim Gilmore. Financial World magazine researched and published similar ratings -- independent of Pew -- in the 1990s. Virginia received the top management grade in 1995 and 1996 under Allen, and in 1992 and 1993 under the governorship of Democrat Doug Wilder. The Pew report looks at a state’s performance and resources in four major categories: money, infrastructure, people and information. The diverse topics means a state’s record is dependant on many people, including elected officials and state employees. The state’s 2008 mark under Kaine was unchanged from the "A-" grade received in 2005 under Warner. Virginia’s ranking as the top state for doing business comes from Forbes, the financial magazine. The state took first place each year from 2006 to 2009. In 2009 the publication said Virginia earned the top spot thanks to a highly-trained workforce, a favorable regulatory environment and high quality of life. As governor, Kaine had only indirect control over most of these factors. Although he certainly had a say in tax rates and regulations, he had little sway over how many Virginians earned college degrees during his term and many quality-of-life issues. But the facts match Kaine’s claim about the state being rated best for business during his tenure. Last year the state surrendered the top spot to Utah and placed second in the Forbes survey. Despite the drop, the magazine still had high praise for Virginia’s business climate. Utah had narrowly trailed Virginia in 2009. The claim about Virginia being the best state to raise a child comes from a 2007 report by Education Weekand the Pew Center on the States. The survey examined education test scores, high school graduation rates, family income and even the education level of Virginia parents. Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey and Maryland rounded out the top five. Like the other categories, Kaine can’t claim credit for all of these successes. He certainly didn’t play a role in how many Virginians went to college during the years or decades before he became governor. Let’s review our findings. Virginia has long-earned top marks for state management, finishing at or near the top of virtually every survey in that category for 20 years. Kaine built upon a strong legacy of management established by his predecessors from both parties. He deserves credit, however, for keeping the state near the top. He was handed a Cadillac and drove it well. We rate his statements True.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2011-04-07T13:00:26	2011-04-05	['None']
pomt-02000	By 2009, "dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield" by drones.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/11/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-2009-us-drones-had-killed-doz/	In Hillary Clinton’s new memoir, Hard Choices, the former secretary of state defends the administration’s use of drone strikes in the face of knotty ethical and legal questions. In chapter 9 of the book, Clinton says drone strikes quickly became "one of the most effective and controversial elements of the Obama Administration’s strategy against al Qaeda and like-minded terrorists." She goes on to defend the careful planning of the strikes and their legal grounding, as well as their strategic value. But we were especially interested in one claim she made: "President Obama would eventually declassify many of the details of the program and explain his policies to the world, but in 2009 all I could say was ‘no comment’ whenever the subject came up. Yet it was widely known that dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield by drones, and we later learned that bin Laden himself worried about the heavy losses that drones were inflicting." Is that correct? First, some background. Using armed unmanned aerial vehicles in combat is controversial because it pushes legal boundaries. (Here’s a previous fact-check in which we looked at this issue.) Of special concern is that drones have killed at least four American citizens on foreign soil. In defense of the program, officials often praise its effectiveness in hampering terrorist organizations. Tallying up the number of drone strikes is challenging, for obvious reasons -- they are done with tight secrecy. Although breaking down this data is difficult to do as a layperson, experts we checked with suggest that the claim that U.S. drone strikes have killed "dozens" of senior terrorists may well be an understatement. "Hillary Clinton’s statement is 100 percent correct," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "That’s a conservative estimate." There are no definitive lists of drone strikes or casualties they cause, but an analysis by the New America Foundation, a think tank, found that as of 2013, drones have killed about 58 known militant leaders in Pakistan and 35 in Yemen. In just those two countries, drones have killed between 2,861 and 4,452 people in all -- civilians and unknowns, in addition to militants, according to the foundation’s study. (Pakistan and Yemen are the locations of the majority of United States drone strikes, though attacks have also occurred in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Philippines.) Clinton, though, uses the "dozens" number to refer to senior terrorists killed through 2009. A look through another non-governmental database -- created by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a philanthropically funded investigative-journalism project based in the United Kingdom -- appears to provide support for Clinton’s claims. We sifted through the project’s aggregated news reports about confirmed and suspected U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia, where the U.S. primarily sends drones to target members of al-Qaida and its affiliates. We searched for reported deaths of terrorists and militants described as "senior," "leader" or "commander" through the end of 2009. Under these reasonably restrictive conditions, we found roughly three dozen top terrorists killed. Looking just at articles compiled by the Washington Post, we come up with at least two dozen. This number is nowhere near definitive, since it includes several deaths that are disputed. On the other hand, the number could be higher since it doesn’t include information from unreported strikes or strikes in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq or Philippines. Despite these caveats, a conservative analysis of the evidence does suggest a factual basis for Clinton’s claim. A final note: Clinton also appears to be right about bin Laden being concerned about drones. A trove of letters found at Osama bin Laden’s compound after his 2011 death reveal that he was concerned about America’s drone use. In an October 2010 letter, he revealed that he was particularly worried about attacks in Waziristan, a region of Afghanistan. "I am leaning toward getting most of the brothers out of the area," he wrote. "We could leave the cars because they are targeting cars now, but if we leave them, they will start focusing on houses and that would increase casualties among women and children. It is possible that they have photographed targeted homes. The brothers who can keep a low profile and take the necessary precautions should stay, but move to new houses on a cloudy day." Our ruling Clinton said that "dozens of senior terrorists had been taken off the battlefield" by drones. While it’s difficult to find a definitive number just using publicly available evidence, even a conservative estimate using credible accounts is enough to rate her claim True.

pomt-13445	Says she "would bring 186,740 new jobs to Wisconsin" and "Donald Trump would cost Wisconsin 61,050 jobs."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/16/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-wisconsin-will-gain-jobs-unde/	With certainty and precise counts, the Democratic presidential nominee vowed she will create jobs in Wisconsin and that the Republican nominee will kill them. "The numbers say it all," read an Aug. 22, 2016 tweet from @HillaryforWI, one of the official Hillary Clinton campaign accounts. The tweet included a graphic that said Clinton "would bring 186,740 new jobs to Wisconsin" and "Donald Trump would cost Wisconsin 61,050 jobs." The claim is derived from national estimates made by a well-regarded economist. But they are estimates, based on only somewhat-detailed policy statements from the candidates. And another set of estimates, albeit done with an arguably less rigorous methodology, produced very different results. Clinton’s evidence The claim is extrapolated from a July 2016 analysis of Clinton’s economic proposals and a June 2016 analysis of Trump’s proposals by Moody’s Analytics. The lead author on both was Mark Zandi, the economic research firm’s chief economist. Zandi is a well-respected economist, one PolitiFact has quoted as an expert in previous fact checks. Interestingly, both Clinton and Trump claim Zandi is on the other team. Perhaps that’s because politicians and economists on both sides of the aisle like Zandi, and because he has contributed to Democrats (including Clinton) and Republicans. Zandi has said he is a registered Democrat, but he told us the only time he officially worked for a candidate was when he was an economic adviser to U.S. Sen. John McCain during the Arizona Republican’s 2008 presidential campaign. Zandi’s two analyses project how Clinton’s and Trump’s policies would affect jobs nationwide during a first term: A gain of 10.4 million jobs under Clinton, a loss of nearly 3.5 million jobs under Trump. The estimates gained headlines from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and CNN/Money. Critics said, among other things, that Zandi underestimates the value of tax cuts. But, back to the claim about Wisconsin jobs. Clinton’s campaign told us it arrived at the Wisconsin figures cited in the tweet by distributing Zandi’s estimated total gains and losses among states in proportion to their population. One can’t assume that Clinton’s or Trump’s policies would have such an evenly-distributed impact on each state; indeed, for years, Wisconsin’s job growth has lagged the nation’s. But Zandi and economist Alan Cole of the free market-oriented Tax Foundation, which PolitiFact also quotes often, told us the extrapolation is reasonable. Zandi added that if he did a state-by-state breakdown, he would expect the numbers for Wisconsin to be roughly what Clinton stated. To counter Clinton’s claim, Trump’s campaign pointed us to the Tax Foundation’s January 2016 analysis of Clinton’s tax plans, which projects that nationally there would be 311,000 fewer jobs over 10 years than would be expected under current law. Meanwhile, the foundation in a September 2015 analysis of Trump’s tax plans projected 5.3 million more jobs over the same period. Cole agreed with Zandi that Zandi’s analyses considered more factors -- for example, spending as well as taxes -- than the Tax Foundation did. Cox also called Zandi’s analyses an honest and serious effort, but said the Tax Foundation arrived at different conclusions because it took a different approach. It’s also important to note that both candidates have announced new proposals since the various estimates were made, though Zandi said he doesn’t believe they would change his estimates significantly. Our rating Clinton says she "would bring 186,740 new jobs to Wisconsin" and "Donald Trump would cost Wisconsin 61,050 jobs." The numbers are derived from analyses of Clinton and Trump policy proposals done by a respected economist from Moody Analytics who has supported both Democrats and Republicans. But the numbers are estimates, not certainties. Moreover, estimates done by the Tax Foundation using a different methodology project job gains under Trump but job losses under Clinton. For a statement that is partially accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Half True.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-09-16T10:30:00	2016-08-22	['Wisconsin', 'Donald_Trump']

pomt-08802	"We have over 700,000 illegal immigrants in the state. They're costing us billions of dollars and they're taking legal residents' jobs."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/18/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-illegal-immigrants-taking-jobs/	In Florida's Republican gubernatorial primary, counting the sins of illegal immigrants has become standard code for, "Look, I am a conservative!" "If you came here seeking a job, alone, and you're here illegally as many are, I think you should be sent back home," Bill McCollum declared during a debate hosted in Miami by Univision, the Spanish-language broadcast channel, on Aug. 2, 2010. Rival Rick Scott offered a similar solution. Illegal immigrants, he said, "Need to go home and come back through a legal process." Scott also explained why he thinks illegal immigrants need to be shown the door. "We have over 700,000 illegal immigrants in the state. They're costing us billions of dollars, and they're taking legal residents' jobs," he said. Both candidates support Arizona's anti-illegal immigration law, the most controversial part of which is now on hold because of a court ruling. But Scott has made closing the door on illegal immigration an almost unbending campaign goal. In fact, his early anti-illegal immigrant television advertisements helped build his support base. Given Scott's focus on illegal immigration, we decided his numbers need a walk through The Truth-O-Meter. We separated his claim into three parts: "We have over 700,000 illegal immigrants in our state." The Department of Homeland Security put Florida's illegal immigrant population at 720,000 in 2009. The Federation for American Immigration Reform, an anti-illegal immigrant group, came up with 810,000 illegal immigrants in 2007. The Pew Hispanic Center estimated the population was more than a million strong in a 2009 report. The numbers vary because producing an exact count of an illegal population is impossible. Still, each of these figures are "over 700,000." Scott's low-end number earns him a True here. "They're costing us billions of dollars." Scott's campaign didn't tell us what source they used, but PolitiFact has already looked at how much illegal immigrants are costing the state of Florida. We know that the Federation for American Immigration Reform estimates the state spends $3.8 billion on education, health and incarceration for illegal immigrants. We determined that the widely quoted study assumed all foreign born inmates and most school children enrolled in English learning classes were illegal immigrants. But Florida does not keep track of what services it provides to illegal immigrants. In short, no one knows what Florida spends on illegal immigrants, so we can't rule on this one yet, though we're still searching for facts. "They're taking legal residents' jobs." Now this is the complicated part of Scott's statement. Again, his campaign offers no support for the claim. Let's dig in anyway. Unauthorized immigrants comprised 8.2 percent of Florida’s workforce, or 750,000 workers, in 2008, according to the Pew Hispanic Center report. So, it is clear that undocumented workers are able to secure illegal employment once they reach the United States. But are these jobs taken from legal residents? Yes, in some part. Almost all studies, whether by liberal, conservative or business groups, conclude that immigrants take jobs that could benefit the country's least educated. "Illegal immigration disproportionately and adversely affects the economic well-being of the most vulnerable and needy segment of the nation’s labor force: its low-skilled workers," Vernon Briggs, an emeritus professor of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University, concluded in a March 2010 paper. He cited U.S. Department of Labor figures, which put the unemployment rate for people over the age of 25 without a high school diploma in its July 2010 report at 15 percent, the highest rate for any educational group of the labor force. Lorraine Schmall, a law professor at Northern Illinois University College of Law, observed that illegal immigrants primarily work in construction and agriculture fields in a 2008 report titled, "Worksite Enforcement of U.S. Immigration Laws." It reads, "In March 2006, a little over 24 percent of the construction workforce was Hispanic, compared to approximately 6 percent in 1980." Those figures apply to all Hispanics, regardless of immigration status. But it is worth noting because 17 percent of construction workers were undocumented in 2008, an increase from 10 percent in 2003, according to the Pew Hispanic Center report. The federal Department of Labor has not studied the effect of illegal immigration on the labor market, according to spokesman Michael Wald. Some reports found illegal immigrants reduced wages for native low-skilled workers. The centrist Council on Foreign Relations found in a 2007 study on illegal immigration that, "over the 1980 to 2000 period, wages of native workers without a high school degree fell by 9 percent as a result of immigration." In a 2005 report, Harvard economist George Borjas estimated illegal immigrants who arrived from 1980 to 2000 had reduced the wages of low-skilled workers in the United States by 8.2 percent. Other studies, however, argue that any wage impact is minimal. In a 2010 report, the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank, found U.S. born workers with less than a high school education saw a relative 0.3 percent increase in wages, or $1.58 per week. The research looked at the estimated effect of immigration from 1994 to 2007. Still, there is more to this story. Only a handful of legal residents are competing for jobs against illegal immigrants, according to many economists. The Council on Foreign Relations study found low-skilled legal U.S. workers are increasingly hard to find. "Between 1960 and 2000, the share of working-age native-born U.S. residents with less than twelve years of schooling fell from 50 percent to 12 percent," concluded the study. "In Mexico, as of 2000, 74 percent of working-age residents had less than twelve years of education." The 2009 Pew Hispanic Center report found undocumented workers were overrepresented in construction, hospitality and service jobs, all of which tend to offer low wages for hard work, or employment unattractive to native residents, economists said. "Most economic research concludes that immigrants and natives work in different jobs," said Madeline Zavodny, an economist with Agnes Scott College. "Immigration therefore has relatively little direct effect on natives." Schmall said that a survey of raids on employment places that hire illegal immigrants, such as construction sites and manufacturing plants, illustrated that employers want to hire illegal immigrants specifically because they have fewer legal rights and are willing to work in horrible conditions. But once the illegal immigrants demanded fair pay, they were shown the door, she said. "Many cases at the National Labor Relations Board reflect that workers without documentation are being hired and then fired after they attempt to organize a union," said Schmall, who reviewed 42 cases involving worksite enforcement of immigration laws reported to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2008. Many economists and labor experts also argue that illegal immigrants ultimately do more good than harm, even if they reduce some native workers' employment or earnings. "There are enough studies and analysis that lead to something of consensus among economists that illegal workers contribute to economic growth, creating as much jobs as they occupy," said Orly Lobel, a University of San Diego law professor. "The net result is probably more jobs and better jobs for others." For example, the Council on Foreign Relations concluded in its 2007 study that illegal immigrants increase the supply of labor to perishable fruits and vegetables, meaning "each acre of land under cultivation generates more output. Similarly, an expansion in the number of manufacturing workers allows the existing industrial base to produce more goods. As a result, "U.S. cities with larger inflows of low-skilled immigrants experienced larger reductions in prices for housekeeping, gardening, child care, dry cleaning, and other labor-intensive, locally traded services." The Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group, analyzed economic data pertaining to legal and illegal immigration in the 25 largest metropolitan areas in a December 2009 report and concluded, "Immigration and economic growth go hand in hand. That’s easily understandable: Economic growth and labor force growth are closely connected, and immigrants are likely to move to areas where there are jobs, and not to areas where there are not." The George W. Bush White House also recognized the advantages of immigration. "Summing up the economic benefits and costs of immigration shows that over time, the benefits of immigration exceed the costs," concluded a 2005 presidential economic report that looked at the impact of both illegal and legal immigration. Along the same lines, a study published by Americans for Immigration Reform determined Florida would lose $43.9 billion in economic activity, $19.5 billion in gross state product, and approximately 262,436 jobs if all unauthorized immigrants were removed from Florida. The Houston group claims it is founded by "Americans concerned with the destructive measures being taken and considered regarding immigration and its impact on the business community, employees and consumers." Citing some of these same reports, PolitiFact Texas ruled a statement that sought to link unemployment reports to illegal immigration as False. Finally, FactCheck.org, an another independent fact-checking site, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, ruled in May 2010 that illegal immigrants do not hurt the labor market. They also looked at multiple economic reports to reach that conclusion. In sum, studies show illegal immigrants do take jobs from some Americans. But they also help create more jobs and stimulate the economy by working for low wages. We rate this part of Scott's claim Half True. To review, here's what we came up with: Scott is right on the 700,000 number, and he's not saying where his cost figures come from. On the question of taking jobs from legal residents, he's leaving out important details on the declining number of low-skill, low-wage residents affected and the overall economic benefits that result. Scott's anti-illegal immigrant rhetoric might sound swell to his conservative base, but The Truth-O-Meter isn't so easily persuaded. We give this claim a Half True.

pomt-12755	Inner-city students "fall back and don’t succeed, whereas if there was a less intensive track, they would."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/feb/27/john-eichelberger/checking-rural-pa-republicans-claim-city-students-/	Would students from distressed urban neighborhoods be better off if their instruction was "less intensive"? A Republican Pennsylvania senator out of Blair County sparked controversy for suggesting as much at a town hall in West Pennsboro last week. As reported in the Carlisle Sentinel, Sen. John Eichelberger criticized state education programming that directs students of color toward college rather than vocational courses as a matter of ill-used funding. "They’re pushing them toward college and they’re dropping out," Eichelberger, chair of Senate Education Committee, said. "They fall back and don’t succeed, whereas if there was a less intensive track, they would." Pa. Sen. Vincent Hughes, D-Philadelphia, called Eichelberger’s remarks "racist." Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa, D-Allegheny, told Philly.com the commentary was "offensive" and that he had contacted Majority Leader Jake Corman, R-Centre, to discuss it because the Democratic caucus members found it alarming. Eichelberger, amid blowback, has insisted that his words were taken out of context. He’s even accused the Sentinel of publishing fake news. But Zack Hoopes, the Sentinel business editor who captured the quotes, told PolitiFact Pennsylvania he stands by the article’s accuracy. Despite of the severity of Eichelberger’s accusation, the senator doesn’t challenge that he actually said this. Eichelberger’s office gave PolitiFact Pennsylvania the following statement yesterday: "He’s never denied saying that, but the comment was taken out of a larger conversation on education and how we prepare our students for the future. The larger context is lost in the story. What has been reported was a brief snippet of an elaborate conversation with local residents. The observations were made about options in our education system during an hour-and-a-half of discussion. It wasn’t perfectly worded, but it is something that needs to be discussed, so instead of misplaced outrage, the Senator would prefer to see an open and honest conversation." So, on with the fact-check! Eichelberger’s office shared no evidence to substantiate his claim. PolitiFact Pennsylvania wasn’t able to find studies that make similar arguments in our research, that a "less intensive" track would be lead to more success for "inner city" students, and the academics we spoke with weren’t familiar with papers that could back that up either. Julia C. Duncheon, an expert on college readiness for urban students based at the University of Texas at El Paso said that is was "not true" that lower-income students needed "less intensive" instruction. In fact, studies show the opposite: "Those who have taken the more rigorous classes are more likely to persist in college," she said. The Institute for Higher Education Policy emphasizes the importance of "a rigorous, college-ready curriculum, starting in middle school," calling this "crucial." Education researchers regularly identify that low-income students in cities often lack access to bona fide college preparatory coursework. In an email, pointing to a 2009 Center for American Progress report that espouses high standards in college prep curricula, Duncheon noted that certain demographics see particular gains. "While rigorous academic preparation is important for all students, it is especially important for African American and Latina/o students," wrote Duncheon. "Again, we see equity gaps decrease among college students who have completed a rigorous academic course load in high school." Duncheon found Eichelberger’s recommending vocational tracks problematic. "We tend to see low-income students funneled into those," said Duncheon. As inadequate access to high-level classes persists in underserved neighborhoods, poor students of color are underrepresented in these courses. "The notion that they pursue vocational education is troubling because we’re already dealing with problems of racial segregation with vocational education." Duncheon was careful not to discourage vocational training, saying that students need "a variety of pathways." "There are too many students getting less intensive education anyway," said Ivory Toldson, editor of the Journal of Negro Education and a professor at Howard University. In 2012, Toldson co-authored the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation report "Challenge the Status Quo: Academic Success among School-age African American Males." They had several recommendations for better preparing black boys: many pushed fostering supportive, bias-free environments in school and at home, but they also recommended "offer[ing] a curriculum that, at a minimum, meets the admissions requirements for the most competitive public university of your state." "What I found in my analysis was that black and Latino students in urban districts like Philadelphia were the least likely to take high-level math and science courses which limited their opportunities," said Toldson. "The short of it is: I think what the senator is proposing is actually the opposite of what they need." Toldson argued that modern technical instruction not only could bear benefits for some students, but relies on a comprehension of math and science that corresponds to the digital age. "We don’t want to give kids the outdated notion that to be an auto mechanic you don’t need math," he said. "That may have been true in the ’50s and ’60s, but that’s not true today." Duncheon didn’t want to dismiss that dropouts are a persistent problem for low-income students. But, she said, "there’s a lot of complexity around why students drop out. There’s no clear cut reason why they do, there’s a lot of factors." Certain trends that researchers like Duncheon have observed pertain to financial restraints and first-generation college students. A 2012 American Institutes for Research report noted that only 10 percent of college dropouts left due to academic struggles. Half of their respondents cited something more hazy, "personal reasons." "Academics are definitely a piece of it, but it’s not the full story," she said. Eichelberger declined repeated requests for interview, but his office did share this statement as well: "Each child has different skills that may be best suited for college or vocational training. This has been recognized by educational experts in our state and around the nation. The best option for kids should be available for all students, whether in Carlisle or Philadelphia or anywhere else in the Commonwealth. "Vocational training is not an offensive term and should not be treated as such. Vocational education is a path for training and education that leads to higher incomes and family-supporting jobs. For many, it is their stepping stone for success. "We cannot continue to protect a system that is failing children. If our students are not being provided with that guidance and options in a significant way, then we need to take a closer look at that to ensure that every student deserves the chance to succeed no matter their skin color or economic situation." Our Ruling Eichelberger said, Inner-city students "fall back and don’t succeed, whereas if there was a less intensive track, they would." While there are experts who support offering vocational education to low-income students, we were not able to find any research that backs Eichelberger’s comment. To the contrary, studies show that low-income students with experience in accelerated courses fare better in college. We rate this statement False.

pomt-12026	Says U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin "wants to use a government jet that costs $25,000 per hour for his honeymoon."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/sep/18/mark-pocan/did-us-treasury-secretary-steve-mnuchin-want-25000/	U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan frequently criticizes the administration of Republican President Donald Trump. On Sept. 13, 2017, the Madison-area Democrat got a little more personal, tweeting this about Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin: Mnuchin wants to use a gov't jet that costs $25k/hour for his honeymoon. And he's in charge of tax reform for the middle class? #OutOfTouch What’s this all about? Revelations in the news Mnuchin is a former longtime banker, Goldman Sachs executive and a Hollywood producer ("The Lego Batman Movie" and others). When tapped for Trump’s Cabinet in late 2016, he was worth $300 million, according to Forbes. As treasury secretary, Mnuchin advises Trump on economic and financial issues. In June 2017, with Vice President Mike Pence officiating, he married Scottish actress Louise Linton. Their honeymoon was in August 2017, according to news reports. Pocan’s tweet was sent the same day ABC News broke a story that was picked up by the Washington Post, USA Today and many other national media. The story said: Mnuchin requested, in writing, a U.S. Air Force jet to take him and his actress-model wife Louise Linton on their honeymoon to Scotland, France and Italy. The jet could cost $25,000 per hour to operate, according to an Air Force spokesman. A Treasury Department spokesman said Mnuchin made the request out of concern for maintaining a secure method of communication, but the secretary's office decided (before ABC’s story) that the use of military aircraft was unnecessary after it became apparent that other methods for secure communication were available. So, based on the news report, Mnuchin’s request isn’t current, as Pocan’s tweet suggests, and the cost isn’t necessarily $25,000 per hour. But the thrust of the claim is correct: Mnuchin requested a military jet for his honeymoon. Mnuchin’s response When we asked the Treasury Department about Pocan’s claim, we were referred to a video clip of an interview Mnuchin did with Politico the day after the ABC News story aired. Asked about the matter, he said: "I probably spend over 50 percent of my time on national security issues ….This had nothing to do with convenience, this was purely about national security." "The government has never paid for any of my personal travel." "My staff wanted to make sure that I constantly had access to secure communication" and the use of a jet for his honeymoon "was one of the things we explored. So, they put in a request to consider the use of an aircraft ... and ultimately we withdrew the request. We found a way of dealing with other secure communication." Asked whether the jet was a staff request, not his personal request, Mnuchin said: "Again, I discussed with the staff a bunch of alternatives … one of the things they suggested, I agreed that they would look into it, OK? We looked into other things, as well. When we found alternative uses, we withdrew the request." So, Mnuchin doesn’t deny requesting the jet, though he suggests it was out of concern for national security. A final note: As of Sept. 14, 2017, the day after the ABC story, the Treasury Department’s inspector general’s office was looking at all requests for, and use of, government aircraft by Mnuchin, that office told reporters. The inquiry was launched after Mnuchin and his wife took a trip to Kentucky just ahead of the August 2017 solar eclipse. Mnuchin held an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and visited Fort Knox, where he and Linton viewed the eclipse near the path of totality, the Los Angeles Times reported. Treasury officials defended that visit as official government travel and said Mnuchin would reimburse the government for bringing his wife along. Our rating Pocan says Mnuchin "wants to use a government jet that costs $25,000 per hour for his honeymoon."

pomt-08150	Says more than $3.5 billion in state revenue that is supposed to be dedicated to basic needs and functions is being diverted to "make the books look balanced."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/dec/04/kirk-watson/kirk-watson-says-more-35-billion-intended-special-/	State Sen. Kirk Watson says he's going to fight budgetary gambits when lawmakers confront an expected shortfall in state budget revenue in the legislative session starting in January. In a Nov. 15 speech outlining his self-titled honesty agenda, the Austin Democrat names among his concerns a tendency by past legislatures to balance the budget by dipping into state income that's supposed to fund specific needs and functions. The result, Watson said, has "diverted billions of dollars that had been promised to roads, parks, hospitals, clean air, utility bill relief, and other necessities – using it instead as a special piggy bank to make the books look balanced. In fact, over $3.5 billion of what people pay to support specific, basic needs and government functions is (currently) being diverted in this way. That's a lot of promises made and then broken. And this practice has grown -- more than doubled -- over the past decade." Watson mentioned the budget-balancing strategy again in an interview excerpted in the Nov. 28 Austin American-Statesman and in a Nov. 30 talk at the University of Texas where he listed three of the affected funds, saying: "Folks, I could go on (listing them) all day." The lege gets blamed for lots of things; has it really been taking funds dedicated to necessities to make the books "look balanced?" History: The Texas Constitution forbids the state from running in the red. Lawmakers who write each two-year budget must satisfy the state comptroller that budgeted expenditures won't exceed what the state gathers in revenue. That's what it means to balance the budget. Watson spokesman Steve Scheibal responded to our request for back-up evidence by sharing a spreadsheet prepared by the state comptroller's office. According to the spreadsheet, since the 1993 session, lawmakers have balanced budgets by tapping special accounts that collect money for specific purposes. Money taken from such accounts increased steadily through eight of the last nine budget periods, reaching more than $3.7 billion for fiscal 2010-11, which runs through August. All told, money spent in this fashion totals $18 billion. So, Watson's $3.5 billion-plus number sticks. According to the spreadsheet, more than 25 different accounts took hits from the 2009 Legislature. A category broadly termed "All Other GR Dedicated Certification Accounts" accounted for the largest single amount, $840 million. Next highest: nearly $671 million from the System Benefit Fund, which consists of proceeds from a tax on some utility bills intended to help low-income residents pay utility bills; $515 million from the Emissions Reduction Plan, which funds grants in targeted counties to address polluting heavy vehicles and equipment; and $331 million from an account called Designated Trauma Facility and EMS, which helps hospitals recover costs of uncompensated trauma care. An August 2009 news article in The Houston Chronicle quotes Dale Craymer, a veteran budget watcher who's president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, saying of such transfers: "It's kind of like having your (household) budget laid out and spending part of your food money on entertainment, or vice versa." Finally, we turned to the tail of Watson's statement--that shifting money from such funds make the books "look balanced" as opposed to actually balancing the budget. For expert perspective, we contacted consultant Billy Hamilton of Austin. He was the deputy comptroller when then-State Comptroller John Sharp recommended that the 1991 Legislature -- then facing a $4 billion-plus revenue shortfall -- consolidate more than 300 state funds. That change laid the groundwork for lawmakers to use accumulated cash balances to help balance future budgets. The comptroller's July 1991 Texas Performance Review report, Breaking the Mold, anticipated criticism of the funds' consolidation as an "accounting trick." It says: "The truth of the matter is that under the state's constitutionally mandated cash-basis budgeting system, there is no trickery involved. Bond rating agencies, for example, see funds consolidation as a component of prudent fiscal management; the one-time revenue gain from such consolidation is a valid and immediate benefit of improving the structure of fiscal management." As it turned out, the "one-time" revenue gain gave lawmakers a budget-balancing tool they have wielded ever since. In an interview, Hamilton said subsequent legislatures used it to balance budgets while avoiding major tax changes, save a 2006 overhaul of the state's largest business tax and a hike in cigarette taxes. Per Watson's statement, Hamilton said, "As a matter of sound public policy, if you agree that the Legislature in the past has set up these dedicated accounts to accomplish certain public policy goals, they're certainly not being accomplished because the money is being effectively used for other purposes." Then again, Hamilton said, "just because (lawmakers) set up a fund, that doesn't mean there's an inherent requirement that they spend the money (on that purpose); the Legislature has the power to appropriate" most state funds as desired. Strolling into wonk territory, we also interviewed Craymer, who said the legislative practice of tapping special-purpose accounts doesn't mean the accounts won't someday recover money spent on other budget items. For instance, future legislatures could vote to replenish the funds from other sources and/or quit draining their dollars. Craymer continued: Lawmakers "are not spending the dedicated revenue, they're spending cash balances the revenue creates." Say what? "It's a distinction only an accountant could appreciate." Separately, R.J. DeSilva, spokesman for the comptroller's office, agreed that dollars made available from the special-purpose accounts actually helped balance the 2010-11 budget, rather than just making the books look balanced. Maybe so, Watson acknowledged, but conversely, if lawmakers spent the dollars taken from a so-called dedicated account "on its intended purpose, then they couldn't make the books look balanced because they wouldn't be" -- meaning funding would fall short somewhere else in the budget. And Watson reminded that once money from such accounts is spent on other items, the dollars aren't available to pay for the needs they were originally intended to support. Watson also noted that on May 27, 2009, Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told his Senate colleagues that the Legislature was "unable to write an appropriations bill that would serve the needs of this state without relying to a fairly significant extent on surplus balances in our general-revenue dedicated funds." Ogden also said that a review of the practice would belong in a comprehensive assessment of the state's finances. "At the end of the story," Ogden said, "the obvious answer is a tax overhaul in the state of Texas. We really have a pretty rickety system right now." Bottom line: Watson accurately recaps the amount of money allocated from specific-purpose accounts for the 2010-11 state budget. But the shifting of funds doesn't just look like a book-balancing; it's for real. We rate Watson's statement Mostly True.	None	Kirk Watson	None	None	None	2010-12-04T06:00:00	2010-11-15	['None']

pomt-07570	Says Jeff Stone = Scott Walker.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/30/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-chris-abele-s/	A doppelganger is a ghostly double of a living person. In German it means "double walker." In the case of a new TV ad from Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Abele, it would be "double Scott Walker." Naturally, state Rep. Jeff Stone -- Abele’s opponent in the April 5 election -- is the alleged double. In a new TV ad with B-movie special effects, Abele presents Stone and the new Republican governor as scary, bleached-out phantoms in ideological lockstep on the "unfair" state budget repair law. Stone, the ad claims, will copy a Walker agenda that has "mismanaged" Milwaukee County government. "I thought he was Scott Walker’s twin," a man identified as David Crowley of Milwaukee County says into the camera. Later, he adds: "Jeff Stone is Scott Walker." Last fall in the governor’s race, we looked at the Republican primary ad Scott Walker used to equate opponent Mark Neumann with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We labeled Walker’s claim -- "Mark Neumann = Nancy Pelosi," for shorthand -- and found it False. Here, Abele’s ad essentially equates Stone with Walker. So: Does Stone = Walker? Of course, depending on where a voter sits, the degree of similarity could be considered a good thing or a bad thing. But it’s worth evaluating, because both sides have made Stone’s ties to Walker a theme -- Stone ran as Walker’s logical successor for most of the race, and Abele is now pointing that out in a negative sense. We asked the Abele campaign to back up the claim. They provided an analysis of voting records and pointed us to public statements and other evidence. "They are overwhelmingly similar, and Jeff would represent a continuation of Scott Walker’s approach to governing," said Brandon Lorenz, Abele’s spokesman. We’ll look at Walker and Stones’ statements about each other, as well as their voting histories, common causes, priorities, styles and backgrounds. Walker and Stone have been linked closely because both are conservative Republicans from suburban Milwaukee communities who scored rare victories to succeed Democrats in office. They served in the Legislature together for about four years -- even carpooling together -- with Walker taking the higher profile. Walker is seven years younger, at 43, but they got into elected politics within a year of each other. Stone started locally, as a Greenfield city alderman. Walker, from Wauwatosa, won a state Assembly seat. Both considered the Milwaukee County exec’s job in 2002 after a pension scandal forced out F. Thomas Ament; only Walker jumped in. Stone helped Walker get elected. Now Stone wants to take over for Walker, and the governor says Stone -- whom he has endorsed and raised campaign money for -- would be a crucial local ally in reducing spending. Stone and Walker’s statements: Walker touted Stone in February 2010 as a worthy successor, saying he was "interested in pursuing some of the same reforms and ideas" that Walker has backed. That confirmed the impression at the Courthouse, dating back years, that Stone was the GOP’s candidate in waiting. Stone has consistently praised Walker. It should be noted though that from the start of his campaign he has said that his small-business experience would make him more focused on job creation than Walker, who Stone said was focused primarily on reforming county government after the pension scandal. Are they close ideologically and by temperament? Stone said in March 2011 that he and Walker share "similar aspirations" and "a similarity in how we go about things. He urged a conservative audience: "Vote for the person who’s going to move Milwaukee County forward along the lines of what Scott Walker has." Stone’s pre-primary campaign literature implored voters to back him to preserve gains being made during Walker’s tenure. At times since Walker’s budget attracted massive protests in Madison this winter, Stone cautiously has tried to separate himself. He has said he will be less confrontational. "I voted for the budget, but I'm not Scott Walker," said Stone. "I'm Jeff Stone. I have a very different way of managing and doing business." Stone voted for Walker’s controversial budget-repair law, but later signaled he would not have tried to sharply curtail union bargaining rights if it had been up to him -- a position that earned him a Half Flip. He voted for the business tax cuts Walker pushed in January’s special session. Common Assembly voting history: Stone and Walker overlapped in the Assembly from 1998 to 2002, when Walker was elected county executive. Stone has operated closer to power during his legislative career than did Walker (1993-2002). Stone served on the Legislature’s budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. Walker made his mark mostly on law enforcement issues. Research by Abele’s camp on more than 1,400 common votes shows Stone and Walker agreed 96 percent of the time. Stone doesn’t dispute that number. There’s a limit, though, to how much insight comes from examining a mass of votes by two members of the same party, because most lawmakers vote the party line most of the time, and so many votes are minor. So we looked at some ratings by a sampling of special interest groups on key legislation. The verdict: Stone and Walker have remarkably similar profiles, though not identical ones. Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce rated both as 100 percent right on the group’s agenda from 1999-2002; the lowest-scoring Republicans are in the high 70s or mid 80s. Groups opposed to abortion view Walker and Stone as identical in their votes. The Wisconsin AFL-CIO, a major labor organization, rates both low, but Walker’s lifetime rating of 30 percent is higher than Stone’s 18 percent. The Wisconsin League of Conservation Voters saw little difference between the two in 2001-02. Top priorities: On the issues, Stone has adopted Walker’s signature anti-tax stance and similarly endorses smaller government. Stone and Walker jointly have proposed various tax cuts over the years. Like Walker, Stone has long been an active supporter of a photo ID requirement for voting. The most notable difference: public transit. Walker has been cool to expanding public transit for years, while Stone has made a regional transportation approach his signature issue. "He’s been a great transit advocate for a decade," Kerry Thomas, interim executive director of Transit Now, a southeastern Wisconsin advocacy group, said of Stone. There are limits to Stone’s support of new transportation options; he has spurned light rail, and he agreed with Walker’s stance against federal help for a high-speed train. But Stone was a leading force behind creation of the Regional Transit Authority focused on commuter rail, and he has backed buses, and some -- but by no means all -- proposals for new funding options for public transit. Walker has taken a much tougher line against transit and new taxes or fees to pay for it. Stone is pledging an end to bus cuts seen under Walker and Ament. Stone, like Walker, has backed freeway expansion. Experience: Stone emphatically says he is his own person and is going to "do it my way." We asked him for examples of where he has broken with Walker -- and how his voting record compares. He offered no criticism of Walker and pointed to no particular votes where they parted. But he notes correctly that he’s made a priority of regional transit, in contrast to Walker. Their biggest difference, Stone said, is "vastly different life experiences and what we’ve done in our career." Stone has run a small printing company, while Walker worked briefly in the private sector before winning election. He suggests that he will be more pragmatic and collegial than Walker. "I have a very different way of managing and doing business that Scott Walker," he said at a candidate forum. Stone has made a point of saying he will try to get along with the County Board and work with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. Let’s review. Abele’s strongest evidence comes from Stone himself, who has aligned himself closely with Walker’s agenda and politics. Their voting histories are very similar, and they win very similar ratings from interest groups. They are not indistinguishable, though: The transit issue illustrates Stone’s willingness to step out from Republican orthodoxy and work behind the scenes in a bipartisan fashion -- neither of which are Walker trademarks. Stone’s business experience is a notable biographical difference. In the end, Abele’s equation (Stone = Walker) scores out as Mostly True.

pomt-01750	Says Rick Scott "raised property taxes."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/aug/01/charlie-crist/rick-scott-raised-property-taxes-charlie-crist-say/	Sorting through this year’s gubernatorial campaign attacks has long since become taxing -- namely, who raised taxes and how much they’ve cost voters. The latest charge from Democratic challenger Charlie Crist comes from a campaign ad released July 31, 2014. In it, he attacked Republican incumbent Gov. Rick Scott’s budget decisions. "Rick Scott raised property taxes," the ad said. A narrator doubles down on the claim, saying Scott raised "your" property taxes. Scott came into office promising to cut property taxes, so PolitiFact Florida thought this claim deserved an audit. Did Rick Scott raise Florida’s property taxes? We’ll budget some time to sort this one out. Taxes for schools Crist’s campaign said the claim came from a May 5, 2014, story in the Tampa Tribune detailing a projected increase in the property taxes municipalities contribute to public schools. This portion of your property tax bill, called the Required Local Effort, has been a Scott target since his 2010 campaign, when he promised to cut the rate first by one and later by two mills over seven years (we rated both Promise Broken). Both the Legislature and the governor have a say in the millage rate, which is used to calculate taxes on the assessed value of a property (one mill is equal to $1 in taxes per $1,000 in value). When Scott took office, the rate was 5.38 mills, which then went up to 5.446 in 2011, but was set at 5.18 in 2013. For 2014, Scott and the Legislature didn’t move the rate either up or down, leaving it at 5.18. Because of the way the rate is calculated, the state Department of Education in July adjusted the rate down to 5.08 mills. That’s important to note, because that means this year’s rate is actually lower than the year before. With a steady increase in property values across the state, the current rate will be bringing in more tax money than before, despite no action from the governor or lawmakers. "If Charlie Crist is accusing us of raising property tax rates, that’s just not true," Scott campaign spokesperson Matt Moon told PolitiFact Florida. Instead, Crist is focusing on the higher tax revenue. The latest Florida Education Finance Program calculations from the Department of Education estimate collections for the Required Local Effort would increase by about $370 million in an $18.9 billion budget. Critics (including the Crist campaign) have equated that rise in collections with a tax increase. Crist campaign spokesman Kevin Cate told PolitiFact Florida "inaction is also an action. And in this case, Rick Scott’s actions raised taxes." If that’s the case, the same logic could apply to Crist. The campaign doesn’t mention that Crist also oversaw changes in both the tax rate and collections from the Required Local Effort. We checked the rates and collections going back to before former Gov. Crist took office in 2007 and found that Crist also saw ups and downs among both. Fiscal year budget RLE millage tax rate Governor RLE tax collections 2006-07 5.01 Jeb Bush $7.3 billion 2007-08 4.84 Crist $7.9 billion 2008-09 5.136 Crist $8.24 billion 2009-10 5.288 Crist $7.8 billion 2010-11 5.38 Crist $7.19 billion 2011-12 5.446 Scott $6.9 billion 2012-13 5.295 Scott $6.7 billion 2013-14 5.18 Scott $6.8 billion 2014-15 5.08 Scott $7.17 billion Most notable is 2007, Crist’s first year, when the budget lowered the tax rate. But because of increasing taxable values just before the Great Recession, tax collections still went up. In subsequent years, Crist-era budgets kept raising the tax rate but saw falling collections by the end of his term. The current rate and projected collections under Scott are both less than they were during Crist’s last approved budget. Our ruling Crist said, "Rick Scott raised property taxes." As Florida homeowners know, the taxes they pay are based on both tax rates and what the current property values are. What Crist means is that because taxable values are rising, collections from school property taxes are going up, even though the tax rate for the Required Local Effort is not going up. Scott did sign a budget his first year that briefly raised those rates, but collections dropped anyway -- a phenomenon that happened to Crist, as well. Even as collections are projected to increase, both the rates and tax revenue are now less than when Scott took office. Collections are increasing because property values are going up after a historic recession and loss of real estate values. Given all these factors, we rate Crist’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-10642	Barack Obama "wants the government to take over health care, spend hundreds of billions of dollars of new money for health insurance for everyone."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/06/mitt-romney/obama-plan-not-a-takeover/	In a question at a New Hampshire debate, the Republican candidates were asked how they would campaign against Barack Obama if he wins the Democratic nomination. Mitt Romney's first response was to argue that Obama "wants the government to take over health care, spend hundreds of billions of dollars of new money for health insurance for everyone." Problem is, Obama's plan keeps the free-market health care system intact, particularly employer-based insurance. His plan expands existing programs for the uninsured by increaseing eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. His plan also creates pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. And it outlines several strategies aimed at reining in costs for everyone, such as streamlining medical record-keeping and emphasizing preventative care. Romney is also off when he says that Obama wants to spend hundreds of billions of dollars. The Obama campaign has said that Obama believes the cost will be less than $100-billion — between $50-billion and $65-billion. Romney is correct when he says Obama wants to cover everyone; Obama has said that is his goal. But Obama has no mandate requiring that adults buy health insurance. How many people would remain uninsured has become a hot issue in the Democratic primary. (See our coverage of this issue here . ) At best, Romney is wrong on two out of three points in his attack on the Obama health plan. It's not a government takeover and the purported cost is less than what Romney stated. For these reasons, we rate Romney's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

"Court orders Obama to pay $400 million in restitution," reads the headline on Daily World Update, a blog site claiming to produce fictitious material and conservative satire. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The article cites the nonexistent West Texas Federal Appeals Court as ordering Obama to repay the $400 million. While there is a federal court serving the Western district of Texas, it is not an appeals court, and there is no official court that matches the name of the one mentioned in the story. The judges named in the fake news article are also made up. They listed Gary Jones, Amanda Perry and Kris Weinshenker as the primary judges who handled the case. When searching for them, we found no results of anyone by these names who serve in legal or judicial practices. The story attributed quotes to the fake judges accusing Obama of having done incomparable economic damage to the United States and evaluating the outcome of the restitution fees. The story claims the $400 million fees come from money that was "lost" in an illegal transaction with Iranian hard-liners. We suspect the reference comes from a $400 million payment made to Iran in 2016 for that amount which was part of a $1.7 billion settlement. PolitiFact fact-checked claims that this payment was a "ransom" deal when Iran released five American prisoners back to the United States on the same day that the payment was transferred by cash to Iran. The initial $400 million has been owed to Iran since 1979 when Iran purchased American fighter jets which the U.S. didn’t deliver following the Islamic Revolution. The payment is actually part of a $1.7 billion payment, in which an additional $1.3 billion serves as interest. Our ruling A fake news article claimed that a court ordered Obama to pay the American public $400 million in repayment fees due to an illegal transaction with Iran. The court and its judges were fictitious and the payment was a reference to a legitimate transaction given to Iran that the United States owed in 2016. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-04009	Says his budget provides "the highest state funding level in history" for education.	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/feb/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-his-budget-proposal-has-highest-st/	Gov. Rick Scott trumpeted his "Florida Families First" budget as providing record-breaking money for schools, including $2,500 raises for teachers. "This total includes $10.7 billion in state funding for Florida K-12 schools, the highest state funding level in history," Scott said in a Jan. 31, 2013, news conference about his 2013-14 budget recommendations. The crowd of teachers and university presidents huddled around Scott applauded his comment. We thought it merited another look. Overall education spending vs. state spending Scott was very careful to specify state funding for education would be higher than ever in his proposed budget. But schools are funded by more sources than the state. The complex school-funding formula includes local taxes and, in recent years, federal stimulus dollars, too. Scott’s press team directed us to a breakdown of state and local school funding for the past 10 years. It does not include federal stimulus funding.The blue bar represents state funding, the green bar represents local funding, and the orange horizontal line at the top represents per-pupil funding. Looking at education spending this way excludes $1.78 billion in economic stimulus money Florida received to bolster its 2009-10 and 2010-11 budgets, so spending in those years should actually appear slightly closer to Scott’s new proposal. Let’s take a closer look at the education spending Scott proposed. He wants the state to spend $18.47 billion for education during the 2013-14 school year. Again, the state’s share of that would be about $10.7 billion. So if the Legislature passes a budget that precisely mirrors Scott’s education proposals, the state’s share of education spending would be its highest since 2007-08, when it was $9.71 billion. In terms of the state’s actual dollar investment, Scott is right that it would be the highest. However, total state and local education spending in Scott’s budget would be $280 million smaller than the 2007-08 budget signed by Gov. Charlie Crist. What’s in the $1.2 billion increase from last year’s education spending? About $480 million would go toward teacher raises and $300 million would go toward the unfunded liability of the state’s retirement system. There’s some debate as to whether the pension funding should be considered part of an education increase, but a couple experts told us it’s reasonable because past calculations of the state’s per-pupil funding have included the cost of teacher wages, part of which goes to the retirement system. Breaking it down per student Of course, there are other ways of looking at state education spending. One is to look at spending per student. As a whole, counting state and local funding, per-pupil funding under Scott’s new budget would be $6,799. That’s short of what it was before the economic recession, when per-pupil funding peaked in 2007-08 at $7,126. So back then, the state had fewer students and was providing more money for each. Now we have 85,000 more students, according to DOE numbers, but less money for each one. But if you only look at the state’s per-pupil level of $3,941 in Scott’s new budget, it does exceed funding levels for the past 10 years in terms of actual dollars. And inflation? We’ll close with a point about inflation. When adjusted for inflation, does Scott’s budget still stand up as the state’s biggest education investment? We used a Consumer Price Index calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to compare Scott’s proposal with state spending on education for the past 10 years. (BLS has not released CPI data for January 2013, so the comparisons use 2012 inflation rates.) The takeaway is that state spending on education, when adjusted for inflation, would not be significantly different than it was from 2004 to 2007. Still, even the Florida Education Association, the state teachers union that sued Scott over the 2011 merit pay plan, conceded the state has never invested more, and that it is reasonable to consider the proposed $300 million contribution to the state’s retirement system as part of the $1.2 billion increase for education. "Added money spent on public schools always helps grow our economy," said FEA President Andy Ford in a statement. "We look forward to the governor’s strong advocacy of this proposal." Our ruling Scott said his budget "includes $10.7 billion in state funding for Florida K-12 schools, the highest state funding level in history." Floridians hearing this statement might think that means education funding for Florida schools has never been higher. That's not the case. Actually, Scott is referring only to the state government's specific contribution to overall spending. Scott drums up the state share as an historic investment, and it is in terms of actual dollars. But there are also local and federal dollars that fund Florida schools. When you consider those, Scott's overall recommendation for education spending is still short of what Florida students received before the economic crash. It's about the same as it was under Gov. Jeb Bush when considering inflation. Scott’s claim is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details that would give a different impression. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13254	"Of course, there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/17/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-large-scale-voter-f/	Donald Trump tripled down on his baseless claim that the U.S. election system is rigged against him, capping a weekend of lashing out at the media for publishing "fabricated" allegations of sexual assault and at Alec Baldwin for impersonating Trump on Saturday Night Live. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans defended the Election Day process at an Oct. 15 rally, but Trump continued to blame the media for "pushing Crooked Hillary" and added that rigging is happening at "many polling places." "Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!" Trump tweeted the morning of Oct. 17. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The Trump campaign reiterated Trump’s stance that the cards are stacked against Trump, pointing to a column from The Hill's media reporter Joe Concha on how the media could influence voter perceptions of Trump. To be clear, this is not the same thing as a voter committing fraud. The Trump campaign also pointed us to a 2012 Pew Center study that estimated about 24 million, equal to one in every eight, voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are inaccurate. But as we have previously reported, no evidence of voter fraud was found — this is about record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray. The other piece of evidence offered by the Trump campaign is a 2014 study that says approximately 6.4 percent of noncitizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent in 2010. That study has been criticized by election experts for using an unreliable database of Internet respondents. And finally, the Trump campaign forwarded us reports of voting irregularities in swing states like Pennsylvania, Colorado and Virginia. But these reports were either of reported and prevented cases of fraud or isolated instances. They do not amount to rampant, widespread fraud or assert that the few cases affected the outcome of an election. Voter fraud is rare. Trump talking about it is not. Voter fraud isn’t a catch-all term for any election shenanigan. Voter fraud is rare and refers to illegal interference in voting, such as ballot stuffing, voter impersonation or vote buying. Before his White House bid, Trump tweeted about dead voters delivering President Barack Obama’s victory in 2012, floated charges about multiple voting in the primaries, and suggested that undocumented immigrants "just walk in and vote" in some polling places. These charges do not reflect reality. News 21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found 150 alleged cases of double voting, 56 cases of noncitizens voting, and 10 cases of voter impersonation across all elections from 2000 to 2011. Many of these allegations never led to charges, while others were acquitted or dismissed. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School and an expert on voter fraud, found an even smaller number: 31 credible incidents out of more than 1 billion votes cast from 2000 to 2014. Put it in another way: More people are struck by lightning or attacked by sharks than are accused of voter fraud. When voter fraud does occur, it’s not always intentional. Multiple studies have traced known cases not to willful deception but to clerical errors or confusion. For example, one case of a dead person voting (Alan J. Mandell) happened because a poll worker accidentally marked his name instead of the man who actually cast the ballot, Alan J. Mandel. Similarly, in one of just five cases of a noncitizen voting between 2000 and 2004, a permanent resident was told he was eligible and given a voter registration form by a DMV clerk when renewing his license. So, given the rarity of occurrence, the lack of intent, and a federal penalty of a $10,000 fine or up to five years in prison, experts say it would be extremely difficult to rig an election through the ways Trump has decried. "I'd like to see him try to vote 10 times on Election Day. It would be virtually impossible and a knuckle-headed way to try to corrupt an election," Lorraine Minnite, a political science professor at Rutgers University who wrote The Myth of Voter Fraud, previously told PolitiFact. For double or triple voting to sway an election, an army of voters would have to visit multiple polling locations each, know the names and addresses of the people they were impersonating and produce fake IDs (in many states) or forge their signatures — plus commit to committing perjury the entire time. "Campaigns don’t pay people to pretend to be people they’re not. That’s too stupid," said Mary Frances Berry, former chairwoman of the U.S Commission on Civil Rights and author of Five Dollars and a Pork Chop Sandwich, a book about electoral fraud. So there is no evidence of a massive attempt to rig the election on and before Election Day. Collusion confusion Trump elaborated on his voter fraud theory a few hours after his initial tweet. "Voter fraud! Crooked Hillary Clinton even got the questions to a debate, and nobody says a word. Can you imagine if I got the questions?" he tweeted. His follow-up is not evidence of large-scale voter fraud, though it does bring up a separate concern revealed by Wikileaks. Trump is referring to an email obtained by Wikileaks from then-CNN contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile with the subject line, "From time to time, I get the the questions in advance." "Here’s one that worries me about HRC," Brazile wrote to Clinton’s communications director Jennifer Palmieri on March 12, 2016. "Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?" Palmieri wrote back: "Hi. Yes, it is one she gets asked about. Not everyone likes her answer but can share it." The next day, CNN co-moderated a Democratic primary town hall, and one person asked Clinton about the death penalty. But Brazile, who is now interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, has denied that she notified the Clinton camp of the question and says she never had access to the questions in the first place. (The Clinton campaign has yet to confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails.) A CNN spokesperson told Politico, "we have never, ever given a town hall question to anyone beforehand." CNN host Jake Tapper, one of the debate moderators, called the leak "very, very upsetting," and the network has blamed debate partner TV One as the source. This is concerning, but none of it is evidence of voter fraud. Our ruling Trump said, "Of course, there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day." Actual instances of voter fraud — such as voter impersonation, ballot stuffing and bought votes — are extremely rare, often unintentional and not on a scale large enough to affect a national election. Trump's alarming claim, once again, is without proof.

pomt-14888	Says he balanced the Milwaukee County budget "without raising taxes five years in a row."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/10/chris-abele/chris-abele-claims-hes-balanced-5-milwaukee-county/	Facing an election challenge from a state senator in his own party, Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele unveiled two campaign ads on Nov. 2, 2015. Both TV spots make the same boast about taxes. In the ad titled "Foundation," the narrator puts it this way: "As county executive, he balanced the budget without raising taxes, five years in a row." Really? Then why is the property tax levy millions of dollars higher than when Abele took office? It’s been well documented that the county Board of Supervisors has generally raised property taxes in making changes to Abele’s budgets. But Abele has, in his own way, adopted those increases as well. The numbers Abele has proposed five county budgets since winning a special election in April 2011 to finish out the final year of Scott Walker’s term, after Walker was elected governor. Abele won a full four-year term in 2012, running unopposed. But he faces a serious challenge from state Sen. Chris Larson of Milwaukee in the April 2016 election. (Although both Abele and Larson are Democrats, the county executive position is officially nonpartisan.) As the following table shows, for each of his five budgets, Abele proposed a property tax levy freeze -- in other words, he proposed levying the same total amount of property taxes that was levied the previous year. But it’s also clear that Abele’s proposed levy has increased every year, and was $13 million higher in 2016 than it was in 2012. Budget Year Property tax levy proposed by Abele` Property tax levy adopted by County Board following vetoes and veto overrides 2011 (Proposed by Scott Walker) $269.6 million 2012 $269.6 million $275.4 million 2013 $275.4 million $279.3 million 2014 $279.3 million $279.3 million 2015 $279.3 million $282.9 million 2016 $282.9 million $287 million* *The County Board on Nov. 9, 2015, adopted the 2016 budget, though Abele can still issue vetoes. The pattern was essentially the same each year: Abele proposed a budget that would have frozen the levy. The County Board approved changes in the budget that -- except for 2014, when the levy stayed the same -- raised the levy. Abele issued a number of budget vetoes, some or all of which were overridden by the County Board. The result was that, except for 2014, the County Board ultimately adopted a budget that contained a property tax levy larger than what Abele proposed. So, by proposing the freezes, and issuing the vetoes, each year, Abele tried to keep the property levy from going up. But when it came time to propose a budget for the next year, Abele used the previous year’s levy. In other words, each year, Abele took advantage of the fact that the County Board had adopted a levy that was higher than he proposed. So, the "freeze" he proposed each year was on the higher amount adopted by the board, not the lower amount that he had proposed and tried to preserve with his vetoes. This was the same pattern Walker followed as county executive. Our rating Abele says he balanced the Milwaukee County budget "without raising taxes five years in a row." That claim has the ring of finality to it, as though Abele has presided over five budgets without a tax increase. In reality, Abele did propose a freeze in the property tax levy each year and he issued budget vetoes that would have kept the levy down. But the County Board ultimately adopted a budget that raised the total property tax take in four of the five years, and Abele took advantage of those actions when he proposed a freeze the following year. So, taxpayers are paying more than when he took office. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.

pomt-09917	ACORN will be a paid partner with the Census Bureau and "they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/26/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-claims-acorn-getting-money-work-c/	Rep. Michele Bachmann sparked a new controversy recently when she declared she would provide the bare minimum to Census takers because she was concerned about the Census Bureau's partnership with ACORN, a left-leaning group that has become a popular villain for Republicans. (You remember ACORN: Formally known as the Association of Community Organization for Reform Now, it was lambasted in 2008 by many Republicans because its voter registration efforts included some fraudulent names such as Mickey Mouse. ACORN leaders said they discovered the fake names, notified authorities and fired some workers who cut corners. But Republican leaders still say it was a willful effort to manipulate the election to help the group's liberal agenda.) Here's how Bachmann explained her concerns in a Washington Times interview (which you can listen to here ): "Now ACORN has been named one of the national partners, which will be a recipient again of federal money," Bachmann said. "And they will be in charge of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public. This is very concerning because the motherload of all data information will be from the Census. And, of course, we think of the Census as just counting how many people live in your home. Unfortunately, the Census data has become very intricate, very personal (with) a lot of the questions that are asked. "And I know for my family the only question that we will be answering is how many people are in our home. We won't be answering any information beyond that, because the Constitution doesn't require any information beyond that." Bachmann packs a lot of bad information into a short space there. So in this item we'll deal with her latest claim about ACORN, and we'll deal with her claim about the constitutional requirement with a different item . She is wildly wrong with her chraracterization of the Census Bureau's partnership program. Yes, the bureau does partner with organizations to help recruit workers. To date, it has 30,000 such partners. ACORN is one. Partners agree "to promote the 2010 Census among their constituents." As a partner, ACORN has agreed to spread the word among its people about the availability of temporary Census jobs. The U.S. Census Bureau expects to hire 1.4 million people through the course of the 2010 census, the bulk of them to do the door-to-door questionnaires, so the bureau casts a wide net to get applicants, including through its partners. Partners don't get paid, but they presumably benefit by getting the word out to members about jobs, and also by providing a public service emphasizing the importance of filling out the Census. According to Census Bureau information provided to Congress on June 1, 2009, "ACORN and other partner organizations simply promote the availability of temporary Census jobs, but have no role in the terms or conditions of employment beyond promotion of the availability of temporary jobs. Applicants that are hired by the Census Bureau to work on the 2010 Census are required to go through a background check that includes an FBI name check and fingerprint check so that felons are not hired to work on the 2010 Census." Partners are also encouraged to donate testing space for the millions of people who will apply for the temporary Census jobs. No payments are made for that. And lastly, partners are asked to promote full participation in the Census among their members, through newsletters, e-mails, local meetings etc. Again, there's no payment for that. So let's count the ways Bachmann is wrong: ACORN will not be "in charge" of going door-to-door and collecting data from the American public, as Bachmann said. The U.S. Census will be in charge of that. Some of the 1.4 million people who get Census-taking jobs may learn about the job through ACORN. Workers who apply to the Census through ACORN have no better shot at the job than those who apply through any of the 30,000 other partners. That's it. And despite Bachmann's claim, ACORN gets no money for signing on as a partner. Once again, she is making a scaremongering claim about ACORN with facts that are ridiculously wrong. So we have to set the meter on fire once again. She earns another Pants on Fire.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2009-06-26T15:34:17	2009-06-17	['United_States']

pomt-00043	Says New York Rep. John Faso "cast the deciding vote" to try to kill health care protections provided by Obamacare.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/05/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/whos-blame-almost-killing-obamacare-democrats-poin/	In 2017, as Republicans considered measures to repeal and replace Obamacare, the House Budget Committee took an important preliminary vote. It decided 19 to 17 to advance the American Health Care Act. That means, the Democratic Party says, that Rep. John Faso of New York "cast the deciding vote to deny protections for pre-existing conditions." The claim is in a new ad the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put on the air in the closing days of the race in New York Congressional District 19 south of Albany, where Faso faces a challenge from Antonio Delgado. Faso, the DCCC says, could have stopped the whole bill, one that critics say could have been deeply harmful to people who need the protections the Affordable Care Act provides. It only failed later because the Senate lacked the support for its version. Was Faso the deciding vote? Let’s look at the math. Budget committee vote The committee vote on March 16, 2017, was 19-17. That means it passed by two votes. But if just one lawmaker who voted yes had voted no instead, the count would have been 18-18, a tie. "It fails if it is a tie," DCCC spokesman Evan Lukaske told us. And that could have stopped everything that followed, he said. Couldn’t any of the others have done the same thing? How can you say one member was the deciding vote? The DCCC allows that any member might have made a difference, but it doesn’t mean Faso couldn’t have been the key. Three other Republicans had voted no because they thought the bill didn’t do enough to kill the health program. Regardless of reasons, Faso could have joined them. "He could have made the decision to kill it," Lukaske said. In fact, the Times Herald-Record, a newspaper covering the Hudson Valley region, had a front page with Faso’s picture and the headline, "Deciding vote," with a story saying the congressman kept the "controversial health care bill alive." The front page is shown in the DCCC ad. The bill’s problems The committee vote was to move the bill along, a necessary step for putting the bill on the House floor. But Republican leaders including Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged it would need changes to win full House approval. When the Budget Committee voted, the bill had provisions calling for reducing Medicaid payments to states. It had language eliminating penalties for people who refused to buy health insurance. It called for changing the subsidy system for those buying coverage. And it would have relaxed the rule that said insurers could charge their oldest customers no more than three times the premiums they charged their youngest ones. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill, as it existed at that point, would have led to 14 million more people being uninsured in 2018, a figure rising to 21 million in 2020 and 24 million in 2026. Democrats and health policy groups warned that if states got less money for Medicaid, they would pare back their programs, inevitably leaving some people with fewer medical services or more hurdles for enrollment. They said older customers with private insurance would face price hikes, and the subsidies to help pay would be inadequate. Republicans supporting the bill pointed out that it included money to help states stabilize their insurance markets. The CBO said states would probably use those grants "to limit the costs to insurers of enrollees with very high claims." At this point, would the bill have killed protections for pre-existing conditions, as the DCCC claims? The answer is indirectly, it could have weakened protections -- but the question is academic because the House made changes to the bill before its May 2017 passage. One included an amendment allowing states to seek waivers from other ACA rules, including one that health policy groups said would have eroded requirements for providing medical services for patients who need them the most. This could lead to a new round of debate on that final House bill, but we have covered that repeatedly and the point here is different: The DCCC says Faso could have stopped everything with his committee vote. Our ruling The DCCC says John Faso "cast the deciding vote to deny protections for preexisting conditions." Before we rule, it’s important to note that states had their own insurance rules before the ACA. New York already prohibited charging higher premiums based on health status. PolitiFact looked at this more fully when examining a related claim about Faso. We are interested here in whether Faso was the deciding vote -- whether, as the ad suggests, he could have stopped it all. We need not go far to decide, because the same kind of claim was used by Republicans against Democrats in past elections, when Republicans blasted Democrats for passing the ACA in the first place. They noted how a procedural motion needed for the bill passed by a single vote. Here were some of those claims: Bill Nelson "the deciding vote" on the health care law (2012) Warner cast "the tiebreaking vote" on Obamacare (2013) Mark Udall 'passed Obamacare with his vote' (2014) Russ Feingold cast deciding vote on Obamacare (2015) There’s more, but you get the gist. Faso was one of 19 House Budget Committee members who voted for the early version of the House repeal-and-replace bill last year. Had he voted no, things might have changed. But the same can be said for 18 others. To point out Faso as the singular villain or hero way overstates his role. Just as we did repeatedly on the ACA claim, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-03102	"You have to get a license to fish on our beaches."	true	/florida/statements/2013/sep/23/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-you-need-license-fish-beach-really/	Indulge us this fantasy: Beckoned by summer’s end, you escape work early and head for the sandy shores of your favorite Florida beach. It’s fishing time! As you stand near gentle waves, fishing rod in hand, an authority figure approaches with a buzzkill of a question: Where’s your license, pal? My what? Yep, there’s really a requirement for a saltwater shoreline fishing license under state law. We were as surprised to hear about it as Gov. Rick Scott during his recent "listening tour" for tax and fee cuts around the state. "You have to get a license to fish on our beaches. I didn't know that," Scott told health care workers in Tampa on Sept. 18. "We're going to get rid of that." Good news for amateur anglers: It’s free to state residents (not counting convenience fees for ordering by phone or Internet). So repealing it is a freebie for Scott’s promise to cut $500 million in taxes and fees. Florida used to have no such requirement, but the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission requested it during the 2009 legislative session. Otherwise, a federal registration requirement carrying a $15-$25 fee would have gone into effect in 2011, according to a Q&A about the license. "I think it’s important for people to realize that fish and wildlife resources belong to everyone," said FWC spokesman Gary Morse. "One of the most important reasons that we have to have the license is for the ability to manage our fisheries. We need to know how much pressure is being put on the fishery for both commercial (purposes) and recreation." With more information in hand, officials can make better decisions about fishing rules and regulations, he said. Popped for fishing on the beach without a license? Officials generally issue a warning -- the first time, Morse said. After that there could be fines. The shoreline license only covers people fishing from land or a structure attached to land, not someone fishing from a boat or a shore reached by boat. Wading into the water is okay, as long as you can stand on the bottom. You don’t have to have the free version if you already possess a saltwater fishing license (annual license starts at $17) or if you are under age 16 or a senior resident. There’s an exemption from the shoreline license for people approved for food stamps, temporary cash assistance or Medicaid by the Department of Children and Families. Actually, there are a lot of regulations and exemptions with all fishing licenses, and you can read more about them from FWC here. (If you want to avoid registration altogether, the state offers two upcoming license-free saltwater fishing days on Oct. 12 and Nov. 30.) Scott may have said he wants to get rid of the requirement, but his press office said there are no plans to formally propose a repeal. As for his statement about needing a license to fish on the beach, we found nothing fishy about it. We rate his claim True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2013-09-23T10:27:49	2013-09-18	['None']
pomt-15177	Says "there’s 400,000" anchor babies born in the United States a year, which are "individuals coming to our country and having their children so their children can be U.S. citizens."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/23/corey-lewandowski/donald-trumps-campaign-manager-says-there-are-4000/	Donald Trump’s proposal to end automatic citizenship for the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants spurred a week of talk about "anchor babies," a term that some say is derogatory. Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski tried to clarify his boss' views on CNN’s State of the Union on Aug. 23, 2015. "If you think of the term ‘anchor baby,’ which is those individuals coming to our country and having their children so their children can be U.S. citizens," Lewandowski said on Aug. 23. "There’s 400,000 of those taking place on a yearly basis. To put this in perspective, that’s equivalent of the population of Tulsa, Okla." We wondered whether there really were 400,000 "anchor babies" born in the United States every year (and yes, that is the population size of Tulsa). Are the undocumented mothers specifically coming here to give birth in hopes of some kind of legal status? We didn’t hear back from Lewandowski or the Trump campaign. We did, however, find the number in congressional testimony from the Center for Immigration Studies, a research organization that supports lower immigration levels. "Every year, 350,000 to 400,000 children are born to illegal immigrants in the United States," the center’s Jon Feere said on April 29, 2015. "To put it another way, as many as one out of 10 births in the United States is now to an illegal immigrant mother." Those figures may have been accurate several years ago, but they are outdated when compared to current estimates, said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center. Passel is the author of a widely cited 2010 Pew Hispanic Center report that pins the number of children born to undocumented immigrants at 340,000 in 2008 (about 8 percent of all births that year). "Figures as high as 400,000 per year are plausible for the mid 2000s, but our current estimates are around 300,000 per year," he told us. "The numbers were higher in the mid 2000s than now — in part because there were more unauthorized immigrants then and overall birth rates, for natives and immigrants alike, were higher before the recession." So Lewandowski’s number is slightly exaggerated. His characterization of these births as "anchor babies" is also problematic, however, as the metaphor implies intent that the numbers don’t back up. Based on past reporting, it’s not clear whether every birth to an undocumented mother was for the purpose of tethering the family to American soil. "There are a million hardworking Hispanic people in San Diego who came here to work and then happened to have a baby," midwife Lauren Weber said in the 2010 fact-check. "Then, there are people who come over in order to have a baby." Weber also described a practice known as "birth tourism," in which middle- and upper-class visitors on tourist visas travel to the United States specifically to have a baby. The numbers for these types of births are much lower, at around 8,600, or 0.2 percent of all births, in 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As for undocummented immigrants, experts don't think they have the same motivations. "I believe that most migrants come for economic reasons and opportunity," said Theresa Brown, the director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Institute. "The idea that their child may be able to sponsor them for a green card in 21 years is probably too long term to be a primary driver of immigration." Roberto Suro, a communications and journalism professor at the University of Southern California who specializes in Hispanic issues, had also pointed that if undocumented immigration was spurred by "anchor babies," more undocumented immigrants would be women of childbearing age. The data shows the exact opposite: Adult immigrant men vastly outnumber women. Our ruling Lewandowski said that 400,000 "anchor babies" are born in the U.S. every year. The claim is not as straight-forward as it seems. First, the figure is outdated — a more accurate number for the amount of births to undocumented immigrants is 300,000. Lewandowski also makes a blanket statement when he says all of these births occurred specifically to anchor the undocumented families to the United States. While the practice occurs, it’s not safe to draw a single broad conclusion from the data and apply it to the intentions of every pregnant undocumented woman. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-04736	Says that as Providence’s mayor, David Cicilline said the city had a "world-class … school system. Not only did Providence not have a world-class school system but as measured, was amongst the last school system in the entire country."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/aug/30/anthony-gemma/anthony-gemma-says-when-us-rep-david-cicilline-was/	In between leveling charges Tuesday night that U.S. Rep. David Cicilline was a liar and had committed voter fraud -- charges that Cicilline strenuously denied -- challenger Anthony Gemma claimed that the first-term congressman’s "number one lie" pertained to the condition of Providence’s schools while Cicilline was mayor. During their first television debate in the 2012 primary race, broadcast on WPRI-Channel 12, Gemma said Cicilline had described the capital city’s school system during his eight years as mayor in glowing terms when that was far from the truth. "When Mr. Cicilline was mayor of Providence -- we’re going to stumble on the number one lie of Mr. Cicilline during his tenure as mayor --what he said is that the City of Providence during his eight years had a world-class -- and he used the word world-class -- school system. And not only did Providence not have a world-class school system but, as measured, was amongst the last school system [sic] in the entire country." We knew that the city’s schools -- like those in many urban centers -- have problems and are among the most troubled in Rhode Island. But we wondered whether they are among the worst in the entire country. We called the Gemma campaign to get the candidate’s supporting evidence and, while we waited for a response, started doing our own research. At no time in American history are students and their schools more tested and ranked than today. With every changing season, it seems, comes another report evaluating their educational progress and slippage. There are tests that can be used to compare schools within the same district and school districts within each state. There is even the rare instance of one state’s schools ranked against another state's. But we could not find one ranking that measured Providence’s school system against other city systems around the country, as Gemma claimed, let alone that ranked it so poorly. We called the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, a statewide children’s policy organization. Neither knew of any national test rankings that ever compared the performance of Providence’s school system with, for example, Los Angeles or Cincinnati. Terris Ross, a research scientist at The National Center for Education Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Department of Education, said the center does compile an annual list of statistics on the nation’s 100 largest school districts. But it does not rank or compare school districts by achievement or performance. Locally, Providence’s schools rank among the worst in Rhode Island. According to data by Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, 65 percent of Providence’s public schools made "insufficient progress" in 2008 while Cicilline was serving the third of his four terms as mayor. But what Gemma’s campaign spokesman supplied as evidence supporting the candidate’s remarks was way off the mark. In an e-mail, Alex Morash said Gemma’s claims were based on low marks given in several studies to "Rhode Island and/or Providence schools. " But how Rhode Island schools fared is not at issue here at all. Gemma specifically criticized Cicilline for the low marks Providence schools allegedly received while Cicilline was mayor. And none of the studies his campaign provided links to specifically ranked Providence against other cities in the nation. Further, the only reference the Gemma campaign provided of Cicilline using the phrase "world class" was a speech Cicilline gave at a school in Cumberland talking about the importance of students -- in general -- receiving a "world- class" education. Cicilline was using the phrase as a goal to shoot for -- not, as Gemma claimed, to describe Providence’s schools. Our ruling Anthony Gemma, who is challenging David Cicilline in the Democratic primary for Rhode Island’s 1st District congressional seat, said the former Providence mayor had described the capital city’s school system as world class when, in fact, "not only did Providence not have a world-class school system but as measured, was amongst the last school system in the entire country." We’ve already cited why Gemma was wrong about the "world-class" remark. Concerning the schools, neither state nor federal education officials know of any national school-district ranking that would have placed the city’s school system among the worst in the country. And Gemma didn’t provide any. For those reasons, we rate his statement a world-class False.	None	Anthony Gemma	None	None	None	2012-08-30T00:03:00	2012-08-28	['None']
pomt-11738	"Breaking: woman says she was offered big money by Washington Post to accuse Roy Moore of misconduct."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/11/evening-world/fake-news-about-washington-post-and-roy-moore-accu/	A fake news story said a Washington Post reporter offered a woman money if she would accuse Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of a crime. "Breaking: Woman says she was offered big money by Washington Post to accuse Roy Moore of misconduct," stated a Nov. 13 headline in Evening World, which is similar to an earlier story by The Gateway Pundit, a website that posts some fake news. The Washington Post reported in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper. The allegations have become the hot topic in his Dec. 12 race against Democrat Doug Jones. Facebook users flagged the Evening World story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article is based on a since-deleted twitter account and is fake. The website based the claim that a Post reporter offered money to a woman by citing the Twitter account of @umpire43 who identified himself as Doug Lewis #MAGA. "A family friend who lives in Alabama just told my wife that a WAPO reporter named Beth offered her 1000$ to accuse Roy Moore????," Lewis tweeted Nov. 10. One of the Post reporters who wrote about Moore was Beth Reinhard. Lewis also tweeted that the family friend had photographs of the reporter and had recorded the telephone conversation. He directed her to bring that information to her local district attorney’s office. Lewis wrote that "Jean" provided evidence to the Etowah County District Attorney in Alabama. Multiple news outlets including The Daily Beast, the Post and Snopes reported in November that @umpire43 had since deleted his account. The account user had a history of perpetuating hoaxes. The Daily Beast reported that the author of the account had repeatedly invented stories about his own background claiming to be a Navy veteran, a pollster, a baseball umpire, an expert on rigged voting machines, an American consulate worker in Calgary and "a beleaguered soul who needed time off after the 9/11 attacks when he saw Muslims ‘dancing on rooftops.’ " The Daily Beast contacted all of his alleged employers and affiliates and found that he hadn’t held any of the positions. The Twitter account launched in 2011 peaked at around 18,000 followers by the time that the Gateway Pundit reported on his claim against the Post. Tweets from @umpire43 had drawn attention from InfoWars and other right-wing sources. The Gateway Pundit added a an update at the bottom of its story about @umpire43’s tweets: "We have not been able to confirm these allegations by Doug Lewis." Reinhard, the Post reporter targeted in the fake news story, directed PolitiFact to a spokeswoman for the Post, Shani George. "The accusation against the Post is categorically false," George told PolitiFact in an email. "We have an explicit policy that prohibits paying sources." We found no contact information or disclaimer on the Evening World’s website, eveningw.com. The pro-Donald Trump website lifts accounts from other conservative websites. (The Evening World was an actual newspaper that published in New York City from 1887-1931). There is no evidence that a Post reporter offered a woman money to make an accusation against Moore.

Its claims were deemed "absurd" by the National Hurricane Center. With a headline "12 More Hurricanes Headed Towards US," the post was published on react365.com and alleged to be sourced to the National Hurricane Center. "The National Hurricane Center has issued 12 more hurricane warnings for the East Coast of the U.S.," read the post, "‘Regardless of which coast you live on, be prepared to evacuate at least 12 times, the National Weather Services said Thursday, not ruling out the possibility of a 13th hurricane by the end of the year." Despite the assumed validity of the sources, the entirety of this post is false. PolitiFact has written about similar "prank" posts in the past. This post and React365.com are part of a social media trend that allows people to create bogus news articles and publish them as if they are true. These so-called prank posts can leave users vulnerable to "like-farming," where scammers use click-bait posts to get as many likes as possible and spread malware through popularly clicked links. We first saw the post on Sept. 21, 2017, but it appears to have been updated by the publisher to look more current. The content of the post hasn’t changed. Since we first saw the post, there have been only three hurricanes in the Atlantic: Jose, Maria and Lee. Jose, which was quickly downgraded to a tropical storm when it came close to the East Coast, has fallen off the National Hurricane Center radar since Sept. 22. Maria has moved north off the shores of North Carolina and is predicted to move northeast, farther away from the East Coast. And Lee remains a idle swirl in the middle of the Atlantic with no apparent intent to touch American shores. The National Hurricane Center has yet to issue anything more severe than a tropical storm warning for any of these storms. Though the post is false, Dennis Feltgen of the National Hurricane Center advises people to stay vigilant during this active hurricane season. Since May, the National Weather Service has forecast that this year’s Atlantic hurricane season would be more active than past seasons. On Aug. 9, they updated their forecast, stating that this may be the most active hurricane season since 2010. But, in the eyes of the National Hurricane Center, the react365.com claim is still nothing more than fake news and, according to Feltgen, "totally unfounded, totally baseless and totally irresponsible."

pomt-07180	Out of 150,000 tenured teachers in the last 10 years, only 17 have been dismissed for incompetence.	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/10/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-claims-only-17-150000-tenured-n/	In his ongoing attempts at education reform in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie has a statistic to prove his point that tenure in the public school system provides a "job for life": only 17 out of 150,000 tenured teachers have been dismissed for incompetence during the past decade. The Republican governor offered those figures during his April 29 address before about 250 students and professors at Harvard University's Graduate School of Education. Here’s what Christie told the Ivy League institution: "In New Jersey, despite whatever the union will tell you, tenure is a job for life after three years and one day. It is a job for life. Here’s the evidence of it. We have about 150,000 public school teachers in New Jersey. In the last ten years how many teachers do you believe were dismissed for incompetence who were tenured teachers? Now keep it in context. Ten years at 150,000, 1.5M (1.5 million) opportunities to do this in the last ten years. The answer is seventeen. Seventeen in ten years." PolitiFact New Jersey was intrigued by the low number, and we reached out to the governor’s office and the state Department of Education to check it. The governor’s representatives could not prove there have been 150,000 tenured teachers during the past decade, but state records mostly support Christie’s argument that only 17 teachers were removed from the classroom following charges of "inefficiency" or "incompetence" during the past 10 years. First, let’s talk about that bigger number -- 150,000 tenured teachers? According to the New Jersey Department of Education’s website, the number of certified teachers climbed from 102,723 in the 2001-02 school year to about 114,704 in the 2009-10 school year. Those figures likely include nontenured teachers. PolitiFact New Jersey submitted an open public records request seeking, in part, documents detailing the number of tenured teachers in the public school system from 2000 to 2011, but state education officials told us they don’t have any such records. We reached out to the governor’s office for an explanation of the 150,000 figure, but two phone messages were never returned. Now, let’s return to those 17 dismissals cited by Christie at Harvard. Through the same open public records request, state education officials provided records of 17 cases from between 2001 and 2010 where tenured individuals were dismissed or resigned from their jobs following charges of inefficiency or incompetence. Christie had used the word "incompetence," but education spokesman Alan Guenther told us the correct term is "inefficiency," which covers incompetence. The cases typically involve teachers failing to provide adequate instruction for students. PolitiFact New Jersey found a few discrepancies between Christie’s statement and the records provided by the education department. Christie said 17 teachers were dismissed, but the records show that nine individuals resigned through settlement agreements and another person resigned before an agreement was reached. The remaining seven individuals were dismissed from their positions by the commissioner or acting commissioner of education. Also, the 17 individuals include a social worker, a facilities manager and a secretary. We also conducted our own review of more than 140 legal decisions available on the Department of Education’s website involving tenure hearings during the past decade. That research turned up only two cases ending in teacher dismissals between 2001 and 2010 involving inefficiency charges that were not included in the records provided by the education department. Excluding cases involving inefficiency or incompetence, 64 staff members in public schools were dismissed between 2001 and 2010 for other tenure charges, such as unbecoming conduct, according to decisions on the department’s website. Another eight individuals lost their jobs by other means in the face of tenure charges. Here’s where all that research leaves us: If we include the case involving the social worker, our research and the records provided to us support Christie’s statement that 17 teachers left their jobs following charges of inefficiency or incompetence. A New Jersey Education Association spokesman and a Rutgers professor took exception to Christie’s figure. NJEA spokesman Steve Baker pointed to state data showing that, on average, nearly 40 percent of first-year certified staff members in New Jersey do not attain tenure. By the time individuals attain tenure, they have proven to be competent teachers, Baker said. "Because they are essentially at-will employees for three years, there is no way to know why each one left or was not brought back. However, it is clear that a large number were dismissed, or chose to leave, because they were not effective," Baker wrote in an email. "Those who make it through the process and earn tenure have already pretty convincingly demonstrated to their administrators that they are effective and capable." Bruce Baker, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers University, who is not related to Steve Baker, said the 17 figure is not very meaningful because teachers are dismissed before reaching tenure status or they’re forced out later without charges being filed. There also is no benchmark of how many bad teachers are out there, Baker said. Two experts said proving charges of inefficiency and incompetence presents a challenge to school districts. The existing evaluation system makes it difficult to determine ineffectiveness among tenured teachers, said Patrick McGuinn, an associate professor of political science at Drew University. The cost and time involved in pursuing such tenure cases also are disincentives for districts, he said. Middlesex County attorney David Rubin, who represents various school districts, added: "What constitutes lousy teaching is somewhat subjective to begin with." Let’s return to Christie’s statement: The governor said 17 out of 150,000 tenured teachers were dismissed for incompetence in the last 10 years. The 150,000 figure is off, since state records show no more than 114,704 certified teachers have been working in the past decade. But state records back up his statement about the 17 cases involving inefficiency or incompetence charges. Still, his underlying point is largely correct. The state has tens of thousands of teachers and only 17 have lost their jobs through dismissals or resignations in the past decade following charges of incompetence or inefficiency. We rate his statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, join the conversation at www.NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2011-06-10T05:02:00	2011-04-29	['None']
pomt-07052	Says he can’t release his internal affairs record because there are Attorney General guidelines in place protecting it.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/30/samuel-demaio/acting-newark-police-director-samuel-demaio-says-h/	Acting Newark Police Director Samuel DeMaio has set many precedents during his tenure with the Newark Police Department. But there is one distinction he doesn’t want: "to be the first cop in the state of New Jersey" to release his internal affairs record. During a recent interview on FOX 5’s "Good Day New York" program, a reporter said to DeMaio, "The city council president, Donald Payne Jr., has really been pressing. He wants to see your internal affairs record. He believes there have been infractions in the past, committed by you. He wants to see your record. Why not release it to him?" "It's really that I can't," DeMaio replied. "There are Attorney General guidelines in place that protect it because of what's in those records. It's any allegation ... what I can say is there’s no sustained complaints on my record. I don't want to be the first cop in the state of New Jersey to set that precedent. It’s just not an issue." PolitiFact New Jersey learned there are guidelines covering different files kept on police officers, and there are strict protections on internal affairs files to maintain their confidentiality. But there are exceptions -- one of which would allow the release of DeMaio’s internal affairs file. First, let’s explain why DeMaio is being asked to release his records. DeMaio was appointed acting top cop in Newark days before the U.S. Justice Department announced an investigation into the Newark Police Department. The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey last year petitioned the federal government to investigate alleged civil-rights abuses by the department. When the previous police director, Garry McCarthy, announced his departure, ACLU-NJ Executive Director Deborah Jacobs asked Newark Mayor Cory Booker to require any internal candidate for the position to "voluntarily disclose to the public their work assignment history and their internal affairs/disciplinary history." After DeMaio’s appointment was announced, Jacobs wrote in a May 10 opinion-editorial piece, "For DeMaio, the need for transparency is especially pressing," citing a 2007 incident when DeMaio was reprimanded by the state Attorney General’s Office for questioning a witness about his immigration status, as well as other concerns about DeMaio’s reputation in the community. In Jacobs’ op-ed, she referred to the files she wants released as both internal affairs records and disciplinary records. City council members and a group of Newark pastors have also called for DeMaio to release his file, which they often refer to as his disciplinary record. But a disciplinary record is generally not maintained as a separate file. The state Attorney General’s Office recommends police departments keep a personnel file, an internal affairs file and a medical file on police officers. A Booker spokeswoman told us the Newark Police Department follows that system. DeMaio correctly stated that state Attorney General guidelines protect internal affairs files. The guidelines state that "the nature and source of internal allegations, the progress of internal affairs investigations, and the resulting materials are confidential information." The guidelines describe several "limited circumstances" under which records from internal affairs investigations can be released, including upon a court order and upon the request of the county prosecutor or Attorney General. But the guidelines also state, "the law enforcement executive officer may authorize access [to] a particular file or record for good cause." The state Attorney General’s Office refused to confirm that the guidelines authorize Newark’s police director to release an internal affairs file. Booker’s spokeswoman said the police director is the "law enforcement executive officer" in the city. She also noted, "it should be pointed out that when they say a ‘particular file’ they mean incident specific." James Drylie, executive director of Kean University’s school of criminal justice, said that while DeMaio has the authority to release his internal affairs file as the "law enforcement executive officer," the state Attorney General guidelines clearly aim to keep those files confidential. The city administration sent this statement when we requested comment from DeMaio: "Acting Police Director DeMaio remains focused on his number one priority - the public safety of our residents and making sure that this summer will be Newark’s safest." Let’s review. DeMaio said he can’t release his internal affairs record because there are state Attorney General guidelines protecting it. The state Attorney General’s guidelines describe an internal affairs file as a confidential document, but also lays out specific exceptions to that policy -- one of which technically allows DeMaio to release his file. We rate DeMaio’s statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Samuel DeMaio	None	None	None	2011-06-30T05:15:00	2011-06-09	['None']

pomt-12848	Obamacare is "hurting people right now" with premium increases of up to 116 percent.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/03/paul-ryan/testing-paul-ryan-claim-obamacare-premium-increase/	U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan has received a lot of criticism (and a False rating from us) for his claims that actuaries say Obamacare is in a "death spiral." But it’s far from his only criticism of the former president’s trademark health care law. Ryan has repeatedly brought up rising premiums as well, notably in his Jan. 5, 2017 weekly briefing where he ran off a list of increases for 2017. "This law is hurting people right now. I mean, look at these premium increases," the Janesville Republican said, then ticked off a series of states. "This year Arizona, 116 percent increase in premiums. Tennessee, 63 percent increase in premiums. Oklahoma, 69 percent increase in premiums. Illinois, 43 percent increase in premiums. North Carolina, 40 percent increase in premiums. Nebraska, 51 percent. Pennsylvania, 53 percent. These aren’t statistics, these are real lives," he said. "These are real families facing huge premium increases." Are the premium increases Ryan cited correct, "hurting people right now" and attributable to Obamacare? Numbers are on the mark The basic numbers are easy to confirm: Those increases are indeed accurate for 2017 compared to 2016 within the Obamacare marketplace. Arizona has by far the largest increase in the nation, and Oklahoma is second. The states all are among the Top 10 in percentage increase over 2016, according to estimates the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released in October 2016. As such, they are not a representative sample of all 50 states, but Ryan never claimed they were. And they are the headlines in a clear national trend. Premiums rose an average of 25 percent across the 39 states that use the HealthCare.gov marketplace. Only one state (Indiana) saw premiums drop in 2017. The calculation is based on the average cost in each county for the second-lowest-cost silver level plan for a 27-year-old, a plan widely used as a benchmark to compare rates between years and geographic areas. Premiums affect many people Ryan’s description of the law as "hurting people right now" is a bit subjective, but it’s clear enough for us to examine since he later expanded on this by referencing "families facing huge premium increases." Obamacare supporters often claim premium increases are irrelevant due to the subsidies built into Obamacare. Those subsidies cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400% of the federal poverty level (that’s $48,240 in 2017 for a single person). For 2017, 81 percent of consumers enrolled in the marketplace through Dec. 24, 2016 were in line to receive a subsidy. That means 19% of those insured will receive no subsidy and therefore bear the full weight of those premium increases (assuming they stay on the same plan). That’s more than 2 million people, based on the latest enrollment data. Fair to attribute increase to Obamacare? The final hurdle for Ryan’s claim is the matter of blame. He says the law itself is hurting people right now — in other words, that increases due to Obamacare go beyond the general trend of rising health care costs. This year’s 25 percent increase is by far the largest since Obamacare began. Premiums rose around 7 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2015, based on the HHS analysis of the same benchmark plan. For starters, that jump is far beyond what is expected industry wide. The National Business Group on Health estimates employees of the nation’s largest businesses — an indicator of overall health insurance costs — will see about a 5 percent premium increase in 2017, based on a survey of 425 large employers. Obamacare premiums are rising far more in part because of several mechanisms built into the healthcare law that have ended or not worked as intended — reinsurance and risk corridors. Both were set up as temporary measures from 2014 to 2016 to subsidize the marketplace, artificially keeping prices low. Reinsurance was designed to reduce the incentive for insurers to charge higher premiums to higher-cost policyholders in the first years of Obamacare, which was accomplished by transferring funds to the plans for those policyholders. Risk corridors were designed to transfer money from profitable insurers to those losing money on the ACA exchange, discourage insurers from setting high premiums due to the uncertainty of the new market. They were originally pitched as a mechanism that would bring in money, then as one that would break even. But the latest data shows in 2015 claims from insurers for payment through the program outweighed the money paid in by $5.8 billion, so the expected funds weren’t available to redistribute. Now that the programs have ended as designed, premiums are rising to more closely match what it actually costs insurers to offer plans in the marketplace. This is by no means an exhaustive accounting of the factors driving 2017 premiums upward. Experts say general growth in health care costs still play a role, as do changes in who is signing up, provider networks and the small group market, among others. Our rating Ryan said soaring Obamacare premiums are "hurting people right now," including one state with an increase of 116 percent. The state-by-state increases he cited were correct based on the commonly used benchmark plan. The increases appear likely to affect several million people since about one-fifth of those enrolled in Obamacare aren’t eligible for subsidies. And while we can’t exactly identify all the factors in the rising premiums, they are clearly going up more than non-Obamacare premiums due in part to how the system was set up. The missing nuance in Ryan’s claim is that it doesn’t acknowledge the millions of people who wouldn’t have any insurance without Obamacare and would presumably end up hurting even more. And we’ll note some level of financial hurt would exist regardless due to ever-rising cost of health care.

pomt-03670	"Odd fact for odd draft: No. 2 overall pick will earn more than the No. 1 pick due to no state tax in Florida. So 2 not so bad."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/apr/26/adam-schefter/nfl-reporter-says-no-2-pick-nfl-draft-will-earn-mo/	Don’t get us wrong: We love analyzing tax policy and following legislative gamesmanship as much as the next political junkie. But we like our work even more when we get to pull in sports and pop culture. And when our Twitter feed dangled a widespread claim combining Florida’s income tax (or, lack thereof) and football on the first night of the NFL draft, we could not resist giving it a second look. In a tweet shared by more than 3,600 users, ESPN reporter Adam Schefter wrote: "Odd fact for odd draft: No. 2 overall pick will earn more than the No. 1 pick due to no state tax in Florida. So 2 not so bad." The Kansas City Chiefs had the top pick, and the Jacksonville Jaguars got the second. We wondered if Texas A&M offensive lineman Luke Joeckel, headed for Jacksonville, will really make more after income taxes than the draft’s No. 1 pick, University of Central Michigan offensive lineman Eric Fisher, who is going to Missouri. Twitter helped our mission from the start. A user named @SportsTaxMan, New Jersey-based sports and entertainment accountant Robert Raiola, responded to Schefter’s tweet with even more detail. "Eric Fisher was picked 1st by #Chiefs The #Jaguars, selected Luke Joeckel. Luke will get approx $285K > after tax than 1st pick," he tweeted. How’d he figure that? Reached by phone, Raiola called the instance of the No. 2 pick’s after-tax pay exceeding No. 1 after-tax pay "an anomaly" in this year’s draft. His method involves some eyeballing. Since we don’t know for sure what these players’ salaries and signing bonuses will be, he used last year’s contracts for the top two picks (quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III, respectively). There isn’t likely to be a big dollar difference between the top two picks in 2013 because of rules regarding rookie contracts that were adopted as part of the NFL’s 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement. The minimum base salary for a rookie player is $405,000 in 2013, up from $390,000 in 2012. The big money comes in the form of a signing bonus. Counting base pay and a signing bonus in the first year of their deal, Luck received $14.9 million, and Griffin got $14.1 million. Now fast forward to this year. Florida has no state income tax. Missouri has a 6 percent tax on income over $9,000, and Kansas City, Mo., has a 1 percent tax on top of that. So Raiola figures that if Fisher makes $14.9 million, he will pay a little more than $1 million in state and city income taxes -- dropping his pay (pre-federal tax) to about $13.85 million. That’s less than Joeckel’s expected pre-federal tax haul. There is one complicating factor. Professional athletes pay "jock taxes" when they play in certain states and cities on the road. Technically, they’re working in the state in which they are playing when they go on the road, Raiola said. It creates headaches for athletes but isn’t a huge drain given their high incomes, he said. (You can read about how the jock tax got its start, here. It's an interesting story.) He assumes each NFL away game counts for two duty days. Jacksonville has seven preseason and regular season games on its 2013 schedule in states and cities that have a jock tax: the Atlanta Falcons, New York Jets, Oakland Raiders, Denver Broncos, St. Louis Rams, Cleveland Browns and the Indianapolis Colts. Assuming a 7 percent tax rate, jock taxes will cost Joeckel approximately $99,000. (He won’t pay the tax when he plays the Tennessee Titans, Seattle Seahawks or the Houston Texans). After taking out federal, state and local income taxes, Joeckel comes out approximately $285,000 ahead of Fisher, according to Raiola. But Joeckel isn’t even the luckiest top pick in Raiola’s eyes. That distinction goes to defensive end Dion Jordan, who was drafted by the Miami Dolphins after the team traded up to get the No. 3 pick. "The trade to Miami will save him approx $1.7M in state tax in 2013," he tweeted. (That comparison is with the tax situation in Oakland, Calif., because the Oakland Raiders had held the third draft pick.) Now for some caveats. This analysis focuses on income tax. Florida’s overall state and local tax burden, as measured by the Tax Foundation, is a bit higher than Missouri’s, mainly because of property taxes. Using a few cost-of-living calculators, we found Jacksonville is still cheaper to live in than Kansas City. A $500,000 salary goes about $30,000 further in Jacksonville than Kansas City. There’s also no telling if these newly minted millionaires will take any number of actions that would affect their tax bill, including buying a house, socking money away into a 401(k) savings account or any number of credits and deductions they could take. But if we accept that we’re talking approximations -- and if we assume they live in the state they play in -- we found some agreement. "If we just look at the after-tax pay, that comparison is accurate," said Saku Aura, University of Missouri public economics associate professor. "A state without an income tax, like Florida, will be always attractive from a very high-income individual's perspective." Even though Joeckel did not have a choice about moving to Jacksonville, some free agents may consider income tax as a factor in their decision to come to another team. Cornerback Darrelle Revis was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this week from the New York Jets, a move Raiola thinks will save him roughly $1,435,000 in state income tax. Of course, an income tax levied against an athlete is probably not going to lead to many tears -- from athletes, or the rest of us. "I guess I don’t have that much sympathy given that there are a whole host of people who would like to be in either of their positions," said Kim Rueben, Tax Policy Institute senior fellow. Our ruling ESPN’s Adam Schefter merged the worlds of the NFL and tax policy on the first day of the NFL draft when he said that No. 2 pick Luke Joeckel will take home more pay than No. 1 pick Luke Fisher because Florida has no state tax. When looking at income tax, Schefter is largely right. If the 2013 salaries hold at about their 2012 levels, which is part of new NFL rules, Joeckel is better off financially by being selected No. 2 by a Florida team than being picked No. 1 somewhere else. There are two caveats. First, the salaries of Joeckel and Fisher are not yet officially known. Also, there are some other ways to look at income that could affect the bottom for Joeckel and Fisher -- whether it be sales taxes or property taxes or overall cost-of-living. We rate Schefter’s claim Mostly True.	None	Adam Schefter	None	None	None	2013-04-26T17:37:49	2013-04-25	['None']
abbc-00281	"When we came into government in 2013, there were 2,000 kids in detention.

Fact Check considers the Coalition "came into government" on one of these dates but could not establish the precise number of children in detention on either date. However, an August 2014 media release from then immigration minister Scott Morrison said: "When Labor left office there were 1,392 children in held detention". Monthly statistics published by the Department of Immigration and the Parliamentary Library show 1,773 children were in detention at the end of August 2013. In late August 2013, Mr Morrison noted that the Labor government was releasing children from detention. The number of children in detention fell to 1,165 at the end of September 2013. The most recent figures indicate 88 children were in onshore detention facilities on January 31, 2016. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton told Parliament on February 9 there were 75 children in detention. The Immigration Department told Fact Check that on February 11 there were 74 "illegal maritime arrival" children in onshore detention facilities. However, experts consulted by Fact Check did not agree on whether the total number of children in detention should include children currently on Nauru. The most recent figures show 54 children are on Nauru. If those children are added, the total number of children in detention on January 31 was 142. On either definition, the number of children in detention has been falling since October 2015.

pomt-07903	"The New START treaty was passed despite significant concerns among some people in the State and Defense Departments."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/02/bill-janis/bill-janis-says-new-start-treaty-was-passed-despit/	Del. Bill Janis, a Republican from Henrico, recently criticized the U.S. Senate’s ratification of the New START nuclear arms treaty with Russia. According to a Senate roll call, the vote in favor of ratification was 71-26, with three senators not voting. Janis, in a Jan. 25 speech on the floor of the House of Delegates, argued the bill was rushed through the "lame duck" session of Congress despite "significant concerns among some people in the State and Defense Departments." His comments came when he was speaking in support of a proposed U.S. constitutional amendment that would give states the collective right to repeal any law or regulation passed by Congress. We wondered about those "significant concerns" Janis cited and looked to see if there was indeed major opposition to the treaty among former diplomats and generals. First, a word about the pact. New START replaces the 1991 START agreement between the United States and Soviet Union. START stands for Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The latest agreement was signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and Russian President Dimitry Medvedev. The treaty limits each nation to 1,550 nuclear warheads, 74 percent lower than the 1991 treaty’s limits. It also contains agreements for each nation to inspect the other’s weapons facilities and exchange missile telemetry. The treaty is set to run for 10 years, with the possibility of being extended for another five years. When we called Janis, he said his comment was based on news reports saying senators and some former members of the diplomatic corps had concerns about the treaty. "I saw media reporting where former secretaries of state had concerns," he told us. There are nine living people who have served as Secretary of State: Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, Warren Christopher, Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton. Clinton, the current secretary of state, has backed the treaty in repeated public statements and praised its eventual ratification. Kissinger, Shultz, Baker, Eagleburger and Powell, all of whom served Republican presidents, endorsed the treaty in a Dec. 2, 2010 editorial in The Washington Post. Condoleezza Rice, who served under Republican George W. Bush, backed the treaty in a Dec. 7, 2010 editorial in The Wall Street Journal, though she noted her endorsement carried caveats. She said approval should be accompanied by spending to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal and that the treaty should not establish a link between offensive weapons and missile defense systems. Madeleine Albright backed the treaty in a separate editorial in The Washington Post. And Warren Christopher’s support was noted in a November statement released by the office of Vice President Joe Biden. That means every living secretary of state endorsed the treaty. What about at the Defense Department? When the agreement was announced in March 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said the treaty would "strengthen nuclear stability" and that he would work with Congress to ensure ratification. Admiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Join Chiefs of Staff, said "I, the Vice Chairman, and the Joint Chiefs, as well as our combatant commanders around the world, stand solidly behind this new treaty, having had the opportunity to provide our counsel, to make our recommendations, and to help shape the final agreements." But what about opposition from former members of the military or diplomatic corps? After some searching we found that John Bolton, who served as Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations, argued against ratifying the treaty. Bolton, writing with former Bush Justice Department official John Yoo, argued "New Start’s faults are legion. The low limits it would place on nuclear warheads ignore the enormous disparities between American and Russian global responsibilities and the importance of America’s 'nuclear umbrella' in maintaining international security." The men also argued that the treaty would also hinder efforts by the United States to use conventional warheads in future conflicts. We also found a joint letter opposing the treaty that included the signatures of Bolton; retired Admiral James Lyons, Jr.; retired Major Gen. Paul Vallely; retired Brig Gen. Jimmy Cash; Paula DeSutter, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Verification, Compliance, and Implementation; Fred Iklé, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and Bruce Gelb, the former ambassador to Belgium. Let’s review the evidence. In our follow-up interview, Janis said he made his comments to show that the treaty "was not without controversy." He also says he thinks the treaty was "rushed through the ‘lame duck’ Congress." Janis has a point about the controversy; the New START treaty had more opposition in the Senate than its two predecessors. The Senate approved the New START treaty on a 71-26 vote. Only four senators opposed START II in 1996, and just six were against the original START treaty in 1992. But he got it wrong when he said there was opposition from former secretaries of state or top brass in the United States military. And the only truly notable former diplomat we found who opposed the treaty was John Bolton. Other opponents of the treaty existed, but their combined stature is a far cry from the roster of every living secretary of state. While trying to make a point about the sometimes-contentious treaty debate, Janis exceeded the facts. The treaty was backed by virtually every top official, past and present, at both the State Department and Defense Department. Therefore we find his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08714	"Both the state and federal governments make more per gallon in gas taxes than the oil companies make themselves for doing all the work."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/03/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-gas-taxes-exceed-oil-company-prof/	The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was still an accident waiting to happen when Ron Johnson rose to address a political rally last fall, months before he formally entered the U.S. Senate race as a Republican. But the spill would make oil a key issue in many Senate races, including in Johnson’s bid for the seat held by Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold. And oil company profits have long been a debating point between the parties. In his speech, Johnson spoke in defense of oil industry profits and against candidates who criticize the big oil companies. He said the industry’s success fuels further exploration -- and its stock helps fund the retirement accounts of millions of Americans. "How many times have you heard a politician attack Big Oil and Big Pharma as if these were some kind of evil enterprises preying on our society?" Johnson said at the rally. "Why do they do this? Well, I guess it sounds good to some people, and might help them get elected in some districts. But I can guarantee you, it does nothing to help our country. "I don’t know about you, but I want businesses to succeed ... I want oil companies to make enough money to continue to explore, drill, refine and deliver gas to virtually every corner of America. "Almost everyone's 401(k) or retirement fund owns stock in these companies. And I hope everyone realizes that both the state and federal governments make more per gallon in gas taxes than the oil companies make themselves for doing all the work." So is Johnson on the money regarding the government’s take of gasoline sales? His campaign offers evidence from the American Petroleum Institute, the national trade group representing oil and gas companies. An institute report released in August suggests that, per dollar of sales, gas taxes are more than double the net income earned by the largest oil companies. But Stephen Comstock, API’s manager of tax policy, steered PolitiFact Wisconsin away from the institute’s own per-gallon breakdown. He said it could be confusing and might not be appropriate for assessing the notion that gas taxes exceed profits. Comstock suggested the U.S. Energy Information Administration, a federal agency that compiles tax and revenue data about the biggest oil companies. Their numbers aren’t a perfect fit for the Johnson claim, in part because they include profits from products other than gasoline. But government and private researchers say they are the best available. We found that Johnson’s equation holds up in some years but is off base in others. The reason: Industry profits fluctuate wildly with the price of crude oil. We examined U.S. profits as well as the total net profits including foreign sales. Here’s the scorecard: U.S. profits: Gas taxes topped big oil’s domestic profits in six years out of the last 10, ending in 2008. Foreign and domestic profits: Taxes beat profits twice in 10 years. This comparison, though, leaves out foreign gas taxes. In individual years, the range can be wide. In down years, gas taxes paid by the industry -- and passed along to drivers at the pump -- can exceed even combined US-foreign profits by 100 percent (1999). In boom times, U.S. profits alone can top gas taxes paid by almost 40 percent (2006). A 2010 study by the Tax Foundation, a conservative research organization, went back even further. It found that excise taxes collected from the industry outstripped combined foreign and domestic profits in 12 of the 28 years reviewed. So let’s take stock. Johnson’s timing was good: When he gave his speech, taxes the year before came in higher than U.S. profits by the big companies. That 2008 comparison is the latest available on the federal website. But he didn’t put a time frame on his statement, stating the equation as a timeless fact. And if you include foreign profits, it’s not on target even for 2008. The reality is it depends on the year, which is an important detail. We rate Johnson’s statement Half True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2010-09-03T16:11:58	2009-10-10	['None']

pomt-09758	The cap-and-trade bill will mean "2 million jobs lost."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/05/energycitizensorg/claims-cap-and-trade-will-cause-job-losses/	EnergyCitizens.org has a new complaint about the cap-and-trade bill: It's a job killer. In an Oct. 4, 2009, ad in the Washington Post , the group said that "2 million jobs lost" is "another unfortunate truth about Congress's climate bill." The organization, which includes business associations, antitax groups, transportation companies and the American Petroleum Institute, has ramped up criticism of the sweeping cap-and-trade bill since the Senate took up its own version of the legislation in late September. The House has already passed its version of the bill; it aims to lower carbon pollution 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 by capping carbon emissions and requiring firms to buy credits, either from the government or from other companies, to continue polluting. Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits will ultimately harm consumers and business. They argue that phasing out fossil fuels will require big job cuts and many employment opportunities will be sent overseas. EnergyCitizens.org is among the critics. The group's ad cites a May 27 study of the House bill written for the National Black Chamber of Commerce, which opposes the bill, by private consulting firm CRA International. The study predicts that net job losses could be as high as 2.5 million by 2030 and 3 million in 2050. CRA International does not dispute the fact that cap-and-trade would create new jobs. But, "despite the promise of green jobs, ACESA would, if enacted, inevitably depress total employment from baseline levels. The bill would divert resources now used to produce additional goods and services into the work of obtaining energy from sources that are more costly than fossil fuels." That outlook doesn't square with what we've been hearing from lawmakers who support a cap-and-trade plan. The backers of the House version say the legislation would create "millions of new clean-energy jobs." The authors of the Senate version say, "This bill includes targeted protection for our manufacturing sector to ensure that American companies remain competitive and jobs remain here at home. New programs will train workers to succeed in the new energy economy. Agriculture and rural America will see a boom in investments in biofuels and alternative energy sources." Both bills include funding for worker training and expanded unemployment benefits; for example, the House bill would provide 156 weeks of benefits, helping to pay for health insurance, job training and employment search assistance to those who lose their jobs as the result of cap-and-trade. But neither House nor Senate lawmakers working on the legislation have pinned down exactly how many jobs their bills would eliminate and create, so we decided to look at other estimates. The Center for American Progress, another liberal group, says the bill could create a net increase of about 1.7 million jobs so long as $150 billion is dedicated to the clean-energy industry every year. "These job gains would be enough — on their own — to reduce the unemployment rate in today’s economy by about one full percentage point, to 8.4 percent from current 9.4 percent levels — even after taking into full account the inevitable job losses in conventional fossil fuel sectors of the U.S. economy as they contract," according to the June 2009 report. And a second analysis done by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a group that is supporting the bill, estimates that the cap-and-trade bill could create anywhere between 600,000 and 1 million new jobs by 2030. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report in September 2009 that the cap-and-trade plan would have a minor effect on employment in the long-run. "The small effect on overall employment would mask a significant shift in the composition of employment over time," according to the report. "A cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions would reduce the number of jobs in industries that produce carbon-based energy, use energy intensively in their production processes, or produce products whose use involves energy consumption, because those industries would experience the greatest increases in costs and declines in sales." But "the shifts in demand caused by the policy would also create new employment opportunities in some industries." Stephen Seidel, vice president for policy analysis and general counsel at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said, "Estimating jobs is a very difficult task for the limited modeling tools that we have." Jobs will almost certainly be lost and created under a cap-and-trade program, it's just a matter to what degree, he said. The CRA International report used in the EnergyCitizens.org ad "falls on the high end." So, back to EnergyCitizens.org's claim that 2 million jobs will be lost under cap-and-trade. As we've shown, the job predictions are all over the map. Supporters of cap-and-trade predict an increase. CRA, which was hired by an opponent of the proposal, says jobs will be lost. The independent CBO characterizes it as a wash. Of all these groups, we're inclined to believe the CBO, since it is independent. But we can't rule out the possibility that there could be gains or losses on either end, as the predictions aligned with supporters and opponents suggest. So we find the ad's claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07650	Says that President Obama said in 2008 that his proposed greenhouse gas regulations "will bankrupt" anyone who wants to build a new coal-fired power plant.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/mar/14/ohio-coal-association/ohio-coal-industry-says-obama-promised-bankrupt-co/	It’s 2008 all over again, based on a claim that recently surfaced from Ohio’s coal industry. That was the year Barack Obama won the presidency. Ten months earlier, the candidate -- a Democratic senator from Illinois who was campaigning for the presidential nomination -- did a wide-ranging, videotaped interview with the San Francisco Chronicle’s editorial board that included his prescription for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Before the campaign would end, his political opponents, including Sarah Palin, discovered the interview on the newspaper’s website and tried to use it against Obama in coal-rich states like Ohio. Maybe you’ve forgotten about it. The coal industry, in a long battle against proposals to cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing coal use, has not. Mike Carey, president of the Ohio Coal Association, brought up Obama’s statement anew when he testified March 1 to a House subcommittee on energy and power, in advance of a proposed House Republican bill that would strip the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of its ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. "We absolutely must oppose the new effort by the Obama administration to eliminate coal through the new proposed plant emissions and greenhouse gas regulations," Carey said. "In 2008, President Obama said, ‘If someone wants to build a new coal-fired power plant they can, but it will bankrupt them because they will be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that’s being emitted.’ " Later in his testimony, Carey added, "Remember what President Obama promised; they will bankrupt anyone who plans to build a coal facility." Did Obama really promise that? It’s a question that matters in states that employ coal miners and rely on coal-fired electricity, especially as the U.S. EPA under Obama prepares to restrict carbon emissions. During a break in the House hearing, we asked Carey for his source for the quote. Then we went back to the original San Francisco Chronicle interview in its entirety, transcribed the parts in which Obama discussed coal, and examined the context of Obama’s remarks. Obama at the time had proposed an aggressive plan to reduce the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by attaching a price for emissions. The allowable level of emissions would ratchet down yearly, Obama said, with money raised from this system getting invested in cleaner technologies. This would not only create incentives for reducing carbon emissions, he said, but it would also expand the use of wind and solar power, bio-fuels and, potentially, "clean coal," in which carbon emissions could be captured and sequestered in a way that might do no harm. Such clean coal research is ongoing, with vigorous debate as to whether it will someday be applied on a commercial scale. Obama made clear in the interview that he was not suggesting an end to coal use. Too much of the country already uses it in existing power plants and factories. In a portion of the interview his critics failed to note, he said: "This notion of no coal, I think, is an illusion, because the fact of the matter is that right now, we are getting a lot of our energy from coal, and China is building a coal-fired plant once a week. So what we have to do then is we have to figure out how can we use coal without emitting greenhouse gases and carbon. And how can we sequester that carbon and capture it? If we can't, then we're going to still be working on alternatives." But Obama also made clear that he wanted to transition away from building new coal-fired plants, saying that the price on emissions for building one -- using old technology -- would be prohibitive under his plan. Carey said in his testimony that the Obama administration "promised" a "war on coal," which is a claim we believe goes too far. The Obama administration has unquestionably angered the coal industry with rules or proposals affecting air quality standards, coal ash, renewable energy and the issuance of permits needed for coal mining -- all mentioned by Carey in his testimony. But Obama never declared war, and environmentalists and many others have a very different take on this so-called assault. Yet Obama said exactly what Carey quoted him as saying on a point that is especially current, considering the EPA’s new rules, announced this year. To repeat the then-candidate’s statement: "If someone wants to build a new coal-fired power plant they can, but it will bankrupt them because they will be charged a huge sum for all the greenhouse gas that's being emitted." Why, then, aren’t we rating Carey’s claim True? Two reasons: "President Obama" did not make the statement. Obama the U.S. senator and candidate for president did. And that leads to the second reason. Carey suggests that Obama is carrying out the threat he made in 2008, but the new rules from the EPA are different from the cap-and-trade proposal Obama had in 2008. Candidate Obama’s methods were to be more aggressive. In fact, the EPA has shown some flexibility, agreeing to phase in carbon restrictions on new or expanded plants based on their size. The agency also announced on the same day as Carey testified that it will delay its deadlines for businesses that must report their emissions. Carey quoted Obama accurately but not fully, and the regulations and methods that Obama’s EPA wants -- backed by a U.S. Supreme Court decision saying the agency has to regulate greenhouse gas emissions -- are not the same as the candidate proposed.

pomt-12488	"Ted Nugent killed in hunting accident."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/01/blog-posting/reports-about-ted-nugent-dying-or-not-hunting-trip/	A series of Internet posts that claimed outspoken rocker Ted Nugent had been killed in a hunting accident — then was assassinated, then was faking his own death — was all fake news. A fake news story that appeared on multiple disreputable websites on April 28, 2017, carried a headline that read, "Conservative icon Ted Nugent killed in hunting accident." Facebook users reported the story as being potentially fabricated, as part of the site’s efforts to keep fake news out of users’ news feeds. The story, which is fake, said Nugent was hunting from a tree stand before dawn somewhere in Montana when he was shot "in the chest by a hunter with a scope nearly a quarter of a mile away who believed he was a brown bear." The unnamed hunter faced manslaughter charges and was being held by state police in Boseman (which is really spelled Bozeman). But that’s not the end of the story, by a long shot. The post originated on April 28 at TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a parody website that has been the source of several fake news stories that we’ve previously checked. TheLastLineOfDefense.org fabricates posts keyed to topics designed to inflame conservatives. The articles quite often end up being passed around on multiple websites, often without an indication that they are fake. TheLastLineOfDefense.org doesn’t immediately indicate that any of its stories are fake, but its About Us link notes that "all articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney." In this case, the site followed up its own story with another fake post the same day that said Nugent actually had been killed purposely by a "white sympathizer" named James Alan Whitland, under the alias Alex Hayne. This story also ended up on multiple sites. Whitland, the second post read, had been a teenage hitman for the Black Panthers and had assisted the man who killed five Dallas police officers in 2016. The post said Whitland had been caught by a game warden after Nugent was killed. Nugent and his wife Shermane posted a Facebook Live video the same day he was supposedly shot, confirming that he was alive. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But there’s more: TheLastLineOfDefense.org then posted a third item, on April 29, saying that Nugent was actually still alive. The third post said Nugent actually had called "local channel WKLU NBC2" (actually an Indianapolis-area radio station) and made up the story and had been "drinking iced tea at the local police station with his accomplices" as the news hit social media. This fake post said two Bozeman police officers had been charged with helping create the hoax and had been "relieved of their duties." Nugent faced a year in jail and more than $1 million in fines over the waste of resources committed to the hoax, the site said, admitting that TheLastLineOfDefense.org had been fooled, too. Of course, this was all fake, because the site is the outlet that made up the stories in the first place. Our contact with the supposed creator of TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a person who says his name is Zeke Wilekenmeyer, did not reply to our email seeking comment on the ruse. Nugent’s assistant, Linda Peterson, did reply to PolitiFact’s questions about the stories, sending a two-word email that read, "Fake news." It’s apparent Nugent was not killed, nor did he perpetrate his own death hoax. The only real news about him recently is his trip to the White House on April 19. We rate the statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-11362	Says Rep. Martha McSally "is a #FlipFlopBorderHawk."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2018/apr/03/kelli-ward/Is-GOP-congresswoman-McSally-a-border-hawk-flip-fl/	U.S. Senate hopeful Kelli Ward called out her Republican opponent as a flip-flopper on a crucial matter to Arizona: border security. "Hey Martha McSally, we could discuss your record a lot easier if you agreed to publicly debate the issues. But since you refuse to, will you at least agree to be honest with the voters? #FlipFlopBorderHawk #TimeToDebate #NoMoreFlakes #AZSEN," Ward said in a March 16 Facebook post. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The Senate seat is up for grabs as Republican Sen. Jeff Flake’s term comes to an end. Flake isn’t running for re-election. The Republican primary is Aug. 28. Ward, a Republican physician who has served in the state Senate, linked her comment against McSally to a post on Newsmax headlined, "Republicans side with Dems against border wall funding." It cited a joint statement from McSally, a U.S. House member since 2015, and Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, acknowledging both the need for border security and for stewardship of taxpayer dollars. Has McSally flip-flopped on her support for the border wall? Ward's campaign pointed to McSally's past reservations on the effectiveness of a 2,000-mile border wall, as well as her initial hesitation to approve money for border barriers requested by President Donald Trump. Yet McSally — who chairs a House subcommittee responsible for oversight of border security programs — ultimately voted to appropriate the funds. Overall, McSally has been neither a fierce critic nor a staunch supporter of the border wall. Ward campaign spotlights McSally’s questions on border wall funding Ward’s team turned the spotlight on a March 15 tweet from McSally that said, "I have always supported building a wall," linking to a Fox News interview in which she decried California’s immigration policies as too lenient. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But McSally wasn’t always such a fan, Ward's campaign said, pointing to comments about her and that she made in 2017. The Hill in January 2017 reported that Hurd, from Texas, "actively opposes the wall," while McSally and Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., "expressed skepticism" about its effectiveness in stopping illegal immigration. CNN reported on a rowdy town hall in her district the next month and said McSally "made it clear she wasn't sold on Trump's plan to build a border wall." "Not a continuous, 2,000-mile border wall, no," CNN quoted McSally as saying. The Wall Street Journal in April 2017 reported that McSally said walls do little to stop criminal organizations from getting across the border. It cited the McSally-Hurd oversight letter with questions about the request for taxpayer money. (McSally and Hurd are chair and vice-chair, respectively, of the House Committee on Homeland Security’s Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee.) "While we have both publicly stated in the past that we believe physical barriers to be one of many tools required to gain operational control of the border, we also believe that an expenditure this large, and submitted with limited details, deserves additional scrutiny to ensure funds are being used effectively in pursuit of our shared goal of securing the southwest border," their letter said. It listed several questions, including whether the department would consider existing manmade and natural barriers when constructing new barriers. After Trump issued an executive order in January 2017 calling for the border wall and the hiring of an additional 5,000 Border Patrol agents, McSally said it was a "strong start in the right direction." "When it comes to barriers, they are important where appropriate, but only part of the equation. What we need is a comprehensive strategy to grow situational awareness, build operational control, and dismantle the cartels and their networks," she said. In July 2017, McSally voted in favor of a spending bill that included money for border fencing and wall construction planning. But as AZCentral.com noted, McSally praised the bill for what it did for defense, veterans and water, but stopped short of mentioning the border wall. McSally campaign spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair told PolitiFact that McSally is "unequivocally in favor of building a wall," with the addition of technology and agents. McSally has also sponsored and supported several bills to increase border security since joining Congress in 2015, her campaign said. In a November 2017 Fox News interview, McSally said a necessary border strategy is one that "absolutely includes the border wall and physical infrastructure where appropriate." McSally's remarks and actions in 2017 show that while she hasn't been an effusive supporter of the wall, she favors it to an extent. It's worth mentioning that McSally represents a district that voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. Flip-flop or not? Does that mean McSally has flip-flopped on border wall funding? Josiah M. Heyman, an anthropology professor and director of the Center for Interamerican and Border Studies at the University of Texas at El Paso, said he understood Ward’s point given McSally’s 2017 reticence. He noted that an appropriations bill she voted for was for "a very limited version of the wall," and much of it restricted to reworking segments that already exist. The funds also can’t be used to build any of the new wall prototypes, Heyman said. Elizabeth F. Cohen, an associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, said "it is disingenuous to claim that someone who has acted cautiously or recommended scrutiny of border wall plans is either for or against building the wall." "McSally has voted in favor of funding border fencing and wall construction," Cohen said. "Cautious support may in fact ultimately be quite important to the realization of effective border security given that there are many types of border fences and walls that are ineffective or dangerous." Our ruling Ward in a Facebook post called McSally a #FlipFlopBorderHawk. In 2017, McSally publicly questioned a funding request for border barriers — due to limited details — but ultimately voted in favor of it. McSally has said a border wall alone will not stop illegal immigration or criminal organizations, but can work in certain areas. In 2018, McSally has offered a strong embrace, saying she has "always supported building a wall." Ward’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-02313	"Wisconsin wages are declining at double the rate of other states."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/31/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-wages-are-declining-wisconsin-doub/	At the center of Mary Burke’s economic critique of the Gov. Scott Walker era is the charge that Wisconsin’s recovery from the Great Recession has lagged behind other states. In her recently unveiled jobs plan, the Democratic candidate for governor marshalled statistics to make a case that progress on jobs and earnings has been lackluster or even nonexistent. One example: "Wisconsin wages are declining at double the rate of other states, and current indicators suggest these trends will continue if we stay on the current path," according to Burke’s plan, which came out March 25, 2014. Are we really losing ground on wages that quickly? We started with the source cited in Burke’s plan: "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, private-sector wages in Wisconsin fell 2.2% in the 12 months ending September 2012, double the 1.1% decline experienced by the nation overall." Those numbers were familiar to us. They were included in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story headlined "American workers losing ground on wages." That story ran May 26, 2013, citing the most-recent wage data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. It showed Wisconsin wages were declining at double the rate of other states. But that was then, and this is now. Newer numbers Wage data for both the state and nation is volatile and fluctuates strongly when measured in increments of 12 months or one quarter. Since those September 2012 figures were released, the BLS has published four quarterly updates. Each update looks at one quarter and compares it with the same quarter a year earlier. (Data notes: There’s a reporting lag of about six months due to the time spent collecting and analyzing the data; the most recent available runs through September 2013. These are averages, so they point to a general trend.) It turns out Burke’s campaign plan selected the worst quarterly wages report during the Walker era and the end of the final term of Gov. Jim Doyle, who left office after 2010. The report she cited ranked Wisconsin at 47th among the states for percent change in average weekly wage (including bonuses) for the one-year period ending in September 2012 quarter. The average wage fell -- losing 2.2 percent in preliminary calculations and 2.3 percent in the final analysis. That was a reduction for workers of $18 a week. But that trend did not hold either in Wisconsin or nationally. Wisconsin’s private-sector wage growth has made a big move in the opposite direction, topping the national average starting with the March 2013 quarterly report. We found: -- For the quarter ending December 2012, the average weekly wage went up (4.9 percent), not down, compared with the same period a year earlier. That was tied for 18th best among the states, and only slightly trailed the national average wage increase. -- By March 2013, the average increase was 1.2 percent, three times better than the national average. -- By June 2013, the increase was 2.2 percent, slightly above the national average and tied for 19th. -- For the one-year period ending in the September 2013 quarter, the state’s wage growth was fifth best in the country, beating the national average (3.4 percent gain vs. 1.9 percent gain). The picture changes This latest report came out five days before the release of Burke’s economic plan. It shows Wisconsin’s wage growth in that period ahead of all adjoining Midwest states and behind only North Dakota, South Dakota, Louisiana and Nebraska nationally. Drilling down, average Wisconsin wages grew 2.8 percent in goods-producing jobs and 3.7 percent in service jobs. In sum, the 2013 picture on wage growth so far is much different than the one for 2012, but is omitted by Burke. Her jobs plan pointedly blames "misguided" Walker actions over three years for helping make Wisconsin’s recovery an outlier -- while examining only one quarterly report of wage data from 2012. We filled in that gap some more by looking at other quarterly wage reports that reflect wage trends in Walker’s first year, 2011. In those, Wisconsin’s wage increase topped the national mark twice. In a third, average wages dropped both nationally and in Wisconsin (-1.6 percent and -2.2 percent, respectively). Burke’s campaign told us she meant to spotlight a long-term gap between Wisconsin and U.S. earnings growth trends. That gap exists, according to a Journal Sentinel story on March 25, 2014 that said, since 2009, Wisconsin's personal net earnings have rebounded after the recession but more slowly than the nation, based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. That data came out the same day Burke made her jobs plan public. Burke’s jobs plan does, we note, discuss job and wage trends in the context both of Walker and the years preceding his election. But her campaign pointed us to nothing that shows Wisconsin’s average wages have dropped over an extended period, much less at twice the rate of the mark in other states. Our rating Burke’s economic plan said that "Wisconsin wages are declining at double the rate of other states." That was the situation in one quarter ending in September 2012, but Wisconsin wages are not declining at all based on much more current data. Burke’s plan cherry-picked an outdated report that turned out to be an anomaly. More recent data that shows Wisconsin’s average wages not only growing but topping the national mark three quarters in a row. All this is easily accessed on federal websites and publicized in news releases issued by federal officials. We think that makes this claim not only false but ridiculous. Pants on Fire.

pomt-11139	Says Austin has "been ranked repeatedly as one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/may/31/greg-casar/greg-casar-says-austin-ranked-repeatedly-high-econ/	An official concerned about government not enforcing fair housing regulations says Austin has long been known to be a city divided. Greg Casar, who represents District 4 on the Austin City Council, told the Austin American-Statesman in May 2018: "We do have a really serious problem in Austin. We’ve been ranked repeatedly as one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country." Economic segregation can briefly be defined as residential division by income. And has Austin repeatedly been ranked high by that metric? Casar notes three studies To our request for elaboration, Shelby Alexander in Casar’s council office said by email that three recent studies classified Austin as economically segregated to a great degree. A February 2015 study, explored at the time in an American-Statesman news story, ranked the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area the country’s most economically segregated large metro area. That study, overseen by Richard Florida for the University of Toronto-based Martin Prosperity Institute, evaluated the nation’s 350-plus metro areas based on individual and combined measures of income, educational and occupational segregation plus an overall economic segregation index. The study ranked Austin first for economic segregation among metro areas with populations of 1 million or more. The San Antonio area ranked third, the Houston area was fourth and the Dallas area was seventh. Among all U.S. metros, the study found the Tallahassee and Trenton areas to have the greatest economic segregation, followed by the metro areas of Austin, Tucson, San Antonio, Houston, Ann Arbor, Bridgeport and Los Angeles: SOURCE: Report, "Segregated City, The Geography of Economic Segregation in America’s Metros," Martin Prosperity Institute, Rotman School of Management University of Toronto, February 2015 We followed up with Florida, who pointed us by email to his 2017 book, "The New Urban Crisis," in which Florida says that since 2003, he’s explored his finding that the country’s "creative cities" including Austin double as "epicenters of economic inequality." "Austin," the book says, "is divided east to west… Its creative class is concentrated in a huge wedge to the west that runs from downtown through its high-end suburbs out to Round Rock and in another separate bloc in the far southeastern portion of the metro. Austin’s downtown has seen substantial revitalization, including the development of large amounts of new housing. The service-class and smaller working-class areas are massed entirely in the more disadvantaged areas of the east." Also pointed out by Casar's aide: A 2017 study funded by the Urban Institute presenting economic segregation indexes for the 100 most populous U.S. "commuting zones" (similar to metro areas) as of the 1990 census. Generally, the institute study says, the "share of Americans living in middle-income neighborhoods dropped from 65 percent in 1970 to 42 percent in 2009, and the share of families living in neighborhoods defined as either rich or poor has grown rapidly." Since 2000, the report says, "the number of people living in areas of concentrated poverty has nearly doubled, from 7.2 million to 13.8 million in 2013." Also, the report says, "the proportion of families living in high-income neighborhoods has risen." The researchers analyzed economic segregation, the report says, by using the Generalized Neighborhood Sorting Index (GNSI), described as measuring how many people of similar incomes "clump" together within a metro region, how many poor households tend to live in neighborhoods made up of mostly other poor households and how many rich households tend to live in neighborhoods made up of other richer households. From 1990 through 2010, the report says, Austin ranked among a dozen communities consistently placing in the top quarter of the nation’s economically segregated areas. But as of 2010, 10 of the 12 areas had greater eco-segregation, the report says: New York; Charlotte, N.C.; Kansas City; Philadelphia; Louisville; San Francisco; Nashville; Dallas; St. Louis; and Washington, D.C. Among all 100 zones, Austin in 2010 ranked 18th in economic segregation--up from 25th in 2000 but down from 13th in 1990, according to a table in the study’s appendix. Dallas, the table says, was 15th, Houston was 28th, El Paso was 36th, San Antonio was 42nd, Fort Worth was 43rd, Brownsville was 86th. That year, the table says, New York ranked first by the metric ahead of No. 2 Bridgeport, Conn., and No. 3 Charlotte. Alexander also noted an April 2018 institute report ranking cities--not metro areas--by income and racial inclusion. By email, the institute’s Christina Stacy answered our inquiry by confirming that in 2013 by the institute’s analysis, Austin was outpaced for "income segregation" by only nine of 274 cities. INCOME SEGREGATION INDEX, 2013, AUSTIN (BLUE) AND NATIONAL AVG (YELLOW) SOURCE: Report, "Measuring Inclusion in America’s Cities," the Urban Institute, April 25, 2018 "Although Austin ranks as highly segregated," Stacy wrote, "it did improve on segregation between 2000 and 2013 while most other cities worsened. So, it has shown some improvement, but is still toward the bottom of the pack." Another expert Another expert, Brown University sociologist John Logan, answered our inquiry with an email pointing out research placing the Austin area in 2010-14 16th among the nation’s most populous cities and 17th among all evaluated metro areas for economic segregation. Logan, presented with Casar’s claim, commented that the "Austin metro is on the high end, but not so high as to merit the characterization as ‘one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country.’" "The general point is that all U.S. metro areas are highly segregated by income," Logan wrote, "and that has consequences for the lives of residents." We circled back to Casar, who agreed in replies emailed by his office that Austin’s level of economic segregation might be decreasing and that no study placed Austin by itself No. 1 by that metric. "You could see how looking beyond the city proper makes sense," Casar replied. "Consider, for example, that it’s commonplace for smaller municipalities within a larger metro area to show segregation, with some predominantly higher income and others predominantly lower income. It's also a problem that some central city neighborhoods see higher income people leave to suburbs nearby, thereby exacerbating segregation. It's also common for some lower income people to be pushed out of city limits, further away from services, also exacerbating segregation." Our ruling Casar said Austin has "been ranked repeatedly as one of the most, if not the most, economically segregated cities in the country." Austin and the Austin region have repeatedly been ranked among the nation’s most economically segregated areas. We didn’t find a ranking that placed the city or area No. 1 by this indicator though the University of Toronto study ranked the Austin area first among areas of 1 million residents or more. In that analysis, the Austin area landed third overall. We rate Casar’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

"We got back every dime used to rescue the banks," he told the crowd gathered Oct. 18 in Victory Park. "We made that happen." As of this month, four years have passed since federal lawmakers salvaged some of the nations largest banks with the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. But, now, the question is, how much of the money has the government received back? We decided to crunch the numbers. In past rulings, PolitiFact has looked into statements about the auto industry bailout, and last month, we ruled Mostly False on a claim from former President Bill Clinton’s that the total bailout program has earned a profit. But, Obama’s claim about the bank bailouts, specifically, seemed to be worth a fresh look. To start, we reached out to the Obama campaign, which directed us first to the U.S. Treasury, which releases daily updates on the Temporary Assets Relief Program. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which created the TARP, initially offered up to $700 billion to banks, auto companies, insurance agencies and mortgage lenders, among other groups. In 2010, Congress amended the law to limit the spending to $475 billion. Now, four years later, lawmakers have thus far distributed $466 billion of that total, according to the Treasury, and, of that total, about $370.4 billion has been returned, including $41.9 billion from interest and dividends, among other income sources. But, of those the totals, the bank payments that the president referenced are only a portion. Of the $466 billion distributed, about $245.2 billion have gone to banks, both national and local. And, as of Oct. 18, the day of the president’s speech, the government had taken back about $266.7 billion, according to the treasury count-- about $21.5 billion more than the initial investment. "TARP’s bank programs have already earned a significant profit for taxpayers," Matthew Anderson, a Treasury Department spokesman, wrote in an email to PolitiFact NH. But, that total doesn’t necessarily mean the banks have paid back in full. The treasury report shows that, of the $245.2 billion disbursements, $232.9 been have been repaid. The $33.8 billion difference between the repayments and the total cash collected has come through interest, dividends and other revenue sources. These numbers differ slightly from those reported by ProPublica, a Pulitzer-winning investigative group, which tracks the federal figures on its Bailout Tracker. ProPublica, which categorizes the payments differently, reports that banks have returned $223.9 billion, which, along with $31.9 billion collected in interest other revenues, has left the government with a $19.6 billion gain. But, the point is the same, noted Paul Kiel, who authors the Bailout Tracker. "Essentially, the treasury has realized a profit on the bank portion of the TARP investments," Kiel wrote last week in an email message. Those profits could rise even higher. The treasury, which purchased stock from 707 banks, still holds investments in about 280 of them. But, if we expand the definition, as ProPublica does, to include investment agencies and credit card companies, among other financial institutions, more than 400 companies still have debts outstanding with the government, Kiel wrote in a September blog post. Most of these banks, however, are small institutions who are struggling to stay afloat, Kiel wrote. Of the 400-plus, 162 have fallen behind on their dividend payments to the treasury, he wrote, and, according to a March report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, 130 banks were included on the government’s list of "problem banks," demonstrating "financial, operational, or managerial weaknesses that threatened their continued financial viability." "While repayments, dividends, and interest from institutions participating ... have exceeded the program’s original investment disbursements, the number of missed payments has increased over the life of the program," government officials wrote in the GAO report. "Institutions that continue to miss payments and problem institutions may have difficulty ever fully repaying their … investments." Our ruling: Not all of the banks who received TARP money have repaid the loans. In fact, 400-plus banks are still on the government’s red list -- more than have completed the payments -- and, according to the GAO, some may never pay the money back. But, the fact remains, due to interest, dividends and other revenue streams, the government has received more money back ($266.7 billion, according to the Treasury) than it handed out to banks under the bailout law ($245.2 billion).

pomt-01899	"Light rail does not reduce congestion."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jul/03/no-tax-tracks/greenlight-pinellas-opponent-says-light-rail-does-/	Critics of the Greenlight Pinellas mass transit initiative are attacking the plan at full speed by questioning the effectiveness of the proposal’s light rail line. The group’s home page, RailTaxFacts.com, features a commercial arguing against pro-transit talking points, such as light rail creating long-term economic growth and reducing traffic congestion. The video shows a "Truth Meter" (not to be confused with PolitiFact Florida’s Truth-O-Meter) rating the statements false. "Light rail does not reduce congestion," the website says under the video. Greenlight Pinellas plans a 24-mile light rail route from St. Petersburg to Clearwater projected to cost $2 billion over a decade. We wondered if the idea of reduced congestion was a dependable guidepost, or if we’re all being taken for a ride. Railing against rail Light rail is generally considered to be a rail line that either shares space with roads or is a separate, above-ground commuter line, as opposed to a subway or elevated train. The Greenlight Pinellas plan calls for a proposed line with 16 stations to provide a 57-minute total trip time between St. Pete and Clearwater. It’s slated to be installed and operational within 10 years and serve as an anchor for future transit additions. Greenlight also has plans for bus rapid transit and expanded service, which we’ve addressed before, but in this case, No Tax For Tracks says a common talking point by light rail advocates is that a rail system will decrease congestion. One of the group’s supporting links is a Washington Post Wonkblog post linking to another post from The Atlantic suggesting light rail’s effects on congestion are debatable. The other piece of evidence is an April 2014 analysis by David McKalip, a St. Petersburg neurosurgeon and No Tax For Tracks supporter, concluding light rail actually increases congestion. McKalip writes about how despite extensive rail investment in Portland, Ore., the city saw more people in cars and higher traffic volumes in the subsequent years. He also cites another Atlantic post discussing a study of four British cities that showed light rail didn’t get people out of their cars, but did take them off buses. "I have yet to find any science ever that says congestion goes down," McKalip told PolitiFact Florida. "Experts say, ‘do not make that assertion.’ " McKalip followed up his post with another on July 1 saying car travel times in the Tampa Bay area are routinely faster than in other cities with rail and there is no concrete evidence of a relationship between congestion reduction and light rail. An essay by public transit planning consultant and author Jarrett Walker says that while transit has several benefits that make cities more sustainable and improves quality of life, a definite correlation between service and fewer cars isn’t apparent. Thinking ahead Many transit experts don’t agree with that conclusion. Todd Litman, founder and executive director of the Victoria Transport Policy Institute in Canada, said "traffic congestion and economic impacts vary considerably depending on specific circumstances and how the impacts are measured." He said that a transit system with sufficient demand and adequate supporting policies can indeed reduce congestion. He cited several studies that showed congestion increased at a higher rate in areas without light rail. One showed that in Denver, there was a 31 percent increase in vehicle traffic in light rail corridors, as opposed to 41 percent elsewhere. Another said Baltimore’s congestion increase dropped from 2.8 percent to 1.5 percent annually after building light rail. One Los Angeles study said people who lived within a half-mile of one light rail line in the city traveled an average of 10 to 12 miles less by car per day. Another said that Utah’s TRAX system dropped the estimated number of vehicles on the studied corridor from 44,000 to 22,300 per day. PSTA told PolitiFact Florida that reducing future congestion is the guideline Greenlight Pinellas is addressing, offering Pinellas County residents a transportation option in the face of projected population growth across the region. Vukan Vuchic, transportation engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said that’s a sufficient way to measure a reduction in congestion. Cities inevitably will keep growing, and thanks to an ingrained car culture, the only way to ensure a net loss of vehicles is to completely reorganize entire cities with pedestrian zones and policies that make car ownership prohibitive. "Yes, we see people are buying more cars and driving more miles, but we didn’t give people a choice," he said, adding that communities must make a conscious choice to enact many policies aimed at reducing congestion. "It’s not automatic. It’s not like you put in a rail line and it’s automatically beautiful." Our ruling No Tax For Tracks said "light rail does not reduce congestion." The studies we looked at didn’t show a strict reduction in congestion. However, there are studies that show congestion grows more slowly in communities that have implemented light rail, especially if they do so in conjunction with other policies that give people an option not to drive.

pomt-06185	"Only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors in this country . . . Barack Obama."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/12/mitt-romney/romney-says-only-obama-has-cut-medicare/	Medicare, the health insurance program for seniors and the disabled, constitutes a massive and growing share of federal spending. Yet Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney says that in the more than four decades since its inception, only one president has ever cut the program’s budget. "Let's not forget, only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors in this country, and it's Barack Obama," Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, said in a Republican presidential debate on Dec. 10, 2011. We looked into the accuracy of that statement and found Romney is way off. First, did Obama cut Medicare? The Romney campaign did not respond to our inquiry about this statement. We assume that when he said Obama cut Medicare, he was talking about the 2010 health care reform law that, among other things, reduces future Medicare spending by $500 billion. But that’s just it -- the cuts don’t come from the current Medicare budget, they put a leash on future growth and payment increases. PolitiFact has explored this before: "The Affordable Care Act does reduce Medicare spending by $500 billion over the next 10 years. But here’s the catch: Those dollars aren’t taken out of the current budget, they are not actual cuts, and nowhere does the bill actually eliminate any current benefits," we wrote last month. Which brings us to the next point. We note that, in the debate, Romney specified that Obama cut Medicare "for seniors." That sounds like he meant that Obama cut Medicare benefits. That notion falls flat too. The health care law does not reduce benefits -- in fact, it enhances them. "The Affordable Care Act improves the benefits in Medicare, in terms of prevention, in terms of filling in the donut hole in Medicare Part D for prescription drugs," said Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Oberlander said there’s only one "leg to stand on" in interpreting that the law reduces benefits. "The Affordable Care Act reduces payments to Medicare Advantage plans. They’re overpaid by quite a lot -- excess payments above and beyond what it costs to treat people," he said. "As a result of that, there are projections that some of those (plans) are going to trim some of the extra benefits." Those could include benefits for vision or dental care. "But," Oberlander said, "that hasn’t happened so far, and it doesn’t affect the core benefits, the required Medicare benefits." Did other presidents make cuts? In short, yes. John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, a coalition of trade associations, labor unions and advocacy groups that supports health care reform, offered some historical perspective on the matter. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan in his first year in office signed an omnibus budget reconciliation act that raised Medicare deductibles for beneficiaries. Rother said he considers that a cut in benefits. Two years later, Reagan and Congress enacted legislation that changed the way Medicare reimbursed hospitals. The program’s costs had been growing exponentially as hospitals treated patients and then sent the federal government the bills. It was known as "retrospective cost-based reimbursement." The new law established a "prospective payment system," which categorized inpatient admission cases into what were called diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). In this system, Medicare pays hospitals a flat rate for each inpatient case. "The system was intended to motivate hospitals to change the way they deliver services. With DRGs, it did not matter what hospitals charged anymore -- Medicare capped their payments," according to a 2001 report by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General. The resulting savings to Medicare were $21-billion in the first three years, exceeding even the Congressional Budget Office projections. It cut the program, Rother said, but did not affect benefits. In 1987, Reagan signed a law that expanded Medicare benefits, including drug coverage and catastrophic illness coverage. But when George H.W. Bush took office, he repealed it. So Rother puts Bush in the column of presidents who cut Medicare for seniors. The Medicare program saw another major overhaul in 1997. President Bill Clinton signed the Balanced Budget Act, which tightened payments to doctors, nursing homes, home health agencies and health insurance plans and expanded the types of private plans that could participate in Medicare (the part of the program now known as Medicare Advantage). Its goal was to trim $393.8 billion in spending over 10 years. But it’s a trickier question to answer whether that law cut benefits. "With Clinton, it’s an indirect effect," Rother said. "It did cut reimbursements to several providers who claimed they would not be able to serve the beneficiary population." The tally, then: * Reagan cut Medicare by reducing payments to hospitals, and he cut benefits by raising deductibles. * George H.W. Bush cut benefits by repealing a law that would have expanded coverage for drugs and catastrophic illness. * Clinton cut Medicare by changing payments to doctors and other providers, which could be considered to have an indirect effect on beneficiaries. * Obama cut future Medicare spending but expanded benefits. Our ruling Romney said, "only one president has ever cut Medicare for seniors in this country and it's Barack Obama." The statement gets it wrong on every front. The Medicare belt was tightened in 1981 and 1982 under Reagan, in 1989 under the first President Bush and again in 1997 under Clinton. So Obama is in no way the only president to cut the program. Further, by specifying that Obama cut Medicare "for seniors," Romney seems to mean that the president slashed benefits, not just the program’s spending. That’s even more egregious. Other presidents have made changes to Medicare that reduced benefits for seniors, while the health care law Obama signed actually increases them. That’s a lot of inaccuracy in a single sentence. We rate Romney’s statement False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-12-12T17:47:59	2011-12-10	['Medicare_(United_States)', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-11793	"We’ve cut taxes 75 times, cut $7.5 billion worth in taxes, and as a result we’ve added over 1.3 million jobs."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/nov/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-he-cut-taxes-75-times-created-13-m/	For years, Republican Gov. Rick Scott has touted an ever-growing pile of tax cuts he has achieved for the state. In 2013, he claimed he cut taxes 24 times. In 2014, that number grew to 40. Now, as Scott rounds out his last full year in office (and ponders a run for the U.S. Senate), the tally has been raised once more. "We’ve cut taxes 75 times, cut $7.5 billion worth in taxes, and as a result we’ve added over 1.3 million jobs," Scott said Nov. 9 during a news conference in Tampa. Scott's past boasts rated Half True, because Scott relied on some creative math to reach his tax cut total. He did that again in this claim, but he went even further when he said those tax cuts resulted in the creation of 1.3 million jobs. Experts say the cuts may be a factor in job growth, but they're likely not the most critical one. "The governor takes credit for all the jobs created since he took office, but with so many other driving factors at play, it's difficult to attribute these jobs to the tax cuts," said Joe Pennisi with the Florida Policy Institute. Breaking down the cuts Scott’s team sent PolitiFact Florida a list of 82 "tax cuts" that reduced government revenues by a combined $7.7 billion. (You can see the list from 2011-16 here; the 2017 list is here.) As in times past, the list counts Florida's mostly annual sales tax holiday, includes reductions in fees such as lowering the cost to obtain a concealed weapons permit, and counts a measure that stopped an automatic fee increase to obtain a hunting or fishing license. Many of the measures are extremely targeted and many only affect businesses. However, they do reduce state government revenue, which is why Scott broadly defines them as a tax cut, even if they aren't. Asked to back up the governor's statement, his office sent us a more nuanced statement about how the tax cuts "helped" contribute to positive economic growth — it did not as directly link the cuts to jobs. "As the governor has said for the past seven years, cutting taxes has helped turn around Florida’s economy, made our state more business-friendly, and has allowed job creators to invest more in creating new opportunities — all of which has helped Florida businesses create more than 1.3 million new jobs," said Scott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland. We organized the list into four broad categories: targeted breaks (21 items), sales tax reductions or exemptions (25), breaks for businesses (17), and fee reductions (12). Targeted breaks The largest chunk of tax cuts reduce the amount of taxes collected on a very specific good, service or industry. Examples include tax exemptions for first responders and surviving spouses, eliminating the sales taxes on repairs to planes between 2,000 and 15,000 pounds, and increasing financial assistance for businesses to donate to community development and housing projects for low-income residents. Also counted is a renewable energy tax exemption that exempts 80 percent of the value of a renewable energy source from tangible personal property tax for all applicants, residential and nonresidential. Sales tax breaks One thing to remember about sales tax exemptions and reductions: You have to consume the goods to get the break — and most offered temporary relief. The tax cut package from 2014 included several exemptions, including a temporary cut for the purchase of cement mixing drums for cement trucks. Scott’s list also counts about $20 million worth of sales tax exemptions for child car seats and youth bike helmets, prescribed diet pet food, and prepaid college meal plans. These last until the end of 2017. The agriculture industry has also seen sales tax breaks, such as the 2015 exemption that was extended for trailers and irrigation equipment related to production. The manufacturing industry also got a permanent exemption on mechanical equipment. Exemptions in 2017 include health products for livestock poultry and aquaculture, construction building materials, feminine hygiene products and medical marijuana delivery devices. Scott counted the mostly annual tax-free shopping holiday around seven different times since 2017. From 2011-17 there was a tax-free holiday in the month of August for shoes, clothing and school supply purchases. It also exempted sales taxes on laptops and tablets, up to $750 in four of the years. Most of the holidays were three days, but in 2015, there was a 10-day period for the break. The state has offered the holiday since 1998 except in 2002, 2003, 2008, 2009. Cuts for businesses Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of research, pointed out that several tax cuts on Scott’s list aim to build a more competitive business climate, such as the permanent sales tax exemption for manufacturing equipment. He said targeting capital expenses, particularly in industries with high wages, stimulates the economy. Scott and the Legislature have worked to expand tax credits for businesses for areas such as research and development; cleaning up contaminated sites known as brownfields; and increasing the amount of money available for credits under a "new market" program. Per Scott’s wishes, the Legislature expanded the exemption for corporate income taxes from $5,000 to $25,000 in 2011, and again in 2012 to $50,000, sparing thousands of businesses from paying the tax. The hit to the state budget for both is about $30 million a year. Another notable example in this section came in the most recent legislative session when lawmakers pared the sales tax on the total rent paid for any commercial property from 6 percent to 5.8 percent, a loss of $25 million in tax revenue in 2017. Fee reductions The Legislature has targeted fees for specific licenses during Scott’s tenure. Lawmakers blocked an automatic inflation adjustment for hunting and fishing license fees costing the state almost $20 million from 2013-17. They also reduced the cost of licenses renewal for concealed weapons from $60 to $50, and then again in 2017 to $45. One significant fee reduction came in 2014 with SB 156, which rolled back motor vehicle registration fee increases, saving motorists about $25 a year per vehicle registration. No hard evidence tax cuts led to jobs No doubt, Scott has cut taxes in his seven years as governor. Our quibble is with the claim that he did it 75 times, which is an inflated statistic. His claim that those tax cuts created 1.3 million jobs, however, is on shakier ground. "It’s hard to determine exactly how many jobs the tax cuts produced; however, it's economically expected that spending more is going to help the economy and in turn create jobs," Wenner said. Experts said a bulk of the tax cuts (especially the sales tax holidays and narrow sales tax exemptions) have a minimal effect on the economy. "What causes businesses to hire more employees is demand for their services," said Jonathan Hamilton, an economic professor at the University of Florida. "The (tax cuts) on Scott’s list all account for a relatively small reduction in their costs." Pennisi pointed to research from left-leaning organizations that show tax cuts and business incentives fail to have a significant impact on economic activity and job creation. Businesses don’t necessarily use extra savings to hire more employees. "Hiring is driven by the demand for a business’ goods and services rather than the presence in the owner’s pocket of a few more dollars made available through tax cuts," Pennisi said in a 2016 brief. He said the bulk of the governor’s tax cuts would not be expected to create that demand. Looking for more evidence Scott's tax cuts can't solely be the reason the state added 1.3 million jobs? In July 2010, before Scott was elected governor, state economists predicted that the national economic recovery would mean 1 million new jobs for Florida by 2017. That was before Scott was elected or ever cut a tax. Our ruling Scott said, "We’ve cut taxes 75 times, cut $7.5 billion worth in taxes, and as a result we’ve added over 1.3 million jobs." Scott is including anything that reduces government revenues to claim he's cut taxes 75 times. But, as we've said before, the list includes things that are clearly not tax cuts. In addition, Scott is claiming those tax cuts have resulted in the creation of 1.3 million jobs. The fact is, state economists predicted Florida would add 1 million jobs in over the same time period before Scott was even elected governor and had an opportunity to enact his policies. Experts say tax cuts may be a reason the state has seen jobs rebound, but it's not the sole or even most important reason. Scott’s claim is partially accurate and overplays the connection to more than 1 million jobs. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-10277	John McCain has seven houses.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/22/barack-obama/updated-eight-houses-for-john-and-cindy-mccain/	UPDATED: How many homes John McCain owns became an unlikely campaign issue on Aug. 20, 2008, when he told the Politico Web site that he didn't know the answer. "I think — I'll have my staff get to you," McCain told Politico in Las Cruces, N.M. "It's condominiums where — I'll have them get to you." It's not hard to see how McCain got confused. The McCain family owns properties in multiple states under several names. We checked this issue earlier when it was raised on the campaign trail by Barack Obama's top strategist, David Axelrod. Axelrod was arguing that the McCain campaign is guilty of hypocrisy in trying to paint Obama as an elitist. "Obviously, his strategists met on the portico of the McCain estate in Sedona — or maybe in one of his six other houses — and decided what line of attack they were going to use," Axelrod told Adam Nagourney of the New York Times. The Democratic National Committee has also attacked McCain as being out of touch. In an Aug. 12 news release called "Seven Months of Job Losses for Americans, Seven Houses for McCain," the DNC said McCain fails to understand the economic difficulties of Americans. Bloggers have repeated the claim and created video tours of the McCain properties. Initially we confirmed that McCain owns seven homes, but Politico found a third condo that the McCains own in Phoenix, which we missed, and that brings the total to eight. One of their properties, a ranch in Sedona, also has multiple buildings on it that could be counted as additional homes. We count it as one. The property is owned under several names, including limited liability companies and family trusts. Public records connect these entities to Cindy McCain, chairwoman of Hensley & Co, a huge Anheuser-Busch beer distributorship that was founded by her parents. Here's a rundown of the properties and how we get to our total. 1. The largest home is a creekside ranch near Sedona, Ariz., spread over more than six acres. That's where McCain entertained vice presidential prospects, including Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, over Memorial Day weekend. Records from Yavapai County Assessor's Office show it includes three houses and is worth about $1.1-million. CNN reported that McCain said there are six houses on the property. The owner is listed as the Cindy Hensley McCain Family Trust. If McCain is correct that there are six houses on the property and you counted each one, the total homes owned would rise to 13 (though again, when pressed by Politico about properties, McCain said he wasn't sure). 2. and 3. In nearby Phoenix, Cindy McCain owns two combined condo units worth about $1.7-million. They're part of the Residences at 2211 Camelback, which bills itself as "The Valley of the Sun's finest example of life beyond the expected" at "the most preferred urban residential address in the prestigious Camelback Corridor." Wild River Rental LLC, which records show is controlled by Cindy McCain, owns another unit in the building, which was purchased in 2007 for $830,000. (This is the unit we missed in our first go round.) 4. In Arlington, Va., the McCains live in a three-bedroom high-rise condo worth $847,800, property records show. 5. They also own a condo in La Jolla, Calif., that's worth more than $1-million. The building overlooks a park and the Pacific Ocean. Records also link the McCains to three other residences. 6. Wild River Rental LLC, the company controlled by Cindy McCain, is listed as the owner of Phoenix condo worth more than half a million dollars. The McCains bought the condo for their daughter Meghan, according to a story in GQ magazine and confirmed through a public records search. The reporter compared the inside to "a spaceship furnished by West Elm. There's a giant silver chimney that extends out of her fireplace into the ceiling about twenty feet above." 7. and 8. Dream Catcher Family LLC, a domestic corporation formed by the McCain family, owns two condos in a beachfront complex in Coronado, Calif. Tax records show one is valued at $2.7-million. The other was purchased this year, according to sales records. A sales price was not available. The Obama campaign has released two ads since McCain's gaffe saying that McCain owns seven homes. The Obama campaign doesn't mention that trusts and companies controlled by Cindy McCain generally own the properties. And their count is off by one; the McCain family actually owns eight. We'll be monitoring this property issue as the campaign goes on. It's possible that there are other properties owned by corporate entities related to the McCains of which we are not aware. As we re-examined this claim after confirming the eighth property, we've come to a slightly different conclusion about the true ownership of the homes. Because there is indirect ownership here, though these are clearly the McCains' homes, we rule the statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-22T00:00:00	2008-08-11	['None']

pomt-10271	The Bush administration's latest plans for troop withdrawal from Iraq by 2011 are "more or less the same time frame I announced two years ago."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/24/barack-obama/more-like-one-year-ago/	As events unfold in Iraq, the political campaigns react. On Aug. 21, 2008, for example, news broke that the Bush administration and officials in Iraq were negotiating an agreement that envisioned U.S. troops leaving Iraq by 2011. Barack Obama gave an interview to USA Today the same day in which he discussed his Iraq policy. He pointed to the 2011 date and said it matched his own policies. "It's more or less the same time frame I announced two years ago," Obama said. We looked back two years ago to find Obama's statements on Iraq. The most salient example from that time was a speech he gave on Iraq to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs on Nov. 20, 2006. Obama criticized the Bush administration's handling of the war in Iraq and emphasized the need for a strategy that finds a political solution to the conflict. "The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government — a phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months," Obama said. "When I first advocated steps along these lines over a year ago, I had hoped that this phased redeployment could begin by the end of 2006. Such a timetable may now need to begin in 2007, but begin it must." A few months later, in January 2007, Obama proposed legislation that would have started pulling out troops in May 2007 with a goal of having all combat troops out by March 31, 2008. The legislation included provisions to halt the withdrawal in case of national interest or if the Iraqi government met certain targets. The legislation didn't pass, and it probably never had much of a chance given President Bush's opposition to withdrawal. On the campaign trail in 2007, Obama began discussing timetables for withdrawal that would begin with a new administration taking office in 2009. At a debate on Sept. 26, 2007, Obama said, "I believe that we should have all our troops out by 2013, but I don't want to make promises not knowing what the situation's going to be three or four years out." As the campaign proceeded, Obama discussed removing troops at a pace of about one brigade a month, noting that complete withdrawal would take "about 16 months," or around the middle of 2010. He included caveats to allow for changing circumstances on the ground and the advice of military advisers. To sum up the timetables here: • The Bush administration is negotiating a 2011 withdrawal date. • Two years ago, Obama proposed a withdrawal date of 2008. • When that proposal foundered, Obama moved to a withdrawal window based on a 16-month timeline, withdrawing all troops between 2010 and 2013. Obama's statement to USA Today says the Bush administration's latest plans for troop withdrawal from Iraq are "more or less the same time frame I announced two years ago." We'll agree that the 2011 date could be "more or less" the timeframe that Obama has proposed. But we don't see much similarity between the new 2011 withdrawal date and what Obama advocated two years ago. It's closer to what he began advocating a year ago. Obama stretches the timeline a little bit here in a way that's not supported by the facts, though we'll grant that Obama was calling for a general withdrawal two years ago and John McCain was not. So we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-24T00:00:00	2008-08-21	['Iraq', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-12638	"K-12 education is getting more money this year than they did last year. ... It is a total increase of 4.1 percent."	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2017/mar/28/eric-greitens/greitens-hasnt-increased-education-budget-4-percen/	Gov. Eric Greitens announced his recommended budget for fiscal year 2018 at a preschool for students with special needs in Nixa, Mo., instead of at the Capitol in Jefferson City. By speaking at a preschool, the new Republican governor said he was highlighting his commitment to public elementary and secondary education. Greitens described the difficult challenge he encountered making cuts to balance Missouri's "broken budget." The budget was broken, he said, by decreased tax revenues paid by special interests and by rising health care costs due to the Affordable Care Act. He promised K-12 classrooms would be protected from budget cuts. After the speech, Greitens took questions from the press. One reporter asked for clarification about elementary and secondary education funding and higher education funding. Greitens said: "K-12 education is getting more money this year than they did last year. And just to be specific, I’ll give you the exact numbers. Last year it was $5,914,000,000. This year is $5,951,000,000. We’re actually increasing spending for K-12 education. There will be more money from gaming funds, federal funds and state funds into K-12 education. It is a total increase of 4.1 percent." We wanted to check into this claim, especially because cuts Greitens proposed to school transportation would cause some schools to dip into other accounts to transport kids to and from school. Education department numbers Right off the bat, Greitens is correct in saying that the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education would receive more total funding than in FY 2017 under his proposed FY 2018 budget. And the budgeted numbers he cited also check out. According to the governor's FY 2018 budget, last year the department received a total of $5,914,605,606 to fund public schools and other programs. This year Greitens recommends appropriating $5,950,859,927. But the governor said this was a 4.1 percent increase. The $36.3 million increase was actually an increase of 0.613 percent — just a little off. PolitiFact tried to get in contact with Greitens to understand where he came up with his 4.1 percent figure. His office referred us to the Department of Revenue, and his press secretary has not responded to our calls and emails. Throughout the speech, Greitens reiterated he was was increasing funds to K-12 education, but according to records available in the Office of Administration, he’s not increasing funds as much as previous years. Since unveiling his budget proposal, Greitens recommended that $11 million of $52 million received from a tobacco legal settlement be put toward K-12 school bus transportation. That increases the total amount for the department to $5.96 billion, or an 0.8 percent increase over the previous year. School transportation allocation Even with this additional money, Greitens’ proposal would still underfund school districts’ requests for reimbursement in transportation spending. To fully fund all of the school district's transportation requests, the department would need to dole out $280 million, said Roger Dorson, deputy commissioner of financial and administrative services for the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. The extra $11 million puts the total for transportation up to $80 million. School administrators were quick to point out when Greitens first unveiled his budget that school transportation funding decreased 34 percent from the previous year — or $36 million. To make up for this, administrators said they’d have to take money from classrooms or make changes to their local busing policy. By law, districts must transport students who live more than 3.5 miles from school, and the state will reimburse up to 75 percent of the total cost for the district. Additionally, the governor’s budget won’t fully fund the Foundation Formula by nearly $45 million. The formula determines how state money will be allocated to each district to ensure that every student, no matter where he or she lives, receives an adequate education. When the formula isn’t fully funded, schools must find other sources of money — or make cuts — to meet their financial needs, said Shari LaPage, the the chief budget officer of the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Greitens is giving $3.2 million more to the formula than the previous fiscal year, yet the amount still isn’t enough to allocate the amount of money to each school as required by law. Since 2014, the Foundation Formula hasn’t been fully funded. Our ruling Greitens said, "K-12 education is getting more money this year than they did last year. ... It is a total increase of 4.1 percent." Greitens is right that his proposal for FY 2018 would allocate more money to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, but he is overstates the size of the increase. Even after including the money from the tobacco legal settlement, the increase would still be less than 1 percent. And the funding for core K-12 education falls short of the state’s own benchmark formula. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Eric Greitens	None	None	None	2017-03-28T17:24:46	2017-02-02	['None']
pomt-02249	Says Gov. Scott Walker’s repeal of a 2009 law has left Wisconsin as "one of five states without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/apr/13/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-scott-walker-left-wisconsin-women-/	Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke minced no words on Equal Pay Day, April 8, 2014, charging that Gov. Scott Walker has left women behind in the Wisconsin workplace. "Following Scott Walker's repeal in 2012 of protections against gender discrimination, Wisconsin is now one of just five states without an equal pay law," the Madison School Board member said in a media statement. Burke pledged to reinstate Wisconsin’s 2009 Equal Pay Enforcement Act, saying that in Wisconsin, "a woman only earns $0.80 for every dollar a man earns, and pay discrimination doesn't just hurt our families, it hurts our economies too." The former Trek Bicycle executive also sent supporters an email saying that due to Walker’s action, Wisconsin now is "without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck." In bringing up Walker’s repeal of the 2009 law, Burke echoed Democratic Party attacks that Republicans are conducting a "war on women." Is Burke on target in saying that Wisconsin women are working without an anti-discrimination safety net? Before we dive in, we should note that several federal laws give Wisconsin women a way to pursue cases of pay discrimination. It seems clear, though, that Burke was talking about state-level laws that are separate from the federal laws. So that’s what we’ll examine. Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki pointed us to research posted online by the National Conference of State Legislatures, which concluded that Wisconsin, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Utah lack equal-pay laws. That nugget was picked up by the Washington Post and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in March 2014. How did the group come to that conclusion? The NCSL told us they searched an online legal research service for terms such as "equal pay" and got no hits for Wisconsin. But Wisconsin has a longstanding law by another name, the state Fair Employment Act, which explicitly prohibits gender-based employment discrimination "in promotion (and) compensation paid for equal or substantially similar work." Attorneys on both sides of discrimination cases told us the state’s Fair Employment Act allows people who believe they’ve faced pay discrimination to seek back wages and legal fees from their employers through a state administrative hearing process. So what was the 2009 law passed by Democrats then in full control of the Capitol? That legislation, approved by then-Gov. Jim Doyle, sought to expand the state penalties employers could face if found guilty of discrimination against women and other protected groups on pay or other employment issues. Democrats, women’s professional groups and plaintiff’s lawyers had argued that the Fair Employment law needed more teeth (while Republican opponents said businesses would see more frivolous lawsuits). So the 2009 bill allowed persons to sue in court -- and get compensatory and punitive damages -- after they had exhausted their administrative cases in the state Department of Workforce Development. But that 2009 law -- the one repealed in 2012 by Walker and Republicans -- was a fairly narrow one focused on tougher enforcement of existing protections for women and other groups. It did not establish a new set of equal-pay protections -- those already were in the Fair Employment law, where they have been since 1982 and where they remained even after the 2012 repeal. "The bill will help all workers who are already protected under Wisconsin’s Fair Employment Law to fight these kinds of discrimination," state Rep. Christine Sinicki (D-Milwaukee), a co-sponsor, said in 2009. She added: "The bill does not create any protected new groups, just backs up those who, despite current law, are still unfairly denied work, fired from work or compensated less than others for the same work." All of that history undermines Burke’s sweeping claim. States have changed laws There’s another angle here. It’s tougher on employees to win under Wisconsin law than in some other states where workers can turn to state statutes written more explicitly to require equal pay for equal work, said Janet Heins, managing partner of a Mequon law firm that represents workers. States have adopted those measures in recent years under the heading of "Equal Pay" laws. One result: some states, mirroring federal laws, require only that employees prove unequal pay for equal work instead of showing that employers had a discriminatory motive, said Heins. Ronald Stadler, who defends employers accused of discrimination, agreed but noted that the 2009 Wisconsin law changes did not alter the standard for proving discrimination. Instead, those changes focused on adding remedies such as punitive damages that are already in federal laws. Wisconsin sought in its 2009 "equal pay enforcement" changes to make the state process more appealing and available to employees, in part because its more affordable than filing a federal action. Many state-law claimants proceed without an attorney. In Stadler’s view, the bottom line is that Wisconsin women have a state-law course of action on pay discrimination despite what he called a semantic difference. "We don’t have an ‘equal pay act,’ but we have a ‘fair employment act’ that says you can’t have one male and one female at different pay rates for same job," Stadler, a Milwaukee attorney, said. Heins thinks it’s a "tricky" question to answer, but believes it’s technically accurate to say there’s no state "equal pay" law. Without tougher remedies, some would-be plaintiffs may not be pursuing state claims because it does not make financial sense, Heins said. Burke portrays the 2009 changes as major. But they were repealed before that could be determined, Heins and Stadler said. Heins said that workers’ attorneys may have gained a bit more leverage over employers to settle more cases under the changes. The number of cases that go to state administrative law hearings is not large and most are settled privately, are withdrawn or dismissed for various reasons, according to numbers provided by state Workforce Development officials. In gender pay cases from January 2011 to April 2014 that got to the hearing stage, judges found discrimination in three cases, no discrimination in one and another 33 were settled privately. About 35 other complaints were dismissed, withdrawn or the judges affirmed an earlier finding of no probable cause. Earlier ratings We examined similar statement by Democrats in March 2012 when Republicans were repealing the 2009 change. State Rep. Cory Mason (D-Racine) said the GOP bill would repeal a law that ensures "that women cannot get paid less than a man for doing the same job." We rated that Mostly False, noting the 2009 law did not ensure pay equity, but rather gave discriminated workers the right to sue in state court for compensatory and punitive damages. And we rated False a claim by Kathleen Falk, Democrat running for governor, that Wisconsin women facing pay discrimination "can’t do something about it" under the repeal bill passed by Republicans. We noted that women suffering pay discrimination could still file a state or federal complaint in an effort to be made whole. And they could still seek larger monetary damages by suing in federal court. As for Burke’s claim, there’s a case to be made that Walker’s 2012 action filed down some of the (potentially) sharp new teeth put into the law in 2009. But Burke goes much further, saying that thanks to the governor, Wisconsin is "without an equal pay law." This is highly misleading. Our rating Burke said that Walker’s repeal of a 2009 law has left Wisconsin as "just one of five states without an equal pay law protecting women from gender discrimination in their paycheck." But while Walker reversed an attempt to toughen up Wisconsin law, its protections against gender discrimination in workplace pay date back decades. The governor’s 2012 action left those in place, albeit without tougher penalties for employers. We rate Burke’s claim False.

pomt-01819	"The so-called defense minister of the People's Republic of Donetsk ... actually posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport. And then when it became apparent it was civilian, they pulled it down from social media."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/20/john-kerry/kerry-ukrainian-separatist-bragged-social-media/	John Kerry made a strong case Sunday tying Ukrainian separatists to the missile that shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Kerry spoke on all the major networks about what he knows so far about MH 17, the Boeing 777 carrying nearly 300 people that was shot down over eastern Ukraine July 17. The evidence clearly points to Ukraine’s Russian separatists, who have already shot down 12 Ukrainian military planes, he said. Kerry’s cache of evidence included a flow of major weapons (including tanks and rocket launchers) from Russia to the rebels over the past month. And he says the Russians trained the rebels to use an SA-11 missile launcher like the one used to shoot down MH 17. Additionally, an SA-11 passed through the area where the launch originated in the past couple of days, but it did not belong to Ukraine. To top it off, the separatists have implicated themselves, Kerry claimed. Intelligence intercepted conversations among separatists talking about knocking down a plane. And one separatist leader allegedly bragged on social media about shooting down a plane. "We know that very shortly (after the crash), separatists were bragging in the social media about having shot down a transport plane," Kerry said on Fox News Sunday. "We know that the so-called defense minister of the People's Republic of Donetsk, Mr. Igor Strelkov, actually posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport. And then when it became apparent it was civilian, they pulled it down from social media." While much of Kerry’s evidence relies on intelligence that the public can’t access, we can fact-check his claim that a rebel leader posted on social media about shooting down a plane. We quickly found this screenshot of a post from Strelkov’s social media profile -- allegedly the smoking gun -- that has made its way around the Internet since Thursday: The post has since been deleted. But the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine -- which periodically saves versions of websites -- shows the post did appear on Strelkov’s page at one point, so we know it was it was a real post. But does it indicate that the rebels are behind the attack like Kerry said. First, some background. Who is Igor Strelkov? Igor Strelkov is the rebel commander of Ukraine’s pro-Kremlin forces and an alleged former Russian intelligence agent. His real name is Igor Girkin (Strelkov is Russian for "gunman"), and he’s also called "Igor the Terrible." Strelkov is a shadowy figure. He is a veteran of the Russian military, having fought in post-Soviet conflicts in Transnistria, Serbia and Chechnya, according to the New York Times. Kiev leadership believes Strelkov currently works for Russian military intelligence -- taken by some as proof of Russia’s assistance in the separatist uprising, according to BBC reports. Strelkov last legally crossed into Ukraine from Russia on Feb. 26 of this year. In an interview with the Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, he admitted to participating in the conflicts in Crimea in the spring and in Slovyansk in April. There, he was named the commander of the rebel forces of the Donetsk People's Republic -- the separatists’ self-proclaimed state in eastern Ukraine. The New York Times describes him as an "iron-fisted" solo operator, who has openly criticized the Kremlin for not providing aid to the rebels. Strelkov wrote for the right-wing Russian nationalist newspaper Zavtra in the 1990s, and he is a war re-enactment enthusiast. Bloggers have discovered photos of him dressed in period military costumes. What do we know about his post? The U.S. State Department confirmed that the post pictured above is the one Kerry was referring to in his statement on Fox. The post comes from Strelkov’s profile on VKontakte (VK), Russia’s version of Facebook. This is a translation of the post, according to the Ukraine Crisis Media Center: 17.07.2014 17:50 (Moscow time) In the region of Torez AN-26 plane has been shot, it is somewhere near the ‘Progress’ mine. We have warned them – not to fly ‘in our sky.’ Here is video-proof of yet another ‘bird fall.’ The bird has fallen behind the (waste heap), it missed the residential quarters. Peaceful citizens were not hurt. The post also included two videos showing some sort of explosion from a distance that are similar to other videos of the MH 17 aftermath. One of the videos is still on YouTube. Supporting the idea that the post was referring to MH 17, it went up at 5:50 p.m. local time, which was about a half hour after MH 17 went down. It says the plane went down in Torez, which is just a few miles south of the MH 17 crash site. The post says, though, that the rebels shot down an AN-26, which is a military transport plane about one-third the length of a Boeing 777. (People in the alleged leaked audio of intercepted conversations also mention confusion over whether the downed plane was a civilian or AN-26.) Separatists had recently shot down at least two transport planes. And the post is no longer on VK -- leading Kerry and others to the conclusion that it was deleted after Strelkov realized that it was a civilian plane, not a transport. But Strelkov denies involvement in the post. In a later VK post, translated for Forbes, Strelkov said the announcement about the transport plane going down was not an official one: "ATTENTION. This announcement declared that the news of the downing of the AN-26 was not official but came from residents and militia members on the scene. The only official announcements are published under the banner: Strelkov INFORMS. In other words, Strelkov asks his readers to forget the earlier announcement of the successful downing of a fascist Ukrainian plane." Later, he posted that Donetsk supports an objective investigation but denies involvement in the missile launch and instead blames the Ukrainian military. Additionally, some separatists in Donetsk told Max Seddon, a BuzzFeed reporter, that Streklov’s VK page is a fake made by fans. But of course, the separatists have an incentive to distance themselves from any evidence tying them to an action that killed 300 civilians. Our ruling Kerry said, "(Strelkov) posted a bragging social media posting of having shot down a military transport. And then when it became apparent it was civilian, they pulled it down from social media." We know that a post appeared on Strelkov’s social media profile bragging about shooting down a transport plane close to the MH 17 crash site. In a subsequent post, Strelkov said the information passed along came not from him directly, but from militia members on the scene. He said the information was unofficial and incorrect. It’s impossible to know with certainty Strelkov's role in the post, or when the post was pulled, but we do know that the posts come from within the separatist movement -- as Strelkov himself said. The evidence is largely on Kerry's side, though there are some points that are unclear. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	John Kerry	None	None	None	2014-07-20T17:40:05	2014-07-20	['None']
pomt-05555	Says Obama has failed to pass a budget.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/06/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-failed-pass-budget/	In a speech that looked beyond the primary to the general election, Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, hit President Barack Obama over his handling of the recession. "President Obama's answer to our economic crisis was more spending, more debt and larger government. And by the end of his term in office he will have added nearly as much public debt as all the prior presidents combined," Romney said in an April 4, 2012, speech to newspaper editors. "No president has ever run a trillion-dollar deficit. The new normal the president would have us embrace is trillion-dollar deficits and 8 percent unemployment. Through all of this, President Obama has failed to even pass a budget." There are a lot of accusations packed in there, but that last one -- that Obama failed to pass a budget -- piqued our interest most. How the budget happens The federal budget doesn’t get enacted the way other laws do. The process starts with the president submitting his budget request to Congress early in the year. That voluminous document is partly a presidential wish list, but it also gives Congress a framework. "The ‘PresBud,’ as it is called, forms the basis of the fiscal year budget that starts the following October," according to this post from the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. In Congress, the House and Senate have budget committees tasked with creating concurrent budget resolutions, using the president’s budget as a guide. As Taxpayers for Common Sense wrote, "The legislation they draft is for Congressional use only: it doesn't go to the President, it isn't law, it just helps Congress keep its budgetary ducks in a row." So there is the first problem with Romney’s statement. The president doesn’t "pass" a budget. That’s Congress’ job. In Obama’s case, he has submitted his budget request each year he has been in office. Voting on his requests Romney said in his speech that "In February, (Obama) put forward a proposal that included the largest tax increase in history and still left our national debt spiraling out of control, and the House rejected it unanimously." He’s right about the rejection. After Obama submitted his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal on Feb. 13, 2012, House Republicans put it up for a floor vote. The result: 414-0 against. The same thing happened a year earlier in the Senate. That vote: 97-0 against. Democrats didn’t support the plan because it has been supplanted by another deficit-reduction plan Obama had later outlined. Republican leaders demanded a vote on Obama’s budget to show that Democrats don’t support any detailed budget blueprint, according to The Hill. Such votes are taken "just as a means of embarrassing the president and his party," said Patrick Louis Knudsen, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Usually it’s brought up by the opposition party because they generally anticipate that a president’s budget won’t get very much support especially if it has controversial elements to it," he said. Other experts agree. Said Steve Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense: "That was pure political theater and was done to score rhetorical points." And Norman Ornstein, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, "it doesn’t mean a damn thing. It’s only a symbolic gesture." These votes are also what Romney’s campaign cited when we asked for documentation of his statement. "Everyone understands that the president has a unique and important role in facilitating that process," said spokesman Ryan Williams in an email. "President Obama has been an unprecedented failure in that respect. His FY 2012 budget went down 97-0 in the Senate and his FY 2013 budget went down 414-0 in the House." Speaking of precedent We wondered what other budgetary scenarios have played out recently. Knudsen pointed to 2009, when Democrats still held a majority in the House. They introduced a resolution that included the mechanism for the health care legislation championed by Obama in his budget. The resolution had many elements of the president’s budget, Knudsen said, though it wasn’t strictly speaking that document. Ornstein referred us to the gridlock of 2011 that resulted from the debate over raising the debt ceiling. The budget control act, which was passed to avoid a default on our debt and signed by Obama wasn’t a traditional budget resolution, Ornstein said. But he noted: "That was actually a budget adopted by a president." Ornstein also noted that during George W. Bush’s presidency, there were years that Democrats in Congress failed to pass joint resolutions. "To suggest that was Bush not passing a budget would be a misstatement," Ornstein said. He called Romney’s rap on Obama "at best a gross exaggeration." But in Knudsen’s view, Romney’s statement was "technically accurate." "The president’s budgets have been brought to the floor twice and they have failed," Knudsen said. "It’s not atypical that that should happen, but nevertheless the governor is correct." PolitiFact has examined similar accusations about a lack of budgeting when they’ve been leveled at Congress. In January 2012, Republican House member Paul Ryan charged that Senate Democrats "have gone without any budget at all" for more than 1,000 days. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated that Mostly True, finding he was slightly off about the number of days but correct that the Democrat-controlled Senate had gone a long time with passing a budget resolution. Former Louisiana Congressman and Gov. Buddy Roemer earned a Half True from us when he said in July 2011 that "Obama has never submitted a budget, and Congress has worked for two years without passing one." He was right about Congress but wrong about Obama. Our ruling In his speech, Romney faulted Obama for failing to pass a budget. He was correct that the two times Congress voted on the president’s budget requests, both times they were voted down. But the job of passing a budget resolution is not the president’s. That responsibility falls to Congress, and even then the president doesn’t sign it. As Ellis, our expert, put it: "The president has no role in passing a budget. The president can cajole Congress about passing a budget and advocate for positions and funding levels, but in the end, Congress approves the budget resolution for their own purposes." That’s the difference between this and other claims we’ve rated which blamed Congress for inaction on the budget. Romney’s statement contains a grain of truth, in that two of Obama’s budget requests failed to pass. But citing those votes leaves a wrong impression -- namely that the votes were anything more than political theater. Romney omitted the more critical information that passing a federal budget is the job of Congress. Given all that, we rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-03048	Domestic violence "is seen as a pre-existing" health condition and "women had to pay 50 percent more for health care because of gender ratings," but under Obamacare, "all of that is over."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/06/gwen-moore/obamacare-stop-domestic-violence-pre-existing-cond/	On Sept. 29, 2013, two days before a political showdown over Obamacare led to a government shutdown, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore defended the health care law. On MSNBC’s "Disrupt with Karen Finney" show, the Milwaukee Democrat described how bad women have had it -- and how things will improve with the Affordable Care Act. She stated: "If you’re a victim of domestic violence, even that’s seen as a pre-existing condition. Women had to pay 50 percent more for health care because of gender rating. All of that is over." So, we need to determine whether being a domestic violence victim is regarded as a pre-existing health condition; and whether women have had to pay 50 percent more for their health care because of "gender rating." We also need to see how the health care law handles domestic violence and gender rating. Pre-existing conditions In 2009, first lady Michelle Obama made a statement similar to the first part of Moore’s claim. She said it was legal in some states to regard domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and use it as a basis for denying health insurance coverage. PolitiFact National rated Obama’s statement True because at the time, eight states permitted treating domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, according to the National Women’s Law Center. The law center told us that its most recent check, in 2010, showed the District of Columbia as well as six states -- Idaho, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Vermont and Wyoming -- had no law prohibiting the insurers from designating domestic violence as a pre-existing condition. However, there were restrictions in some of those states. (The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy research group, also referred us to the law center on this question.) In rating Michelle Obama’s statement, our colleagues pointed out that just because it's legal in some states for insurance companies to cite domestic violence as a pre-existing condition, it doesn't mean insurance companies are actually taking advantage of the loophole. Indeed, an insurer might deny a woman coverage based on an injury or condition without it being disclosed that the injury or condition was a result of domestic violence. There was evidence in the 1990s that using domestic violence to deny coverage was widespread, but the law center told us it is not aware of any data on how many insurance companies actually use domestic violence now as a pre-existing condition. Beginning on Jan. 1, 2014, the Affordable Care Act will prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage to people who already have health problems, such as high blood pressure, depression or diabetes, as well as "conditions arising out of domestic violence." So, while there isn’t evidence that health insurers commonly use domestic violence as a pre-existing condition to deny coverage, it is "seen" as such in that it is legal in a handful of states for health insurers to do so. Moore is also correct that practice is being outlawed under Obamacare. "Gender rating" The second part of Moore’s claim is that women have had to pay 50 percent more for their health care because of "gender rating." There’s no dispute that health insurers use gender as one factor in setting rates; others include age, family size, geographic region and health status. But Moore’s broad claim that women pay 50 percent higher rates isn’t so clear. Moore cited a March 2012 report, again from the National Women’s Law Center. The center said it used the eHealthInsurance website to calculate premiums in the individual market -- in other words, premiums for women who purchase health insurance themselves, rather than getting it through their employer or spouse. The individual market is a key target of the Affordable Care Act. The center said premiums were at least 50 percent higher for women than for men in a number of instances, including health plans for 25-year-olds in Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia and Wyoming; and for 40-year-olds in Alabama, Arizona, Kansas and Kentucky. Although federal anti-discrimination protections enacted prior to the Affordable Care Act generally prohibit employers from charging female employees higher premiums than male employees, businesses with predominantly female workforces are routinely charged more for group coverage, according to the law center. The reform law prohibits gender rating, beginning Jan. 1, 2014. So, there is evidence that some women buying health insurance in the individual market, a key target of Obamacare, are charged 50 percent more than men for the same coverage. Such gender rating is made illegal under the health reform law. Our rating Moore said domestic violence "is seen as a pre-existing" health condition and "women had to pay 50 percent more for health care because of gender ratings," but under Obamacare, "all of that is over." The thrust of what Moore said is partially accurate, in that there is some evidence to back the pre-existing condition and 50 percent parts of her claim. She’s correct that the Affordable Care Act eliminates the treatment of domestic violence as a pre-existing condition and eliminates gender rating. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Moore a Half True. If you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-13779	"It was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi and after four Americans fell said, 'What difference at this point does it make?' "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/mike-pence/mike-pences-false-claim-about-clintons-role-and-re/	Indiana Gov. Mike Pence officially accepted the GOP’s nomination for vice president July 21, 2016, in Cleveland, and didn’t miss a beat when it came to assailing Hillary Clinton. "It was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi and after four Americans fell said, 'What difference at this point does it make?' " Pence said, eliciting loud boos from the audience. We’ve heard a version of this attack several times at the Republican National Convention, with some versions more accurate than others. Both parts of this particular claim are inaccurate. There is no evidence showing Clinton personally "left Americans in harm’s way in Benghazi." And while he’s using Clinton words, he’s misattributing their meaning. Leaving Americans ‘in harm’s way’ We reached out to the Trump campaign to clarify what Pence meant by Clinton leaving "Americans in harm’s way" but didn’t hear back immediately. It could refer to her alleged inaction after the attacks in sending troops to the scene. Or, to her allegedly brushing off requests for more security at the Benghazi compound. Or, her "sleeping through" the attacks. No matter, all of these claims are inaccurate -- some more so than others. Let’s take a look one by one. Before he officially got the job, Pence knocked Clinton for taking "13 hours to send help to Americans under fire." We rated that False. Clinton was not responsible for sending help to Benghazi; that fell to military officials. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred. Others have accused Clinton of ignoring requests for more security for the Benghazi consulate. It’s undeniable that officials in Libya repeatedly asked for better security, but there’s no evidence that Clinton herself was aware or that she willfully denied them. And finally, Pence may have been making his running mate’s point that the Benghazi victims were "left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed." That’s also False. Clinton was not literally sleeping when the attacks unfolded, as it was mid afternoon in Washington. Emails show she worked late into the night. Taking Trump’s and Pence’s claim more broadly, was Clinton inattentive as the attacks unfolded? In its recently released report, the House select committee on Benghazi did conclude that there were State Department and overall administrative failings, but Pence and Trump blamed Clinton specifically. And neither that probe nor the seven congressional investigations before it have suggested Clinton was personally responsible or could have prevented the attack. Clinton, for her part, has accepted responsibility for the attack as the head of the State Department at the time. ‘What difference at this point does it make?’ Pence’s claim that she made this oft-repeated comment in response "after four Americans fell" is also inaccurate. Clinton’s comments, said during a hearing months after the attack, was not an expression of apathy over the deaths.It was an exasperated response to Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., pressing Clinton on why State Department officials in Washington didn’t call their counterparts in Libya to determine the cause of the attack (protests over a video mocking Islam or a planned terrorist attack). Clinton told Johnson her priority was figuring out how to rescue them, not pressing them for information, and it wasn’t appropriate to talk to the them before FBI interviews. When Johnson continued to press her for a more straightforward answer, Clinton gave her exasperated answer. "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?" she said. (You can read the full six-minute transcript here, courtesy of PolitiFact Wisconsin.) Our ruling Pence said, "It was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi and after four Americans fell said, 'What difference at this point does it make?' " It’s reasonable to argue that Clinton, as head of the State Department, should shoulder some responsibility for the bureaucratic failures that may have contributed to the tragedy. But there’s no evidence that suggests, as Pence does, that Clinton was personally responsible for or could have prevented the deaths of the four Benghazi victims. As for Clinton’s comment, it did not come "after four Americans fell," but in a subsequent congressional hearing. She was responding to a senator’s repeated questioning over why she didn’t call department workers in Benghazi to figure out the cause of the attack, not to the fact that four Americans had died.

pomt-10403	"John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time (last year)."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/04/barack-obama/thats-what-the-votes-show-yes/	Sharpening his attack line that electing Sen. John McCain is the equivalent of giving President Bush a third term, Sen. Barack Obama used his triumphant speech in St. Paul, Minn. June 3, 2008, in which he finally claimed the Democratic nomination, to note that his Republican rival voted with the commander-in-chief 95 percent of the time last year. "It's not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time, as he did in the Senate last year," Obama said. The number Obama cited didn't come out of thin air. It reflects McCain's 2007 "presidential support" score from Congressional Quarterly, part of a carefully measured and widely cited series of vote studies that demonstrate how often lawmakers back or oppose the president, as well as the majority of their parties. But while Obama may be accurately quoting the CQ analysis of 2007, he's selectively picking facts while not telling the entire story. McCain's 95 percent score was the high-water mark of his presidential support during President Bush's tenure, and was partly a reflection of the new political calculus in the Democratic-controlled Congress. McCain supported Bush as infrequently as 77 percent of the time in 2005, and backed the president's position an average of 89 percent of the time since 2001. By congressional standards, that's solidly partisan, but hardly marching in lockstep. The 2007 votes reflected the Senate agenda after Democrats gained a one-vote majority in the chamber in the 2006 mid-term elections. Bush stated a position on 97 roll call votes and won 64 of them — a 66 percent success rate. Deduct the 29 Senate votes to confirm Bush nominees to executive branch positions or judgeships, and the president's success rate fell to just over 51 percent. But while he had a terrible year on paper, Bush was the winner on critical votes on spending limits, taxes and energy policy, thanks to unified support from Republicans. Because Senate rules require 60 votes to end prolonged debate or a filibuster, Republicans repeatedly used the stalling tactic to stop initiatives on the Democrats' agenda. The Senate voted 18 times last year on motions to cut off debate and end filibusters that Bush was on record as supporting. He prevailed 17 times. McCain missed more than half the votes on which Bush had a position, as he campaigned for the White House. But repeated votes on immigration and the Iraq war — two issues on which he was closely allied with Bush — as well as the filibuster votes helped elevate McCain from one of the president's chief adversaries three years ago to one of his biggest supporters. McCain's vote score can thus be viewed both as a reflection of ideological kinship with the Bush administration and with the hard-line, tactical decisions he made in response to some Democratic initiatives. Because Obama correctly quotes an accurate measure of how often McCain was in sync with the president in 2007, we rule the claim True.

pomt-15137	Bernie Sanders opposes the death penalty, and Hillary Clinton supports it.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/sep/02/viral-image/where-do-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders-stand-/	An image circulating on Twitter and Reddit claims Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have opposing views on a host of issues, including the death penalty. According to the image, Sanders opposes the death penalty, but Clinton supports it. We wanted to see if the two candidates disagree on capital punishment. (See our other checks on the image here.) Sanders and the death penalty The Vermont senator has been an opponent of the death penalty for his entire political career. And with one exception, he has voted against expansions of the death penalty at every turn. Sanders opposed the Violent Crime Prevention Act of 1991 during his first year in the U.S. House of Representatives. "All over the industrialized world now, countries are saying, ‘let us put an end to state murder, let us stop capital punishment’," Sanders said in a 1991 speech on the House floor. "But here what we’re talking about is more and more capital punishment." The bill, which included provisions to authorize the death penalty as appropriate punishment for crimes involving the murder of a law enforcement officer, terrorism and drug trafficking, never reached the desk of President George H.W. Bush. In 1994, however, Sanders voted in favor of the final version of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, a bill that expanded the federal death penalty. Sanders had voted for an amendment to the bill that would have replaced all federal death sentences with life in prison. Even though the amendment failed, Sanders still voted for the larger crime bill. A spokesman for Sanders said he voted for the bill "because it included the Violence Against Women Act and the ban on certain assault weapons." Sanders reiterated his opposition to capital punishment in 2015. "I just don’t think the state itself, whether it’s the state government or federal government, should be in the business of killing people," he said on a radio show. Clinton and the death penalty Clinton’s campaign did not provide her stance on capital punishment. The last time she publicly addressed capital punishment, which was 15 years ago, Clinton offered support. In her 2000 run for U.S. Senate, she was quoted by a Washington Post columnist as saying the death penalty had her "unenthusiastic support." Clinton’s history on the issue, however, is slightly complicated. As director of the legal aid clinic at the University of Arkansas in the 1970s, Clinton helped to get the death sentence of a 20-year-old African-American man sentenced to life in prison. But according to a timeline of the case compiled by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization that focuses on criminal justice, Clinton’s views on the topic changed as her husband’s did. Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, is described as shifting his position on the death penalty as part of an effort to present himself as a centrist "New Democrat" in the 1980s. Citing Paul Kengor’s 2007 book God and Hillary Clinton: A Spiritual Life, the timeline says that Hillary Clinton " ‘agonized’ over her husband’s embrace of capital punishment," eventually supporting it. As first lady, she supported the 1994 crime bill that Sanders opposed. After her election to U.S. Senate, she co-sponsored a bill that made it easier for prisoners on death row to appeal for exoneration through DNA testing. Clinton hasn’t yet addressed the issue in the 2016 election cycle. Our ruling The infographic claims Bernie Sanders opposes the death penalty and that Hillary Clinton supports it. Sanders has opposed the death penalty for at least the last 20 years, though he did vote for the 1994 crime bill that, among many other provisions, expanded the number of crimes that could result in death penalty sentences. While Clinton has helped make it easier to appeal a death sentence, her most recent documented statements on the topic expressed tepid support. Without a clear idea of her most recent stance, we can only assume she still holds that position. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-13412	Says Donald Trump has outlined "policies that read like a Kremlin wish list."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/22/michael-morell/experts-say-donald-trumps-policies-dovetail-what-v/	Concerned by Donald Trump's secrecy about his dealings with other countries, 55 former government, military and national security officials — Democrats and some Republicans — have signed a letter urging him to reveal his international business relationships and foreign investments, and to pledge to divest himself of all overseas business interests if he wins the presidency. The letter was drafted in part by Michael Morell, former acting director and deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency. It says that the limited amount of information available to the public — Trump has refused to release his tax returns — suggests business relationships that "would be problematic" and might influence his policy positions as president, particularly when it comes to Russia. "On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian leadership, while outlining policies that read like a Kremlin wish list. He has claimed that Putin would never invade Ukraine, suggested permanently ceding Crimea to Russia, and placed conditions on upholding our obligation to protect our NATO allies. He even encouraged Russian espionage to interfere with our election, a tactic Putin has deployed across Central Asia and Europe to boost his preferred candidates. In addition, he has floated lifting sanctions against Russia, which would benefit both Putin and the Trump Organization." For this fact-check, we were interested in whether Trump has outlined "policies that read like a Kremlin wish list." We talked to Russia experts who signed the letter as well as those who didn't. We emailed several people in the Trump campaign asking for reaction and information to dispute the assertion. We received no reply. We contacted Morell and more than a half dozen of the signers to get details on the claim. Their focus is on the issues mentioned in the letter: NATO, Ukraine and the lack of support for economic sanctions against Russia. Let's review them separately. NATO: In July, Trump told the New York Times that he wouldn't automatically come to the defense of a NATO ally that hasn't paid its expected contribution. "I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, 'Congratulations, you will be defending yourself,' " he said. NATO was created as deterrent to the former Soviet Union, of which Russia was the key player. Putin has strongly objected to attempts to expand NATO because of Russian security concerns, so anything that weakens NATO could strengthen Russia. "This is exactly what Putin wants — to sow the seeds of doubt in those countries on his periphery over whether the West will be there for them," Morell told us in an email. "This kind of talk forces those states to be more accommodating to Russian interests." Trump's potential unwillingness to defend NATO members who don't contribute enough financially to the alliance is "essentially undermining unconditional nature of our commitment to their defense," said a cosigner of the letter, Richard Nephew, a former principal deputy coordinator of sanctions policy for the State Department who is now at Columbia University. Crimea and Ukraine: Russia annexed Crimea, and Putin supported an uprising in eastern Ukraine, sending in fighters after a revolution removed a pro-Russian president in 2014. Putin said annexation was morally and legally justified. The United States and the European Union disagreed. Trump had a different attitude. "The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were," he said in a July 31 interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. He also called Putin’s grab "so smart" in an April 12, 2014 Fox News interview. As PolitiFact reported in August, Trump’s comments actually echo the official Kremlin position that Crimea is now Russian and its citizens prefer it that way. "Trump has sided with Putin on all these issues," said Samantha Vinograd, another co-signer and former director for international affairs and Iraq at the National Security Council. "If you look at how Trump will not condemn Russia's military takeover of Crimea, that's something that literally Putin was probably jumping up and down over when he said that." "This lets Putin off the hook for the first land grab in Europe since World War II," said Morell. "That gift to Putin even has a bow on it." Sanctions against Russia: The European Union and the United States responded to the situation in Ukraine by issuing sanctions against Russia. They affect Russian banks, arms makers and energy companies, and have both limited Russia's access to Western markets and hindered its ability to deal with a recession caused by the sharp drop in oil prices. Clearly, Russia would like to see those sanctions lifted. Trump has said he would consider removing them. "That undermines sanctions as a tool," said Vinograd. "You don't just remove them without proof that a country has met its international obligations." What other Russia experts say Experts we consulted who didn't sign the letter agreed that many of Trump's comments line up with actions that Putin would probably like to see. "I think Trump's foreign policy is the most pro-Russian policy we've seen from a major presidential candidate, at least since World War II," said Matthew Kroenig, associate professor at Georgetown University and a senior advisor on the Marco Rubio campaign who signed an anti-Trump letter last spring. "With talk of tearing up NATO and positive talk about President Putin, it seems to be a very sympathetic Russian foreign policy," "Putin and the Russians would be delighted to see him elected," Kroenig added. "To be more supportive of the Kremlin, Trump would have to scrap America's nuclear arsenal and sign a treaty to give the Ukraine back to Russia." Michael McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, made additional points in an Aug. 17, 2016, Washington Post commentary. For example, a political battle over building a wall on the Mexican border, would be a major distraction in this country and "a United States convulsed by infighting over Trump's deeply divisive policy proposals gives Putin more freedom to act around the world." But Peter Feaver, a professor of political science and public policy at Duke University, said the claim that Trump's policies read like a Kremlin wish list is "hyperbole to be sure, because it's looking at some of Trump's statements and not others." For example, the candidate's pledge to reinvigorate the United States military would not be part of a Russian wish list. He said the idea that NATO allies aren't paying their fair share for the defense of Europe is a longstanding United States complaint. It's just that Trump is the first to threaten to take action by not defending a country that's attacked but is not paying. "And he described the situation in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine in a way that was favorable to Russia's interpretation of what's happening," said Feaver. "So I wouldn't say his comments are are on the Kremlin's wish list, but they were certainly reinforcing Putin's approach and undermining NATO, which is a way of achieving one of Putin's goals, which is to weaken NATO." He also cautioned that it can be hard to tell what Trump really thinks, given all the things he says in off-the-cuff remarks. Only the other hand, he noted, Trump seldom backtracks on an outrageous statement he's made. The claim that Trump's policies read like a Kremlin wish list "has a lot more to do with Donald Trump's overall statements about Russia than it does with any concrete policies, and that's because Donald Trump doesn't really have many concrete policies," said Emma Ashford, a defense and foreign policy research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. "Trump tends to be quite inconsistent on a lot of things" such as working with Russia to fight ISIS," she said. "So with Donald Trump's inconsistency, it's really really hard to tell what he would do on some of these issues." Our ruling Morell and others said Trump has outlined "policies that read like a Kremlin wish list." Trumps comments on backing away from NATO, supporting Russia on the Ukraine and rethinking sanctions against Russia certainly qualify as statements that dovetail with what the Putin administration would like. But not all of his opinions, such as wanting to increase military spending, are in lockstep with policies the Kremlin might favor.

pomt-09008	"Sen. McConnell offered a fully paid two-month extension of unemployment insurance."	true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/11/john-cornyn/mcconnell-proposed-extending-unemployment-benefits/	Haggling over extending unemployment insurance to the nation’s jobless ended in a deadlock last week when Senate Democrats couldn’t secure one additional vote to prevent a Republican filibuster. The next day, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas advised that Republicans are not against extending such benefits. They just want the benefits to be paid for first, he said, instead of adding the costs to the federal deficit. "Sen. (Mitch) McConnell offered a fully paid two-month extension of unemployment insurance," Cornyn told Texas reporters during a July 1 conference call. McConnell is the GOP leader in the Senate. Mindful the nation’s unemployment rate hasn’t slipped below 9 percent in more than a year — it was 9.5 percent in June — we decided to investigate. First, some background: Since it was created in 1935, the unemployment insurance system has helped the jobless by replacing part of their lost income for up to 26 weeks. Though supervised by the federal government, the program is run by the states, which provide most funding through employer taxes. In 1970, Congress created the permanent Extended Benefits program, which provides an additional 13 or 20 weeks to former employees who have exhausted their 26 weeks of regular benefits in states where unemployment has worsened. On top of that, Congress regularly extends unemployment benefits during serious economic downturns. Most recently, in June 2008, Congress created the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program so workers who had exhausted state unemployment benefits could receive up to 34 weeks of additional benefits — and workers in states with high unemployment rates qualified for or up to 53 weeks of additional aid. As of May 2010, Nevada had the highest unemployment rate in the country at 14 percent, followed by Michigan (13.6 percent) and California (12.4). Texas’ unemployment rate stayed steady from April at 8.3 percent, while North Dakota had the lowest rate: 3.6 percent. Experts we spoke with from across the political spectrum couldn’t recall an instance when extensions during recessions were funded up front. Why not? Gary Burtless, an economist at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution and formerly of the U.S. Department of Labor, said unemployment rates 7 percent or more are almost always considered emergencies — "that is, serious recessions for which a major federal response is considered appropriate." Emergency expenditures can add to the deficit because Congress can approve them without offsetting the costs with spending cuts or revenue increases. Congress and the sitting administration have approved unemployment benefit extensions in every recession since the late 1950s, Burtless said. The Senate majority leader, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said on the Senate floor June 30: "We, as a Congress — Democrats and Republicans — have always extended unemployment benefits because it is an emergency. President Reagan did it for almost three years. President Bush did it for a couple of years. It has been going on on a bipartisan basis when times are tough in America." Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert and resident scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, told us that while such extensions temporarily contribute to deficits, they’re usually one-time expenditures, as opposed to spending that "continues into perpetuity or creates a policy that adds to spending over the longer term." "Generally speaking, when you hit a downturn, you want to have deficits that spur your economy," he said. "But most states, of course, have balanced-budget amendments, so they provide a fiscal drag... the only place you can turn is the federal government." Case in point: In February 2009, President Barack Obama signed the stimulus act, which extended through 2009 emergency unemployment insurance. Congress subsequently extended benefits in November, December, March and most recently in April, with an $18 billion bill extending benefits until June 2. Each time, the legislation wasn’t offset with tax revenue or spending cuts — a sticking point for most Republicans. In February, Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., initially refused to allow the Senate to consider a House measure to extend benefits for 30 days because it wasn’t offset with other savings. The deficit is on the rise. In its analysis of Obama’s budget for fiscal 2011, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted annual deficits would pile up, totaling $9.8 trillion by 2020. Which almost brings us back to now. From June 18 through June 30, Senate Democrats failed to secure enough votes to extend unemployment benefits while increasing the deficit. Reid ultimately fell a vote short of the 60 votes needed to block a filibuster on an amendment that would have extended unemployment benefits through Nov. 30, retroactive to June 2, the expiration date for the previously extended benefits. The Congressional Budget Office projected the blocked extension would cost $33.9 billion through 2020. Republicans said they would support extending benefits if they were paid for up front. And on June 30, McConnell, the minority leader, proposed a two-month extension — rather than the Democratic-backed extension through November — that he said reduced the deficit by $1.7 billion. How? By adjusting Medicaid payments, trimming stimulus-funded food stamps in 2014, cutting $600 million in stimulus-supported programs to expand broadband Internet access and eliminating a provision letting qualified residents receive their earned-income tax credit throughout the year instead at the end of the tax filing season. "We cannot support job-killing taxes and adding tens of billions to the already unsustainable national debt," McConnell said on the floor June 30. "If the Democrats object to extending these programs using their own stimulus offset to pay for them, then they will be saying loudly and clearly that their commitment to deficit spending trumps their desire to help the unemployed." Democrats rejected McConnell’s proposal, saying that the stimulus money would be needed elsewhere to boost job growth. Thomas Mann, a congressional scholar at Brookings, said that in the past, it was broadly accepted that additional spending on unemployment benefits during a serious economic downturn wasn’t harmful to the economy. Similarly, most of the funding during the last eight years for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan was treated as emergency spending and not included in the regular budget, he said. In 2005, for example, Congress approved Bush’s request for $51.8 billion in emergency spending — $1.4 billion to the military, $400 million to the Army Corps of Engineers, and $50 billion to "disaster relief’ (the legislation came in the wake of Hurricane Katrina). Summing up: Of late, congressional efforts to extend unemployment insurance benefits have failed — including McConnell's proposal to finance an extension by paying for it with stimulus funding. We rate Cornyn's statement as True.	None	John Cornyn	None	None	None	2010-07-11T13:20:48	2010-07-01	['None']
pomt-09119	"The minute this proposal for near-beach oil drilling came up, I was against it."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/17/alex-sink/sink-says-she-opposed-drilling-minute-it-was-propo/	Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, a Democratic candidate for governor, has been a vocal critic of offshore drilling in the aftermath of the Gulf oil spill. In a speech to the Suncoast Tiger Bay Club in Clearwater on June 10, 2010, Sink responded to a question about how she would handle the crisis as governor: "Clearly we are in uncharted territory here because while other parts of the world have been subject to oil spills, and by the way, the minute this proposal for near-beach oil drilling came up, I was against it, and that's why I support a constitutional amendment for the people of Florida to be able to say never will we have drilling within 3 miles of our shore." We were struck by Sink's claim that she opposed a proposal for near-beach oil drilling "the minute" it came up. Did she? It was spring 2009 when a group of Republican lawmakers, in the waning days of Florida's legislative session, advanced a proposal to allow offshore oil drilling in state waters, 3 to 10 miles off Florida's coasts. A bill related to developing a plan to implement oil drilling was proposed on Feb. 26, 2009, but it didn't evolve into an actual push to allow drilling until April 21. That's when state Rep. Dean Cannon advocated for a measure to allow applications to the Florida Cabinet to open up drilling. At Cannon's urging, the House Policy Council passed the bill 17-6 on April 21. The bill represented a reversal of the longstanding ban on oil drilling in state waters. But a massive budget deficit encouraged some lawmakers to support the change, which would have allowed the state to charge $1 million per application. If the Cabinet gave the go-ahead for exploration, companies would have had to post a $500 million bond. Environmentalists protested. "Florida's beaches are our legacy and to put them at risk for a few million dollars makes no sense," Eric Draper of the Florida Audubon Society told the Miami Herald. "One small oil spill could wipe out billions of dollars of economic activities. This is gambling with Florida's future." U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson tweeted his dismay. "I can't believe some Florida lawmakers might actually be serious about allowing oil drilling within 10 miles offshore," he wrote on April 21. So what about Sink? An April 22, 2009, article by the Associated Press quotes Sink as being upset that the issue surfaced so late in the session, but her opposition isn't apparent. "I thought we were supposed to have government in the sunshine, this is government in the middle of the night," Sink said. "We have to have open, rigorous debate, and real time to hear from Florida's citizens about this 11th-hour change that could bring drilling rigs just 3 miles off Florida's coastline in the shallow waters of the Gulf." Sink spokesman Kyra Jennings pointed us to an April 24 press release in which Sink opposed the proposed bill -- three days after the House Policy Council voted for it. "As Florida’s Chief Financial Officer it is my responsibility to protect the people of Florida and all state owned land, and I take these obligations very seriously," Sink wrote. "That's why I strongly oppose the near-shore drilling legislation, which would threaten Florida’s economy by bringing oil rigs 3 miles off our coast, sanctioning drilling in the shallow waters of the Gulf, and allowing unlimited pipelines to go through sensitive areas up to our beaches. This controversial near-shore drilling bill puts Florida's billion dollar tourism, fishery, and marina-related industries at serious risk, and is not in the best interest of Florida." As a member of the state Cabinet, Sink's opinion was relevant because the bill would have given the Cabinet authority to accept applications for drilling. Sink was one of many Democratic politicians to voice opposition. On April 27, the House approved HB 1219 on a 70-43 vote, but the Senate put the brakes on it because the issue surfaced near the end of the session. A similar proposal was suggested for the 2010 session, but the April 20 Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion sunk all efforts. Even before the 2009 legislative session, Sink was critical of drilling near Florida's coasts. She joined several Democrats in 2008 responding to Gov. Charlie Crist's comments that oil drilling would reduce gas prices. "The future is not in destroying our coast," she said. "We need long-term solutions now.'' Earlier this year, when Obama sought to lift the federal ban on drilling off Florida's west coast -- which would still keep rigs 125 miles away -- Sink issued this response March 31, 2010: "While I support additional offshore exploration 125 miles from Florida's coasts, I have long been opposed to the near-beach drilling proposal currently in the Florida legislature that puts our tourism economy at risk. Florida depends on our tourism, fishery, and marina industries and having oil rigs in sight, pipes on our beaches and the potential of a spill would threaten our state's economic well-being. It's extremely important to ensure that any drilling will not impact Florida's $65 billion tourism industry or interfere with the important work of Florida's military bases, both of which are vital to our state's economy." After the Gulf oil spill, she joined other officials in calling for a permanent ban near Florida's shores. "I have seen the BP oil spill up close, spreading for miles," Sink said. "This evidence proves that near-beach drilling in Florida is a disastrous idea. We must never let oil companies drill just 3 miles off our beaches." It's clear Sink is opposed to drilling off Florida's coast, but she said in her statement that she opposed the idea "the minute" was floated in 2009. In a press release, she spoke out against the proposal three days after the House Policy Council voted for it -- and three days before the full House voted on it. Because she was so specific with her words, we have to be specific, too. Three days after a vote is not "the minute," despite her 2008 opposition. Sen. Nelson tweeted about it that very day. So we rate her claim Half True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-06-17T13:49:04	2010-06-10	['None']
pomt-01004	Science is "very certain" that the measles vaccine doesn't cause autism.	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/03/megyn-kelly/foxs-kelly-science-measles-vaccine-safety-certain-/	As the number of cases of measles slowly grows across the United States, it has revived a past debate over the safety of the vaccine that for decades prevented an outbreak. Potential presidential contenders, including Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, have suggested that parents should be allowed to decline vaccination for their children if they have concerns over side effects. Two Fox News hosts, Bill O’Reilly and Megyn Kelly, tackled the touchy topic of mandatory vaccinations on The O’Reilly Factor on Feb. 2, 2015. Kelly said she had all three of her children vaccinated and that for immunization programs to work, they must be mandatory. Kelly, however, cut some slack for parents who might have decided otherwise a few years ago. "They were given bad information years ago by a U.K. study that came out in 1998," Kelly said. "Five years ago the science wasn't even as certain as it is today. It is very certain today." In this fact-check, we take a look at the scientific certainty over the safety of vaccination. Along the way, we’ll see if the science has become even more certain in the past five years. We told Fox News we were digging into this and didn’t hear back, but Kelly’s five-year mark lines up with the formal retraction of that United Kingdom study she mentioned. To quickly recap, in 1998, a British medical journal called the Lancet published a paper by Andrew Wakefield and a dozen colleagues that claimed to show a link between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and autism. Many parents responded with predictable fear and vaccination rates began falling. The impact was strongest in the United Kingdom where the rate fell from the 90 percent range down to 80 percent. The United States saw a minor dip. In some states, the rate dropped below 90 percent although nationally the rate remained higher. In 2010, roughly five years ago, the Lancet retracted Wakefield’s study. This seems to be the benchmark for Kelly’s comparison. What we heard from the public health community is that not only is the medical science clear today, it was back in 2010 as well. The scientists were sure Dr. Mark Schleiss is director of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the University of Minnesota Medical School. Schleiss told PunditFact that the science was clear in 2010, and it’s clear today. "Wakefield's work had been discredited within a year or two of publication," Schleiss said. "After Wakefield, there were a number of other studies performed, and it was convincingly shown that there was no link with autism, but that safety information was already known well before that." Schleiss dates efforts to test the safety of childhood immunizations back to the 1980s when there were reports that the whooping cough vaccine caused developmental disorders. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute of Medicine (at the time, a division of the National Academy of Sciences) conducted studies and found the whooping cough reports without merit. Along the way, that work also established the safety of the MMR vaccine and would undermine Wakefield’s research in the Lancet. The Wakefield study had such a high profile that it spurred further rounds of research. In 2001, the Institute of Medicine published a report that found no evidence of an association between the vaccine and autism. In 2004, the institute conducted another review. The institute said in a press release, "14 large epidemiological studies consistently showed no association between the MMR vaccine and autism." Dr. Marie McCormick, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, oversaw the committee that conducted the 2004 IOM vaccine safety review. McCormick told us that there were no divisions within the scientific community at that time. "I think that the data were pretty firm as of 2004," McCormick said. By 2004, 10 of Wakefield’s co-authors had withdrawn their names from his study. Other things also had happened. Brian Deer, a British journalist, documented shoddy data that underlay the results. Deer also found that Wakefield never disclosed that he had been paid by a lawyer representing some of the children cited in the article. In the British Medical Journal, Deer later exposed how Wakefield engaged in an elaborate scientific fraud. Wakefield sued the British Medical Journal and lost. Editor-in-chief Fiona Godlee told PunditFact that "the science has been much the same throughout the MMR scare caused by Wakefield's paper." McCormick said the one thing that did change over the years was the public reporting around the topic. At the height of the scare, McCormick said news coverage suffered from a systematic flaw. "If a reporter interviewed a scientist about the results, she would almost automatically give equal time and weight to an opponent of vaccines regardless of the validity of their opinion," McCormick said. "Thus, to the viewer or reader, the issue would seem evenly balanced, even when it was not." Our ruling Kelly said that the science on vaccine safety is certain today. The researchers we contacted said that as far as the science is concerned, certainty had been reached at least 10 years ago with the release of a major national study debunking the link between the measles mumps, rubella vaccine and autism. Five years ago, the British journal the Lancet retracted the original report that triggered the initial wave of fear. That decision was the final nail in the coffin of a discredited report. If anything, Kelly undersold her point about when scientists agreed that vaccination is safe. We rate the claim True.	None	Megyn Kelly	None	None	None	2015-02-03T18:04:48	2015-02-02	['None']
pomt-14935	Paul Ryan "is one of only six House Republicans who voted for Teddy Kennedy's bill to force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/28/constitutional-rights-pac/paul-ryan-one-few-gop-vote-force-christian-employe/	Even if by one measure he is the most conservative Speaker in decades, the idea of Paul Ryan leading the U.S. House of Representatives is an abomination to some on the right. That was evident on Oct. 14, 2015, more than two weeks before the Wisconsin Republican’s colleagues elected him speaker. A conservative political action committee issued a news release announcing its "Fire Paul Ryan" campaign. The release from the Constitutional Rights PAC made a number of attacks on Ryan, including one about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. "Paul Ryan would be the most liberal, pro-union, Republican speaker in history," said the release, quoting North Carolina Republican Kay Daly, who is running against a GOP incumbent for Congress. "He is one of only six House Republicans who voted for Teddy Kennedy’s bill to force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees. Even John Boehner never did that!" As we’ll see, there are problems with each part of the claim. Ryan’s vote The Constitutional Rights PAC, based outside of Washington, D.C., says it "exists to advocate constitutional governance and remind elected servants of the oaths they swore to uphold." The PAC takes credit for forcing Boehner, Ryan’s predecessor, to resign, and it ran a "Fire Kevin McCarthy" campaign before the California Republican unexpectedly dropped his bid to be speaker. The PAC’s attack on Ryan is in reference to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known as ENDA, which aims to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. It has been introduced a number of times, beginning in 1994, but has never become law. The late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was the main sponsor of the 1996 version of ENDA. The measure died after failing in the Senate on a 50-49 vote. So, there was no House vote on the Kennedy bill. Moreover, Ryan wasn’t elected to the House until 1998, two years later. A 2007 version of ENDA did pass the House, 235-184. There was never a vote in the Senate. According to a New Yorker article on the history of ENDA legislation, the measure died because it did not include protection for transgendered persons. Ryan voted yes on that measure. "They didn’t roll out of bed one morning and choose to be gay. That’s who they are," he once said, acknowledging he "took a lot of grief" for the ENDA vote from fellow Republicans. The Constitutional Rights PAC, in its original news release, said Ryan was one of only six GOP House members who voted yes. That’s wrong. The release was later revised to say 10. But even that count is misleading, in that it only refers only to Republican House members who voted yes on the 2007 bill and are still in the House. As we noted, Ryan was among a total of 35 GOP House members who voted yes. Ten are still in the House, plus two others who voted yes are now in the Senate. The bill The thrust of the PAC’s claim is that the bill Ryan backed would have forced Christian employers to hire people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. That part of the claim is in error in that the bill did not include transgender people. And the "force" part of the claim, particularly as it applies to "Christian employers," goes too far. The bill would have prohibited employers of 15 or more persons from discriminating in employment -- including hiring, firing and compensation -- on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation. At the same time, it would have prohibited the adoption of quotas or granting preferential treatment to an individual based on their sexual orientation. What’s more, the bill had a religious exemption. For example, it did not apply to a "religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society which has as its primary purpose religious ritual or worship or the teaching or spreading of religious doctrine or belief." The bill would not have applied, for example, to a religious school in the hiring of teachers who taught religious tenets, though it would have applied in the hiring of more general positions, such as janitor. There would not have been a general exemption, however, for employers who are Christian. For example, under the bill, a Christian owner of a dry cleaning business would have been in violation of the law to not hire a qualified job applicant simply because the person was gay. Madison attorney Tamara Packard, who has taught sexual orientation and the law as an adjunct professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, pointed out to us that there was no affirmative action element or quota in the legislation. (She also noted that, despite that federal ENDA legislation has never become law, discrimination in employment against people based on sexual orientation is illegal under Wisconsin law. The state law also includes a religious employer exemption.) So, it’s a stretch to say the ENDA bill Ryan voted for would "force" Christian employers -- or any employers, for that matter -- to hire lesbian, gay or bisexual people. Walter Olson, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told us that some employers who would not have otherwise hired a gay person would have been forced to do so, if the person was qualified, or risk violating the law. But what the bill explicitly would have done is prohibit most employers from discriminating against gay, lesbian and bisexual people based on their sexual orientation -- which isn’t the same as requiring they be hired. Our rating The Constitutional Rights PAC said Ryan "is one of only six House Republicans who voted for Teddy Kennedy's bill to force Christian employers to hire LGBT employees." Ryan was among 35 House Republicans, including 10 still in the House (not six), who voted for a so-called ENDA bill that would have prohibited employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The ENDA bill Ryan voted for, in 2007, was not Kennedy’s bill from 1996. The 2007 bill would have protected lesbian, gay and bisexual people, but not transgender people. The bill, which exempted religious organizations in the hiring of certain employees, would not have forced employers to hire lesbian, gay and bisexual people but rather would have prohibited discriminating against them based on sexual orientation. We rate the statement False. More on Paul Ryan Blogger Erick Erickson: "Paul Ryan is one of less than a dozen Republican congressmen to have voted for every bailout to come before Congress." Mostly False. Ryan: "Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had" fast-track trade authority. Half True.

"Horrible news are coming from the President’s house while President (Donald) Trump on Friday began a 17-day stint at his prized golf club in Bedminster, NJ. Barron Trump has been rushed to hospital with severe pneumonia while on holiday in Bedminster, NJ," the Aug. 6 post said. Trump’s youngest son is indeed on vacation with his family at their Bedminster resort, but we found no proof of his purported illness. The post claimed Trump had sent a Snapchat photo to his friends captioned, "Not the sort of bangles I usually choose on holiday." We traced the image attached to the article to an 841-day old photo on an Instagram search engine called Mulpix. It’s not Barron Trump’s hand. "He also tweeted his friends, saying that he was currently ‘in a wheelchair, connected up to tubes, in a hospital,’ " the post said. But we didn’t find any tweets mentioning a wheelchair or a hospital in the various unofficial Barron Trump Twitter pages. The post also cited a nonexistent Fox News report that he was receiving treatment at an unnamed hospital. In reality, the post is stealing some real-life events from surrounding a British television show host. The host of the show Grand Tour, Jeremy Clarkson, was admitted to a Spanish hospital for pneumonia on Aug. 6, the same day as this fake news story was posted. A spokesperson for the show said in a statement that Clarkson "was admitted to hospital on Friday morning during a family holiday in Spain." Clarkson posted a photo on Instagram of his arm which he captioned, "Not the sort of bangles I usually choose on holiday." He also said he was in "in a wheelchair, connected up to tubes, in a hospital" in a tweet.

pomt-13169	"One-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump pays."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/27/hillary-clinton/clinton-undocumented-workers-pay-more-trump-federa/	Some undocumented immigrants pay more in federal income taxes than Donald Trump, said Hillary Clinton Oct. 26 at a rally in Tampa, Fla. Less than two weeks before Election Day, the Democratic presidential nominee chastised her opponent for his hardline stance on immigration. "By the way, one-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump pays," she said. Experts told us Clinton’s claim is grounded in educated estimates about undocumented immigrants and knowledge of Trump’s past tax practices. But they’re still just estimates. Undocumented workers There is no official count of undocumented workers who pay federal income taxes. But Clinton’s claim — that half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes — is an educated assumption that many experts use, said Kim Rueben, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. "As far as we can vet it, it is true," Rueben said. For reference, the Tax Policy Center estimates that 56 percent of the entire population pays federal income tax, while 44 percent don’t. Social Security is one way we know undocumented workers pay federal income taxes. The Social Security Administration estimated that in 2009, 3.1 million unauthorized workers paid into Social Security via payroll tax, even though most will not be able to collect those benefits. In addition to Social Security, payroll taxes also withhold federal income taxes from a worker’s paycheck. There’s also the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, which people who are unable to obtain Social Security numbers use to pay income taxes, regardless of immigration status. In 2013, 4.3 million people filed tax returns using ITINs. ITIN filers paid $9 billion in payroll taxes in 2014. Most people with an ITIN are undocumented immigrants, said Ruth Wasem, a public policy professor at the University of Texas. The number of people signing up for ITINs and paying taxes that way has grown over the past few years, particularly because many immigration reform proposals require undocumented immigrants to prove they have been paying taxes in order to qualify for some sort of legal status, Wasem said. Between those who contribute via ITIN, others who have taxes withheld from their paycheck, and any overlap between the two groups, Wasem said Clinton’s claim that half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes is likely a low ball estimate. Donald Trump While experts can make educated guesses about how many undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, there’s still too much we don’t know about Trump’s tax returns to speculate how much he presently pays in federal income taxes. Going against decades of tradition for presidential nominees, Trump has so far refused to release his tax returns. We know there have been at least a few years Trump didn’t pay federal income taxes and that tax write-offs are generally beneficial to real estate developers like Trump. Three pages of Trump’s 1995 tax returns, uncovered and verified by the New York Times, show it’s possible he was able to legally avoid paying federal income tax for as much as 18 years. A tax provision known as net operating loss allows people to report business losses on their personal tax returns as a deduction. So if a person’s reported net operating loss is equal to or larger than their personal income, that person does not have to pay income taxes. Trump’s $916 million loss reported in his 1995 tax return could counteract any income he earned that year and beyond, up to 18 years total under IRS rules in 1995, according to the New York Times. Going back a few more years, a 1981 report by New Jersey gambling regulators analyzed five years of Trump's finances as part of his efforts to get a casino license for a proposed casino-hotel complex. The report says Trump paid federal taxes for three of those five years, 1975-77, but he did not pay federal income tax in 1978 and 1979. So in the years Trump paid zero federal income taxes, undocumented immigrants who paid any federal income taxes presumably would have paid more than him. But Clinton’s claim is phrased in the present. Without Trump’s current tax returns, we simply don’t know what his tax burden is today. So in the most recent tax year, we don’t know who paid more in federal income tax, Trump or an undocumented worker. Our ruling Clinton said, "One-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump pays." While there is no official figure, experts estimate that about half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, if not more. So in a year when Trump does not pay federal income taxes, which has been the case in the past, undocumented immigrants who do federal pay income taxes would pay more than him. But Clinton makes it seem as if this is a present state, and we don’t know anything about Trump’s current tax situation because he has not made his tax returns public. For that reason, we have no way of comparing Trump’s federal income tax payments to those of any given undocumented immigrant. We rate Clinton’s claim Half True.

pomt-15164	Buying the naming rights to the new Falcons stadium is the largest marketing deal in Mercedes-Benz history.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/aug/27/steve-cannon/mercedes-benz-target-superlative-about-atlanta-sta/	German luxury automaker Mercedes-Benz this week signed a multimillion-dollar deal that officials said is aimed at further cementing the company’s relationship with Atlanta, home of its new U.S. headquarters. Mercedes-Benz bought the rights to have its name on the still-under construction $1.4 billion stadium that’s to be home to the National Football League’s Atlanta Falcons and Major League Soccer’s Atlanta United. Steve Cannon, CEO of Mercedes-Benz USA, told reporters Monday that buying the naming rights to the new Falcons stadium is the largest marketing deal in the company’s history. PolitiFact was intrigued. We decided to dig deeper. It’s not uncommon for teams not to disclose the financial numbers, and, at Monday’s press conference, officials were mum about the cost to Mercedes-Benz for the near-record 27 year naming rights. (The Atlanta Falcons keep all revenue from the naming rights under a stadium agreement they struck with the city of Atlanta and Georgia World Congress Center.) The Falcons said the goal was to land a deal in the upper range of NFL naming-rights agreements. The largest such deals are a reported $17 million-plus per year for both the New York Giants/Jets' MetLife Stadium and the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium and $11 million a year for the San Francisco 49ers' Levi's Stadium. We contacted Donna Boland, manager of corporate communications for Mercedes-Benz USA LLC. We asked for evidence supporting Cannon’s statement. "Since he’s been with the company for 24 years, more or less, you can take him at his word that this is the biggest marketing initiative we’ve undertaken," she said. Boland went on to say: "Unfortunately, as a matter of policy, we don’t disclose marketing/sponsorship costs – for this or for the Saints…." PolitiFact reached out to three academics who focus on sports economy. Their estimates of the annual value of the naming rights ranged from a low of $8 million to a high of $20 million. Don Muret, who covers sports venues for Sports Business Journal, citing a source who brokers such deals, put the price of the naming rights in Atlanta at $12 million a year, essentially double what has been widely reported as the amount Mercedes-Benz paid in 2011 for the naming rights to the Superdome for 10 years. Andrew Zimbalist, professor of economics at Smith College, valued the naming rights deal "in the neighborhood of $8 million to $10 million a year," or minimally $216 million for 27 years, given that "Atlanta is a lesser advertising market and the Falcons are not a team with much cachet." Joel Maxcy, associate professor in the Department of Sports Management at Drexel University in Philadelphia, had the highest projection: $20 million a year, on par with the Dallas and Giants/Jets deals, "given the nature of the stadium and where it is in Atlanta." Maxcy said it is likely a very good deal for Mercedes-Benz, given the national and regional television exposure from the professional and college football games, and even the visibility that the stadium has to commuters and travelers to Atlanta, he said. "When you take the gross value -- say $20 million over 27 years for naming rights, that’s why it expands into the biggest deal ever," Maxcy said. " But in 10 years or 12 years, when everybody’s paying double that [for naming rights] that looks really good." Victor Matheson, professor of economics at College of Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., said he expects the naming rights went for about $11 million, which is what Levi’s paid for the stadium in San Francisco and is about right "given the size of Atlanta." The naming rights deal in Atlanta is one of, but not the longest around, Matheson said. American Airlines has rights to the basketball/hockey area in Dallas for 30 years, he said. Mercedes-Benz has had commercials in past SuperBowls, not a spare-change ticket item. Reports say its naming rights in New Orleans is costing $60 million. On the low end of the estimates we received, the Atlanta naming rights -- 27 years at $8 million -- would total $216 million. (On the high end, 27 years at $20 million, the number jumps to $540 million.) The company also has its names on arenas in Shanghai China and Stuttgart Germany. Sports Business Journal has reported that Mercedes-Benz signed the Shanghi deal in 2009 for 10 years at $6 million a year, $60 million total. We tried to find out about Mercedes-Benz marketing investments, but the closest we could come was figures on what it spends on advertising. The auto maker spends about $340 million a year in the U.S. on advertising across all media, according to the monitoring service Kantar Media. Bradley Johnson, director of data analytics for the trade publication Advertising Age, said the Mercedes-Benz stadium deal in Atlanta will likely account for just a small part of the automaker’s annual marketing budget. Parent company Daimler in 2014 had estimated U.S. ad spending of $561.9 million, primarily for its Mercedes-Benz business, Johnson said, noting that Daimler also markets trucks and buses under brands including Freightliner, Thomas Built Buses, Western Star and Fuso. "If Mercedes says this is its largest marketing deal ever, then it presumably is Mercedes’ largest marketing deal ever," he said. "But most of Mercedes’ ongoing marketing spending doesn’t relate to a single deal. Over the period of this stadium deal, Mercedes is destined to spend billions of dollars on U.S. marketing." Our ruling Steve Cannon, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, said at a press conference on Monday, that buying the naming rights to the new Falcons stadium is the largest marketing deal in Mercedes-Benz history. The cost of those naming rights wasn’t disclosed. The company didn’t provide any evidence to back up his statement when we asked. Experts we talk to said the naming rights probably are costing the luxury car dealer between $8 million and $20 million a year, which over 27 years would be on the low end $216 million. Industry analysts say Mercedes-Benz may spend close to that top dollar figure in a single year, but not on a single marketing deal. We rate the statement Mostly True.

"I was one of about a dozen (senators) who voted against the Bridge to Nowhere," Allen said in a Dec. 7 debate with Tim Kaine, his expected Democratic rival for the senate seat. Allen, who served in the senate from 2001-2007, was referring to a federal plan to build a $225 million bridge connecting the city of Ketchikan, Alaska, with the Island of Gravina, which has 50 residents. The plan became a lightning rod for critics who said congressional earmarking -- the set aside of federal money for pet projects -- had run amok. Funding for the bridge was included in a $286.5 billion highway and transportation bill in 2005. The Senate passed the legislation on July 29, 2005, by a vote of 91-4. Jamie Radtke, who is challenging Allen for the GOP nomination for the Senate seat, has charged that Allen supported the bridge because he voted for the omnibus highway bill. We’re dismissive of the charge, because funding for the Alaska bridge came to less than one-tenth of one percent of the expenses in the bill. PolitiFact examined a similar charge that President Barack Obama supported the Bridge to Nowhere because, like Allen, he voted in favor of the overall highway bill that contained the bridge funding. The claim -- made by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, was rated Mostly False. But how does Allen justify his assertion that he actually voted against the bridge? Dan Allen, a senior advisor to the Allen campaign, cited the former senator’s vote on an amendment in a later transportation appropriations bill that called for stripping federal funding from the Bridge to Nowhere project. That amendment, sponsored by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, sought to redirect part of the funding for the Ketchikan-Gravina Island bridge funding to a project to rebuild the Twin Spans Bridge between New Orleans and Slidell, La., which had been damaged during Hurricane Katrina. That amendment failed by a vote of 82-15. Allen was indeed one of the 15 senators who voted in favor of killing the funding for the Bridge to Nowhere. Steve Ellis, the vice president of the Taxpayers for Common Sense, said considering Allen’s vote on the amendment, Allen’s statement is accurate. "It rings pretty true," Ellis said. After the amendment’s defeat, lawmakers hashing out differences between the House and Senate measure of the appropriations bill removed the earmark for the Bridge project and instead provided the money directly to the Alaska Department of Transportation to spend on whatever projects it saw fit. That funding still could have gone to Ketchikan-Gravina Island span, but ultimately the bridge was never built. Our Ruling Allen said he was one of a dozen senators who voted against the Bridge to Nowhere. When faced with a specific amendment to defund the bridge, Allen was one of a minority of senators who opted to kill the project. We rate his claim True.

pomt-05454	"We don’t allow filming inside of the City Hall unless there is a specific reason."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/25/h-ford-gravitt/mayor-orders-camera-council-meeting/	Meetings of the Cumming City Council rarely make the evening news, but that changed last week with video of a woman being tossed out of the public gathering. The woman, Nydia Tisdale, was attempting to film the council’s meeting April 17, but she was told that was not going to happen. "We don’t allow filming inside of the City Hall here," Mayor H. Ford Gravitt said, "unless there is a specific reason." PolitiFact Georgia thought the mayor’s statement was odd, considering our reporters have covered countless City Council meetings throughout the Atlanta region. The city of Cumming is a political subdivision that must abide by the laws of the state of Georgia, which has clear guidelines that generally allow meetings of elected officials to be recorded on video. When the mayor uses the collective "we" in his statement, he is speaking as the elected head of the city. We wondered whether the mayor had a basis for his objection and decided to put it up for a vote on our Truth-O-Meter. In a strange bit of timing, Tisdale was tossed from the council meeting on the same day Gov. Nathan Deal signed House Bill 397, a revised state law on open meetings and records aimed at providing greater access to documents and public meetings. Tisdale, apparently, likes to use the laws to keep others informed about what’s going on in Forsyth County. She has a YouTube channel that includes a recording of a contentious Forsyth County Planning Commission meeting and video of candidate forums. Tisdale was asked to turn off her camera at one Planning Commission meeting because one of the members was distracted by Tisdale holding the camera while speaking to the board. She declined to do so, and she began to recite the state’s open meetings laws. "That’s fine," the official said. Tisdale was recording the April 17 council meeting for nearly two minutes before it started. Once Gravitt called the meeting to order, he turned his attention to Tisdale. The mayor asked the police chief to have the camera removed. "Respectfully, mayor, Georgia’s sunshine laws ..." Tisdale says on the recording. "It’s not for discussion," Gravitt says, waving his hands. "I’m expressing my right as a citizen to record this meeting," Tisdale says as the camera shakes and her voice rises. "Sir, this is an open, public meeting." Gravitt tells Tisdale she’s allowed to take notes. Tisdale responds by saying the city is violating the state’s open meetings law. She eventually turns off her video camera after being removed from the meeting. So was this a violation of the Georgia Open Meetings Act? As promised, Tisdale filed a complaint with the state. The Georgia Attorney General’s Office sent Cumming City Attorney Dana Miles a letter dated April 19 that said "Georgia law expressly allows video recording of public meetings." Title 50, Section 14 of the Georgia Open Meetings Act states that "[v]isual, sound, and visual and sound recording during open meetings shall be permitted" at city council and other meetings. The act does not apply when governing bodies are discussing the acquisition of real estate, records that are not allowed for public inspection and most personnel matters. The mayor told Fox 5 Atlanta that he ordered the video camera turned off because of safety concerns. "I think if it's a safety issue, and you have people running over you maybe in a case of emergency, I think you can use some common sense," Gravitt said. He added: "Visual and sound equipment, it may be permitted. Well, you know, it's a little gray area there. I see it." Gravitt declined our request to talk about this, saying his attorneys have advised him not to do any more interviews. Hollie Manheimer, executive director of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, said the state’s open meetings laws specify that government meetings are allowed to be recorded. "The point of the Open Meetings Act is to allow an educated public to make informed decisions by way of watching its elected officials at public meetings," she said. "This legislative session, in particular, we all spent so much time on redrafting the statute -- all with the intent of maximizing public access." Manheimer said the past and revised code had similar language that allows city council and other meetings to be recorded. The state’s open meeting laws specifically state that city council meetings can be video recorded, excluding some specific instances. The beginning of this Cumming City Council meeting did not seem to be one of those special cases. We rate the mayor’s claim as False.	None	H.

pomt-14456	Says he "tore down hundreds of abandoned homes that served as havens for crime and reduce(d) the value of our neighborhoods."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2016/mar/04/tim-mcginty/prosecutor-tim-mcginty-claims-credit-demolishing-a/	Ohio has the gloomy distinction of being one of the hardest-hit states in the national foreclosure crisis. Its policymakers are also on the leading edge of crafting legislation to expedite foreclosures, hoping to remedy the hazards of "zombie properties," or vacant homes that sit as bait for vandalism and violent crime. Ohio HB 134 reduces the foreclosure process, which can take two to three years, down to as little as six months. Currently awaiting passage in the Ohio Senate, it would make Ohio the eighth state since 2009 to pass similar legislation. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine is most clearly associated with leading the demolition of empty homes. Ohio received funding through the National Mortgage Settlement after five of the largest mortgage servicers were accused of questionable lending practices. In 2012, with Ohio’s portion of settlement funds, DeWine dedicated a $75 million grant program to reimburse counties for demolishing abandoned properties. But Cuyahoga County prosecutor Tim McGinty, running for re-election, claims that his office is responsible for hundreds of demolitions in Cleveland. On his campaign website, McGinty claims he "tore down hundreds of abandoned homes that served as havens for crime and reduce the value of our neighborhoods." We zoomed in on the "hundreds" claim. Is McGinty stealing the attorney general’s shine? We made some calls to find out. The city of Cleveland demolished 761 abandoned and blighted properties in 2014 and 2015, according to statistics recently presented in the City Council’s budget hearings. Most of the funds for the tear-downs came from from county and federal dollars, but when demolition dollars dried up, McGinty’s office pitched in $2 million from the county’s Delinquent Tax and Assessment Collection Fund. Gus Frangos, the president of the Cuyahoga County Land Reutilization Corporation (aka the "land bank") says that the prosecutor, the city and his agency teamed up to tackle the problem. The land bank used $125,000 of the prosecutor’s funds to tear down 15 properties in "very challenged neighborhoods, which Prosecutor McGinty’s office has identified based on crime data and other distress factors," Frangos says. His agency tore down an additional 117 structures using its own funds from operating grants, donations and contributions. Dan Williams, city spokesperson, confirms that the city received $1.68 million from the prosecutor’s office and tore down 191 structures in 2015. Our rating McGinty says he tore down "hundreds of abandoned homes." It’s true that he piggybacked on the attorney general’s already-established program. But he also directed spending of $2 million from the Delinquent Tax and Assessment Collection Fund so that more demolitions could take place. The head of the land bank and a city spokesperson confirmed this with their numbers. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Tim McGinty	None	None	None	2016-03-04T13:34:53	2016-03-04	['None']

pomt-08609	"The total number of dollars that passes through the Department of Development is like $900 million and like $650 (million) of it has nothing to do with development, which is breathtaking when you think about it."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/22/john-kasich/john-kasich-claims-ohios-department-development-on/	If elected governor in November, Republican challenger John Kasich is certain to rule the state like a CEO managing a Fortune 500 company. In fact, Kasich has said he wanted to completely eliminate the Ohio Department of Development, the state’s primary job development agency. Instead, Kasich would outsource Ohio’s job recruiting and developing efforts to a 12-member private board of hand-picked business leaders who would report to him. In selling this idea to reporters in August, Kasich, who is challenging Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, ripped the current job creation efforts by the Department of Development as feeble and inefficient. "The total number of dollars that passes through the Department of Development is like $900 million and like $650 (million) of it has nothing to do with development, which is breathtaking when you think about it," Kasich told reporters Aug. 17 in Columbus. Essentially, Kasich is charging that the state’s primary job creation division only uses 28 cents of every taxpayer dollar it spends on seeking out and bringing jobs to Ohio. PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know, did Kasich make an accurate statement or just blurt out a comment to perfectly accompany his new idea? For starters, it is true that there is a lot more going on at the Department of Development besides job creation. The state agency also oversees home winterization and energy reduction projects, Ohio’s tourism marketing, and community development and housing programs, to name a few. The agency’s fiscal year 2011 budget is a little over $930 million. Of that, the agency is spending $327 million this year (not including federal matching funds) directly on what it calls economic development, which is job development programs. That would mean the department spends about 35 percent of its funds for job creation. Thus far, Kasich’s figures are off but his larger point — that a state agency charged with bringing jobs to Ohio spends the bulk of its money elsewhere — has some merit. But those easy to capture figures do not reveal the entire picture, says development Director Lisa Patt-McDaniel. Part of the problem is that through the years as various programs were added, such as providing heating assistance to people who can’t afford to pay their utility bills, state leaders often had no idea where to officially house the programs. Eventually, the Department of Development emerged as a catchall of various projects. Adding more slices to the pie actually crowds the slice entitled "job creation" and makes it appear the agency isn’t putting its all behind its main purpose. Money the department spends in other areas, such as, the Home Winterization Assistance Program, the Community Development Block Grant, even tourism, also each might contain job training programs that indirectly lead to economic development, Patt-McDaniel said. Also, those programs under development that focus on cleaning up brownfields, tidying up neighborhoods and green energy projects all make Ohio a more attractive place to live and do business, which also indirectly lures jobs. Development is really more comprehensive than just straight job development figures, she said. "It's important to understand that companies want to be in good communities with good quality of life and an educated workforce. They are all intertwined and important to each other. Our business is to make a business-friendly climate." For example, the department has budgeted $210 million for winterizing and making other energy saving adjustments to Ohio homes this coming winter. The department says the program alone has helped create 1,300 jobs. But the department cannot say how much of that $210 million can be extrapolated as purely job creation spending. To Kasich’s point, it is hard to believe that a state agency charged with bringing and retaining jobs for Ohio could spend only a small fraction of its state funds on its primary duty. Give him credit for the over-arching point. But his figures are off and do not encapsulate the full picture. Take some credit away for that. We rate his statement as Half True.

pomt-06281	"House Republicans are ramming through legislation ... to classify pizza as a 'vegetable' for the purpose of school lunches."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/22/democratic-national-committee/republicans-pizza-vegetable-school-lunch/	You may have heard the uproar by now: "Pizza is not a vegetable!" Democrats used the rallying cry in a mass e-mail Nov. 17, 2011, alerting partisans that, "House Republicans are ramming through legislation this week to classify pizza as a 'vegetable' for the purpose of school lunches." We wondered: Pizza as a vegetable? We had heard rumblings on social networks about magical pizza seeds and pizza gardens — all in response to Congress' action — and we had to know. Was it true? Here's more from Democrats' message: Why? Because a massive lobbying effort of Republican lawmakers by the frozen pizza industry, among other corporate interests, is underway to get around Obama Administration guidelines to make school lunches contain healthier options. In this Republican Congress, almost anything is up for sale to the highest bidder and most powerful lobbyists -- including the literal definition of the word "vegetable" -- and this time, it's coming at the expense of our kids' health ... Look, we could have a lot of fun with this one. But the fact is that there is a very real bottom line: Childhood obesity has tripled in the past three decades. And for some kids, school lunches are some of the best nutrition options they have during the day. School lunches are hard to change -- and it doesn't take a doozy like "pizza is a vegetable" to know that the corporate interests have more money and more Washington lobbyists than kids do. That's why pizza was classified as a vegetable during the Bush years. The Obama administration made that common-sense change, but the Republican Congress wants to take us back to the money-for-influence status quo. If you think this is as ridiculous as we do, tell the GOP that it's time they started picking real people over corporations (and real vegetables over slices of pizza, for that matter). Then it linked to a message for folks to send from MyDemocrats.org/Pizza. (The message: "Dear House Republicans, Pizza is not a vegetable. Sincerely, America.") We could have a lot of fun with this. We asked the source of the e-mail, Brad Woodhouse at the Democratic National Committee, to back up his statement. He sent us a CBS News/Associated Press article from Nov. 15, 2011, "Congress pushes back on healthier school lunches." The topic? A spending bill that forces the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ignore a proposed change from the Obama administration about how to credit tomato paste. (Congress simply won't fund implementation of the new rule.) The House and Senate both approved the bill Nov. 17, and the president signed it the next day. The new law doesn't mention pizza. What it does is allow just two tablespoons of tomato paste to continue to count as a serving of vegetables. The USDA had proposed requiring a full half-cup of the concentrated tomato spread before it would count as a fruit or veggie — a standard "serving" by volume — far more than you'd find slathered on a slice o' school cafeteria pizza. (And, yes, we're aware the tomato is technically a fruit. The federal regulations cover both fruits and vegetables, but most folks in this debate are referring to tomatoes as vegetables. Just roll with it.) How crazy is considering tomato paste on a pizza as a vegetable? One Washington Post Wonkblog reporter said that it's not as nuts as you might think. Sarah Kliff pointed out that two tablespoons of tomato paste offer up a nutritional profile comparable to a half-cup of apples or other fresh fruit. It offers more than a gram each of fiber and protein and more calcium and potassium than the apples. It also packs beta carotene and the antioxidant lycopene, according the the USDA. We should also note that the slices kids get at school aren't exactly the greasy, meat-laden marvels they might pick up at a pizza parlor. Federal nutrition standards require that school meals get no more than 30 percent of their calories from fat, and less than 10 percent from saturated fat. Schwan Food Co., which makes 70 percent of school-lunch pizza, started adding protein and whole grains to crusts and pushing down fat and salt to meet school standards. Not to mention, if that slice doesn't have at least two tablespoons of tomato paste on it, it's not going to fly. No creamy white or pesto pizza gets automatic credit. (Well, unless that pesto's made from enough basil or spinach ... but we digress.) Still, Margo Wootan, nutrition policy director for Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a Nov. 15 press release that, "if finalized, this legislation may go down in nutritional history as a bigger blunder than when the Reagan Administration tried (but failed) to credit ketchup as a vegetable in the school lunch program. Pizza should be served with a vegetable, not count as one." She's right that if the tomato paste didn't count as a serving of vegetables, kids would benefit from tomato-paste-covered pizza plus an additional serving of a vegetable. But is this the great Reagan ketchup debacle? The same amount of ketchup, according to the USDA, sneaks in about 10 times the sodium, contains just a third of the protein, less than a tenth of the fiber and more carbs and sugar. It offers smaller traces of vitamins, and half the beta carotene and lycopene. Tomato paste is not ketchup. Still, frozen pizza manufacturers and the frozen food industry did push hard to keep the vegetable designation for the tomato paste on the pizza. When it does, that's one less vegetable the school has to buy and a cheaper deal for school districts. Fewer vegetables for kids may not be exactly a win for America. But did House Republicans try "to classify pizza as a 'vegetable' for the purpose of school lunches"? They did fight for the classification for the sauce on the pizza and blocked a move by the Obama administration to boost the amount of tomato paste needed to count as a serving of vegetables. But they didn't try to classify "pizza" as a vegetable. And even the amount of tomato paste required, just two tablespoons, packs nearly the nutritional punch of a half-cup of other foods we consider healthy. That's a pretty important detail to omit. We call the Democrats' claim Half True.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2011-11-22T10:41:44	2011-11-17	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-12838	The seven nations identified in Donald Trump's travel ban were "identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/07/reince-priebus/were-7-nations-identified-donald-trumps-travel-ban/	Two days after President Donald Trump temporarily banned certain groups of people from entering the United States, his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, defended the executive order by directing attention to terrorism and Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama. The protest-triggering order has been criticized as a "Muslim ban" (it is and it isn’t, we found). But Trump refutes that, asserting that the part of the order targeting seven Muslim-majority countries is aimed at fighting terrorism. Priebus, a Wisconsin native, appeared Jan. 29, 2017 on NBC’s "Meet the Press" and said: Here’s the deal: If you're coming in and out of one of those seven countries -- by the way, identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists and affirmed by Congress multiple times -- then you're going to be subjected temporarily with more questioning until a better program is put in place over the next several months. As we noted in our Muslim ban article, the large majority of jihadists committing acts of terror in America have been American citizens or legal residents. And since 9/11, no one in the United States has been killed in a terrorist attack by someone from the seven countries, though there have been at least three non-deadly cases in which the perpetrator was connected to Iran or Somalia. So, were the seven nations that are identified in Trump's travel ban pegged by the Obama administration as the "seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists"? Not quite in that way, but Priebus has a point. Trump’s order Trump’s executive order has two major components. It suspended entry of all refugees -- those who want to resettle in the United States -- for 120 days and barred refugees from Syria indefinitely. It also prohibits nearly all citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days. That travel part of the order is a Muslim ban in the sense that most residents of those seven countries are Muslim. But it’s not a ban, in the sense that the vast majority of Muslims in the world don’t live in those countries and thus are not affected by the order. A week after the order, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, lifting the ban, although more court action followed. The Obama connection The travel part of Trump’s order does target the same seven countries that were singled out with a law Obama signed in December 2015. The Obama-signed law contains provisions that restrict travel to the United States for people who lived in or visited Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria since March 2011. They must have a visa to enter the United States; they can’t use what is known as the Visa Waiver Program, which allows 90-day U.S. visits to other foreign visitors. The law was soon expanded by Obama’s Department of Homeland Security to cover Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. They were identified in the agency’s announcement as "countries of concern," a phrase used in the law. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told us Priebus’ claim is not misleading, but that the law Obama signed doesn’t define the seven countries as the most dangerous in terms of harboring terrorists. There are other countries where terrorists are active but could have been left off the Obama list for other reasons, he said. There are countries, such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and others, where militants have significant space to operate, but there could be a variety of reasons why they were not included with countries where travel without visas is restricted by Obama law, he said. For instance, the U.S. government has a delicate relationship with the Pakistani government and there might be a desire on the part of the United States not to restrict travel from people in certain countries. Two notes before we close that don’t directly bear on Priebus’ claim, but shed light on the seven countries: Iran (added in 1984), Sudan (1993) and Syria (1979) are the only countries on the U.S. State Department’s list of "state sponsors of terrorism." They were determined by the secretary of state to have "repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism." Iraq, Libya, Somalia and Yemen are on the State Department’s list of "terrorist safe havens" -- where terrorists operate "in relative security." But nine other countries or regions are on the safe havens list, too. Our rating Priebus said Trump's executive order that temporarily bans nearly all travel to the United States from seven nations were "identified by the Obama administration as the seven most dangerous countries in the world in regard to harboring terrorists." Prompted by concerns about terrorism, the Obama administration did put those seven countries -- Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen -- on a list that makes travel into the United States somewhat more difficult. But that list doesn’t necessarily identify the seven as being the most dangerous. For a statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.

pomt-05324	After they bought GST Steel, "Mitt Romney and his partners loaded it with debt, closed the Kansas City plant and walked away with a healthy profit, leaving hundreds of employees out of work with their pensions in jeopardy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/16/barack-obama/obama-ad-claims-romney-bain-left-misery-wake-gst-s/	Mitt Romney’s business record is the central narrative of his presidential campaign -- and the main line of attack by his rivals. Is he a savvy businessman who understands the factors that make economies thrive? Or a corporate raider who makes rich profits for himself while often leaving working people as collateral damage? You can guess which storyline President Barack Obama’s campaign is weaving. A new ad from Team Obama tells the story of GST Steel, a company taken over by Bain Capital, the private equity firm Romney led for years before his entrance into politics. In the ad, we meet several steelworkers who lost their jobs eight years after Bain took over GST. The plant, which went through several owners, first opened in 1888. At its peak it employed 4,500 people in jobs that ensured college for the kids and a secure retirement.. But by the mid 1990s, the plant was struggling against competition and operating with outdated equipment. Bain bought the mill in 1993, took on debt, changed the management and paid dividends to investors. It created a new parent company, GS Industries, and acquired other steel businesses, building its reach, and its debt. Then steel prices dove, and the company had no cushion to weather the difficult times. In 2001, the parent company filed for bankruptcy protection — and shut down the Kansas City plant. "It was like watching an old friend bleed to death," former employee Joe Soptic says in the ad. Then we hear Romney’s voice: "As I look around at the millions of Americans without work, it breaks my heart." We’re checking a statement from an Obama campaign news release announcing the ad. It sums up the GST story this way: "After purchasing the company, Mitt Romney and his partners loaded it with debt, closed the Kansas City plant and walked away with a healthy profit, leaving hundreds of employees out of work with their pensions in jeopardy." First, some background The Kansas City plant produced wire for mattress springs and tires, as well as high-carbon balls and rods used by the mining industry to pulverize rocks. In 1993, owner Armco was looking to sell it, and selected Bain because the firm "had earned a sterling reputation for turning companies around," according to a Reuters story from January 2012 about Bain’s takeover. Bain Capital, in a statement responding to Obama’s ad, says it "undertook an ambitious plan in 1993 to turnaround GSI, a struggling manufacturer of specialty steel products that was slated for closure if no investor could be found. We invested more than $100 million and many thousands of hours into this turnaround, upgrading its facilities in an attempt to make the company competitive." Bain and its partners decided to buy the mill for $75 million, with Bain itself putting up about $8 million to gain majority control of the company, renamed GS Technologies Inc. We’ll examine each claim in the statement. So first, we address whether Bain "loaded" the steel company with debt. ‘Loaded it with debt’ After its initial $8 million investment, the new company issued $125 million in bonds — paying $65 million to stockholders in 1994, according to GS Technologies Operating Co. filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bain collected a $36.1 million dividend, according to Reuters. GS Technologies announced plans to spend $98 million modernizing the Kansas City plant and in 1995, issued another $125 million in bonds to pay for a merger with another wire rod maker in South Carolina. Bain reinvested $16.5 million of its earlier dividend, Reuters wrote. GST’s total debt in 1995: $378 million. "Paying distributions with debt is not uncommon," Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, told Reuters. "The only thing that strikes me as a bit unusual is the size of the dividend. There would be logic in them saving some cash for a downturn." Josh Kosman, a New York Post reporter and author of the book The Buyout of America: How Private Equity is Destroying Jobs and Killing the American Economy, said Bain reinvested its dividends so it could merge with the other steel company. "They needed to get bigger, to have more earnings to be able to handle the debt," Kosman told PolitiFact. Plans were put in place to take the company public, but other problems intervened. According to a 2002 story in the Boston Globe, plant workers said the company’s new owners brought in an inexperienced management team that had no expertise in steel manufacturing, although filings show several top executives did have experience at steel companies. In April 1997, the company faced its first labor strike in 40 years. The walkout stretched over 10 weeks, becoming bitter, divisive and sometimes violent. Then prices for electricity and natural gas skyrocketed. A power bill in September 1998 was more than double what it had been in 1997, a costly increase because the plant depended so heavily on electrical equipment. Meanwhile, a flood of cheap steel imports drove down prices in the late ‘90s, the company reported. In 1998, it worked with other steel companies and United Steelworkers of America to petition the government for limits on wire rod imports. But Kosman, the book author, argues that the debt acquired under Bain was the overriding problem. "After quickly raising profits, (Bain) had the company, less than one year after the buyout, borrow another $61 million to pay themselves a dividend. This left little room for error as profit, $32 million in 1995, could barely cover the increased interest expenses, rising from $9 million to $24 million," Kosman told us in an email. "Even when profits fell below interest payments in 1998 and 1999 due to cheap imports, there was enough operating profit to survive if not for the interest expense." In its 2001 bankruptcy filing, GS Industries listed total debts of $554 million. ‘Closed the Kansas City plant’ Along with the bankruptcy filing came the announcement that GS Industries was shutting down the Kansas City mill. Some 750 employees were put out of work. In a news release, the company said the bankruptcy was triggered in part by "the critical need to restructure the company's liabilities." How much of that was Romney’s fault? Mark Essig, GS Industries’ former CEO, never met Romney. Essig came aboard in January 1998, the year before Romney left to run the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. "His name never came up in conversation," Essig told PolitiFact. "In my tenure at GSI, he wasn't involved at all." Of course, by the time Essig came on board, the bulk of the debt had already been acquired, during years in which Romney ran Bain. (That’s very different from another Bain investment we examined, KB Toys, in which Bain Capital didn’t get involved until after Romney left.) Romney wasn’t on GS Industries’ board of directors, but several Bain employees were. Still, Essig points to a complex picture. Nearly half of U.S. steel companies filed for bankruptcy around the same time that GS Industries did. Major customers of the Kansas City plant did, too, Essig said. "Prices went down, costs had gone up, and it was kind of the perfect storm," he said. "Our debt load was a factor, no question about it. But there were companies without that debt load that also filed bankruptcy." Meanwhile, Essig pointed out, closing the Kansas City plant allowed GS Industries to save other plants. "In that respect, we viewed it as a partial victory," Essig said. Romney, who had left the company, retained his title as CEO of Bain Capital but was not involved in day-to-day operations. "I take personal responsibility for making the investment," Romney said in a statement at the time of the plant closure, according to the Globe. "But I didn't manage these companies. Our philosophy at Bain Capital was to support management teams in companies where we saw potential for growth, or in companies that were in financial distress that we thought we might be able to save." Essig, who voted for Obama in 2008 but this year plans to vote for Romney, doesn’t blame him. "No matter how you look at it or what side of the fence you're on, a plant closing is a tragedy for people. I think when you try to tie it to a person and say, Mitt was responsible for this — a lot of steel companies went out of business at that time, and Mitt had nothing to do with it," he said. "That was a macro-industry tidal wave that hit that plant. I bet if the Bain folks had to do it over again, they wouldn't have gotten involved with it. It can't be treated lightly, but to lay it at the doorstep of Mitt, I think, is not accurate." ‘Walked away with a healthy profit’ Bain had always turned impressive profits, and the GS Industries deal was no exception. The Los Angeles Times wrote last year that a prospectus from 2000 showed Bain delivered an average annual return of 88 percent from 1984 to 1999. The L.A. Times said Bain invested a total of $24 million in the entire steel company deal (including the merger in South Carolina) and ended up with a $50 million return -- "a 100 percent gain." Reuters also noted that Romney continued receiving dividends from Bain after he left, and Bain collected $900,000 a year from the steel company for management consulting services through 1999. ‘Leaving hundreds of employees out of work with their pensions in jeopardy’ Following the bankruptcy, GS Industries announced it would not provide workers with severance pay, health insurance, life insurance and pension supplements that had been promised. GS Industries also left the company’s pension underfunded by $44 million and in 2002 the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. bailed it out. Basic pension payments were covered, Reuters wrote, but not the supplement agreed to with the union. Our ruling Obama’s ad, and the news release announcing it, packed a lot of claims about Romney’s tenure at Bain Capital and how it handled its investment in a Kansas City steel mill. We are checking this claim: "After purchasing the company, Mitt Romney and his partners loaded it with debt, closed the Kansas City plant and walked away with a healthy profit, leaving hundreds of employees out of work with their pensions in jeopardy." We found, through corporate filings, interviews and investigations by other news organizations, that the statement is accurate but needs some clarification. First, it’s true that Bain added significantly to GST’s debt load while paying dividends to itself. The plant’s closure, however, happened after Romney had left daily operations at Bain, though he led Bain during six years of its majority investment in the plant. And other, outside factors were at work, making the steel industry a tough business. Steel prices were low and electricity costs were high, and those forces drove other steel mills out of business around the same time. The statement’s last two claims are solid: Bain (and Romney) made a profit from taking over GST, and the employees lost many benefits their union had negotiated, including supplemental pension payments. The federal government had to step in to shore up the fund. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-05-16T18:43:46	2012-05-14	['Kansas_City,_Missouri']
pomt-06556	Says Tommy Thompson "pushed such strict laws that abortion providers faced potential life imprisonment and women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/03/emilys-list/emilys-list-says-gop-us-senate-hopeful-tommy-thomp/	EMILY’s List, one of the 100 largest overall donors to federal elections over the past two decades, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, has set its sights on the race for an open U.S. Senate seat in Wisconsin. The group -- whose acronym stands for "Early Money Is Like Yeast" -- has raised $8.39 million in the 2011-2012 election cycle alone to elect pro-choice Democratic women to office. Founded in 1985, the group takes credit for helping elect 16 women to the U.S. Senate and 86 women, including Wisconsin’s Tammy Baldwin, to the U.S. House of Representatives. EMILY’s List is backing Baldwin’s run for the Senate seat that is being vacated in 2012 by Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl. And it is criticizing the Republican Senate hopefuls, including state Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, former U.S. Rep. Mark Neumann and former Gov. Tommy Thompson. In a Sept. 19, 2011 blog post, EMILY’s List derided all three GOP contenders as "far-right, conservative white males." It focused criticism on Thompson, who was Wisconsin’s governor from 1987 to 2001 before becoming U.S. health and human services secretary under President George W. Bush. The group declared that as governor, Thompson "pushed such strict laws that abortion providers faced potential life imprisonment and women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues." Strong words and a strong statement. The statement contains two parts. We’ll address them one at a time. Abortion providers facing prison In its blog post, EMILY’s List cited a 1998 Wisconsin law signed by Thompson that banned most partial-birth abortions. The law defined the procedure, performed during the second or third trimester of pregnancy, as one "in which a person partially vaginally delivers a living child, causes the death of the partially delivered child with the intent to kill the child and then completes the delivery of the child." Under the law, a partial-birth abortion could be performed to save the life of a woman. But anyone who illegally performed a partial-birth abortion could be convicted of a Class A felony, punishable by life in prison. That procedure, long controversial, is rarely used -- a point even pro-choice advocates made when fighting the ban. At the time, Thompson was quoted as saying: "This issue has captured our hearts, for the people of Wisconsin will not stand for a procedure so heartless to occur in our state. This is a matter of humanity. Banning partial birth abortions is simply the right thing to do.'' A federal appeals court struck down the Wisconsin law as unconstitutional in 2001. That court cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a similar Nebraska law, which the high court said put an "undue burden upon a woman's right to make an abortion decision." That left Wisconsin among 14 states whose partial-birth ban laws have been blocked by courts and are not in effect, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, an independent research organization that analyzes data on population growth and reproductive health. The institute doesn’t have statistics on partial-birth abortions, per se, but its latest national figures show that 1.5 percent of abortions in 2006 were done during the late second trimester or the third trimester of pregnancy. In any case, partial-birth abortions make up only a portion of the 1.5 percent of all abortions that are performed later in a pregnancy. So, although partial-birth abortions were rarely done, Thompson did --as EMILY’s List claimed -- support a law that subjected partial-birth abortion providers to possible life imprisonment. Women forced to leave state The second claim made by EMILY’s List was "women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues." The group cited news articles about abortion providers around Wisconsin canceling abortion appointments after a federal judge refused to issue a temporary restraining order to prevent the 1998 partial-birth ban law from going into effect. The articles quoted providers as saying that women who had scheduled abortions were forced to reschedule them or to get the procedure done out of state. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported at the time that abortion providers throughout Wisconsin put all abortion procedures on hold for a few days as they waited for legal questions about the law to be sorted out. EMILY’s List did not provide us evidence to show that any women left Wisconsin "to receive attention for life-threatening issues." The group’s spokeswoman, Jess McIntosh, said in an email: "The abortion providers who stopped working told dozens of prospective patients who needed to be seen immediately that they had to travel. Assuming not a single one did that and went on to have the procedure just isn't plausible." It’s also not likely, however, that all or even most females who were seeking an abortion at the time faced a life-threatening situation. Asked about the EMILY’s statement, Thompson campaign spokesman Darrin Schmitz said: "Gov. Thompson is proud of his pro-life record and defense of the unborn." Our conclusion In support of Baldwin’s Senate bid, EMILY’s List said Thompson had "pushed such strict laws that abortion providers faced potential life imprisonment and women were forced to cross state lines in order to receive attention for life-threatening issues." A partial-birth abortion ban that Thompson signed into law as Wisconsin’s governor did contain the life imprisonment provision. The law also caused many abortion providers, at least for a few days, to stop performing abortions. That means it was possible some Wisconsin women had to leave the state in order to get an abortion. But there is no proof, as EMILY’s List claimed, that women were forced to leave the state "to receive attention for life-threatening issues." We rate the EMILY’s List statement Half True.

pomt-06784	"Our credit rating went up since I've been in office."	false	/florida/statements/2011/aug/17/rick-scott/countrys-credit-rating-down-floridas/	In light of Standard & Poor's recent downgrade of America's credit rating from AAA to AA+, Republicans in Florida are trying to draw a contrast with President Barack Obama by claiming -- or at least passing along the news -- that Florida's credit rating has been upgraded. Florida Gov. Rick Scott made the declaration Aug. 11, 2011, in an interview with Panama City radio station WFLA 94.5 "Our credit rating went up since I've been in office," he said. "And their credit rating (the federal government's) is dropping because they’re not doing what we're doing in Florida. We are the most fiscal responsible state in the country." We've seen similar claims pop up repeatedly in the past few days. For example: • Adam Hasner, a former state House member and a candidate for U.S. Senate, tweeted, "S&P's upgrade of FL's credit proves balanced budget is first step towards fiscal solvency." • The Republican Party of Florida also posted the good news on Twitter. "Obama & the federal govt could learn a few things from FL & @FLGovScott—FL's credit rating was recently upgraded to AAA." • Same for Scott's official campaign Twitter feed @ScottForFlorida, which sent this message: "RT @FreedomsMob: USA downgraded by S&P, Florida upgraded to AAA by S&P http://t.co/F2qa5XK." The link takes people to an interview between Scott and CNBC host Larry Kudlow. "While the U.S. had its own debt downgraded, the Sunshine State of Florida (got) upgraded by S&P," Kudlow said before introducing Scott. Did Florida's credit rating go up, while the United States' credit rating went down? Standard & Poor's is a New York-based ratings agency that studies the financial markets. It issues guidance to investors and rates various investments for financial risk. That includes investments in public debt, such as bonds issued by the state of Florida. S&P spokesman Olayinka Fadahunsi told us that Florida has held S&P's AAA rating since February 2005. That means the agency considers Florida to have "extremely strong capacity to meet financial commitments." It's also the highest rating the agency gives. So how could Florida's rating have been upgraded? It wasn't, Fadahunsi said. Here's what happened: In January 2009, the agency changed its outlook on Florida debt. An "outlook" is an evaluation of the likely direction of a rating over six months to two years. In 2009, S&P's outlook on Florida's rating dropped from "stable," which means that a rating isn't likely to change, to "negative," which means that a rating may be lowered. In July 2011, as the United States was having its rating issues, things reversed course in Florida. S&P revised its outlook for Florida from negative back to stable (registration required to see report) based on the latest budget passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature and signed by Gov. Rick Scott. "The outlook revision reflects our view of the progress the state has made in addressing its structural imbalance through significant cost-cutting measures adopted in fiscal 2012 and maintenance of strong reserves," said Standard & Poor's credit analyst John Sugden-Castillo. The outlook change did not affect Florida's AAA rating. We also asked S&P spokesman Fadahunsi whether the agency considers a change in outlook a credit "upgrade." "We don't consider outlook changes upgrades or downgrades," he said. State Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater put it best in an Aug. 9, 2011, interview with the St. Petersburg Times. "Florida was AAA before the downgrade, it's AAA today, and in fact the rating agencies just upgraded our longer term outlook," Atwater said. Part of the problem with this myth is that the media has at times perpetuated it. On Aug. 16, for instance, the Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece headlined "Upgrading the States." It began: "Ohio and Florida get plenty of attention as Presidential election swing states, but this year they deserve notice for another reason. While Uncle Sam was having its debt downgraded, Ohio and Florida both got upgrades from Standard & Poor's in July as a result of their improved fiscal management." After more detail about Ohio, it added: "Ditto for Florida, which won a AAA rating after closing a budget hole with what S&P said were 'significant cost-cutting measures' and making a commitment to maintaining strong reserves. Governor Rick Scott's 2012 budget was praised for 'significant measures' to address its budget deficit and for being 'proactive in reducing expenditures to adjust for revenue shortfalls.'" We also found this Aug. 16 report from WOKV radio in Jacksonville. "While the United States credit rating with Standard & Poor's may have been downgraded recently, Florida's jumped from AA+ to AAA." The WOKV report quotes Atwater as seemingly acknowledging the ratings upgrade. "We went through, got lower pricing, because a triple A bond rating can give us that. In this marketplace, there aren't many of us out there who have that rating," Atwater said, according to the report. But CFO spokeswoman Alexis Lambert said the report misinterpreted Atwater. "The CFO was discussing Standard & Poor's revised outlook for Florida from negative to stable and the state’s ability to refinance bonds in the current market conditions," Lambert told us. To recap: Florida's credit rating was upgraded to AAA in 2005 while Jeb Bush was governor. Its rating has been the same ever since. The only thing that changed is S&P's outlook on Florida debt. It went from stable to negative, then back to stable. But that isn't considered an upgrade, the ratings agency says. (We should note that Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Florida, corrected his tweet about the credit rating. "Correction: S&P made positive change to the outlook of FL's credit worthiness, not the rating.") Standard & Poor's did react favorably to Florida's budget behavior this year. Both the S&P press release and a longer report we reviewed from the July outlook change spoke highly of Florida's fiscal strategy, especially its willingness to cut spending as revenue dropped. But it's not accurate to say Florida's credit rating went up, so we rule Scott's statement False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-08-17T17:44:14	2011-08-11	['None']

pomt-08069	Unemployment and the housing and auto industry crises can be fixed by giving a million dollars to every worker over age 50 to retire.	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2010/dec/22/chain-email/simple-solution-economic-crisis-would-cost-more-th/	Sometimes it's the simple, overlooked solution that's the best. One proposal for fixing the U.S. economy, known as the "Patriotic Retirement Plan," is making the rounds in e-mail inboxes, along with a notation that says, "I think this guy nailed it!" In some variations, it takes the form of a letter to the president: "Instead of giving billions of dollars to companies that will squander the money on lavish parties and unearned bonuses, use the following plan. You can call it the 'Patriotic Retirement Plan': "There are about 40 million people over 50 in the work force. Pay them $1 million apiece severance for early retirement with the following stipulations: "1.) They MUST retire. Forty million job openings -- Unemployment fixed. "2.) They MUST buy a new AMERICAN car. Forty million cars ordered -- Auto Industry fixed. "3.) They MUST either buy a house or pay off their mortgage -- Housing Crisis fixed. "It can't get any easier than that!! "P.S. If more money is needed, have all members in Congress pay their taxes. Mr. President, while you're at it, make Congress retire on Social Security and Medicare. I'll bet both programs would be fixed pronto! "If you think this would work, please forward to everyone you know." Apparently a lot of people are buying it. This e-mail, written and passed along by the mathematically challenged, has been going around since 2009, helped by the note that it was published Feb . 8, 2009, in The St. Petersburg Times. (The newspaper asked readers for their suggestions to fix the economy. This was one of more than two dozen responses.) Even though the plan was debunked by Snopes.com in April 2009, it continues to thrive on the Internet. A quick Google search shows that it has popped up on blogs as recently as last month, with supporting comments such as this one on Nov. 27 on Tech Support Forums: "That's so simple, and yet such a good idea ... I'm in, I'm only 47 give me a million I'll retire tomorrow, pay off my house keep my American cars I already have, split the rest in half and put half in the bank, invest the other half and live the rest of my life in comfort, and with the security the govt PROMISED me when I first joined the Navy." But as soon as you look at the numbers, the plan disintegrates. Giving 40,000,000 people $1,000,000 each would cost the United States $40,000,000,000,000, or $40 trillion. In contrast, the controversial TARP bank bailout package passed by the federal government was worth about $0.7 trillion (or $700 billion). That's just 1.8 percent of what this e-mail proposes to spend. To put this in perspective, the national debt as of Dec. 17 was nearly $14 trillion dollars. That's $44,648 for every man, woman and child -- legal and illegal -- in the United States. Getting 40 million Americans to retire early and spend money on a car and home would certainly help out the housing and automotive industries. But saying that our economic problems would be solved by nearly quadrupling our national debt to $173,000 per person is a ridiculous statement. Personally, we don't have that kind of money to burn. So, instead, we'll take a match and lighter fluid to this e-mail and declare it Pants on Fire!	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-12-22T00:01:00	2010-12-20	['None']

pomt-01991	There have been 74 "school shootings in America since Sandy Hook."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/13/everytown-gun-safety/have-there-been-74-school-shootings-sandy-hook-clo/	After an Oregon high school freshman armed with an assault rifle injured a teacher, killed a student and killed himself Tuesday, a striking statistic began circulating on the internet. It said that at least 74 school shootings had occurred since December 2012, when an assault on Sandy Hook Elementary School by Adam Lanza left 28 dead, including Lanza and his mother. The statistic came from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and gun-control advocate Shannon Watts. That comes out to more than one school shooting per week. Numerous media outlets reported the 74 school shootings figure, and the number spread widely in Facebook posts and through other forms of social media. Even President Barack Obama brought up the once-a-week line in an interview with Tumblr CEO David Karp. In the interview, Obama discussed his frustration with lawmakers’ inaction on gun control legislation, particularly in the wake of Sandy Hook. While it’s not clear that Obama was specifically referencing the statistic compiled by Everytown, his comment was in line with their math. "We’re the only developed country on Earth where this happens," he said, "and it happens now once a week." But as widely as the number spread, it also attracted criticism. Charles Johnson, who writes for the conservative Daily Caller, garnered attention for what he considered a debunking of the Everytown list. We decided to sift through the numbers ourselves. How Everytown counted 74 incidents To its credit, Everytown provided details on each of the 74 shootings, including the date, city and school location. The group also clearly laid out its methodology at the bottom of the list. These make it possible for the critics -- and us -- to look under the hood at its calculations. The main reason for the criticism of Everytown’s count is that its definition of "school shooting" is relatively broad. The group’s criteria goes beyond what many people would consider "school shootings" -- incidents in which a student or an intruder enters a school and fires at innocent students and staff. For many people, this is the first thing that comes to mind when they hear the phrase "school shooting" -- an incident such as Sandy Hook or, before it, the 1999 Columbine shooting in Colorado that left 15 dead, including the shooters. Here’s the methodology as explained by the group at the bottom of the list: Incidents were classified as school shootings when a firearm was discharged inside a school building or on school or campus grounds, as documented in publicly reported news accounts. This includes assaults, homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings. Incidents in which guns were brought into schools but not fired there, or were fired off school grounds after having been possessed in schools, were not included.... Incidents were identified through media reports, so this is likely an undercount of the true total. This definition allows for incidents that don’t typically call to mind the term "school shooting" -- for example, a case in which a man unaffiliated with Alogna High/Middle School in Iowa killed himself in the school’s parking lot in the middle of the night, or an early-morning armed robbery on a street that goes through the Marquette University campus in Wisconsin. Both count in Everytown’s tally. Clearly it is difficult to draw lines. The Everytown list did not include the recent and highly publicized shooting spree in Isla Vista, Calif. In that case, the shooter was a student at the University of California at Santa Barbara, and he targeted other students, including women living in a sorority house near the campus. Seven people died, but the shooting wasn’t technically on campus, so it didn’t make the list. Our Breakdown We reviewed news reports for all 74 shootings and did our best to sort them into five categories. Here’s our breakdown. (See individual shootings by category here, with clickable links to news reports on each shooting.) • Incidents such as Sandy Hook or Columbine in which the shooter intended to commit mass murder: 10 instances • Incidents related to criminal activity (such as drug dealing or robbery), or personal altercations: 39 instances • Incidents unconnected to members of school community and/or that took place outside school hours: 16 instances • Suicides: 6 instances • Accidental discharges: 3 instances In all, these 74 incidents resulted in 38 deaths and 53 injuries. The biggest death toll in one incident was a shooting spree that ended at Santa Monica College. Six people died, though not all of them took place on the campus. While the list includes a lot of gunfire, deaths and injuries, only about 14 percent were shootings that mirrored Columbine and Sandy Hook. In addition, almost half -- 35 -- occurred at a college or university rather than a K-12 school. This clashes with the imagery invoked by the line in the chart’s introduction, that "we should feel secure in sending our children to school — comforted by the knowledge that they’re safe." We asked James Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University, for some perspective. He pointed to the 2013 "Indicators of School Crime and Safety" report compiled by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. There were about 45 school-associated violent deaths (not just by guns) at elementary and secondary schools each year between the 1992 and 2010 school years, according to the report. The highest annual total was 63 deaths in 2006-07, while the lowest was 31 in 2010-11. In other words, Fox said, the number of gun deaths documented by Everytown over the past year and a half are not out of the ordinary. About 15 to 20 kids in grades K-12 are killed at school each year, along with a similar number of college students, he said. Is it misleading? The experts we consulted agreed that Everytown’s broad definition of "school shooting" could be misleading, encouraging them to assume that there have been 74 incidents similar to Columbine or Sandy Hook. While the Everytown definition is certainly one way of calculating it, there is such a range of motivations, degrees of planning and outcomes that it ceases to be an especially useful measurement, said Jay Corzine, a University of Central Florida sociology professor. Mark Safarik, president of Forensic Behavioral Services Inc. and a former member of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit, agreed that when the average person thinks of a school shooting, they think of a mass murder like Sandy Hook. "There is an ocean of difference between Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech and Columbine and a depressed student who (commits suicide) at school, or an accidental discharge," Safarik said. "To call them all school shootings may be true in a technical sense but is quite disingenuous on an emotional level, which is where they are trying to capture for their audience." Everytown has countered the media criticism by arguing that focusing too closely on Sandy Hook-like incidents unfairly diminishes the full extent of the dangers to students and staff posed by guns in or near schools. "The country's gun-violence epidemic has seeped into our children's schools, and that is a problem, regardless of the body count," said spokeswoman Erika Lamb. "Those lives count, too, even if the media is only focused on mass tragedies." Corzine prefers the designation used by the New York Police Department, among others -- "active shooter," which limits the list to incidents that occur during school hours, involving a firearm discharged with the intent to kill or injure others on school grounds or while in transit on a school vehicle. In addition, Fox said the statistic is misleading for another reason -- it focuses on short-term patterns, rather than long-term trends. Despite the media focus, Fox said, it’s worth noting that the number of school-related homicides has remained relatively flat for two decades, he said. "I don't mean to minimize the horror of these events or the pain and suffering of victims, but schools are safe, safer than other places that our children spend time," he said. "For some kids, school is even safer than their home." Corzine said he sees some value in Everytown’s calculations -- but also pitfalls. On the one hand, "they are a valid indicator of the ease with which firearms enter the school environment in the United States compared to other highly developed nations." By the same token, though, "it is misleading to use the 74 school shootings in a context that explicitly or implicitly equates them with Sandy Hook." Our ruling A statistic calculated by Everytown for Gun Safety, and shared widely on social media, said that there have been 74 "school shootings in America since Sandy Hook." The group’s figure is accurate only if you use a broad definition of "school shooting" that includes such incidents as suicides, accidents and spillover from adjacent criminal activity. The figure has some value in quantifying the proximity of guns to school campuses, but the group makes a significant stretch by tying the statistic so closely to the mass shooting at Sandy Hook. By doing this, the group closely associates the statistic with planned mass shootings targeting students and school staff -- a category that, using a more strict definition, accounts for only 10 of the 74 incidents. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02752	A gun "background check is futile. Something like 42 (people during the) last year … were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of 11 million."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/15/larry-pratt/gun-supporter-says-few-prosecutions-show-backgroun/	Fox News Sunday used the one-year anniversary of the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., to renew the gun debate. Carlee Soto, the sister of Newtown victim and Sandy Hook Elementary School teacher Victoria Soto, and Mark Kelly, the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, both advocated for a failed Senate bill that would expand background checks on gun purchases. Larry Pratt, the executive director of Gun Owners of America, countered by calling for more guns in schools. He also dismissed the Senate legislation. "The background check is futile," Pratt said. "Something like 42 (people during the) last year … were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of 11 million." This talking point came up quite a bit in the months after the Sandy Hook shooting. The numbers aren’t far off, but they also doesn’t get at the heart of what a background check accomplishes. If 42 people out of 11 million were the only ones deterred from legally buying a gun because of a background check, then maybe "futile" would be an accurate description. After all, that’s only 1 in every 262,000 applications. But before we get into the other elements of a background check, let’s get the numbers right. Since the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 went into effect, federally licensed firearms dealers and state and federal authorities have used the FBI background check system to determine whether an individual can legally purchase a firearm. Pratt’s claim that 11 million background checks were conducted during the last year of record is a high estimate, but not by much. According to the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics, it’s actually around 10.4 million in 2010, the latest year on file. He’s also not far off on the number of prosecutions. A report by the Regional Justice Information Service "Enforcement of the Brady Act, 2010," showed 62 charges were filed by U.S. attorneys across the country in response to background checks. Of those charges, 18 were dropped, putting the tally at 44, a couple more than Pratt’s number. However, that doesn’t include local charges in states that conduct their own checks. As PolitiFact noted earlier this year while conducting a similar fact-check on comments from Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., that’s likely to increase the total number of prosecutions. In his research, Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the Regional Justice Information Service, found that in the four states that voluntarily report local cases — Colorado, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia — 1,520 arrests were noted. Another 17 states that conduct background checks themselves were not included. "You’d have to say (the total number of arrests) would be higher," Frandsen told PolitiFact at the time. "There’s no question." Pratt is also ignoring all the individuals who were denied weapons up front because they could not pass a background check. In 2010, 153,000 applications to purchase a firearm or obtain a permit were blocked. The most common reason an application is denied is because the customer has a previous felony conviction or indictment, making up almost half of all denials for federal checks and one-third of state checks. It’s still a small percentage of all the applications processed, about 1.5 percent, but it’s much more than Pratt lets one believe. Our ruling Pratt said "the background check is futile. Something like 42 (people during the) last year of record were prosecuted for trying to buy a gun with a criminal record out of 11 million." He is a little off in his numbers, but they’re close. However, his statement also paints just a partial picture of the entire background check procedure and how authorities and gun sellers use it to keep criminals from purchasing weapons. To make a bold claim like the system is "futile" and then leave out the thousands of individuals denied a firearm because of a background check is misleading. We rate it Half True.

pomt-07001	"Dubious taxpayer-funded stimulus projects in Rhode Island include … $250,000 to provide digital television to the state’s inmate population."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jul/10/ocean-state-policy-research-institute/watchdog-group-says-ri-used-stimulus-funds-250000-/	Flip through "The 2011 Rhode Island Piglet Book" and you’ll find hundreds of examples of what the Ocean State Policy Research Institute (OSPRI) considers wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars OSPRI, which says it is devoted to "the principles of free enterprise, limited government, and traditional American values," published the 39-page booklet in June with the support of Citizens Against Government Waste, a national conservative nonprofit group. The report focuses on municipal, state and federal spending in Rhode Island. The authors say the booklet "exposes over 300 pork projects, bungled boondoggles, bad ideas and examples of abuse of power that have resulted in the waste, fraud and abuse of more than $600 million of the taxpayers’ hard-earned money." We can’t check on every example. But we were intrigued by one, related to federal stimulus spending, that OSPRI executive director Mike Stenhouse cited when publicizing the report on an appearance on WHJJ-920 AM’s "The Helen Glover Show." The report says: "The stimulus’ $2 billion price tag alone doesn’t tell the whole story of how tax dollars were spent – and wasted – in Rhode Island. In order to see the pork projects and frivolous spending hidden in the state’s stimulus spending, it is necessary to take a closer look." Included on a list of "some of the more dubious taxpayer-funded stimulus projects" is "$250,000 to provide digital television to the state’s inmate population." Our antennae perked up: Did the state channel stimulus funds to digital TV for prisoners? The item in the report is footnoted and includes the first in a series of links that bring you to an OSPRI Web page with what appears to be a list of Department of Corrections projects. It includes $250,000 "to convert digital television signal." We inquired about the project at the state Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment, which administers spending under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) -- the formal name of the stimulus program. Deputy director Laurie Petrone reviewed records and got back to us. "Under ARRA, they are not receiving any funds for that," she said. So we contacted the corrections department "There were no ARRA funds used for the digital conversion project," said spokeswoman Tracey Zeckhausen. When we related this to Stenhouse, he sent an e-mail with an attached state document that he said was where "the specific information was originally drawn from." The document heading reads, "Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment" and beneath that it says "submitted requests under review, state agencies and state university." Beneath that, in larger red type, the phrase "submitted requests under review" is repeated. Petrone said those headings reflect that the document was merely a list of projects that various state agencies and institutions proposed as possible candidates for stimulus funding. The state compiled the list as it prepared to apply for stimulus money, she said. Ultimately, many did not receive ARRA funds, including the requested $250,000 for digital TV conversion at the Adult Correctional Institutions, she said. The corrections department did undertake the project, however, using $143,000 in capital funds and $31,000 from its general fund to pay for work that ended up costing $174,000, Zeckhausen said. The sources of those revenues were state taxpayer dollars, she said. The project, completed in early 2009, prepared the Adult Correctional Institutions for the federally mandated deadline for full-power TV stations to switch from analog to digital broadcasts. After that date, June 13, 2009, the prisons’ analog TVs -- the only kind available at that time -- would have been unable to receive over-the-air broadcasts without special converter boxes and antennae. And, Zeckhausen noted, "They do not get cable." The ACI’s 3,200 inmates watch TV in common areas and in their cells. In minimum security, as many as eight inmates may live in the same dormitory room and share one television. Inmates in old maximum security, who have no cellmates, have the exclusive choice of what to watch. The 2009 project involved improvements to the ACI’s existing antenna system, including rewiring and installing new components for reception of over-the-air digital broadcasts, Zeckhausen said. TVs are connected to the antenna wiring via a cable plugged into a cell wall. Today, inmates can purchase converter boxes for their analog TVs for $69 or buy new 13-inch digital flat-screen TVs for $191 (with clear backs to prevent the hiding of contraband). The TVs can receive about two dozen stations, including NBC, CBS, ABC and PBS outlets in Providence and Boston. Why should inmates get to watch TV at all? "An idle inmate can present a security risk. Keeping prisoners occupied is critical, and the opportunity to watch TV is one way to do that," Corrections Director A. T. Wall said in a statement. He also said that TV "keeps inmates...in tune with current events, another factor in preparing them for life beyond the walls." But our mission here isn’t to judge whether such spending is, or is not, "dubious." It’s to check on the accuracy of the report’s claim. Here’s what we found: OSPRI got two things right. The project was "taxpayer-funded" and it did provide digital television to the state’s inmates. But it got two big things wrong. First, the project didn’t cost $250,000. The actual price was $174,000. And more important, it is not a "stimulus project." OSPRI should have heeded the cautionary note in big red type on the document it cited. A call to the Office of Economic Recovery and Reinvestment would have cleared that up. When we told Stenhouse what we learned, he downplayed the source of the project’s funding. The main purpose of the Piglet book, he said, is " to list federal, state, and local expenditures of taxpayer dollars in R.I." Isn’t the purpose of a 38-page report with 412 footnotes to get the facts right? Furthermore, the OSPRI report pointedly described federal stimulus spending as a "litany of pricey and preposterous handouts" in highlighting 17 local projects it said benefited from the program. When we asked Petrone about those other items, she said only 2 of the 17 won funding through the state. We can’t delve into those here, but we’re checking into whether any secured stimulus funding through some other means, if they received any public funding at all, and whether the projects were actually undertaken. (Download the report, go to page 32 and let us know the ones you’re interested in.) The Piglet Book authors got a bit lucky on this one. The fact that the ACI completed the project without stimulus funding saved their bacon from the flames of a Pants on Fire ruling. We rate this one False (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-03798	"Quite frankly, it was during the Bush years of spending, multiplied now by the Obama years that we have this mess."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/mar/26/steve-latourette/former-rep-steve-latourette-says-spending-during-b/	Since retiring from Congress at the beginning of this year because he was frustrated by partisan gridlock, former Bainbridge Township GOP Rep. Steve LaTourette has become head of the Republican Main Street Partnership, where he has urged more centrism and cooperation between Republicans and Democrats. In that capacity, LaTourette has dismissed Republicans who refuse to compromise with Democrats as "chuckleheads" who are hindering governance. In a March 17 segment on "Fox News Sunday", LaTourette debated those views with a leader of the Tea Party movement, FreedomWorks president and CEO Matt Kibbe. Kibbe told LaTourette that "the only reason we are talking about a balanced budget, the only reason that we’re having a serious debate about $16-plus trillion in debt, is because of the Tea Party class in 2010, and the folks we had in 2012." "We’re never going to fix the problem just by pretending that the process of bipartisanship somehow gets to real problems, because that’s how we got here," Kibbe said. "This crisis was created by both Republicans and Democrats not willing to make tough choices." "That flies in the face of what we did in the 1990s," LaTourette responded. "Bill Clinton was the president, John Kasich was the budget chair and Newt Gingrich was the speaker and we created the Balanced Budget Act in 1997. And quite frankly, it was during the Bush years of spending, multiplied now by the Obama years that we have this mess." LaTourette went on to tell Kibbe the Tea Party is an important part of the Republican Party, but he believes "just saying no doesn’t get you anything, and it creates these false crises. And you can get past the false crises if you work something out." In light of Kibbe’s skepticism that bipartisanship can fix the nation’s budget problems, we thought it was worth examining LaTourette’s assertion that Republicans in Congress worked with the Democratic-controlled White House in 1997 to balance the budget, and "it was during the Bush years of spending, multiplied by the Obama years that we now have this mess." According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was designed to shave $127 billion from the federal budget deficit between 1998 and 2002, largely by slowing the growth of the Medicare program. After that agreement, the federal government’s revenue exceeded its spending from 1998 to 2001. Throughout that period, Clinton controlled the White House and Republicans controlled the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. President George W. Bush took office in January 2001, after the 2001 budget had been assembled by Clinton and the GOP Congress. As noted by FactCheck.org, the debt the government owes to the public decreased during this period of surpluses, but was not erased. In 2001, CBO predicted the government would run a total of $5.6 trillion in surpluses from 2001-11, including a surplus of nearly $900 billion in 2011 alone. It forecast that the federal government’s debt would be erased by 2006, and there’d be a $2.3 trillion surplus by 2011. Instead the federal government ran $6.1 trillion in deficits, including deficits exceeding $1 trillion in each of 2009-11. Numerous organizations have analyzed what went wrong. In an April 2011 report, the nonpartisan Pew Charitable Trusts said a variety of factors are responsible for the growth in federal debt since 2001. Its fiscal analysis put two thirds of the blame on legislation adopted since January 2001 that enacted roughly three dollars of new spending for every two dollars in tax cuts. It traced 13 percent of the increased debt to tax cuts that were implemented from 2001 to 2003, 10 percent to spending caused by military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, 6 percent to the Recovery Act, 3 percent to tax legislation adopted in 2010, and 2 percent to establishment of prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. A different nonprofit, nonpartisan economic research organization called e21 says the projected surpluses did not materialize because forecasters made inaccurate projections, such as failing to predict "the bursting of the 1990s dot-com stock bubble, which by itself eliminated the surpluses projected for 2002 and 2003." It said that spending increases were responsible for nearly half of the evaporated surplus, that off-base projections caused about 27 percent, and tax relief caused 24 percent. "One major factor that worsened the fiscal outlook was a large increase in federal discretionary spending," said the e21 report authored by former Bush administration economic advisor Charles Blahous. "Much of this, of course, happened after the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001. The U.S. thereafter conducted major military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and also increased expenditures on homeland security. These policies were enacted with bipartisan support, including bipartisan decisions to add their costs to the federal deficit. Discretionary spending increases further accelerated in 2009-11." It is clear that federal budget surpluses disappeared after 2001 for a variety of reasons. During last year’s presidential contest, a great deal of political wind was expended over whether Bush or Barack Obama was more to blame for elevated government spending since 2001. Because LaTourette said they both left a mess, it’s not necessary here to dissect how much harm was done during each presidency. It is worth noting that Bush had a Republican Congress to back his initiatives during most of his presidency. Partway through his first term, Democrats assumed control of the U.S Senate when Vermont’s Jim Jeffords left the Republican party and announced he’d caucus with Democrats. Republicans controlled all three branches of government from 2003 through 2007. During Bush’s last two years, Democrats controlled the House of Representatives and Senate. Obama began his term with his fellow Democrats in charge of the House and Senate. Two years later, Republicans took charge of the House of Representatives, though Democrats retained control of the U.S. Senate. That scenario persists today. LaTourette is correct that the federal budget was balanced in the 1990s, at a time when a Democratic president was forced to find common ground with Republicans who controlled Congress. He’s also correct that the nation’s budget woes have escalated since then. Spending is no doubt a major factor, but there are a variety of reasons. With that point of clarification, we rule that LaTourette’s statement is Mostly True.	None	Steve LaTourette	None	None	None	2013-03-26T16:49:20	2013-03-17	['Barack_Obama', 'George_W._Bush']
pomt-12791	"The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/16/donald-trump/trump-hints-stock-market-record-high-linked-presid/	As he lauded his first month in office, President Donald Trump reaffirmed his promise to create jobs by citing the progress of the stock market as signaling a promising business environment. "The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world," Trump said in a press conference Feb. 16. "To me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, ‘Oh, that's good.’ Now it means, ‘That's good for jobs.’ Very different." Trump had sent a similar message earlier in the day, tweeting: "Stock market hits new high with longest winning streak in decades. Great level of confidence and optimism - even before tax plan rollout!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com All three major stock indexes closed at record highs for five days in row on Feb. 15. But does Trump get credit for that, as he suggested? Experts told us there are nuances. Stock market winning streaks The Dow Jones Industrial Average includes the stocks of the 30 largest and most powerful companies in the country (Wal-Mart, Disney, Pfizer, for example). The Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) consists of the 500 most commonly traded stocks and represents about 80 percent of the total value of U.S. stock markets. The Nasdaq Composite Index features mostly technology companies. All three major indexes on Feb. 15 closed at record highs for the fifth consecutive day. It was the first time the three indexes achieved concurrent high records for that length of time since January 1992, according to analyses reported by CNNMoney and MarketWatch. MarketWatch countered part of Trump’s tweet, saying that the Feb. 15 high really wasn’t "the longest winning streak in decades." "Rather, it’s the best record-setting stretch in a quarter century … In terms of winning streaks, the S&P has risen for seven consecutive trading days for its longest stretch of up days since September 2013, when it also rose for seven straight sessions. That’s according to Dow Jones data," wrote MarketWatch’s Victor Reklaitis, also noting Dow gains for five days straight and a Nasdaq seven-session winning streak. (More on the those winning streaks here and here.) Experts told us that investors are at least somewhat hopeful about Trump’s promised tax and regulation cuts, though that’s not the sole driver of the stock market highs. Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 30 directing that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be eliminated. Trump says "wasteful and unnecessary" regulation kills jobs and stop businesses from growing. Trump also has promised to slash the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. In meetings with CEOs of different industries, Trump has reiterated that tax cuts are coming and that he’d like to get rid of 75 percent of regulations, "maybe more." He has also tweeted about a border tax for imports. "I would definitely say Trump gets credit," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The S&P 500 returns are up 3.8 percent from Jan. 20, the day Trump took office, said Stovall, who has studied the market’s returns during each president’s first month dating back to President Herbert Hoover in 1929. Amid the recession and during Obama's first month in office in 2009, returns fell 9.4 percent, Stovall said. They rose 1.4 percent during Obama's first month in office in his second term, according to Stovall's study. Tim Duy, an economist and professor at the University of Oregon, said the economy was poised for relative strength as the end of 2016 approached, regardless of Trump’s inauguration. "Underlying growth remained solid, and it increasingly looked like some of the inventory overhang of the previous year was easing," Duy said. Manufacturing and services sector surveys were going up, and two factors that’d been weighing on stocks -- decline in oil prices and strength of the dollar -- waned over 2016, Duy added. "The economy was not headed into a recession and, in the absence of a recession, stocks are more likely to go up than down," Duy said. "In other words, this was largely baked into the cake regardless of who won the election. Trump was handed a solid economy at the macro level." It’s still reasonable to believe that hopes of tax cuts have boosted stocks to some degree, but it wasn’t the dominant factor, Duy said. Economic news has been nuanced in recent weeks. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show 227,000 jobs were added in January 2017. The unemployment rate in January was 4.8 percent, slightly higher than the previous month but based on 584,000 more people looking for jobs after accounting for annual adjustments to population controls, according to Feb. 3 BLS figures. "Consumer confidence decreased in January, after reaching a 15-year high in December," said in a Jan. 31 statement Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, which presents the Consumer Confidence Index based on a monthly survey. "The decline in confidence was driven solely by a less optimistic outlook for business conditions, jobs, and especially consumers’ income prospects. Consumers’ assessment of current conditions, on the other hand, improved in January," Franco said. "Despite the retreat in confidence, consumers remain confident that the economy will continue to expand in the coming months." Trump certainly isn’t the first to boast about the stock market’s performance. In 2015, Hillary Clinton claimed the stock market does better when there’s a Democratic president. While several calculations backed her statement, we rated her claim Mostly True because experts said several other factors are key in determining performance, including timing, policies and international economic trends. Our ruling Trump said, "The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world." The three major stock indexes, Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed at record highs for five consecutive days. While investors are optimistic about Trump’s plans to cut taxes and eliminate regulations, experts say other factors play influential roles in the stock market. After rising in December, consumer confidence dropped in January, though consumers are confident the economy will expand in coming months. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-05721	"When my grandfather came to this country back in 1925, there were no government benefits."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/06/rick-santorum/santorum-says-when-his-grandfather-came-us-1925-th/	On a number of occasions, Rick Santorum has used speeches to tout the theme of self-reliance and limited government, including one claim about government programs at the time his grandfather immigrated to the United States. Here’s an excerpt from his Feb. 29, 2012, speech near Knoxville, Tenn.: "Eight or nine months ago, President (Barack) Obama, responding to Paul Ryan’s budget, gave a lecture on all these wonderful programs that Ryan was going to cut or change. Programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps and housing programs and Medicaid and Medicare. He listed them all. He said America is a better country because of these commitments. And then he read off his teleprompter, he said, ‘I will go one step further. America was not a great country until these commitments.’ "So the president of the United States did not believe America was great until people came into power in Washington who raised your taxes, took your freedom and then redistributed your hard-earned dollars to someone that Washington believed deserved it more than you did. In his mind, that’s the greatness of America. "That’s what makes America not different or great -- it makes it like every other country in the world. And by the way, all of us came from those countries because we didn’t want those countries to take care of us. When my grandfather came to this country back in 1925, there were no government benefits." There’s a lot to digest here, but we’ll focus in this item on whether it’s true that when Santorum’s grandfather arrived in the United States in 1925, "there were no government benefits." We contacted the Santorum campaign about this statement but received no response. But did hear from a dozen historians and economists and read a number of scholarly papers on the subject and found that the pre-1925 history of social welfare spending in the United States was complicated and nuanced. There were two major sources of payments to individuals prior to 1925 -- veterans benefits and workers' compensation. We’ll take a closer look here: Veterans benefits: The federal government began funding benefits for Civil War veterans in 1862, initially based on a physical examination to determine the severity of a wartime injury. In time, however, the threshold for receiving a benefit was lowered -- first to less obvious wartime ailments, then to retroactive wartime claims that had never been previously been reported and then, in 1890, to servicemembers who had a disability not related to their military service. "Pensioners and federal expenditures swelled after 1890, and the amount the government spent on pensions that year alone was $106 million," Peter Blanck and Chen Song wrote in a 2003 paper in the William and Mary Law Review. The 1890 Disability Pension Act, they wrote, was called the most expensive and liberal pension measure "ever passed by any legislative body in the world" at the time. The law was expanded further in 1904 through an executive order by President Theodore Roosevelt, defining "disability" to include old age, as long as the beneficiary had at least 90 days of service and an honorable discharge. Three years later, the 1890 law was replaced by a new one that granted pensions to veterans over 62, with increases in payments as they aged. "In 1907, it was estimated that the 1890 Act had cost more than $1 billion," Blanck and Song wrote. "Between 1870 and 1910, the proportion of veterans receiving pensions rose from 5 percent to 93 percent." A veterans’ health system also began in the aftermath of World War I. This was not a trivial portion of the population. In a different paper, University of Arizona economist Price V. Fishback wrote that "roughly 40 to 48 percent of the elderly in the North and Midwest in the early 1900s were receiving pensions" through the system. This was such a significant group, Fishback wrote, that "it likely altered the political calculus in ways that delayed the adoption of old-age assistance and pensions in the United States for a decade or two." The presence of federal benefits created, and reinforced, a broad interest group. "At its height in the 1890s, the (Union veteran) pension scheme consumed almost half of the federal budget and was intimately linked to the Republican Party's strategy to maintain the soldier vote and hold the White House," Blanck and Song wrote, adding that "it galvanized interests of the constituency of disabled (Union) veterans, who were increasingly important to the Republican and Democratic parties in the upcoming national elections." Worker compensation: A federal worker-compensation law to help civilian government workers injured or made sick on the job was adopted in 1908, according to a history on the Social Security Administration website. Starting in 1911, states began passing such laws, and by 1929, laws were in effect in all but four states. Some states ran the compensation systems themselves, others required employers to pay into private plans, and some gave employers a choice between the two. While these are the clearest examples that run counter to Santorum’s claim, there are a few other efforts worth noting. Local government aid to the poor: During the period Santorum is talking about, local governments were responsible for providing benefits to the poor, Fishback told PolitiFact. These payments tended to be modest. Fischback cited a study by Brendan Livingston of Rowan University that looked at welfare policies in Massachusetts -- generally considered the most generous state in the first decades of the 20th century -- and found that local governments were spending an amount equivalent to about 0.5 percent to 1 percent of all income earned by state residents on relief for the poor. Private charities were spending at about twice that rate. By 1925, most states also had "mothers' pensions" on the books, which allowed widows to raise their children without having to put them in orphanages, according to Fishback’s paper. By then, a handful of states also had means-tested pensions for the elderly, and a sizable number had pensions for the blind. And states or municipalities often operated mental hospitals, old-age homes, orphanages and general hospitals, all for the public benefit. "The 1920s were years when state and municipal expenditures expanded rapidly and public and social services continued the professionalization that had started mainly after World War I," said Michael B. Katz, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania. Schools and universities: While education isn’t a direct payment to individuals, it’s worth pointing out that they represented a government-provided benefit in kind. "Primary and secondary education were already overwhelmingly paid for by taxes from the late 1800s on," said Peter Lindert, an economist at the University of California at Davis. Meanwhile, higher education had land-grant subsidies -- federally backed institutions dating back to the Morrill Land-Grant Acts of 1862 and 1890. "Because they were public institutions, tuition was cheaper on account of public subsidies," said Gary Gerstle, a historian and political scientist at Vanderbilt University. "This was clearly a government benefit." Health funding for mothers and newborns. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding signed the Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Protection Act, which gave states matching federal funds to build and operate prenatal and child health care centers. The bill grew out of an investigation begun under President William Howard Taft, which found that "nearly 80 percent of U.S. women did not receive proper prenatal care -- a fact starkly illustrated during World War I when thousands of men failed to pass their physicals due to afflictions stemming from inadequate medical care as children." Adding it up How much did such expenditures add up to? Researchers from the Urban Institute pointed us to old editions of the Statistical Abstract of the United States. One table shows a compilation for expenses for federal, state and local governments for selected years between 1902 and 1970. We chose 1922, the year closest to 1925, and found that the "public assistance" category amounted to $57 million, the "other public welfare" category totaled $71 million and "veterans services otherwise not classified" was $505 million. Combined, these three categories were 6.8 percent of expenditures at the three levels of government combined. Even if this overstates the amount, it’s clear that the amount of government benefits was not zero. Santorum does have a point that social welfare spending by 1925 was relatively small compared to what it would ultimately become, because two major programs, Social Security and Medicare, didn't start until later. "The most obvious feature of social expenditures at the turn of the 20th century was how much smaller they were in comparisons with the levels at the turn of the 21st century," Fishback wrote. As we noted in a previous fact-check of Santorum, federal entitlement programs have grown significantly, particularly after the establishment of Social Security in the 1930s and Medicare in the 1960s. In 1958, such payments accounted for 25.4 percent of the federal budget and grew to 65.1 percent in fiscal year 2011. This is not purely a result of policy decisions; it’s also a result of technological advances and demographic trends. The cost of medical care has risen significantly over the years due to technology and advances in treatments (a topic we earlier discussed here), and the percentage of the population that is elderly has grown from 4.1 percent in 1900 to 12.2 percent in 2000. It’s also worth noting that the specific individual Santorum cited -- his newly arrived immigrant grandfather -- wouldn’t have benefited from military pensions or a land-grant college upon his arrival on these shores, and his ability to collect worker compensation would have depended on what state he lived in upon his arrival. Similarly, the local aid to the poor he would have qualified for would have varied significantly depending on what city or county he lived in, and it would have been small by the standards of later decades. "I’d go easy on Santorum for this one," said Brookings Institution economist Henry Aaron. "There wasn’t much back then." "Santorum is not alone in making these mistakes," Fishback told PolitiFact. "I would bet that the vast majority of people including many social scientists do not know what our social welfare system looked like in 1925." Still, Aaron and Fishback are among many economists we contacted who were skeptical about the underlying message of Santorum’s claim -- that life was better before the New Deal programs of the 1930s and the Great Society programs of the 1960s. Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, notes that inflation-adjusted per capita disposable income grew from $6,537 in 1929 to $32,659 in 2011 -- a fivefold increase. "Life is unquestionably better, unless you think two-earner households, busy spouses, and dirtier homes are not worth SUVs, air conditioning, and weekend in Paris," said Douglas J. Besharov, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland. Our ruling Contrary to what Santorum said, millions of Americans in 1925 would have either qualified for benefits directly, such as payments to veterans, or have been protected by workers' compensation laws that provided benefits to those who became disabled by their jobs. And state and local governments had the longstanding role of paying support to people who were disabled or indigent. This provides a much more complex picture than Santorum is painting.

pomt-14677	Says Sen. Ted Cruz used to be "in favor of birthright citizenship" but is now against it.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/15/marco-rubio/rubio-mischaracterizes-cruzs-statement-birthright-/	Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz picked up their immigration battle at another presidential debate, with Rubio accusing his rival of flip-flopping on a laundry list of positions, including birthright citizenship. "You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship. Now you say that you are against it," Rubio said as Cruz vigorously shook his head. The question takes on special significance in this case, since Cruz, born in Canada to an American mother and Cuban father, has had his own American citizenship questioned by frontrunner Donald Trump. We decided to check if Cruz has changed his political position on whether the children of immigrants should be American citizens if they are born in the United States. We found Cruz has shifted his talk about birthright citizenship, but it’s not in the way Rubio described on national television. Campaign comments When we asked Rubio’s campaign about the accusation, they sent us a list of attacks about Cruz allegedly switching positions on a host of issues. But the claim boils down to a 2011 radio interview on The Duke Machado Show during Cruz’s Senate campaign. The show’s host asked Cruz whether the issue of birthright citizenship in the 14th Amendment should be changed. The amendment states, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside." Now, Cruz didn’t offer outright support for birthright citizenship. Cruz, a former prosecutor, said it would be difficult to revisit the provision. "The 14th Amendment provides for birthright citizenship. I’ve looked at the legal arguments against it, and I will tell you as a Supreme Court litigator, those arguments are not very good," he said. "As much as someone may dislike the policy of birthright citizenship, it’s in the U.S. Constitution. And I don’t like it when federal judges set aside the Constitution because their policy preferences are different. "And so in my view I think it is a mistake for conservatives to be focusing on trying to fight what the Constitution says on birthright citizenship. I think we are far better off focusing on securing the border, because birthright citizenship wouldn’t be an issue if we didn’t have people coming in illegally." The full interview isn’t available, so we can’t say what else Cruz may have said on the subject during the 2011 broadcast. Pressed to clarify his view during the current presidential campaign, Cruz gave a series of interviews in August 2015 to show he opposed the practice. "We should end granting automatic birthright citizenship to the children of those who are here illegally," Cruz said in an Aug. 19 radio interview on "The Michael Medved Show." Medved asked if Cruz would change the Constitution if he could: "I think that it is possible, but any constitutional amendment, by its nature, is difficult to achieve. Look, I would note, that has been my position from the very first day of my running for the Senate." Cruz repeated his position Aug. 23 on Face the Nation, saying while he is against giving the kids of undocumented immigrants citizenship, the real problem is a matter of preventing illegal immigration with better border security. "I think birthright citizenship as a policy matter doesn't make sense," Cruz said. "We have right now upwards of 12 million people living here illegally. It doesn't make any sense that our law automatically grants citizenship to their children because what it does is it incentivizes additional illegal immigration." Two days later, he told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly that birthright citizenship is an incentive for undocumented immigrants to come to America and that "we ought to change that policy" but that "there is a legal dispute about the best means to do it." "There are serious scholars who argue that Congress could do it through statute defining what it means to be subject to the jurisdiction, the language of the 14th Amendment," he said. "There are other serious constitutional scholars who argue the only way to change it is through a constitutional amendment. My view is, we should pursue either or both, whichever is effective; What matters is that we should change the policy so we are not rewarding and incentivizing and encouraging more illegal immigration." Is it a flip-flop? Some conservative media outlets, and Rubio, have said this amounts to a "flip-flop" for Cruz. But it’s not that straight-forward. At most, Cruz said in 2011 he didn’t think changing the 14th Amendment was feasible from a legal standpoint, and conservatives would be better off focusing on securing the borders. We couldn’t find any statements by Cruz that showed anything resembling support for birthright citizenship, and we don’t read his resistance to fighting a constitutional amendment as support for the concept in the way his critics do. That said, there has been a shift on one thing: Cruz now says he supports pursuing a change, either with an amendment or legislation. Cruz’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. Our ruling Rubio said Cruz used to be "in favor of birthright citizenship" but is now against it. He was referring to a 2011 radio interview in which Cruz said birthright citizenship was guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, and it was better for conservatives to focus on border security instead of trying to change the Constitution. He has since insisted he opposed birthright citizenship then and opposes it now. We can’t find evidence that contradicts him. Cruz apparently changed his mind on at least one thing: He has said he now supports Congress pursuing a way to change the policy. While that raises questions on some details about Cruz’s position, it’s different than what Rubio claimed. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-05848	Says a U.S. Supreme Court justice suggested that some U.S. cases will be decided based on South African law.	false	/florida/statements/2012/feb/14/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-us-supreme-court-justice-south-african/	Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio spoke to his fellow Republican brethren at the Conservative Political Action Conference -- the annual gathering of big-name conservatives. In his speech Rubio defended those who believe in the Constitution. Let’s make that crystal clear -- the U.S. Constitution. "So the majority of Americans are conservatives," Rubio said Feb. 9, 2012. "They believe in things like the Constitution. I know that’s weird to some people but they believe in it. Of course, if you listen to one of our Supreme Court Justices recently she believes that. ...’’ At this point, the audience interrupted Rubio with boos. "Yeah," Rubio continued. "Let me just say if you are an appellate lawyer, you need to brush up on your South African law because that is how some cases apparently are going to be decided here going forward. Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah -- America." We wondered what Rubio was talking about; it sounded like he was saying that a Supreme Court justice had suggested that future cases will be decided based on South African law. (We fact-checked whether the majority of Americans are conservatives in a separate report.) Rubio didn’t name the justice in that part of his speech, but it didn’t take long to find a flurry of media reports about comments U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made on Egyptian TV, in which she mentioned the South African Constitution. But when we listened to her entire interview, we found that her point didn’t relate to decisions about U.S. cases at all. Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told us in an email that "Ginsburg recently praised the South African constitution, said it was better than ours." He also pointed to this post in Foreign Policy magazine, which reviewed the response of conservative blogs to her comments. When we contacted Conant again and told him that we thought Rubio’s claim was inaccurate, Conant replied, "I think it was pretty clear that Sen. Rubio was joking." (Watch Rubio's remarks and decide for yourself.) What Ginsburg said Once an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, Ginsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. She is widely viewed as one of the court’s most liberal justices. Ginsburg went to Egypt in January 2012 to meet with Egyptian judges and legal experts, and while there gave an interview to Al Hayat TV. The interviewer asked Ginsburg her advice about whether Egypt should look to other countries’ constitutions as a model. Ginsberg replied: "You should certainly be aided by all the constitution-writing that has gone on since the end of World War II. I would not look to the U.S. Constitution, if I were drafting a constitution in the year 2012. I might look at the constitution of South Africa. That was a deliberate attempt to have a fundamental instrument of government that embraced basic human rights (and) had an independent judiciary. It really is, I think, a great piece of work that was done. Much more recently than the U.S. Constitution is Canada, (which) has a charter of rights and freedoms (and) dates from 1982. You would almost certainly look at the European Convention on Human Rights.....I'm a very strong believer from listening and learning from others.'' During the 18-minute TV segment, Ginsburg made several other comments -- many positive -- about the U.S. Constitution: • The Egyptian Constitution "should safeguard basic fundamental human rights, like our First Amendment is the right to speak freely, to publish freely without the government as a censor." • "One of my favorite provisions in our Constitution is the one that says that government shall not deny to any person the equal protection of the laws." • The U.S. Constitution includes a separation of powers between Congress, the president and the judiciary, and the judiciary has independence. • "We have the oldest written constitution still in force in the world. And it's a constitution that starts out with three wonderful words: ‘We the people." • The men who wrote the U.S. Constitution were "some of the most brilliant minds" and "very wise." Ginsburg also noted that at the time the U.S. Constitution was written in 1787, slavery was legal, and women weren’t part of the Constitutional Convention (though Ginsburg notes that John Adams' wife Abigail urged him to not forget the ladies as he wrote it). "The genius of the Constitution, I think, is that it had this notion of who composes 'We the People.' It has expanded, expanded over the years. So now it includes people who were left out at the beginning: Native Americans were left out, certainly people held in human bondage, women, people who were newcomers to our shore," she said. The left and right respond to Ginsburg Ginsburg’s comments set off fire from the right. Consider these headlines: "Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Anti U.S. Constitution" wrote the Liberally Conservative blog, and from U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., posting on RedState, "Our constitution is not irrelevant, Justice Ginsburg." Mathew Staver, founder and chairman of the Liberty Counsel and Dean of Liberty University School of Law, said, "For a sitting U.S. Supreme Court Justice to speak derisively about the Constitution she is sworn to uphold is distressing, to say the least." On the left, Media Matters said the right was showing "misplaced outrage" and linked to the blog of Eugene Volokh, a law professor at University of California at Los Angeles. (Volokh told us he considers himself center-right or libertarian-conservative.) Volokh argued that Ginsburg, who swore an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution, probably thinks it works well for our country. "But why should she (or we) think that the 1787 constitutional text, coupled with the 27 amendments that have come in fits and spurts since then, would necessarily work well for a completely different country today? … None of this tells us whether Justice Ginsburg is committed to following the U.S. Constitution in the U.S. Maybe you think she is so committed and maybe you think she isn’t, but you’d have to figure that out from other sources than from the advice she gives to a different country about whether to adopt the constitutional text in a completely different political and legal requirement." A Boston Globe editorial wrote that there was no outrage when Justice Antonin Scalia told a congressional panel in October 2011: "The bill of rights of the former ‘evil empire,' the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, was much better than ours. I mean it literally: It was much better. We guarantee freedom of speech and of the press. Big deal. They guaranteed freedom of speech, of the press, of street demonstrations and protests, and anyone who is caught trying to suppress criticism of the government will be called to account. Whoa, that is wonderful stuff!'' The Globe explained: "Why no outrage? Because Scalia went on to make the point that the Soviet constitution was nothing but ‘words on paper,' a fig leaf for tyranny. By contrast, America's constitutional system - with its careful separation of powers and government institutions checking and balancing each other - has proved a bulwark against tyranny. Only someone brazenly yanking Scalia's words out of context could have accused him of revering the Kremlin's Potemkin constitution more than the one drafted in Philadelphia in 1787." Our ruling Rubio mentioned a female Supreme Court Judge and then concluded, "if you are an appellate lawyer you need to brush up on your South African law because that is how some cases apparently are going to be decided here going forward." Rubio was implying that Justice Ginsburg favored South African law rather than the U.S. Constitution, and that some cases in the U.S. might be decided based on South African law. Rubio’s spokesman says he was joking, but even a joke can leave some viewers with a false impression. Rubio could have poked fun at Ginsburg’s comments without distorting them. There is nothing in Ginsburg’s interview in which she suggested that any legal matter in the U.S. should be decided based on anything from South African law. Ginsburg was giving advice to another country on how to draft a constitution, and she suggested examples written more recently than the U.S. Constitution. She didn’t dis the U.S. Constitution -- she explained that it was written at a time when slavery was legal and women didn’t have equal rights. In fact, Ginsburg also heaped lots of praise on the U.S. Constitution. We rate this claim False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2012-02-14T09:00:00	2012-02-09	['United_States', 'South_Africa']

pomt-11346	"In many places, like California, the same person votes many times. You probably heard about that. They always like to say 'oh that's a conspiracy theory.' Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/06/donald-trump/no-proof-trumps-claim-millions-voted-many-times/	In a speech in West Virginia that was billed as being about tax reform, President Donald Trump continued his refrain about widespread voter fraud by stating that millions of people vote multiple times. "In many places, like California, the same person votes many times," he said. "You probably heard about that. They always like to say 'oh that's a conspiracy theory.' Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people, and it's very hard because the state guards their records. They don’t want to see it." Is there evidence that millions and millions of people have voted many times? No, there's not. But we will summarize the research on this topic. National experts have said that voter fraud is isolated and rare -- and the same holds true for voting multiple times, a phenomenon called double voting. Double voting -- a person casting more than one ballot in an election -- is not the same thing as a person being registered in more than one state, which often happens when people move. Pew found in 2012 that approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state. But as we’ll see, that doesn’t mean that 2.75 million people actually voted more than once. We contacted Trump’s spokesman to ask for evidence and didn’t get a reply. Research on double voting A group of experts in computer science and political science from Stanford and University of Pennsylvania published a paper in 2017 that estimated the prevalence of double voting in the 130 million ballots cast in the 2012 presidential election. The researchers estimated that 33,000 votes, or .02 percent of the votes cast, could have been double votes, but they called that an upper-bound estimate. "We would expect to estimate there were around 33,000 double voters even if there were no actual double votes cast," they wrote. The paper concluded that there was almost no chance that double votes could affect the outcome of a national election. The researchers explained in an essay in Slate that double voting is hard to detect because voting records cannot be easily linked across state lines. Kris Kobach, the Republican secretary of state of Kansas, who helped lead Trump’s now defunct voter fraud commission, promotes the Interstate Crosscheck Program, an ongoing program that coordinates the collection of registration records across states. As of 2014, 28 participating states provided the program with their registration records. The states received a list of registrations in their own state that matched the first name, last name, and date of birth recorded on a registration in another member state. In the 2012 election, Crosscheck flagged more than 1.4 million registrations as potential duplicates that member states should further scrutinize. But the key word there is potential. "In a country where 130 million votes are cast in a presidential election, there is a surprisingly high chance that two ballots cast under the same first name, last name, and date of birth actually belong to two different people," the researchers wrote. "While it is unlikely that any two randomly selected vote records would share a common first name, last name, and birthdate, a sizable number of these cases will occur once we aggregate over the 10 quadrillion pairs of vote records in the population. This phenomenon is what statisticians call the birthday paradox." Investigations of double voting There have been some investigations into double voting, some of which led to prosecutions, but they are rare -- far, far less than millions of votes. The conservative Heritage Foundation keeps a voter fraud database which said it showed 1,071 proven instances of fraud including 961 criminal convictions between the 1980s and 2017. Using the database, we counted 80 criminal conviction cases for duplicate voting between 2001 and 2017. (In a few cases, two individuals were convicted.) The California Secretary of State was investigating 56 allegations of double voting as of March 2017, according to its response to a public records request by CALmatters, a nonprofit journalism venture. The New Hampshire Department of State and Department Safety said in the fall of 2017 that 196 people were being investigated as possibly having voted in New Hampshire and one other state. This information is still under view, and the state expects to announce findings in June. News 21, a national investigative reporting project, found that there had been 13 cases in Arizona prosecuted for double voting, according to a 2016 report. In North Carolina, Verna Roehm, 77, pleaded guilty to voting twice after she admitted that she fulfilled her dying husband’s wish to vote for Mitt Romney in 2012. Voting experts such as Loyola law professor Justin Levitt said that no research backs up Trump’s statement. "There is zero evidence for President Trump’s claim that there are millions and millions of double voters," he said. "Zero." Our ruling Trump said, "In many places, like California, the same person votes many times. You probably heard about that. They always like to say 'oh that's a conspiracy theory.' Not a conspiracy theory, folks. Millions and millions of people. They don’t want to see it." While there have been some investigations into multiple voting allegations, including some convictions, they are rare. We found no evidence that the amount of double voting is anywhere close to millions. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-09128	Since 2000, "the Texas clean air program achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx emissions."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jun/16/rick-perry/perry-state-has-cut-ozone-22-nitrogen-oxide-emissi/	It's Gov. Rick Perry vs. Washington again, this time in a battle over Texas' compliance with the federal Clean Air Act. A day after the state filed suit to stop the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from taking over parts of the state program that issues permits for companies to foul the air, Perry touted afresh Texas' progress in reducing pollution levels. Since 2000, Perry said in a press release issued Tuesday, "the Texas clean air program (has) achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions." The same statistic was cited by Perry in a May 28 letter to President Barack Obama and mentioned in news accounts such as a New York Times article published online June 9. Sounds good, but what do the figures mean? And does the state deserve credit for improvements? First, let's look at the basic science. A goal of the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce the levels of what EPA calls "commonly found air pollutants." Among those is ground-level ozone, which forms when nitrogen oxide emissions mix with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight and heat. Common sources of nitrogen oxides: cars and trucks, power plants and industrial boilers. EPA sets limits on the concentration of ozonethe primary component of smog, in the air. Areas that fail to meet the standard are designated in "nonattainment." Under the Clean Air Act, the state is required to submit plans to EPA that outline how it will clean up areas and meet the federal standard. Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for the governor's office, said Perry's May letter to Obama focuses on ozone levels and nitrogen oxide emissions because "ozone is the only thing that we are in nonattainment for the state. And NOx is a precursor to ozone, so it makes sense to highlight that." Experts agreed with that reasoning. David Allen, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Texas, said: "Controlling NOx emissions is, in general, the most effective strategy for reducing ozone in Texas. So, the governor was right to focus on NOx." The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality provided us with data showing a 46 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxide from industrial sources such as chemical plants, refineries and electric utility plants between 2000 and 2006. Considering the drop through 2008, the decrease was even bigger: 53 percent. However, industrial sources account for only about a fourth of NOx emissions in Texas. Most come from road vehicles, ships and airplanes, as well as smaller sources such as gas stations and dry cleaners. Susana Hildebrand, TCEQ's chief engineer, told us Perry referenced industrial sources of pollution because that's mainly what the state regulates; the federal government regulates mobile sources. Considering all sources of nitrogen oxide emissions, the total fell 26 percent between 2002 and 2008. (The reduction since 2000 was not available.) As for ozone itself, establishing that statewide measure is complicated. There are about 70 regulatory ozone monitors in Texas, primarily in urban areas, almost all located on or east of the Interstate 35 corridor. The statewide measure is the three-year average of ozone levels from sites with some of the highest readings. TCEQ said it believes the sites were all in Houston or Dallas. The data show a 22 percent reduction in ozone between 2000 and 2008. In short, said UT's Allen, Perry's ozone figure is in line with what the agency and university researchers have found. "All of these measurements paint a consistent picture. Ozone concentrations are going down across the state," he said. Still, some parts of Texas have struggled to meet federal ozone standards. Three regions are currently designated in nonattainment under a limit set by EPA in 1997: Dallas-Forth Worth (nine counties), Houston (eight counties), and Beaumont-Port Arthur (four counties). According to TCEQ, the Beaumont area is being reclassified as in compliance and the Houston area met the standard for the first time in 2009. But a tightening of EPA standards, expected in August, will likely put several more areas, including the five-county Austin region, out of compliance. Next, to what degree were the reductions in ozone and NOx achieved by the state's "clean-air program"? Allen said that it's difficult to say "quantitatively" whether federal or state regulations were primarily responsible. Indeed, we found disagreement among experts on that front. Hildebrand, of TCEQ, said state efforts deserve full credit for the industrial NOx emission reductions, pointing to initiatives designed to bring regions into compliance with federal ozone standards. An example: the Mass Emissions Cap and Trade program, in place in Houston since 2001, which limits NOx emissions from large sources. But Neil Carman, clean air program director of the environmental group Sierra Club of Texas, said the federal government deserves the vast majority of the credit for reducing industrial NOx pollution because state actions have been driven by the Clean Air Act. And vehicle emissions, which are regulated by the feds and are a greater source of NOx pollution than industrial sources, have gone down as well -- 40 percent by TCEQ's measure between 2002 and 2008. Hildebrand acknowledged that has helped improve Texas' ozone picture. Al Armendariz of Dallas, administrator of EPA's multi-state Region 6, which includes Texas, credited all levels of government with hastening the ozone improvements, especially in Dallas and Houston. As examples, he pointed to enforcement actions taken against industry by the federal government that led to facilities' agreeing to major cuts in emissions, as well as state initiatives. The state touts incentive-driven programs such as its Emission Reduction Plan, which has spent more than $760 million since 2000 to help companies retrofit or replace more than 12,000 diesel vehicles with cleaner-burning ones. Despite the ozone improvements, a report released April 28 by the American Lung Association ranked the Houston area as the seventh-worst in the nation for ozone pollution and Dallas-Fort Worth 13th. (The worst six places for ozone were in California.) Of the 30 Texas counties graded by the lung association on their ozone pollution, 21 -- including Travis -- received F's. So how does Perry's statement hold up? The governor accurately cites recent improvements in the state's ozone levels. As for the NOx emissions contributing to ozone levels, his statistic refers to only one source -- industrial -- which he did not note. Nearly three-quarters comes from other sources. Whether the state gets the credit for those improvements is another issue. Even if TCEQ is responsible for the drop in industrial NOx emissions, federal efforts -- namely vehicle emission regulations -- also have helped lower ozone levels. Significantly, the state's ozone-related programs exist to help Texas comply with federal expectations. We rate Perry's statement as Half True.

The Lakewood Democrat put both elements together in his kickoff speechby talking about education. "Just last night, ladies and gentlemen," he said, "we passed a program to guarantee a college savings account for every single child who enters kindergarten in this county -- the first county in the United States to do so. The first one." PolitiFact Ohio was surprised by the statement, because we had looked previouslyat the College Savings Account Program. Advanced by FitzGeraldin November and approved by the County Council in April, the program will establish a $100 college-savings account for every new kindergarten student who lives in Cuyahoga County. We knew the program was similarto San Francisco's Kindergarten to College initiative -- and previous coverage indicated FitzGerald knew it. San Francisco's effort was developed with the Corporation for Enterprise Development, which said about a dozen other communities nationwide have set up savings account programs for children. We asked FitzGerald's campaign how he backed up the statement that Cuyahoga was "the first county in the United States to do so." They cited one of the Truth-O-Meter's guiding principles, that words matter. FitzGerald specifically said Cuyahoga County's program guarantees a college savings account "for every single child who enters kindergarten in this county." By "every single child," he meant that the program covers children entering kindergarten in public, private and parochial schools -- about 15,000 pupils a year. San Francisco's program, created in 2010, is similar but more restricted. It does not cover every child. The consolidated city-county program establishes a $50 savings account only for children entering kindergarten in public schools -- about 4,500 pupils a year. The Corporation for Enterprise Development, the Washington nonprofit that promotes saving and protecting assets and led the development of child savings programs, said no other program nationwide is on the scale established in Cuyahoga County. The county program is the nation's largest. FitzGerald said that the Cuyahoga County College Savings Account Program is the first county program in the nation "to guarantee a college savings account for every single child who enters kindergarten." The statement is accurate. Though additional information gives a fuller picture, it is not needed for accuracy, even in the context of a political speech. The statement was not misleading.

pomt-07022	A year since the "Recovery Summer," there has been been "a fall, winter and spring of no recovery."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/05/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-year-recovery-summer-theres-s/	Do you remember the Recovery Summer? Apparently, not many people do. It was a year ago, and President Barack Obama and the White House said that road-building and other construction projects in the second year of the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (later estimated to cost $830 billion) would pump extra octane into the nation’s economic engine. Yet the economy, though certainly out of recession, is still struggling, creating a sense of uncertainty that has made Americans slow to build or buy houses and businesses reluctant to expand or spend money. It’s been "a year since we announced the summer of recovery," U.S. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, told Neil Cavuto of Fox Business Network on June 16. "And you’re right, it has been a fall, winter and spring of no recovery." Portman made the same claim during a news conference with Republican colleagues that day, saying, "Unfortunately, it wasn’t the summer of recovery. In fact, it wasn’t a fall, winter or spring of recovery." The mood of the nation sure seems to suggest that at times. But moods and metrics that measure the economy are two different things. Portman has major budget chops, having served as President George W. Bush’s trade ambassador and budget director, but there’s little downside to his party in suggesting that the Democratic administration has bungled the recovery. Fortunately, these things are measurable, so we went gathering metrics. Portman’s office suggested a comparison with the White House’s own projections of where the economy would stand by now with passage of the 2009 recovery act. The national unemployment rate was supposed to be below 7 percent by now, according to an incoming administration projection in January 2009. Instead, it’s at 9.1 percent. Total non-farm employment was supposed to be above 137.5 million by now, the same report projected. Instead, it’s 131 million, lower than when Obama took office. By that standard, said Portman spokeswoman Christine Mangi, "this could be called a 6.5 million jobs deficit." Those early job projections have been through the mill already. Advisers to Obama made them before he even took office. Call them overly optimistic or off-base; either way, they were wrong. Mangi added a few other measures that we confirmed. The average duration of unemployment is now 39.7 weeks, a recordsince the government began keeping records in 1948. These are persuasive numbers. Yet Portman spoke specifically of a summer, fall, winter and spring "of no recovery." He wasn’t referring to joblessness since Obama entered office. He was citing specific seasons since last summer. There are benchmarks for these seasons, so we examined them. Unemployment The seasonally adjusted national unemployment rate was 9.5 in June 2010, when the White House promoted the Recovery Summer. Then its movement resembled that of a yo-yo -- up, down, and back up again (9.1 percent at last count). In other words, the unemployment rate showed a recovery in one of the seasons but the trend has reversed. It is better now than at the start of the Recovery Summer, though that’s prompting few cheers. Number of Jobs By the start of the Recovery Summer, non-farm employment was at 129.9 million, down nearly 3 million from when the recovery act passed. The number of people working dropped by another 108,000 by the end of last summer. But by last November -- the Recovery Fall, if you will -- employment rose to 130.1 million, and was at 130.5 million by February. By May 2011, it climbed to 131 million. Keep in mind that these were private sector job gains, made impressive by the fact that they occurred as local and state governments were actually shedding workers, says Josh Bivens, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, a think tank that focuses on economic conditions of low- and middle-income Americans. While governments at all levels in this country lost 596,000 jobs since the start of the Recovery Summer, the private sector added 1.7 million jobs, according to figures we checked in Bureau of Labor Statistics databases. These are steady seasons of gains -- a trend that actually began in October 2010, the month of the Recovery Halloween -- although they’re insufficient to bring the economy out of its doldrums. At a recent press briefing, White House spokesman Jay Carney contrasted these gains with an economy that was "in free-fall" when Obama took office. "There was a loss of jobs at a pace of 700,000 a month," Carney said. We checked his numbers, too. They were solid. You might wonder why the rise in employment didn’t bring the jobless numbers down. It’s because job growth was insufficient to keep pace with the natural growth of the working age population. Growth of the U.S. Economy The gross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure of the country’s output of goods and services, and economists say it is a key number to watch. GDP growth has been sluggish many quarters, but it nevertheless has been positive since the middle of 2009, when the recession ended. It grew by 2.6 percent in the third quarter of 2010, a period that included much of the Recovery Summer, and by 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Had growth continued at that rate, more job creation (and lower unemployment) might have followed. But economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2011 to a meager 1.9 percent. As we researched this matter, sources mentioned other measures, among them stock market growth (up, though with stops and starts), corporate profits and CEO pay (up) and home prices (down -- and hovering close to where they were in 2003). Consumer confidence is still flagging. Republicans on the congressional Joint Economic Committee, using the pun "Barack Obama’s Recovery Bummer," say that a combination of indicators show that economic conditions today areworse than in any recovery since at least World War II. But their figures leave out the fact that the recession that began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009 was deeper than the prior ones. The bigger the hole, the tougher it is to dig out. If you compare job growth since this recession ended with job growth at this stage after the 2001 recession (one that lasted only 8 months), it is stronger today, says Bivens. So where does all this data leave us? Well, there’s actually more but we’ll spare you. You should know, however, that when the White House announced the Recovery Summer, it set out a goal: By the end of 2010, the recovery act would have created or saved at least 3.5 million jobs since its start. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office as well as Obama’s White House Council of Economic Advisers issued subsequent reports suggesting the goal was met, although their estimates had very wide ranges. That made us wonder if there was a more precise way to define "recovery." We checked with the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private, nonprofit research center whose work is watched closely by the government and universities. It turns out the national bureau doesn’t use that word. So we finally called James Feyrer, a Dartmouth College economist who conducted research for the national bureau on the question, "Did the stimulus stimulate?" (His short answer: "Yes. I think in the aggregate it did create positive stimulus for the economy." The longer answer is that some parts -- support for low-income households and infrastructure spending -- worked while grants to states for education did not appear to create additional jobs.) Asked about the no-recovery claim, he said, "I think the problem with that is that ‘recovery’ is in the eye of the beholder." The nation is out of recession, he said, "but we certainly are not having a robust recovery. It seems like we’re somewhere in the gap between where rhetoric and reality fall." Assessing Portman’s claim comes down to how you view the recovery -- not since the start of Obama’s presidency but since the start of the Recovery Summer, because that’s specifically what Portman was talking about. There have been successive seasons of GDP growth, though not consistently strong. The White House met its own standard, however imprecise it may have been (the goal of "saving" jobs is hard to measure). Private-sector job growth struck Bivens as noteworthy, especially when compared with the 2001 recession. But unemployment is still a big problem. Economists talk of an anemic recovery, but a recovery, nonetheless. Portman, on the other hand, said that "it wasn’t the summer of recovery," nor was it "a fall, winter or spring of recovery." That’s how he sees it, and it’s understandable that anyone without a job could see it that way too. But too many metrics present a different impression, showing there has been a recovery -- a weak one. It’s not all sunshine and rainbows, but it hasn’t been season after season of gloom, either. Portman’s statement contains some element of truth, but it ignores facts that would give a different impression. The Truth-O-Meter has a precise definition for such a claim: Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10528	Says Clinton did not read the National Intelligence Estimate before voting for the Iraq war.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/03/barack-obama/when-a-briefing-isnt-as-good-as-a-book/	Trying to counter Sen. Hillary Clinton's questions about his foreign policy chops, Sen. Barack Obama accused the New York senator of bungling the biggest foreign policy vote of her career by authorizing the use of military force against Iraq in 2002 without first reading the National Intelligence Estimate – a forecast by the nation's intelligence services of potential developments that could affect national security. To underscore his point, Obama noted that former Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence at the time, voted against the resolution, citing dissents in the document, primarily from the State and Energy departments, to intelligence reports that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. "If you have a National Intelligence Estimate and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee says, 'You should read this, this is why I'm voting against the war,' you should read it," Obama said in a speech in Westerville, Ohio, on March 1. Obama didn't serve in the Senate when the chamber cleared the use-of-force resolution, 77-23, on Oct. 11, 2002, but spoke against the war while serving as an Illinois state senator. To evaluate the vote on the resolution, one has to consider the ambivalence and fears about war that filled Congress at the time. With the memory of the Sept. 11 terror attacks fresh in everyone's mind, many lawmakers worried that the failure to give Bush the power to act against Iraq would make the United States more vulnerable to further attacks. Others were concerned they would be labeled unpatriotic if they voted against a popular president in the weeks before a national election. Many who had questioned Bush's talk of war wound up joining in a broad coalition behind the president. As a presidential candidate, Clinton has repeatedly said she made a mistake voting for the resolution but also noted that reading the entire National Intelligence Estimate was not a necessity because she and other lawmakers were getting frequent briefings from high-level Bush administration officials. The book Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton , by New York Times reporters Jeff Gerth and Don van Natta Jr., first suggested she did not read the report. "I was fully briefed by the people who wrote that. I was briefed by the people from, you know, the State Department, the CIA, the Department of Defense; all of the various players in that," Clinton said in a Jan. 13, 2008, appearance on Meet the Press. "Some people read it and voted for the resolution, some people read it and voted against the resolution. I felt very well briefed." Clinton sidestepped host Tim Russert's question about whether she read it, but she did not challenge his assertion that she had not. Instead, she emphasized that she spoke with the authors of the report. The back-and-forth is casting new attention on the National Intelligence Estimate, versions of which have been prepared since 1946, at the beginning of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The documents are periodically requested by administration officials, military commanders or members of Congress and produced by the National Intelligence Council, which serves as the intelligence community's forecast center and reports directly to the director of National Intelligence. All of the nation's intelligence agencies have an opportunity to weigh in on the reports. Graham, in a 2005 op-ed piece in the Washington Post, said a careful reading of the National Intelligence Estimate revealed it didn't contain the rationale for a pre-emptive war in Iraq. Graham said he exercised the intelligence committee's prerogative during the run-up to the war and demanded that then-CIA Director George Tenet prepare a classified estimate in September 2002 after learning the White House had not requested one and that none was being prepared. The resulting 92-page document, in Graham's opinion, was slanted toward the conclusion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction at 550 sites, but contained what he called "vigorous dissents," especially about aluminum tubes that were offered as evidence that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear program. Clinton was far from the only member of Congress to rely on in-person briefings instead of actually reading the document. To read the report, members of Congress had to go to a secure location in the U.S. Capitol. The Washington Post reported in 2004 that no more than six senators and a handful of representatives had logged and read the report beyond a five-page executive summary. In the end, 29 out of 50 Democrats in the chamber voted in favor of the resolution, rejecting arguments by opponents led by Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia that it amounted to giving President Bush unlimited authority to wage war, akin to the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorizing military action during the Vietnam War. We find Obama's accusation is accurate because Clinton said she relied on in-person briefings from the administration. We find Obama's statement to be True.

pomt-09825	"Since World War II, only Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton have had worse ratings after seven months than President Obama."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/31/newt-gingrich/barack-obama-poll-after-seven-months-shows-him-beh/	The pundits and prognosticators are saying President Barack Obama is losing his mojo. And they have facts to back up their claim. "Since World War II, only Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton have had worse ratings after seven months than President Obama," said Republican Newt Gingrich, offering advice to Obama on the op-ed page of the Washington Post. Gingrich's comment was part of a roundup of advice solicited by the Post for the supposedly faltering president; Gingrich advised Obama to reject his left-leaning supporters and move to the center. Being but humble fact-checkers, we can't speak to the wisdom or folly of Gingrich's advice. But we certainly can check his factual statement about Obama's poll numbers, a claim we've seen repeated in other media. The Gallup poll actually has been tracking presidential approval ratings since World War II. We consulted Gallup's tracking polls and found that Gingrich is correct. At the seven-month mark, Obama's approval rating was 51 percent. The only two presidents doing worse than Obama were Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton. Interestingly, Ford and Clinton finished their presidencies with decidely different outcomes. Ford's public approval ratings dropped below 50 percent about three months into his presidency. Those numbers improved slightly and plateaued over the next few years. But Ford, who took office upon Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974, lost the 1976 election to Jimmy Carter. Clinton's approval ratings dropped below 50 percent four months into his presidency, falling even further during his first year in office to the high 30s. There were a few more ups and downs during his first term, but he won re-election in 1996 and finished his term in 2001 with approval ratings above 60 percent, despite being impeached by the House of Representatives after a sex scandal. Make of all this what you will. We've looked into Gingrich's statement and found that he is correct. We rate his statement True.

pomt-10238	In the U.S. Senate, Barack Obama "has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/02/joe-lieberman/we-found-a-few-things/	In a major speech to the Republican National Convention, Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut praised his friend John McCain and attacked the Democratic nominee Barack Obama. Lieberman was a Democrat who lost his primary race in 2006. He ran as an Independent Democrat in the general election and won his fourth senate term. Lieberman praised McCain on Sept. 2, 2008, at the convention in St. Paul, Minn., as an independent thinker who puts his country first. Obama, Lieberman said, is too inexperienced to be effective. "Sen. Obama is a gifted and eloquent young man who can do great things for our country in the years ahead," he said. "But eloquence is no substitute for a record — not in these tough times. In the Senate he has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done, nor has he been willing to take on powerful interest groups in the Democratic Party." Here we'll look at the statement that Obama has not reached across party lines to get anything significant done. But we've found several instances of legislation that Obama passed in concert with Republican lawmakers. • Obama collaborated with Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., in 2006 to pass a law (PL 109-282) creating a Google-like database of federal contracts and grants allowing users to type in key words that would bring up exactly how much money any particular recipient received. • With then-Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., Obama won enactment of a 2006 law (PL 109-401) that allowed the United States to export nuclear fuel, technology and reactors to India for the first time in three decades. The law accepted India as a nuclear-armed power and was enacted despite concerns about India's ties to Iran and past sanctions for transferring sensitive equipment to Iran. • He also worked with Lugar on a Senate bill that authorized the president to carry out a program to provide assistance to foreign countries to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Another part of the measure was intended to stop the spread of conventional weapons, notably shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles that the legislation refers to as man-portable air defense systems, or MANPADS. The bill's provisions were incorporated into a House bill that passed later that year and was signed into law in January 2007 (PL 109-472). These bills arguably meet the threshhold of significance, particularly the two measures with Lugar on important foreign policy issues. Since Obama is a Democrat, and Lugar and Coburn are Republicans, that seems to qualify as reaching across party lines. We find Lieberman's claim False.

pomt-14826	"I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering" as the World Trade Center collapsed.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/22/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-thousands-new-jersey-ch/	Arguing that there are terrorist sympathizers in the United States, Donald Trump says he saw "thousands" of New Jerseyans celebrating after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. "I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down," the Republican presidential candidate said at a Nov. 21 rally in Birmingham, Ala. "And I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering." The next day, ABC This Week host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he misspoke, noting that "the police say that didn't happen." Trump -- who has said he was in his Manhattan apartment the morning of the attack -- doubled down. "It was on television. I saw it," Trump said. "It was well covered at the time, George. Now, I know they don't like to talk about it, but it was well covered at the time. There were people over in New Jersey that were watching it, a heavy Arab population, that were cheering as the buildings came down. Not good." We looked back at the record to see what we could find about American Muslim celebrations in New Jersey on 9/11. While we found widely broadcast video of people in the Palestinian territories celebrating, we found no evidence to back up Trump’s description of events on American soil. Urban myth We conducted an exhaustive search of newspaper and television transcripts on LexisNexis, looking for reports from September 2001 through December 2001 that made any mention of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the 9/11 attacks. Regarding Jersey City, which Trump mentioned specifically, we found two uncorroborated and unsourced mentions. Neither begins to approach the scale Trump described. The Associated Press, on Sept. 17, 2001, described "rumors of rooftop celebrations of the attack by Muslims" in Jersey City. But the same report said those rumors were "unfounded." The Washington Post, on Sept. 18, 2001, published an article that claimed "law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river." The Post story includes no source for this information, and we found no evidence that any of these allegations ever stuck. A more rampant rumor of Muslim or Arab-Americans cheering the attacks centered around nearby Paterson, N.J. But that turned out to be just a rumor, spawned by chain emails and perpetuated by shock jock Howard Stern’s radio show. The Star-Ledger reported that as the rumors spread, "Paterson police rushed to South Main Street, the center of the city's Middle Eastern community." "When we got there, they were all in prayer," Paterson Police Chief Lawrence Spagnola said. Three percent of New Jersey residents are Muslim -- the highest of any state -- according to Pew Research Center. Suspected 9/11 terrorists had ties to Jersey City and Paterson. But there is no conclusive evidence that any New Jersey residents celebrated the attacks, and there is no evidence whatsoever of any demonstrations where "thousands and thousands of people" cheered. Nor is there any evidence Trump saw these events play out in any way, be it on TV or in person. We reached out to Trump’s campaign but didn’t hear back. What we did find are many stories of Muslims living in New Jersey speaking out against the attacks and bracing themselves for anti-Muslim backlash. For example, Paterson residents put up a banner on the city’s main street that said "The Muslim Community Does Not Support Terrorism.'' Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop responded to Trump’s statement on Twitter, saying Trump "has memory issues or willfully distorts the truth." Our ruling Trump said he "watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering" as the World Trade Center collapsed. This defies basic logic. If thousands and thousands of people were celebrating the 9/11 attacks on American soil, many people beyond Trump would remember it. And in the 21st century, there would be video or visual evidence. Instead, all we found were a couple of news articles that described rumors of celebrations that were either debunked or unproven. Trump’s recollection of events in New Jersey in the hours after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks flies in the face of all the evidence we could find. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-08657	DeWine "took $1.9 million from big banks," "supported legislation that helped Bernie Madoff make millions" and "protected predatory lenders while families lost their homes."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/14/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-partys-charge-dewine-was-wall-stre/	The Democratic political playbook has a new page that is getting flipped to the most in 2010—running against Wall Street. Whenever possible this year Democratic candidates are linking their Republican opponents to one of the primary bogeymen for the country’s economic recession. The Ohio Democratic Party uses this tactic in a web ad focused on former U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, the Republican candidate for Ohio attorney general, even going so far as to call him a "lap dog" for Wall Street. The ODP attack rolls everything bad about Wall Street into one big ball evoking big banks, Wall Street villain and convicted swindler Bernie Madoff and predatory lenders. The video says that while in Congress, DeWine "took $1.9 million from big banks. DeWine supported legislation that helped Bernie Madoff make millions. He protected predatory lenders while families lost their homes." PolitiFact Ohio decided to dig into these claims that paint DeWine as a pawn of the Wall Street elite. The most straightforward one is that DeWine took $1.9 million from "big banks." ODP officials say it’s easy to get $1.9 million. Just add up DeWine’s career fundraising totals on Open secrets.org — the handy federal fundraising tracker from the independent Center for Responsive Politics — as well as more than $62,000 raised in the current AG’s race. While the math checks out, you can get to the $1.9 million figure only by adding in money not only from commercial banks ($595,677) but also securities and investment firms ($726,375), miscellaneous financial institutions ($348,548) as well as finance and credit card companies ($237,750). The "big bank" claim need a pretty big tent to fit all of the qualifying financial institutions in its shade. Meanwhile, the ODP claim that DeWine "helped Madoff make millions" can be traced to three "yes" votes the Republican cast in 1995 for a bill known as the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. DeWine joined 48 Republicans and 20 Democrats in the Senate. The legislation raised the burden of proof lawyers in private practice would have to show in cases of corporate fraud. That means that DeWine’s vote was "helping Madoff make millions" because it handcuffed private attorneys from pursuing claims as concerns surfaced "as early as 1999" that Madoff was operating a Ponzi scheme, the ODP argues in an e-mail. Even if that’s true — and it’s certainly open to debate — the timing of the concerns about Madoff’s operation don’t square with the timeline as presented by the Ohio Democratic Party. In a 477-page report issued in 2009, SEC Inspector General David Kotz found that substantive complaints against Madoff were filed as far back as 1992 — three years before DeWine voted to overhaul the law. That reports states that a total of "three examinations and two investigations" were conducted by SEC officials but that "a thorough and competent investigation or examination was never performed." Most incredibly, SEC officials even failed to take the most basic of steps to check up on Madoff. "At no time did the SEC ever verify Madoff’s trading through an independent third-party, and in fact, never actually conducted a Ponzi scheme examination or investigation of Madoff," states Kotz’s report. Madoff himself called it "astonishing" that the check wasn’t done. "They never even looked at my stock records," he told Kotz for his report, according to a December 2009 story in the New York Daily News. "It would have been easy for them to see. If you’re looking at a Ponzi scheme, it’s the first thing you do." Clearly, the overriding reason that Madoff went undetected for so long is because the federal officials supposed to watch over him dropped the ball again and again. Is it possible that a private attorney could have brought forward an investigation that brought Madoff to justice if the law hadn’t been changed in 1995? Yes, it is possible, but it’s far from a sure thing, especially considering that the old law was in place for three years after initial concerns surfaced about Madoff. Besides, the law change doesn’t seem to quite equal "helping make Madoff money," even if you conclude he would have been caught earlier if the old law had been in place. Lastly, the ODP accuses DeWine of helping "to protect predatory lenders while families lost their homes." That charge references a pair of 2001 tabling votes that DeWine made during the debate over the Bankruptcy Reform Act, which never became law because the differences between the House and Senate versions were never reconciled. At that time, DeWine, 48 other Republicans and 15 Democrats blocked an amendment requiring that credit card companies disclose more information to consumers and giving stiffer penalties for predatory lenders. The other amendment that DeWine tried unsuccessfully to table prevented predatory lenders who violated the Truth in Lending Act from filing for bankruptcy to dodge claims. Those votes were at a time when the Ohio Democratic Party says "families lost their homes" in a reference to the foreclosure crisis that has walloped the state, including a record-high 89,053 foreclosure cases in 2009. However, Ohio Supreme Court statistics on foreclosures show only 43,419 in 2001. So while certainly some families were among those who lost their homes in 2001, the foreclosure numbers were about half the record-breaking foreclosure numbers that have hit the state in recent years with upwards of 80,000 a year since 2007. By then, DeWine wasn’t even a senator. Add it up, and the scorecard for the Ohio Democratic Party is far from spotless. The $1.9 million figure isn’t wholly accurate because it lumps in a broad range of financial service companies into "big banks." The Bernie Madoff charge lays the blame for his long-term swindling on a law change, rather than on the on bumbling investigators where it properly belongs. And the protecting predatory lending charge implies that DeWine’s votes came recently during the worst of Ohio’s foreclosure crisis when they really were made more than nine years ago. We rate the Ohio Democratic Party’s claims as Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Ohio Democratic Party	None	None	None	2010-09-14T10:10:00	2010-08-23	['Bernard_Madoff']

pomt-08629	After Hurricane Katrina, "Dallas and San Antonio took in 5,000 to 10,000 refugees each, but (Bill) White brought in 250,000 and put them up in his 'buddies' empty apartment buildings and let the federal government pay their rents for over two years. They did not return to New Orleans, most of them are on welfare."	false	/texas/statements/2010/sep/19/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-bill-white-let-federal-governm/	Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White received national praise for welcoming Hurricane Katrina evacuees to Houston as the city's mayor, after the violent storm displaced hundreds of thousands of New Orleans residents in 2005. But a chain e-mail a reader forwarded us on July 25 and that we also saw posted on Internet message boards casts White's response to the disaster as a negative. "In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina a few years ago, Dallas and San Antonio took in 5-10 thousand refugees each, but White brought in 250,000 and put them up in his 'buddies' empty apartment buildings and let the federal government pay their rents for over two years," the e-mail states. "They did not return to New Orleans, most of them are on welfare." Anonymous chain e-mails are notorious for missing facts. For instance, the e-mail we're reviewing also says "White turned Houston into the biggest sanctuary city east of Los Angeles by refusing to let the Houston Police or ICE ask a criminal or even a suspect if they were in this country legally." In March, we rated False a claim that as mayor, White offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants. So we wondered about White's record following the Katrina hegira. Let's start with how many evacuees that each city mentioned in the chain e-mail took in. Dallas: Frank Librio, a city spokesman, told us the Dallas-Fort Worth area took in about 20,000 refugees, while the city alone absorbed approximately 3,000. That number doesn't include those who stayed with families or in hotels on their own, said Librio, who estimated several thousand more took refuge in Dallas. San Antonio: James Mendoza, assistant emergency management coordinator for San Antonio's Office of Emergency Management, told us via a spokeswoman that an estimated 25,000 to 35,000 evacuees stayed there. Houston: The City of Houston didn't respond to our queries, but news reports from the months following the hurricane say that between 100,000 and 150,000 evacuees took shelter in Houston. A September 2006 report by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security states that "over 400,000 Hurricane Katrina evacuees initially sought refuge in Texas and up to 150,000 arrived in the Houston area seeking food, shelter and medical care." In August 2006, NPR reported that more than 111,000 evacuees from New Orleans were still in Houston, with 250,000 living in all of Texas. Upshot: The chain e-mail is about 100,000 off in its estimate of how many evacuees White welcomed to Houston, and at least 15,000 off in its San Antonio estimate. It's in the ballpark for how many evacuees stayed in the city of Dallas. Next, we looked at whether White funneled evacuees to his "buddies'" empty apartment buildings while the government paid the rent. According to a December 2005 Houston Chronicle article, "White worked out an unprecedented plan in concert with FEMA officials: Any family affected by the storm could receive a voucher from the city good for 12 months of rent and utilities at decent but not extravagant apartments that participated in the program. The city paid the landlords directly, and then received reimbursement from FEMA." Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White's campaign, told us via e-mail that White "called on local hotel owners and apartment complex owners for their assistance in housing the hundreds of thousands of evacuees." Jeff Hall, executive vice president of the Houston Apartment Association, told us that in response to White's administration, 250 association members — apartment owners and managers — attended an emergency meeting at Houston's city hall on Sept. 6, 2005, eight days after the storm made landfall, that resulted in 201 owners and companies signing letters of intent to set aside more than 10,000 rental units for evacuees. "In the end, more than 37,000 units were rented," he said. Hall said that apartment buildings were not vacant, as the chain e-mail says. Nor was the emergency housing program a windfall for apartment owners, he said. "Many were paid rents below market value," he said. "In many cases, payments for rent were delayed for months, causing financial concerns for owners." Hall said the effort was originally funded through the city, then through FEMA, and then by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through local housing authorities. "Though some evacuees have returned to their pre-hurricane hometowns, many continue to reside in Houston," Hall said. Michael Gerber, executive director of the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, told us his department worked closely with the city, White, Harris County Judge Robert Eckels and the apartment association, among others, to "identify vacant units" for evacuees so that families wouldn't be stuck in the AstroDome. Gerber said it was "all hands on deck." He said he didn't witness any impropriety involving White. Donald Sampley, who served as White's assistant director of Housing and Community Development starting in 2006, said White never interfered with the local housing authorities. He "never directed me, or to my knowledge, my boss, about who would receive money and who wouldn't receive money," Sampley said. As for whether White "let" the federal government pay rent on evacuees' apartments, FEMA spokesman Earl Armstrong told us that city mayors had no say in whether or not hurricane evacuees could receive federal aid. Donna White, a HUD spokesman, told us that 5,300 families received help paying their rent through a disaster assistance program that picked up where FEMA aid left off in November 2007. The program ended in October 2009. Nationally, 37,000 families were enrolled in the disaster housing program, and 12,000 eventually transitioned into HUD's non-emergeny housing assistance program. What about the chain e-mail's lament that Katrina evacuees never returned to New Orleans and that "most of them are on welfare?" According to a 2006 study by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, 111,111 evacuees were still living in Houston as of May 2006 and 251,000 were still living in Texas. The study found that most families displaced to Texas didn't have firm plans to leave — 40 percent of all evacuees believed they'd still be in Texas two years later (in 2008), while 22 percent didn't know where they'd be. Some 35 percent of evacuees living in Houston thought they'd still be there in two years, and 21 percent didn't know where they'd be. Finally, we tried to weigh what the chain e-mail means by "welfare," a that term hasn't had a clear-cut definition since Congress overhauled the benefits offered to low-income Americans in the 1990s. Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman a HHSC, told us that the state doesn't use that term. Anne Dunkelberg, associate director at the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities (CPPP), told us the center assumes people are talking about Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which provides cash to families in dire need. According to the HHSC's 2006 study, 5 percent of Hurricane Katrina evacuees were receiving TANF benefits. As of the end of July 2010, 111,920 Texans, including 7,929 Harris County residents, were receiving TANF benefits — $167 per month on average — according to HHSC. More than three million Texans receive food stamps and Medicaid, which some people see as a form of welfare, according to Celia Hagert, a policy analyst at CPPP. According to the HHSC's 2006 study of Katrina evacuees, 33 percent of all respondents said someone in their family received Medicaid and 11 percent said someone in their family received health care through the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In Houston, those numbers were 32 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Also in Houston, 36 percent of evacuees received food stamps. Bottom line? The chain e-mail's count of evacuees who settled in Dallas is about right, but it understates the evacuees who landed in San Antonio and overstates by 100,000, or 67 percent, the evacuees who took up residence in Houston. It's true that evacuees could get assistance to pay for housing for more than two years, as the e-mail says, but the 2006 state study found that more than half of surveyed evacuees did not expect to stay in Texas — meaning, it seems to us, that an undetermined share might have planned to return to New Orleans, contrary to the chain e-mail's claim that no one has returned. We are hampered here by a lack of research. The state study also found that the share of evacuees who said they were benefiting from cash assistance, what we're assuming the chain e-mail scribe means by welfare, was only 5 percent. Significantly, we found no evidence to support the e-mail's claim that White put up evacuees in apartments owned by his pals. So some details of the e-mail are right, but its most explosive — and damaging — claims aren't backed up by facts. We rate the e-mail False. This story was updated to correct the number of Texans receiving TANF benefits to 111,920, including 7,929 Harris County residents.

pomt-15308	"The actual deportations from the interior of the country are way down" under President Obama.	true	/virginia/statements/2015/jul/20/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-says-deportations-us-interior-have-falle/	Rep. Bob Goodlatte scoffs at any suggestion that President Barack Obama has been tough on immigration. Amid news that a 32-year-old woman was allegedly murdered by a felon who had been deported repeatedly, Goodlatte said Obama has been soft on enforcing the country’s immigration laws. "The actual deportations from the interior of the country are way down (under Obama)," Goodlatte, R-6th, said in an interview on ABC News. Are deportations from the interior "way down" under Obama? We asked Goodlatte, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, for the source of his statement. We heard back from Jessica Collins, the deputy communication director for the House Judiciary Committee. She pointed us to a 2014 memo that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent to the committee in response to questions about the federal agency’s figures on undocumented immigrants expelled from the U.S. The agency’s figures show that in 2008, the year before Obama took office, there were 244,091 removals of illegal immigrants from the interior of the U.S., which the agency defines as anywhere away from the "immediate border" where an immigrant is barred from trying to enter the country illegally. In 2009, there were 237,941 interior removals in the first year of Obama’s term. That dropped to 133,551 by year 2013. Those figures represent a broad group of deportations which include two main categories. One is "removals," where someone is ordered out of the country by a formal court order and prohibited from coming back for a period of time. The other category is "returns," where an immigrant voluntarily leaves the U.S., often in the absence of a formal order. That situation typically doesn’t carry harsh penalties if they return to the country. The immigration agency further broke down its figures for the House panel, excluding simple returns and focusing on formal removals. In 2008, there were 171,540 of those removals from the interior. That rose to 175,702 in Obama’s first year in office in 2009 before falling to 110,781 in 2013. In 2014, ICE said it conducted 102,224 removals. It’s not immediately clear from ICE’s latest report whether that 2014 figure includes only formal removals mandated by an order, or whether it includes removals and returns. But either way you look at the figures, interior deportations have fallen between 40 and 60 percent during Obama’s term. Four immigration policy analysts we talked to agreed that interior deportations dropped off under Obama. Marc Rosenblum, the deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, said those deportations really dropped off in recent years as a result of the Obama shifting enforcement away from immigrants who didn’t fall into certain groups flagged for high priority for deportation. The White House is focused on people apprehended at the border and on other priority targets such as immigrants charged with a various crimes or deemed to be a threat to public safety, Rosenblum said. "While they’ve been scaling back interior removals, they’ve been increasing border removals," Rosenblum told us. A July report by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank founded by a group of Democratic and Republican senators, illustrated that switch. In 2008, about two-thirds of ICE’s 369,000 removals were from the interior, while the other third were from the border. That proportion started to change a couple of years ago and by 2014, about one-third of the agency’s 316,000 removals were from the interior while the other two-thirds were from the border. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote in a January blog post, that while interior removals have fallen in recent years under Obama, they remain high compared to former President George W. Bush. Looking at the last six years of the former president’s tenure, Nowrasteh said there were an average of 79,000 removed from the interior annually under Bush, compared with an average of 158,000 during the first six years of Obama’s term. But one problem in comparing the two administrations, Nowrasteh noted, is that there were a chunk of cases each year under Bush in which it was unclear from where in the U.S. an immigrant had been deported. Our ruling Goodlatte said deportations are "way down" under Obama.

pomt-06766	On abortion.	full flop	/texas/statements/2011/aug/21/susan-combs/did-comptroller-susan-combs-flip-flop-abortion/	Three years before the next Texas lieutenant governor’s election, one possible Republican candidate, Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, accused another, Comptroller Susan Combs, of changing her position on abortion. In an Aug. 2 letter to Combs seeking clarification of her stance, Staples says recent comments by Combs’ spokesman run "completely contrary" to her "known pro-choice position." Recent comments? Cody McGregor, campaign manager for Staples, pointed us to a July 5 column in the Houston Chronicle that quotes Combs’ political consultant Reggie Bashur as saying that Combs "wants Roe v. Wade overturned" and is against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when a woman’s life is in jeopardy. Has Combs flip-flopped on abortion? Some background: Combs, Staples and others who may vie for lieutenant governor in 2014 are drawing attention now because the incumbent, David Dewhurst, recently joined the 2012 field of candidates for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison. That means Dewhurst hopes he won’t be seeking another term as lieutenant governor two years later. Staples has said that he will compete for the post overseeing the Texas Senate as long as Dewhurst doesn’t. And Combs is considering jumping in, according to Bashur. Combs, in her second term as comptroller, previously served as state agriculture commissioner and in the Texas House, where she represented an Austin-area district. We first looked into Combs’ past position on abortion. In his letter, Staples says Combs’ "pro-choice position is well documented" through "quoted comments in several news reports." Reporter Peggy Fikac’s July 5 Chronicle column cites two earlier news articles. The first is a May 1995 Austin American-Statesman story in which Combs, then a House member, discussed her belief that government had grown too large and powerful. "We are so casual about government intrusion in our lives," Combs is quoted as saying. "I'm pro-choice for the same reason.'' The second news article cited in the Chronicle column was an Associated Press story from November 2003, when Combs was agriculture commissioner. "Combs supports a woman's right to choose, with exceptions," the story says. "She opposes ‘partial-birth’ abortions and third-trimester abortions and favors parental notification for minors seeking abortions." In an interview, Brooke Botello, communications director for the comptroller's office, told us that the AP story accurately covered Combs' earlier position on abortion. Botello also told us that Combs' position had not shifted significantly during her years as a House member and agriculture commissioner. Staples’ campaign also sent us a February 2011 Texas Tribune story that kicks off by asking whether it’s possible for a pro-choice candidate to win a "high-profile" statewide Republican primary in Texas. "Susan Combs might try," it says. The article describes Combs’ position as "anti-abortion but pro-choice" and says that Combs "has said Roe v. Wade should stand." That Supreme Court ruling, issued Jan. 22, 1973, struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before viability, the time at which a fetus can survive outside a woman's body. It noted that viability "is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks)" of pregnancy "but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks." After fetal viability, the court said, states could limit abortions provided that their policies met certain requirements, including an exception to protect the life of the woman. Since then, other Supreme Court rulings have affirmed states' rights to impose further restrictions. The first sign we found of a possible shift by Combs was in a May 22 Houston Chronicle article on the 2011 regular legislative session. It reported that at Combs’ request, state Rep. Jim Landtroop, R-Plainview, added an amendment to a budget-related bill that would have prohibited businesses from claiming money spent on elective abortions through its employee health plans as an exemption from the state’s franchise tax. When calculating how much they owe under the tax, qualifying companies are permitted to deduct from total revenue certain costs, including health care benefits. The article quotes Rep. John Otto, R-Dayton, as saying that Combs sought the change "to remove what she would consider public subsidies of insurance policies covering abortions. ... In her view, that is subsidizing abortion because that is public money." Botello confirmed that Combs had asked Landtroop to propose the amendment. The overall proposal died, though, and the Combs-backed amendment did not become law. About six weeks later, in July, Bashur’s statement that Combs is now against most abortions appeared in the Chronicle column. On Aug. 2, Staples shared his letter to Combs with news organizations, and the next day, Combs was interviewed by the Tribune, which reported that she had "switched her position on abortion rights, from pro-choice to pro-life." In the interview, Tribune reporter Ross Ramsey says: "Let’s talk about choice. I understand that your position on this has changed." Combs replies: "Uh huh." She continues: "Twenty years ago, I was pro-choice … because I had concerns about the role of government." She then says that she changed her mind after "looking at studies and data and reading books" and concluding that abortion is being used as "birth control." "It is stunning to me that we are at the point in this country where in 2011, you have incredibly high numbers of women choosing to abort rather than have a baby or to have avoided the problem in the first place," she told the Tribune. "So I am unequivocal about it. I was wrong, and it's 20 years later, and I feel very strongly about it." Combs’ newly articulated position — in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade and against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when a woman’s life is threatened — mirrors Staples’. And Austin consultant Wayne Hamilton, a former executive director of the Republican Party of Texas, told us that Texas candidates have generally been considered pro-life if they oppose abortion except in those three cases, though some candidates rule out exceptions. So, how does Combs’ acknowledged shift rate on the Flip-O-Meter? Previously, Combs was in favor of allowing abortions in most cases, excluding those in the final trimester of pregnancy. Now, she opposes abortion in most cases, with the exception of those involving rape, incest or when a woman’s life is threatened. Full Flop.

pomt-14384	"Republicans control the U.S. Senate with 54 seats, but those 54 senators were elected by only two-thirds the number of voters who elected the Democrats. In the Senate, the majority party represents a minority of the people."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2016/mar/17/roy-zimmerman/singer-roy-zimmermans-measure-public-support-senat/	Progressive activist-songwriter Roy Zimmerman took a musical jab at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell amid the debate over whether Senate Republicans should consider President Barack Obama's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. The issue is McConnell's position, coming about an hour after Justice Antonin Scalia’s death had been confirmed, that the vacancy should not be filled until the election of a new president. Zimmerman, best known for singing about obsessive liberals and the hypnotic arguments of Republicans, contends in the song "65 Million" that far more people voted for the Democrats in the Senate than voted for Republicans. "Republicans control the U.S. Senate with 54 seats, but those 54 senators were elected by only two-thirds the number of voters who elected the Democrats,' he says between verses. 'In the Senate, the majority party represents a minority of the people." We wondered if Zimmerman's two points were in tune with the facts, specifically whether his numbers were correct and whether Republican senators represent a minority of the people. When we emailed his website, his wife and co-writer, Melanie Harby, immediately sent along the most recent vote totals for all the senators culled from Wikipedia. The two-thirds ratio First, we checked the Wikipedia totals against the elections database Ballotpedia.org. The Wikipedia vote tallies were different in nearly one-third of the races — in one contest the discrepancy was 71,936 votes. So we turned to a third source, the post-election reports of the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Using the federal numbers as the standard, Wikipedia reported different vote totals in 31 of 100 races. Ballotpedia had discrepancies in nine of 100 races. When we used the official numbers to determine the ratio, it wasn't exactly two-thirds, but it was very close to what Zimmerman said. Congress' 54 GOP senators were elected with 47,068,532 votes. The rest of the senators collectively received 67,933,645. That means Republicans got just 69 percent of the votes garnered by all of the other senators, or just over the two-thirds that Zimmerman talked about. However, two of the non-Republicans are independents. Because they caucus with the Democrats, Harby said, it's fair to include them. That's debatable. Nonetheless, if you exclude them, the Democrats accumulated 67,355,217 votes. Put another way, Republicans earned 70 percent of the votes earned by Democrats. (The percentage only increases slightly because the independents come from states with relatively small populations — Maine and Vermont.) Why would a majority of the senators be elected by a minority of the United States population? The founding fathers allowed for that when they decided that every state — with populations large and small — would only elect two senators. So there's nothing extraordinary about having a group of senators (in this case, the Democrats) who are in the minority even though they were elected by the most votes because they won seats in large states such as California and New York. Voters vs. 'the people' But Zimmerman strikes a sour note in the second half of his statement where he says, "In the Senate, the majority party represents a minority of the people." There are several reasons this is off-key. First, the Democratic victors may have garnered 20 million more votes than the Republicans who won, but that doesn't represent 20 million more voters. Remember, every voter gets to pick two senators for their state. In this case, one vote doesn't equal one voter. Second, the numbers can be skewed by the size of the population in each state. A Democrat who wins 51 percent of the vote in California (population: 39 million) can rack up a disproportionate number of votes compared to a Republican from Wyoming (population: under 600,000) who wins 95 percent of the vote. Third, the typical winning candidates in the 2012 Senate election probably got a lot more votes than the winning candidates running in 2010 or 2014 because 2012 was a presidential election year, when turnout is significantly higher. Only 58.2 percent of eligible voters voted in the 2012 presidential contest, 41 percent in 2010 and 35.9 percent in 2014. Historically, a higher turnout tends to favor the Democrats. Finally, it's problematic to suggest, as Zimmerman does, that the person who won the majority of the votes represents the majority of the people. Some candidates win with less than half the vote, which can happen in races with more that two candidates. Candidates in uncontested races may lose out because many voters don't bother to vote in those races. Candidates who get more than half the vote may not represent the majority of the people. As we alluded to above, even in the best years, more than one-third of the people eligible to vote don't go to the polls. The nation hasn't seen a turnout higher than 66.7 percent since the 1900 presidential election. The national turnout for a midterm election hasn't been above 50 percent since 1914, according to the United States Election Project. In the 2014 midterm election, it was just 36 percent. Our ruling Zimmerman said, "Republicans control the U.S. Senate with 54 seats, but those 54 senators were elected by only two-thirds the number of voters who elected the Democrats. In the Senate, the majority party represents a minority of the people." He's very close on the numbers, but he adds a sour note when he tries to equate the vote totals for the current members of the Senate to the general population. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-05066	States still face a "mandate" to expand Medicaid coverage under President Obama's health care reform law.	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2012/jul/06/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-supreme-court-ruling-health-car/	Gov. Bob McDonnell joined the list of disappointed Republican leaders who took to airwaves in the hours after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld most of President Obama’s health care law. McDonnell, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said the court’s ruling does not mean the law is good policy. Then he ripped at a provision that will greatly widen the Medicaid program for low-income and disabled people. McDonnell said the expansion will strain state budgets. "I tell you what it means for Virginia -- $2.2 billion of an unfunded mandate in Medicaid expansion over the next decade," McDonnell said in an interview on MSNBC on June 28, the day the Supreme Court issued its ruling. McDonnell repeated his statement on June 29 -- the day after the court decision -- during a CNN interview with Soledad O’Brien. He said as a result of the ruling, a "$2.2 billion unfunded mandate falls on Virginia." "Medicaid is growing incredibly fast as a part of the budget. Now this is $2.2 billion on Virginia," the governor said. Late in the afternoon of June 29, McDonnell appeared on Fox News and referred to the health care law as "a cumbersome, unfunded mandate that will cost my state $2.2 billion in the next 10 years by this incredible expansion of Medicaid that has already busted the budget." McDonnell’s mandate claims are striking because, even at the time of his first utterance, it was being widely reported that the court ruling overturned a provision in the law that required states to expand Medicaid. We initially thought the governor misspoke. But when McDonnell twice repeated his statement on national television the next day, we decided to examine his claim that the health care law still subjects states to a Medicaid mandate. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, upheld the major provision of the health care law that will require most people to buy medical insurance or pay a tax penalty. The law also calls for expanding Medicaid by covering adults and families with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, starting in 2014. The court struck down a provision that allowed the federal government to revoke its matching Medicaid funds to a state that refused to take part in the expansion. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote on page 58 of the ruling: "As for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening existing Medicaid funding. Congress has no authority to order the states to regulate according to its instructions. Congress may offer the states grants and require the states to comply with accompanying conditions, but the states must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer." Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, in a written statement released several hours after the Supreme Court decision, concluded that the Medicaid mandate had been voided. He called it a "silver lining" in a disappointing ruling. "The court blocked the federal government from withholding Medicaid dollars that states receive under the current Medicaid program if those states do not want to participate in the new and costly program expansions mandated under the health care law," Cuccinelli wrote. "This alone could save the commonwealth about $200 million a year..." Timothy S. Jost, a law professor at Washington & Lee University, had a similar take during an interview the day after the high court ruling. "The Supreme Court expressly said if Virginia doesn’t want to participate in the Medicaid expansion, it does not have to," Jost told us. We asked the governor’s office how McDonnell justified his claim that the ruling means a $2.2 billion mandate for Virginia. Jeff Caldwell, a McDonnell spokesman, cited a 2010 report by the Virginia House Appropriations Committee staff estimating it would cost the state between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion to cover Medicaid expansion through fiscal 2022. "As you know, the Supreme Court’s ruling places some uncertainty in this issue by removing the mandate" for Medicaid, Caldwell said in an email. In other words, the administration is acknowledging that -- contrary to McDonnell’s statements -- the Medicaid mandate is void. One final note: The federal government will pay for the vast bulk of the expansion costs for states, covering 100 percent of the tab from the 2014 through 2016 fiscal years. Starting in 2017, the federal share gradually goes down to 90 percent by the 2021 fiscal year. That’s still a better deal than the 50 percent federal Medicaid match now offered to Virginia. Our ruling After the Supreme Court’s ruling on the health care act, McDonnell repeatedly said states still face a "mandate" to take part in Medicaid expansion provisions in the law. Actually, the court’s ruling had the opposite effect. It took away Washington’s ability to punish states that don’t take part in the expansion by eliminating their federal Medicaid subsidies. The court ruled states must have "a genuine choice" whether to take part in the expansion. It is perplexing that McDonnell -- a lawyer for 23 years who served as Virginia’s attorney general and now commands a knowledgeable gubernatorial staff -- would repeatedly misrepresent a major part of a landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. Thirty hours after the ruling, McDonnell maintained on national TV that the Medicaid mandate was intact. We rate McDonnell’s statements Pants on Fire.

pomt-13361	"Since I came into office … we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/30/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-va-budget-has-risen-85-percent-h/	During a CNN town hall on Sept. 28, 2016, President Barack Obama took an emotional question from Donna Coates, the widow of Army veteran Barry Coates, who died of cancer after being misdiagnosed at a VA hospital. "My mama's always told me that if you stop talking about stuff and do it, then you don't have to talk about it any longer," Coates said. "So when are we going to actually start holding these contracted doctors and the VA employees accountable?" Obama expressed his sympathies and said, "I don't want to in any way pretend that we're where we need to be." Still, he said, progress has been made in such areas as replacing outdated patient-intake systems. "We now have a situation where about 80 percent of individuals who interact with the VA are satisfied that they're getting timely treatment," he said. "I want that to be 100 percent. And that requires more work." Obama went on to say that "since I came into office, just to give you some sense of perspective, we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent." Even over an eight-year presidential tenure, that sounded like a pretty big increase to us. So we decided to see if it was accurate. Mandatory vs. discretionary spending We turned to VA budget data to see how large the increases have been. This chart summarizes what we found: This chart shows that VA spending has certainly increased since 2008. But we've broken it down into two colors because it’s important to distinguish between two types of funding. The blue portion, known as discretionary spending, is funding that needs to be passed by Congress and signed by the president every year. The red portion, known as mandatory spending, includes funds allocated based on eligibility rules established long before the year when they’re allocated. Examples of mandatory funds include payouts for disability claims, burials, pensions and education. The White House confirmed that the 85 percent increase refers to the entire VA budget, including mandatory and discretionary spending. They said that the Obama administration did have an impact on the mandatory spending figure by enacting increased access to benefits, including expanding eligibility for benefits related to Agent Orange exposure. Still, a large reason for the growth in mandatory spending is that the United States has been engaged in fighting wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, thus creating more and more veterans who qualify for mandatory benefits. So, to a great extent, mandatory spending is on autopilot when a president takes office, meaning that it’s not obvious that Obama can take significant credit for increasing the mandatory portion of the spending bump on his watch. The size of the increases It’s also worth noting that when Obama uses the 85 percent growth figure, he’s choosing the largest of several figures he could have used. There are so many choices because comparing budget growth in the way Obama did is more complicated than it seems at first glance. For starters, fiscal years -- the October-to-October time frames that are typically used in federal budgeting -- do not line up neatly with presidential terms, which always begin on January 20. So one could make an argument that the best base year to use in Obama’s comparison could be either fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2009. And the end years are tricky, too. The most recent year for which final, solid dollar figures are available is 2015. For 2016, we only have projections. We ran the numbers for each of the four possible time spans and found that the increase in overall spending ranged from 67 percent at the low end to 86 percent on the high end. So Obama’s 85 percent figure is cherry-picked, although even the worst calculation for Obama shows a 67 percent increase, which is still pretty substantial. Remember, however, that the president has the most influence -- along with Congress, with whom Obama had to agree -- on the discretionary portion of the VA budget. And the increases in discretionary spending were smaller. For discretionary spending only, the same four possible calculations produce anything from a 36 percent increase to a 61 percent increase. That's a less impressive sounding claim -- at the low end, it’s an increase of roughly 4 percent a year, rather than 10 percent a year, as Obama’s original statement would suggest. That said, Stan Collender, a budget specialist and executive vice president of the firm Qorvis MSLGROUP, cautioned that even an increase of 4 percent a year "is nothing to sneeze at these days in federal budget land. I doubt many other parts of the discretionary budget had increases of that size, or at all." Our ruling Obama said, "Since I came into office … we have increased the VA budget by 85 percent." Obama has a point that the VA has seen significant percentage increases during his tenure, particularly for a period of budgetary belt-tightening elsewhere. However, it’s a stretch for him to take credit for that, since so much of the increase stemmed from mandatory spending that originated with a continuing stream of veterans returning home and qualifying for benefits. Obama has also cherry-picked the highest numerical figure he could have. His statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/31e464bc-18c7-4796-aadf-5c9cb65de6c7	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2016-09-30T10:00:00	2016-09-28	['None']

pomt-09063	It was President Obama's "inaction that caused over three weeks to go by before he even approved the governor's plan to protect our marsh."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/29/steve-scalise/scalise-blames-obama-inaction-berm-plan-contain-oi/	Many Republicans say President Barack Obama has moved too slowly in response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., criticized the president's Oval Office speech and cited slow action in building sand barriers to absorb the oil. "Tonight the president actually said that he won't tolerate inaction," Scalise said on Sean Hannity's show on Fox News shortly after the speech on June 15, 2010. "Yet it was his inaction that caused over three weeks to go by before he even approved the governor's plan to protect our marsh and put up those sand barriers which covered 25 percent of the plan that was submitted by our local leaders." Scalise is referring to a plan proposed May 11 by Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal that the federal government build barrier islands of sand to intercept oil before it hit Louisiana's wetlands. The plan is based on the idea that oil is easier to get out of sand than wetlands, which are an important part of the state's ecosystems. (Read our previous ruling on Jindal's plan here.) We were interested in determining how long it took Obama to implement Gov. Jindal's plan. Now some people have questioned whether Jindal's entire plan could be completed quickly enough to capture the oil before it reached the wetlands. Some scientists have also warned that in the long term, the berms could do more harm than good. They could change coastal currents and further degrade the already extremely fragile coastline. Some suggested that construction of the berms could damage oil and gas pipelines and that dredging the sand to build the berms could cause a change in water salinity that could harm the fish population. Although Scalise refers to "inaction," records indicate that federal agencies have been assessing the proposal since May 11. The Corps of Engineers says it received the plan at 11 p.m. on May 11. The Corps solicited interagency comments in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, and provided those comments to the state of Louisiana. On May 14, the state resubmitted a revised plan based off of the comments. The Corps then solicited a second round of comments and began to discuss technical analyses with the state. On May 21 and May 24, the state submitted additional information, and on May 27, the plan was approved to build berms in six of the 24 proposed sections. On June 2nd, the White House approved of the idea that BP would pay and on June 3rd, BP agreed to pay the estimated $360 million cost. That certainly seems like quite a bit of action to us. According to Scalise spokesman Stephen Bell, Scalise was counting from May 11 to June 3, when BP agreed to pay, because the governor never planned to pay for the berms at the cost of the Louisiana taxpayers. According to that math, the time would be just over three weeks. But we think it's important to note that the Army Corps of Engineers approved Jindal's plan on May 27, two weeks and two days after he proposed it. And then it was June 3 when BP agreed to cover the cost. Scalise said President Obama's "inaction ... caused over three weeks to go by before he even approved the governor's plan." It's the word "inaction" here that is most troubling because it suggests nothing was going on when in fact something was happening to address Jindal's idea. Per protocol, the Corps solicited interagency comments, shared them with the state of Louisiana, received a revised plan, solicited comments on it and then approved the plan May 27. Within a week, the money was in place. The omission of this context leads us to rule Scalise's statement Half True.	None	Steve Scalise	None	None	None	2010-06-29T14:35:16	2010-06-15	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-12750	"Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/28/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claim-about-soaring-ob/	President Donald Trump zeroed in on repealing the Affordable Care Act in his first address to Congress, saying the federal health care law has been a "disaster" that has caused premiums to skyrocket. "Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits," Trump said on Feb. 28, 2017. He then cited a 116 percent increase in Arizona as an example. When Trump says "Obamacare," he’s not talking about everyone who benefitted from President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. He’s referring to premiums for insurance plans on the federal insurance exchange. Premiums for those plans did increase in the past year, drawing criticism from Republicans that the system had failed. But Trump is leaving out a significant part of the story. An off year When officials and policy wonks talk about premium increases, there’s a commonly used benchmark employed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The agency takes a look at the average cost in each county for the second-lowest-cost silver level plan for a 27-year-old. That allows a comparison of rates between years and different parts of the country. In its Oct. 24, 2016, brief, HHS showed that premiums rose an average of 25 percent across the 39 states that use the HealthCare.gov marketplace. As an average, that means some places saw higher increases than others. Oklahoma saw a 69 percent hike, for example, while Arkansas premiums only went up 2 percent. For the record, Arizona is the only state where premiums went up by triple digits. And in Indiana, premiums actually decreased in 2017. (It was the only state where that happened.) The 25 percent average increase is much higher than the earlier years of the Affordable Care Act. Premiums went up about 7 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2015. It’s also much higher than the increases people who acquired health care through an employer saw. In a survey of 425 large employers, the National Business Group on Health estimated that workers who get insurance through their jobs — which most people do — would see a 2017 increase of about 5 or 6 percent. The sudden jump is due in part because portions of the law designed to keep costs artificially low have ended or didn’t work as originally intended. Reinsurance kept premiums for high-cost policyholders low by transferring money to their plans. A program called risk corridors was designed to share money from profitable insurers with companies that lost money, but was targeted by Republicans. Both programs ended as planned for 2017, so many premiums went up considerably to more closely match what it actually costs insurers to offer policies on the exchange. An Urban Institute report said that underpricing was the norm in the early years of the health care law, so the jump this year was a short-term correction. There are other factors, too: Health care costs still are rising each year, though not as much as before the Affordable Care Act. There also are annual changes in who signs up, changes in provider networks and so on. "Price increases are lower than we would have expected without exchanges in place," said Rena Conti, a health economist at the University of Chicago. Enrollment for 2017 also went up, even with higher premiums and a possibility the law could be repealed. Close to 6.4 million people signed up for policies through the marketplace, about 400,000 more than last year. (Trump also doesn’t mention that the Medicaid expansion portion of the law accounts for more than half of newly covered patients.) David Himmelstein, a professor in the CUNY School of Public Health at Hunter College, noted something else not said by Trump. While premiums for some did go up significantly, most people buying these plans aren’t paying those increases. "More than 70 percent of people who purchase coverage through the exchanges receive subsidies, and they will not pay any more for their coverage since their share is fixed," Himmelsten said. "Government will pick up any increase, and government costs for Obamacare have actually been lower than initially predicted." Our ruling Trump said, "Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits." Many people purchasing health care through federal and state insurance marketplaces did see double-digit premium increases, and one, Arizona, saw a larger increase. But as we have noted in previous fact-checks, Trump’s talking point doesn’t accurately reflect the situation overall. Several states did not see such dramatic premium changes, and experts say that health care costs broadly are increasing at a lower rate than before the health care law took effect. Most people get their health care through the employer, which hasn’t seen the same premium spikes. And for people on the health care exchanges, federal subsidies are offsetting premium increases for many. Trump’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-00752	"The president and vice president can't be from the same state."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/16/lawrence-odonnell/president-vice-president-same-state-allowed/	The links between Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have some talking about a Bush/Rubio ticket in 2016. But is it even possible? The day after Rubio announced he was running for president, liberal MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell was already looking ahead to what happens if Rubio’s campaign falls short. "Marco Rubio looks like one of the best possible vice presidential candidates in the Republican field," O’Donnell said on his show on April 14, 2015. "But the one person who can’t choose him is Jeb Bush, because the president and vice president can't be from the same state." While we're still waiting for Bush to make his candidacy official, O'Donnell's claim that "the president and vice president can't be from the same state," got our heads spinning. If correct, that would rule out a Florida ticket of Bush/Rubio, or a Texas ticket of Rick Perry and Ted Cruz for that matter, or any combination that includes Bush, Rubio and two other Florida residents and possible contenders -- Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee. So is it true? The answer is no. Neither the Constitution nor the Electoral College prevents Bush from picking a fellow Floridian or any candidate from choosing a running mate from the same state. It just might make things tricky, depending on the situation. We'll explain the why and how. What the Constitution has to say about electing presidents While registered voters select their preferred candidate for president, the actual electing of the president and vice president is in the hands of the Electoral College. There are 538 electors representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Candidates need a majority, 270, to win. Those electors cast a separate vote for president and vice president. But that wasn't always the case. From 1789-1804, Electoral College members got to vote for two men (and back then, it was only men). The top vote-getter became president and the second-place winner became vice president. There was one caveat. Electoral College voters, called electors, could not cast both of their votes for two people from their home state. In plainspeak, an Electoral College member from Maryland couldn’t cast his two votes for candidates from Maryland. Electors from any other state could still vote for two Maryland representatives, just not the electors from Maryland. The idea behind the restriction was to dilute the power of the big states and to encourage electors to look beyond their political allies. Here’s the text from Article II of the Constitution: "The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves." In 1804, the Twelfth Amendment altered the Electoral College process and created a separate ballot for vice president. But the rule of not being able to use both votes on a person from an elector's home state remained in effect. What does it all mean? Let's use the Bush/Rubio hypothetical. Bush could choose Rubio to be his running mate. And if the two won, Florida's 29 electors could vote to make Bush president, but not to make Rubio vice president (or vice versa). If Bush and Rubio started with 299 electoral votes or more, that wouldn't matter and Rubio would still be vice president. But if the election were close, things would get complicated. This is how it gets complicated We don't have to look too far back to find an example of how this could play out. "We actually flirted with the problem in the 2000 election where both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney had called Texas home in the runup to the nomination," said Robert Bennett, a law professor at Northwestern University and the author of Taming the Electoral College. Cheney sidestepped the issue by registering to vote in Wyoming, the state he once represented in the House. It's good he did. Bush/Cheney wound up with 271 electoral votes. Take away Texas' 32 electoral votes from Cheney's tally and he wouldn't have hit the required 270. Here’s how the 2000 map looked: So what would have happened if Cheney stayed a Texas resident? And what could happen with Bush and Rubio (or another same-state pair)? There are few scenarios. One possible scenario is the Electoral College would vote to elect the new president but not elect the vice president. In that case, the election of the next vice president would become the work of the U.S. Senate, where each senator would get one vote. If that vote is miraculously tied -- well, we’re not sure what would happen next. Some people say the sitting vice president might get to break the tie. Others note that the vice president is not a senator, which is the process spelled out in the Twelfth Amendment. (Imagine if Joe Biden got to vote for himself to break a tie in 2012.) Another possible scenario is that the Electoral College would vote to elect a new vice president and not a president. In this case, the U.S. House of Representatives would break that deadlock, with members of each state casting a single vote. A majority wins. In the case of Bush/Cheney, it never got that far. In the Bush/Rubio exercise, the fact that Republicans control the Senate and House (and a majority of the state delegations) improves their odds of prevailing. But it's definitely a risk. John Harrison, a leading constitutional scholar at the University of Virginia School of Law, offered another hypothetical option looking ahead to 2016. "The Florida Republican Party might seek an amendment to Florida law so that non-Floridians could serve as electors, and nominate a slate of, say, Georgians, who could come down for the day in December when the electors give their vote," Harrison suggested. Harrison added that the Constitution is silent about whether electors must come from the state that appoints them. Harrison acknowledges that this question could be argued (in court) either way. Our ruling O’Donnell said the president and vice president can't be from the same state. That’s incorrect, there is no law or regulation preventing a ticket from coming from the same state. All the Constitution does is prevent electors in the Electoral College from voting for a president and vice president who are both from their home state. In many elections, that actually wouldn't matter. President Barack Obama could have picked a running mate from Illinois in 2008 and 2012 with no ill effect. Ditto for Bill Clinton's victories in 1992 and 1996, George H.W. Bush's 1988 win and Ronald Reagan's victories in 1980 and 1984. But in a close election, the Electoral College quirk could matter (as well as the hoops people might try to work around it). That makes the possibility of an all Florida ticket risky, but not illegal or impossible. We rate the claim False.	None	Lawrence O'Donnell	None	None	None	2015-04-16T18:25:34	2015-04-14	['None']

pomt-06672	"Two days of interest we pay to China is enough to buy one joint strike fighter [jet]."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/09/tom-graves/does-jet-claim-fly-straight/	Like many congressional freshmen, Republican Rep. Tom Graves of Georgia is worried about the nation’s spiraling debt and how much of it is owned by China. Graves, whose district consists of 15 northwest Georgia counties, including Forsyth, talked about the problem of deficit spending at a recent town hall meeting. "Two days of interest we pay to China is enough to buy one joint strike fighter [jet]," Graves told the largely receptive crowd, according to the Cumming Patch website. Those aircraft usually cost astronomical sums of money, so we wondered whether the congressman’s math was correct. On average, does the United States really pay that much money in debt to China? Or did Graves use hyperbole to scare his town hall audience about the rapidly growing economic influence of China? Our friends at PolitiFact Virginia did some of our homework for us. In April, they fact-checked a claim by U.S. Rep. J. Randy Forbes, R-Va., that the federal government pays China nearly $74 million a day in debt interest. PolitiFact Virginia found U.S. Treasury Department reports that show China holds about $1.165 trillion of the national debt. In the most recent 12-month period available, the U.S. spent about $197 billion in interest payments on its debt. Since China owns about 12.8 percent of the U.S. debt, PolitiFact Virginia assumed that country received a similar percentage of the debt interest payments, which for fiscal year 2010 would total nearly $69 million a day. But since the debt increased in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, PolitiFact Virginia did some more math and determined the interest payments to China would be $74.4 million a day, which earned Forbes a True rating on its Truth-O-Meter. Two days of interest payments would total nearly $150 million. So, the next question: How much do these jets cost? The cost to produce a joint strike fighter jet, also known as the F-35, has caused a stir in Washington in recent months. They’re being made by Lockheed Martin, which has a plant in Marietta, and are said to be the most technologically advanced jets ever developed. The jets are being made for the Air Force, Marines and Navy. For the Marines and Navy, it will be the first time they have stealth jets, said Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 Joint Program Office. They’re also very expensive, and some members of Congress are angry about the rising costs. Defense Department officials recently told the U.S. Senate’s Armed Services Committee that the cost for some of the initial planes ordered was 11 percent to 15 percent higher than expected. "Disgraceful," tweeted U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Az., who has been critical of F-35 cost overruns. Cost estimates are all over the place in news accounts. The most accurate estimate came from a Defense Department report that officials say was leaked to the news media a few months ago. The price to build and operate 2,443 of the jets was recently estimated to be about $93 million to $112 million apiece, according to a 2010 Pentagon report. DellaVedova did not dispute the cost estimate. So if we take two days of interest payments, which we believe adds up to about $150 million, that total does eclipse the highest estimate for a F-35 jet, $112 million. Graves’ office estimates the total cost per jet at about $132 million, using a July report from the Congressional Research Service. It used the PolitiFact Virginia report to determine the average daily debt payment to China. We believe Graves has a good argument to base his claim. We rate it as True.

pomt-06637	Hurricane "Irene was the second-largest storm to hit North America in terms of power outages -- and the first hurricane to make landfall in New Jersey since 1904."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/sep/16/jersey-central-power-light/jcpl-says-hurricane-irene-was-second-largest-storm/	When Hurricane Irene roared ashore last month in New Jersey and along parts of the East Coast, the storm killed people, destroyed homes, ruined belongings and caused unprecedented flooding. It also left more than 7 million people in North America without power, according to Jersey Central Power and Light. "In fact, Irene was the second-largest storm to hit North America in terms of power outages – and the first hurricane to make landfall in New Jersey since 1904," according to an advertisement the company published in the Sept. 7 Star-Ledger. PolitiFact New Jersey checked that statistic with a number of weather and energy experts, many of whom agree that Irene is one of the worst storms to hit North America. However, at least one organization puts the number of outages at 9 million. First, let’s look at how JCP&L arrived at its statistic. Spokesman Ron Morano said the company’s research was focused on the costliest and most destructive hurricanes – those affecting large population areas and multiple states. Among them: Hurricane Ike in 2008, which affected customers in 10 states and Canada; and Irene, which affected people in 14 states and the District of Columbia. Irene also entered Canada, but lost its tropical characteristics by the time it crossed the border, said Dennis Feltgen, spokesman for the National Hurricane Center in Miami. JCP&L reviewed a 2009 report by Jeff Masters, a meteorologist and co-founder of the Weather Underground website, that states Ike disrupted power to 7.5 million people. JCP&L also looked at utility reports, press releases from affected utility companies, information from the U.S. Department Of Energy, the National Weather Service, and news articles about Irene that supported data in Masters’ report, Morano said in an email. Morano provided a list of 16 major utility companies along the East Coast that reported 7,070,000 power outages during Irene. More than 670,000 of JCP&L’s 1.1 million customers were among those without power. JCP&L struggled to restore service in Irene's aftermath, and some customers reported being without power for eight days. The company, in press releases, said delays in restoring power were caused by the volume of outages, the location of some problems and continued flooding. Partly because of JCP&L's storm response, public hearings are planned to discuss with the state's utility companies how to improve response for the next storm. "Based on the most recent information, Irene is all but certain to top 7.5 million customers affected," Morano wrote. "Nothing in our research indicates a hurricane has impacted more than 7.5 million customers in North America." But figures still vary. The Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability reported a high of 5.9 million customers with outages during Irene, but cautioned that its data does not include all utility companies. The same office reported a high of approximately 3.8 million outages for Ike. A spokesman for the Washington, DC-based Edison Electric Institute said its outages tally for investor-owned electric companies is approximately 9 million. Municipal power companies and cooperatives are not included in that figure, said spokesman Dan Riedinger. The institute represents approximately 70 percent of the U.S. electric power industry. Given the institute’s estimate – which is in line with figures reported by the Associated Press on Aug. 30 and Sept. 1 for communities from the Carolinas to Maine -- wouldn’t that make Irene, not Ike, the largest storm to hit North America in terms of power outages? "I’m 99 percent sure in terms of the storm that that is correct but we just can’t confirm it yet," Riedinger said. Still, Ike’s ranking is a bit dubious. Since numerous agencies and experts we contacted said there’s no way to quantify an exact number of outages – and, therefore, rank them -- we asked Masters how he was able to do that for the 2009 report cited by JCP&L. "All I did was go through the Wikipedia pages for every major hurricane power outage event of the past 40 years," he said in an email. "Not authoritative at all. I put a plea on the post that if anyone knew of better sources of power outage data, they should contact me, but no one did." Wikipedia is an online database where anyone can enter or edit information on a particular subject, regardless of accuracy. As for the other part of JCP&L’s statement, both David Robinson, New Jersey’s state climatologist, and Feltgen said the last hurricane before Irene to make landfall in New Jersey was in 1903 – not 1904, as JCP&L’s ad stated. Our ruling JCP&L says Hurricane Irene was the second-largest storm to hit North America in terms of power outages, with at least 7 million customers affected. Several experts we spoke with offer power outage ranges from 5.9 million to 9 million, noting that not every utility company is included in those estimates. Prior to Irene, Ike in 2008 reportedly caused 7.5 million outages, but some sourcing of that data comes from an online database with questionable accuracy issues. Still, JCP&L’s overall point about Irene being a major storm that caused millions to lose power is valid. We rate this claim Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-08127	"Ohio is losing over 700 family farms a year, some of them just to pay the inheritance tax."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/dec/09/jim-zehringer/rep-jim-zehringer-point-comment-loss-family-farms-/	Echoing Gov.-elect John Kasich’s pledge to cut taxes, Ohio’s incoming agriculture chief recently called for the elimination of the state’s estate tax. The tax has contributed to the declining number of family farms in Ohio, said State Rep. Jim Zehringer, a Republican from Northwest Ohio whom Kasich recently picked to lead the state’s Department of Agriculture. "Ohio is losing over 700 family farms a year, some of them just to pay the inheritance tax," Zehringer said at a Nov. 16 news conference at which Kasich introduced him as the new agriculture director. Kasich, a Republican who defeated Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland in November, has specifically called for the elimination of the tax, which Zehringer referred to as the inheritance tax, because he believes it punishes success. An estate tax is levied on the net value of an estate before its assets are transferred to anyone else. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look, given the farming remains one of Ohio’s key industries. First we looked to see if the number of family farms actually is decreasing at the rate Zehringer claims. Rob Nichols, a spokesman for John Kasich, said Zehringer based his claim on the United States Department of Agriculture’s statistics, specifically, an agricultural census the department conducts every five years. For his assessment, Zehringer compared figures for one classification of family farms. The USDA, however, also counts "family-held corporations" within its definition of family farms, according to Amanda Pomicter of the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. Family-held corporations represent only a fraction of family farms in Ohio, but their inclusion does color the picture of how fast the number of family farms are shrinking in the state. Here is a comparison over the last 15 years of the figures Zehringer used and statistics that include family-held corporations. Year Family farms only Family farms and corps 1992 60,936 62,538 1997 69,123 71,099 2002 70,890 72,579 2007 66,382 69,131 Nichols told us that Zehringer used the most recent of these five-year stretches for his assertion. Ohio lost 4,508 family farms in that span for an average of about 902 farms a year. If the statistics Zehringer used showed a 900-farm-per-year decline, why did he ballpark the annual losses at 700? He was being conservative, Nichols said. Had Zehringer also included in his analysis farms owned by family-held corporations, he might have reduced the annual decline even further. In the same five year stretch, using the figures the USDA prefers, Ohio lost 3,448 family farms for an average of 690 lost farms per year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture won’t begin counting farms for its 2012 census until the end of that year, so the figures for 2007 represent the most recent available data. Another point of clarity is needed for Zehringer’s assertion that the state’s inheritance tax is causing the state to lose family farms. John Kohlstrand, a spokesman for the Department of Taxation, said the state does not have an inheritance tax. He said inheritance taxes apply to each individual who receives property from an estate. Ohio has an estate tax, which is levied on the net value of an estate before its assets are transferred to anyone else. In e-mails, Nichols told us that was what Zehringer was referring to and that it is "universally known" that some family farms are sold because the estate tax could not be paid. In Ohio, estates worth $338,333 or less are effectively exempt from the state estate tax due to a tax credit, which is available to all estates, of up to $13,900. A 6 percent tax rate applies to estates worth between $338,334 and $500,000. For estates worth more than $500,000, the tax is $9,700 plus 7 percent of the estate’s value. A federal estate tax also exists. It was phased out in 2010 as part of the Bush tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of the year, pending an extension by Congress. The U.S. Agriculture Department does not track how many family farms are lost due to estate taxes, said James Ramey, director of the Ohio field office of the USDA’s National Agriculture Statistics Service. Neither does the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation. But Joe Cornely, the bureau’s spokesman, said Zehringer is "absolutely right" that the Ohio estate tax contributes to the decline in family farms. Sometimes a chunk of a farm is sold to pay federal and state estate taxes and, as a result, the farm is no longer commercially viable, Cornely said. The federal estate tax is more burdensome, but "inheritance taxes, regardless whether it’s state or federal, can have negative consequences on the heirs," he said The food and agriculture industries are a $98 billion business in Ohio. The loss of family farms, particularly in light of Kasich’s commitment to job creation, is sure to be something the incoming Agriculture chief will monitor. Zehringer’s data is somewhat dated, and he didn’t include all types of family farms in his analysis. His statement is not far off the annual decline found in Ohio using statistics the USDA prefers. And ultimately, the differences in numbers don’t impact his underlying point. As for the estate tax’s role in the decline, it’s difficult to say exactly how many family farms were lost for that reason. But Cornely, an authority on Ohio agriculture, said his is sure "some" of the loses would be due to taxes. We rate the statement True.

pomt-11349	"Paul Ryan has blocked all action to strengthen our gun laws."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/06/giffords/gabrielle-giffords-group-claims-gun-rights-backer-/	After the Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, news reports said U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan had thrown cold water on, and shown little interest in, new proposals for gun control. But an attack on the Wisconsin Republican by Giffords PAC, a political action committee named for Gabrielle Giffords, went much further. Ryan "has blocked all action to strengthen our gun laws," Giffords PAC claimed in an online ad released March 13, 2018. As the House speaker since October 2015, Ryan holds one of the most powerful positions in Washington, although other lawmakers, such as committee chairs, have influence over the fate of legislation. And all, of course, is an extreme word. So, let’s see what the record shows on Ryan and gun laws during his time as speaker. Giffords PAC Giffords is a former Democratic U.S. House member from Arizona. In 2011, she was shot while meeting with constituents in Tucson. The shooter killed six people and wounded 13 others. Giffords PAC describes itself as backing elected officials and candidates "who step up to fight the gun violence epidemic." Two weeks before releasing the Ryan ad, the PAC launched a campaign that included Ryan as one of six lawmakers on a #VoteThemOut list. Two Democrats are running for the southern Wisconsin seat held by Ryan, who hasn’t yet announced whether he will run for re-election in November 2018. The PAC’s evidence To back its attack on Ryan, Giffords PAC cited a dozen pieces of gun legislation that were pending since Ryan became speaker. Here are five, each of which was referred to a House committee, but was not voted out of that committee for a vote by the full House: Bill Key provision HR 1217 Reauthorize grants for improvements to the criminal history record system HR 2216 Prohibits sale of gun to person who is subject to restraining order HR 3130 Makes it crime to knowingly give/sell gun to person convicted of misdemeanor stalking HR 1475 Prohibits giving false or misleading material information in connection with a firearm purchase or transfer HR 1478 Ends prohibition on U.S. Department of Health and Human Services using federal funds to promote gun control Giffords PAC argues that the bills were blocked by Ryan by virtue of the fact that the main power of the House speaker -- as explained by a Washington Post primer on House leadership -- "derives from his or her ability to determine what bills come to the floor for debate and a vote." But the PAC provided no evidence that Ryan actually took steps to block the bills. And bills can be blocked by other lawmakers, such as committee chairs. Now to whether there are gun measures that Ryan has not blocked. Ryan’s response To refute the attack, Ryan’s campaign organization cited three measures that passed the House: Measure Key provisions HR 2646 More beds for people with mental illness who need short-term hospitalization HR 4909 Grants to improve school security, including with metal detectors, and to fund training, threat assessments, school and police coordination HR 38 Let people with concealed carry license bring guns across state lines; strengthen National Instant Criminal Background Check System The first two bills make no reference to guns, even if the school measure is aimed at fighting gun violence. The other bill, however, did strengthen background checks, even if it it would also permit additional transportation of guns across state lines. Ryan’s campaign also argued that Ryan has not stood in the way of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from banning bump stocks -- which accelerate a gun’s firing speed -- with regulations using existing law. But it’s not clear that ATF could do so without new legislation; indeed, the Justice Department has said it does not have the legal authority under current law to do so. And Ryan has indicated that the House would not take up a bill that would explicitly allow a ban. Our rating Giffords PAC says: "Paul Ryan has blocked all action to strengthen our gun laws." The anti-gun violence political action committee cited a dozen gun-control measures that didn’t get to a vote in the House. So, it’s clear that Ryan did not move to bring those measures to the floor. But that’s not the same as Ryan himself blocking the measures, given that other lawmakers, such as committee chairs, also have such power. Also, a bill that would strengthen background checks did pass the House -- although it also expanded gun rights, by making it legal for licensed concealed carry holders to bring guns across state lines.

pomt-01713	Michelle Nunn’s "foundation directed grants to an Islamic group tied to radical terrorists."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/08/ending-spending-action-fund/attack-ad-misfires-nonprofits-connection-terrorism/	Michelle Nunn’s U.S. Senate campaign recently had to own up to accidentally posting the details of its election strategy for all the world -- and the opposition -- to see. Within days, one of Nunn’s vocal critics, the conservative Ending Spending Action Fund, was on television with a 30-second ad playing off information from the leaked campaign memo. "What does Michelle Nunn worry about most?" the announcer asks. "It’s not the economy, and it’s not you." The ad tries to tag Nunn with labels that her campaign strategists said in the memo they were anticipating: Nunn’s "too liberal," a "lightweight" a "rubber stamp for Democrats" and "not a real Georgian." But the ad’s headline point is more ominous. "Her foundation directed grants to an Islamic group tied to radical terrorists," the announcer states. "If Nunn supporters are worried, shouldn’t we be, too?" Video of what appears to be armed terrorists is background for part of the ad. PolitiFact decided to fact-check the statement about Nunn, who has spent her career in nonprofits. She became CEO of Points of Light Foundation, the service-oriented organization inspired by President George H.W. Bush, in 2007. Nunn is on leave while campaigning. Ending Spending Action Fund, a political action committee founded by Joe Ricketts, former CEO of TD Ameritrade, has spent more than $1 million on Nunn attack ads since April. Ending Spending president Brian Baker told PolitiFact Georgia last month that the group opposed two candidates this year, Nunn and Republican U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey. Both jumped in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Georgia, but Gingrey was knocked out in the crowded GOP primary that Perdue ultimately won. In July, PolitiFact Georgia rated as Mostly True an Ending Spending ad claim that Nunn earned as much as $300,000 from Points of Light after the non-profit had laid of 90 workers (due to a merger). The contest between Nunn, daughter of retired U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn, and Perdue, cousin of former Gov. Sonny Perdue, is one of the most closely watched of this year’s elections. The prospect of Democrats winning a Senate seat in Republican-controlled Georgia is energizing for Nunn and her party. They want to reclaim a Georgia Senate seat and keep control of the Senate chamber for the last two years of President Barack Obama’s term. Republicans need six seats to claim the Senate majority. For our fact-check of the newest ad from Ending Spending, we contacted Baker, asking for evidence to back up the ad’s claims. He sent us a document based largely on the Nunn campaign’s 144-page internal memo and a story in National Review, the conservative magazine that broke the story of the leaked memo. On July 28th, National Review Online reported that Points of Light had made grants totalling more than $33,000 to Islamic Relief USA, one of a global network of charities that’s under the umbrella of Islamic Relief Worldwide. In June, Israel’s defense minister labeled Islamic Relief Worldwide an "unauthorised association" and has prevented the group from operating in Israel and the West Bank, citing its links to the Palestinian and U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas.. In a web posting, officials with Islamic Relief Worldwide said the organization "is extremely surprised and concerned by this and categorically denies any links with Hamas." Stefanie Weiss, Points of Light’s communications director, told us the nonprofit "has never had any dealings with or given any grants to Hamas or any known terrorist group." From 2003 to 2011, MissionFish was a Points of Light business unit that allowed eBay sellers and buyers to direct all or part of the proceeds from a transaction to their favorite charity, Weiss said. EBay users could donate to any of 20,000 organizations, all of which were registered 501(c)(3) nonprofits or the overseas equivalent, she said. "These nonprofits were vetted regularly to ensure tax-exempt status, good standing with the IRS, and exclusion from terrorist watch lists," Weiss said. Islamic Relief USA was one of them and "remains an eBay Giving Works-approved charity," she said. (Points of Light sold MissionFish to eBay in 2011.) Points of Lights’ IRS 990s show Islamic Relief USA, which describes itself as an independent affiliate of Islamic Relief Worldwide, received about $13,500 in contributions from eBay buyers and sellers in 2006, 2007 and 2010. National Review has corrected its story to show that the $33,000 figure was in error. Nathan Click, spokesman for the Nunn campaign, called the ad a "false and ridiculous attack against Points of Light -- an organization founded by President George H.W. Bush that mobilizes million of volunteers each year." He said this kind of attack "is exactly what Georgians are ready to change about our political process." Our Ruling Just the mention of the word Islamic can ignite strong emotions in some people. And those working to block Nunn’s candidacy clearly know that and hope the ad will work in their favor. Our research showed the group that Points of Light dealt with -- Islamic Relief USA -- is an approved charity and not on the U.S.’s terrorist watch list. But the record of its umbrella organization, Islamic Relief Worldwide, is not clear. Leaders of IRW deny any connection to Hamas. But a top Israeli official in June banned Islamic Relief Worldwide from working in the country, saying terrorist connections exist. The ad says Nunn's foundation "directed money." But Points of Light instead allowed eBay buyers and sellers to choose whether to take part in the program and then designate any one of 20,000 charities, including Islamic Relief USA, to get donated funds. Donors gave to an entity that is not on the U.S. government’s terrorist watch list. These type of donations started before Nunn arrived at Points of Light, and the nonprofit sold MissionFish, three years before the Israel government banned the umbrella group. Ending Spending Action makes a very specific claim based more on innuendo than evidence. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-10965	"Hillary in hiding as police discover dead body hidden in Huma Abedin’s dumpster."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/19/blog-posting/misleading-headline-exaggerates-connection-between/	A misleading headline purporting to link Hillary Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin to a mysterious New York death has blown a small connection way out of proportion. "Hillary in hiding as police discover dead body hidden in Huma Abedin’s dumpster," said a July 12, 2018, headline from Mad World News, a conservative website that has peddled falsehoods before. This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) "Another dead body has turned up in connection to Hillary Clinton," the story said. "This time, the remains of a woman were found in a dumpster at Huma Abedin’s New York apartment. Hillary has gone into hiding as Huma’s neighbors told the cops they believe the death has something to do with Anthony Weiner’s recent conviction." Authorities did find a woman dead in the trash compartment of a New York apartment building on July 10, 2018. But allegations implicating Clinton or Abedin in the incident are uncorroborated. Let’s take a look at what actually happened, according to credible reports detailing the tragedy. On July 10, police responded to Zeckendorf Towers, an upscale apartment complex in New York. There, they "discovered a 48-year-old female unconscious and unresponsive inside a trash compactor," police told the New York Post. The woman, who was later identified as building resident Lara Prychenko, was found by a maintenance worker. Surveillance video later showed her in a nearby elevator moments earlier, where she left her handbag before entering the hallway. Police later told reporters they believed she may have fallen down the chute while drunk. Abedin and her ex-husband, imprisoned former congressman Anthony Weiner, previously owned an apartment in the same complex. The former couple reportedly owned the apartment for multiple years, but listed it for rent on March 19, 2017, the same day Weiner pleaded guilty for explicit texts to a minor and Abedin filed for divorce. The listing was taken off the market days later, though it is not clear whether the apartment was sold or taken off the market for another reason. Most news outlets referred to the building as a place that Abedin "used to call home." Regardless, the trash compactor where the dead woman was found was commonly shared. It was not "Abedin’s dumpster," despite what the Mad World News story said. Further, apartment residents did not tell cops and NBC "they believe the death has something to do with Anthony Weiner’s recent conviction." According to the NBC report cited in the Mad World News story, the neighbors actually "said they initially thought the police presence had something to do with the building's famous resident, Anthony Weiner." Clinton, for her part, has not actually gone into hiding. She has been active criticizing President Donald Trump and promoting her upcoming events on Twitter and Facebook. Three days after the body was discovered, she addressed a teachers union conference in Pittsburgh. She is also set to attend a festival in New York on July 21, 2018, according to her Twitter. The New York Police Department did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling A headline said, "Hillary in hiding as police discover dead body hidden in Huma Abedin’s dumpster." A dead body turned up in the trash compactor at the same apartment building that Abedin used to call home, but we could not find any evidence that Abedin and Clinton played any role in the incident or were implicated in the police investigation.

pomt-01367	"In the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/18/peter-kilmartin/has-atty-gen-peter-kilmartin-prosecuted-more-publi/	Rhode Island has long been a battleground in the fight for open government. Public bodies vote in secret. Deals are cut behind closed doors. Police departments withhold arrest records and daily logs. A report issued last month by ACCESS/RI found a "troubling level of non-compliance" with the state's open records law and called for enhanced oversight by the Attorney General's office. During an interview with Rhode Island Public Radio that aired on Oct. 2, 2014, incumbent Atty. Gen. Peter Kilmartin, a Democrat, was asked about enforcement of the open records law. He lamented that some public bodies are not following the law despite repeated attempts to educate government officials about the documents that are supposed to be public. "Unfortunately, in the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined," he said. "That tells me there is still a problem." It's a statement he repeated on Oct. 10, 2014, during a taping of a debate on WPRI-TV with Republic Dawson Hodgson. We were interested in whether Kilmartin has brought more open records cases to court than his two predecessors, Patrick Lynch (now a lawyer in private practice) and Sheldon Whitehouse (now a U.S. Senator). When we asked Kilmartin's office for a tally of the cases, spokeswoman Amy Kempe sent us a list of 18 civil lawsuits dating as far back as 2002. "There were no lawsuits from 1999 to 2002," she said in an email. According to the list, Whitehouse took one case to court, suing the Anthony fire district in 2002. During Lynch's eight years in office he filed seven suits -- against public entities in Johnston, North Kingstown, Cranston, Woonsocket and Lincoln. Barrington was sued twice. Since 2011, according to the list, Kilmartin has filed 10 suits against public entities for violating the open records law, starting with the Albion Fire District in Lincoln (which Lynch also sued) and ending most recently with the town of Warren. We spot-checked Kilmartin's cases using our archives. To check the list of his predecessors, we first contacted the offices of Lynch and Whitehouse to ask if Kilmartin was omitting any cases. Whitehouse's office said the number seems correct. Repeated inquiries to Lynch's law office produced no response. So we turned to court records and received a list of all civil suits brought by Whitehouse and Lynch against public bodies. Once again, Kilmartin's tally checked out. In summary, Peter Kilmartin said that in the past three years, his office has "prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined." His office has filed 10 suits since 2011. Lynch had seven during his eight years as Attorney General. Whitehouse had just one during his four years in that office. We can't say if the trend is due to previous attorneys general being less aggressive in prosecuting violations of the state's open government laws than Kilmartin, or if public bodies are getting more brazen in ignoring them. Certainly the latest ACCESS/RI report offers evidence that the phrase "open government" is -- for some of Rhode Island's "public" bodies -- an oxymoron. Rhode Island's culture of secrecy persists, but Kilmartin has filed more lawsuits than his two predecessors conbined so we rate Kilmartin's claim as True.

pomt-06937	"I did not vote to spend money to fight that (Amendment 6 redistricting) lawsuit."	true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/20/alan-hays/hays-said-he-didnt-vote-spend-money-amendment-6-la/	Florida legislators hit the road beginning in June 2011 for a series of public hearings to collect input about redistricting. The traveling statewide show has drawn many residents who have peppered legislators with questions and criticisms that have put leaders on the defensive. PolitiFact Florida previously evaluated a claim by State Rep. Will Weatherford, chairman of the redistricting committee in the House. While at a hearing in Panama City, the Wesley Chapel Republican said, "There is no $30 million pot of money" for redistricting in the House -- a claim we deemed False. While there is no $30 million pot of money labeled exclusively for redistricting in the House, there are two pots of money which are available to fight redistricting lawsuits. This time we will travel -- that is, electronically because we watched a video of the July 13 hearing -- to The Villages, a mainly conservative retirement community in Central Florida. There, some residents raised questions about public dollars being spent to fight a redistricting state constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2010. One man directed a question to Sen. Alan Hays, a Republican from Umatilla, north of Orlando. "Some of you people had voted to tax or to spend our taxes against the amendments that were passed by 63 percent of the vote," the man said. "I wonder if you, Sen. Hays, since I'm in your district, did you vote?" "Did I vote for what?" Hays asked. "... These taxes being paid for the suit against the amendments?" the man asked. The man was referring to a lawsuit, initially filed by two of Florida's minority members of Congress -- Democrat Corrine Brown and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart -- seeking to overturn Amendment 6, which relates to congressional redistricting. The Florida House later joined that lawsuit as an intervenor plaintiff. Later in the meeting, Hays responded: "No I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit. The disappointing part of this whole thing, folks, is the misinformation that is out there. The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6. The Amendment 6 lawsuit was filed by one Republican congressman and one Democratic congresswoman. The Florida House chose to go, and what's the term? An intervenor? ... in seeking clarification. The Florida House intervened. But your tax dollars are not being used to sue you, the people who voted the 63 percent. Believe me. I don't know where you got your information but it's incorrect. So no I did not vote to waste that money." When we hear a politician declare that there is misinformation lurking about our ears perk up. In three separate items, we will dissect three claims by Hays: • "No I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit" -- referring to a lawsuit challenging Amendment 6. • "The Florida Legislature has not filed a lawsuit to fight Amendments 5 and 6." • "Your tax dollars are not being used to sue you the people who voted the 63 percent" in favor of Amendment 6. In this item, we'll check Hays' assertion that he did not "vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit." First, some background on redistricting. Every 10 years -- two years after U.S. Census figures are compiled -- state lawmakers redraw state and congressional legislative districts. The objective is to adjust district sizes to reflect changes in the population. The task seems simple enough: to logically divide Florida's 18.8 million residents into 120 House districts, 40 Senate districts and 27 congressional districts. But the process is never without accusations of "gerrymandering" often brought up against the party in power. This round of redistricting, however, figures to be even more contentious because of two constitutional amendments -- 5 and 6 -- approved by voters in November 2010 that require districts to be drawn in a way that doesn't favor incumbents or political parties or interfere with minority representation. Some lawmakers say the amendments are vaguely worded and are open to interpretation, meaning that any redrawing of district lines will be open to a legal challenge. Amendment 5 covers state legislative districts. Amendment 6 imposes the same requirements for drawing congressional maps. As we mentioned, two members of Florida's congressional delegation -- Democrat Corrine Brown and Republican Mario Diaz-Balart -- are challenging Amendment 6, arguing that they believe the changes will reverse gains in minority representation. Hispanics represent more than half of the voting-age population in Diaz-Balart's district while African-Americans represent nearly half in Brown's district, according to their federal court complaint. Brown and Diaz-Balart filed their lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Southern Florida on Nov. 3, 2010, arguing that Florida voters can't change the standards for congressional district-drawing because the issue is governed by the U.S. Constitution, not the Florida Constitution. The Florida Secretary of State is defending the lawsuit, and several other entities or individuals have joined as defendants including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Florida State Conference of NAACP branches as well as a handful of Democratic state legislators. In their May 25 motion seeking to dismiss the suit, the defendants argued that the plaintiffs were asking the court to "nullify the people's decision to require that the Legislature take a fair and balanced approach when drawing Congressional districts. And their motivation is obvious: they are incumbents and they are threatened by the fact that, for the first time ever, there are fair and neutral standards prohibiting the favoring or disfavoring of particular incumbents or parties." (Kurt Browning, the Secretary of State, opposed the amendments.) Oral arguments have been set for July 29 in Miami. On Jan. 14, 2011, the Florida House filed a motion seeking to join the Brown/Diaz-Balart lawsuit which was ultimately granted. The state Senate, however, did not join the lawsuit. We'll talk a little more about the distinction in examining another part of Hays' statement, but for this fact-check, it makes things quite clear. Because the Senate did not join the lawsuit, there clearly wasn't any vote that Hays could have participated in to set aside money to fight that lawsuit. The Senate has money set aside that it could possibly use for redistricting -- including legal fees. But that money won't go toward the Amendment 6 lawsuit. And even more generally, there wasn't a vote on budgeting redistricting legal fees in the Senate, both Craig Meyer, chief of staff for Republican Senate President Mike Haridopolos, and Sen. Nan Rich, the Senate's Democratic leader, told us. Instead, the redistricting dollars go into an overall category that the Senate leadership can spend how it sees fit. So, Hays was correct to say "I did not vote to spend money to fight that lawsuit." There was no vote for line-item money for the lawsuit initially filed by the members of Congress and now also being fought by the state House -- but not the state Senate. We rate this claim True.

pomt-04231	"We’ve outdrawn the Super Bowl for a little while now in the arenas and stadiums that we’ve followed them in for the Super Bowl. We’ve gone in after [the NFL] and surpassed their ticket sales."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/22/paul-levesque/jersey-itinerary-both-events-wrestler-triple-h-say/	Guess what, sports fans? The Super Bowl may not be the biggest ticket in town after all, according to popular wrestling entertainer Triple H. That designation might instead go to WrestleMania, an annual one-night event featuring matches between some of the most popular wrestlers within World Wrestling Entertainment. And MetLife Stadium is likely to become the show ring for that title when WrestleMania comes to town in April and the real Super Bowl follows in February 2014. "We’ve outdrawn the Super Bowl for a little while now in the arenas and stadiums that we’ve followed them in for the Super Bowl," Paul Levesque (Triple H’s real moniker) said in a Nov. 8 interview on NYPost.com. "We’ve gone in after [the NFL] and surpassed their ticket sales." Levesque is executive vice president for Talent Relations and Live Events for the Stamford, Conn.-based WWE. In the context of attendance, Levesque wins this bout. PolitiFact New Jersey can’t predict the ticket sales outcome for both events at MetLife Stadium, so we looked at six stadiums where WrestleMania was held after a Super Bowl. In five of the six arenas (Pontiac Silverdome, Ford Field, Reliant Stadium, University of Phoenix Stadium and Sun Life Stadium), WrestleMania attendance topped Super Bowl attendance. Here’s a breakdown by arena: STADIUM SUPER BOWL YEAR WRESTLEMANIA YEAR Pontiac Silverdome 81,270 1982 93,173 1987 Ford Field 68,206 2006 80,103 2007 Reliant Stadium 71,525 2004 72,744 2009 U. Phoenix Stadium 71,101 2008 72,219 2010 Georgia Dome 72,625 2000 71,617 2011 Sun Life Stadium 74,059 2010 78,363 2012 Sources: World Wrestling Entertainment, NFL’s Super Bowl XLVI 2011 Postseason Media Guide So why has WrestleMania had better ticket sales than the Super Bowl? Staging. Seats can be added to the field for Wrestlemania events, but not for Super Bowls, possibly giving WrestleMania a capacity advantage. "The difference between WrestleMania and Super Bowl staging is that WrestleMania has a stage much like a concert so seats behind the stage are unavailable but would be used for football," Kevin Hennessy, WWE senior director of publicity, said in an e-mail. "However, for WrestleMania, seats are added to field level which would not be done for football. That is why we feel justified in making the comparison." That was the case at Glendale, Ariz.’s University of Phoenix Stadium, where temporary seats were added for WrestleMania in 2010, spokesman Scott Norton said. And New Jerseyans have a reason to care about ticket sales when both events come to MetLife Stadium: ticket sales equal economic impact. "According to the NY/NJ Super Bowls Host Committee (headed by CEO Al Kelly) approximately 150,000 out-of-town visitors will attend non-game events and that the region will have approximately 400,000 people total who will attend events related to Super Bowl activities that are not the actual Super Bowl game," Wayne Hasenbalg, president and CEO of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, said in an e-mail. "According to a SMRI (Sports Management Research Institute) economic study, the recent Super Bowl in Indianapolis (XLVI) had a $155 million economic impact on the central Indiana region," Hasenbalg continued. "The SMRI estimates $550 million in regional economic impact for our Super Bowl (XLVIII)." The SMRI did not return a call for comment. WrestleMania 28’s economic impact on Miami this past April totaled $103 million, according to a report assessing the event’s financial impact on that city. Our ruling WWE executive Paul Levesque, better known by his stage name Triple H, said in a recent interview that "we’ve outdrawn the Super Bowl for a little while now in the arenas and stadiums that we’ve followed them in for the Super Bowl. We’ve gone in after [the NFL] and surpassed their ticket sales." In terms of attendance, Levesque is largely correct: WrestleMania sold more tickets than the Super Bowl in five of the six stadiums where WrestleMania was held after a Super Bowl. It's worth noting, however, that since WrestleMania's staging is similar to a concert's, field seating may be added to compensate for lost seating behind the WrestleMania stage.

pomt-05043	President Barack Obama’s health care reform "slashed $500 billion from Medicare."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/11/sean-duffy/wisconsin-gop-us-rep-sean-duffy-says-obamacare-law/	On June 6, 2012, Wisconsin Democrat Pat Kreitlow huffed and puffed in declaring that U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., "voted twice to end Medicare." It was a claim, made numerous times about others, that PolitiFact National labeled its Lie of the Year for 2011. Kreitlow, who is challenging Duffy in the November 2012 election, earned a Pants on Fire for his version. A day later, Duffy fumed over Kreitlow’s support of President Barack Obama’s health care reform law, saying it "slashed $500 billion from Medicare." That has been another popular claim for the Truth-O-Meter. Let’s see whether Duffy is spouting anything more than hot air. Past claims The first phases of the health care reform law, which was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2012, took effect in March 2010. Six months later, the 60 Plus Association, a conservative advocacy group for senior citizens, began running TV ads against Democratic members of Congress from Wisconsin and other states who voted for it. The claim? The law "will cut $500 billion from Medicare" and "hurt the quality" of care for seniors. PolitiFact National found the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget, but reduces the growth of Medicare spending by just over $500 billion over 10 years. In rating the claim Mostly False, our colleagues noted that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will rise to $929 billion in 2020, an increase of $430 million over actual spending in 2009. So, Medicare spending continues to increase, but not by as much as it would have without the reform law. The claims of a $500 billion cut to Medicare, however, have continued. In May 2012, a Republican Ohio congressman accused a Democratic Ohio congresswoman of having "gutted Medicare by $500 billion" by voting for the health care reform law. PolitiFact Ohio rated the claim Mostly False, noting that Medicare spending would have grown at a faster rate without the law. The same month, PolitiFact Florida gave a Mostly False to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for saying "seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund ‘Obamacare.’" Our colleagues found that slowing the growth in Medicare spending is intended to offset, to some extent, the overall cost of the law. (For a comprehensive look at Medicare and claims made about it, read "The PolitiFact guide to Medicare attack lines.") Duffy claim Duffy's made his claim in a news release issued June 7, 2012 to criticize Kreitlow's support of the health care reform law. Regarding the law's effect on Medicare, Duffy said: "Kreitlow's full-throated support for the government’s unwarranted takeover of healthcare slashed $500 billion from Medicare, too." (Claims that Obama's law is a government takeover of health care was PolitiFact National's Lie of the Year for 2010.) Duffy campaign manager Justin Richards argued that "slashed" is an accurate way of describing how the law reduces the growth in Medicare spending. But even though some of the news article excerpts Richards cited referred to cuts, he acknowledged that the reductions are in the growth of future spending. Our rating Duffy said the federal health care reform law "slashed $500 billion from Medicare." There is an element of truth in his statement because Medicare spending will grow by about $500 billion less than it would have without the law. But the law has not already reduced Medicare spending by $500 billion, as Duffy suggests. We rate Duffy's statement Mostly False.

pomt-13201	The city of Richmond "built the second richest team in the NFL a $14 million stadium."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/oct/24/joe-morrissey/joe-morrissey-hits-and-misses-claim-about-redskin-/	Joe Morrissey says Richmond fumbled in 2013 when it signed a long-term deal to bring the Washington Redskins’ summer training camp to the city. "We built the second richest team in the NFL a $14 million stadium," Morrissey said during an Oct. 17 mayoral candidates debate sponsored by ChamberRVA. There’s been been lots of arguing over whether the Redskins training facility - located behind the Science Museum of Virginia - has been good for the city. Boosters of the plan, including outgoing Mayor Dwight Jones, have said it was a way to bring in economic activity in the city; detractors say the deal was a give away city dollars. We won’t be able to settle that debate, but we’re curious about the factual claims in Morrissey’s statement: That the Redskins are the "second richest team" in the NFL and that the city built them a "$14 million stadium." Let’s start by saying Morrissey’s description of the training camp as a stadium is inaccurate. The facility has no structure with tiered seats surrounding a field. What the city built is essentially a two-story building and two football fields on a 17-acre tract. The first floor has a locker room and training rooms that the Redskins use during their three-week summer camp. When the team leaves town, the first floor is leased by Bon Secours hospital system as a men’s health center. Richmond planned to lease the second floor as office space, but has been unable to find tenants. The $14 million Morrissey said his figure on the cost to build the training facility was derived from two sources -- the city’s $10 million investment in the training camp as well as a $4 million state grant that Virginia provided to the Redskins. The state grant didn’t pay for constructing the facility; it was tied to an agreement between the state to encourage the Redskins, who are headquartered in Ashburn, to retain and expand their operations in Virginia. The cost to build the training camp wasn’t $14 million. It was $10 million, paid for by the city and built by Richmond’s Economic Development Agency, said Tammy Hawley, a spokeswoman for Mayor Jones. She added in an email that the EDA also paid for an additional $1 million to build a park at the site. Rent and naming rights are being used to make bond payments for the city’s investment, she said. But the city is also responsible for $500,000 payments to the Redskins each year during the course of the eight-year-agreement to cover some the team’s costs of training in Richmond. That’s paid for through sponsorships, in-kind services and not additional city funding, says a July 21, 2016 report to the City Council that Hawley sent us. In recent years, the city’s EDA has had to make payments to cover portions of the annual $500,000 bill because sponsorships and other revenues from the site haven’t met expectations. The second richest NFL team? This isn’t the first time Morrissey has said the Redskins are the "second richest team in the NFL." He also did so during a Sept. 29 interview on The John Fredericks show. Morrissey pointed us to an Associated Press article from August 2014 and an April 2016 posting on sports news website that say the Redskins team was the third most valuable team in the NFL. The NFL value rankings are done every year by Forbes magazine, which looks at each team’s overall value as well as how much annual revenue they generate. They have shown that, for years, the Redskins have been in the top tier the most valuable football franchises. Forbes valued the team at $1.7 billion in 2013, $2.4 billion in 2014 and $2.85 billion in 2015. Each year that made them the third most valuable franchise among the NFL’s 32 teams. The Redskins’ annual revenue was $381 million in 2012, $395 million in 2013 and $439 million in 2014, Forbes reported. The 2016 estimates came out last month, and they show Washington has slipped in the rankings even though its value continues to increase. The Dallas Cowboys and New England Patriots continue to dominate as the most valuable teams. But the New York giants and San Francisco 49ers, which are valued at $3.1 billion and $3 billion, respectively, have now barely pulled ahead of the Redskins in the rankings. Washington’s $2.95 billion overall value this year, ranks it fifth.The Redskins’ revenues of $447 million last year still ranked third, barely ahead of the Giants and the 49ers. Our ruling Morrissey said "We built the second richest team in the NFL a $14 million stadium." Morrissey’s gist - that Richmond spent a lot of money building a training facility for one of the richest teams in the NFL - is solid. But his statement is filled with exaggerated figures and terms. The facility is not a stadium; it mainly consists of two practice fields and a building containing a locker room and training rooms. The construction cost was $10 million. And the Redskins are the fifth wealthiest team in the NFL, according to Forbes. On the whole, we rate Morrissey’s multi-faceted statement Half True.

pomt-12007	"Thomas Jefferson said, ‘Government that governs least governs best.’ "	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/21/mike-pence/mike-pence-erroneously-credits-thomas-jefferson-sm/	Vice President Mike Pence defended the diminished role of Washington in the latest health care bill introduced in the Senate by citing ardent anti-Federalist Thomas Jefferson. Pence appeared on Fox & Friends on Sept. 21, 2017, to address criticism of the proposal to dismantle the Affordable Care Act by U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt asked Pence whether proposed block grants to states would mean governors would cover pre-existing conditions. Pence sidestepped the question by suggesting local control is better than a strong central government, a point of view the third president may have endorsed. "Thomas Jefferson said, ‘Government that governs least governs best,’ " Pence said. "I mean, the question that people ought to ask is, who do you think will be more responsive to the healthcare needs in your community? Your governor and your state legislature, or a congressman and a president in a far off nation’s capital?" It must be nice to have Jefferson on your side — except Jefferson didn’t say it. "This comes up a lot," said Annette Gordon-Reed, a Harvard legal history professor who has written extensively about Jefferson. She pointed out that the quote is so often misattributed to him that the Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello in Virginia even has a web page devoted to addressing it. For years, the quote was attributed to Henry David Thoreau, who evoked the motto "That government is best which governs least," in his 1849 essay Civil Disobedience. Thoreau argued that individuals should not let governments make them agents of injustice. Historians now generally accept that Thoreau was likely quoting the United States Magazine and Democratic Review, which printed in 1837 that "The best government is that which governs least." By 1853, credit for the sentiment passed to Jefferson, who was not necessarily a fan of strong central governments. "Although the ideas expressed in this quotation may be in line with Jefferson's opinions to some extent, the exact phrasing is almost certainly not Jefferson's," foundation research librarian Anna Berkes wrote on the page. "However, this quotation has been associated with the ideological descendants of Jefferson's Democratic-Republican party for a very long time, and this is likely why it ultimately came to be attributed to him." Berkes previously told PolitiFact that the rampant misattribution to Jefferson led her to create the "Spurious Quotations" page on the Monticello website. (It seems Thomas Jefferson survives through plenty more false quotes than just this one advocating for small government.) "The opinion has been associated with Jefferson’s Democratic-Republican party ideology, which is probably why people think he said it," she said. "The association is what has been called a natural Jeffersonian maxim. It’s just not a Jefferson quote." Pence repeated a saying often associated with Jefferson, but research showed the writer of the Declaration of Independence never said it. We rate this statement False.

pomt-11317	"On average, American women only earn 80 cents for every dollar a man earns for doing the same job."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/13/tina-smith/do-women-get-only-80-percent-pay-men-do-same-job/	On April 10 -- Equal Pay Day -- Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., tweeted out her support for an end to differential pay for men and women. Her tweet said, "It’s completely unacceptable that, on average, American women only earn 80 cents for every dollar a man earns for doing the same job. And the #paygap is even greater for most women of color. #EqualPayDay" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But there’s a problem: The statistics showing that women earn 80 percent of what men earn are overall comparisons and do not specifically compare men and women occupying the same jobs. After we reached out to Smith’s office, she sent a new tweet to correct her earlier misstatement. Let’s take a closer look at this commonly cited statistic. The most recent official data on this point, published by the U.S. Census Bureau, showed that women earned 80.5 percent of what men did. That’s up by a couple percentage points in recent years. However, as we’ve written previously, this figure actually refers to the general disparity between what men and women earn, not comparing cases of apples to apples. The 80 percent figure does not adjust for such factors as the degrees and jobs women pursue, the time they take off to care for children, the number of hours they work, and the years of experience they’ve had. So while the 80 percent figure may be used to signify some facets of women’s challenges in the workplace -- such as disproportionate representation in fields that offer more flexible work schedules, even if that means earning less -- the statistic cannot be used to pinpoint pay discrimination between men and women doing the same work. Other studies have shown a significantly closer match for men and women holding the same jobs. For instance, a 2013 study by the American Association of University Women that evened out those factors found a 7 percent wage gap between men and women a year after graduating college. That’s still a disparity, but it’s only about one-third as big as the figure Smith cited in her tweet. (It’s also worth noting that the apples-to-apples pay differential varies depending on the job.) Smith did have a point that women of color tend to fare more poorly on pay comparisons than do white women. A 2014 report from the National Women’s Law Center concluded that black women made 60 cents to the dollar earned by a white man, and Hispanic women made 55 cents, according to the report. Asian-American women actually earn higher wages than black and Hispanic men and women, as well as white women, Pew Research has found. Still, Asian-American women lagged behind white males for annual earnings. A few hours after we contacted Smith’s office, they informed us that Smith had sent a new tweet correcting her previous one. In the new tweet, she removed the reference to "the same job" and continued: "When I wrote about Equal Pay Day earlier this week, I said the 80 cents/$1 stat applies to men and women doing the same job. That last part—comparing particular job categories—wasn’t quite right. And I’m glad @PolitiFact reached out to me for clarification." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling In Smith’s initial tweet, she wrote, "On average, American women only earn 80 cents for every dollar a man earns for doing the same job." The official federal data shows that women earn 80 percent of what men earn, but that’s a collective average for all jobs, not a comparison of men and women holding identical jobs. For men and women holding the same job, there’s still a gap, but it’s substantially smaller. Our policy is to acknowledge and applaud after-the-fact corrections by speakers we check, but we still put the original comment to the Truth-O-Meter. So Smith’s initial remark rates Mostly False.

pomt-10664	Romney refused to pardon "a decorated soldier" returning from Iraq who had been charged with a crime involving a BB gun when he was 13.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/28/mike-huckabee/romney-refused-to-pardon-soldier-and-everyo/	In response to a TV ad by Mitt Romney that highlights Mike Huckabee's 1,000-plus pardons, Huckabee tried to turn the tables and said Romney's refusal to grant pardons denied people who committed small crimes a chance to clear their records. Huckabee cited one case involving "a decorated soldier" who wanted to become a police officer but still had a criminal record from a minor incident when he was 13 years old and shot another boy with a BB gun. "Didn't even break the skin," Huckabee said on NBC's Today Show on Dec. 19. Huckabee is accurately describing the case of a soldier named Anthony Circosta of Agawam, Mass., a member of the Army National Guard who fought in Iraq and was awarded a Bronze Star. He then sought a pardon so he could become a police officer, but was turned down. Circosta did not return a phone call from PolitiFact this week, but Huckabee's description of the case is supported by accounts in the Associated Press and other publications. "Now, I would have given that kid a pardon," Huckabee said about Circosta in a Fox News Channel interview on Dec. 20. "And everywhere I've gone and asked people for a show of hands, everybody agrees with me." Romney refused all pardon requests in his four years as governor. "I didn't pardon anybody as governor because I didn't want to overturn a jury," he said during a June 2007 debate. When he was asked about his policy in December 2007, Romney replied "We looked at the cases one by one and I did not want to provide commutations to people who had weapons violations that were going to be asking to use weapons in their new capacity." He told reporters that the only reasons he would have issued a pardon or commutation would have been if he found evidence that proved a wrongful conviction, prosecutorial misconduct or errors in the judicial process.

pomt-14916	"It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through gun shows."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/nov/02/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-40-percent-gun-sales-escape-backgro/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently issued an executive order that banned firearms from most state buildings and offered his rationale for a gun control measure he plans to present to the General Assembly this winter. McAuliffe, a Democrat, is calling for a law that would require all prospective gun buyers in Virginia to undergo a background check to determine whether the purchaser has a disqualifying criminal record or mental health history. Although the governor long has supported this action, his intensity grew after the Aug. 26 fatal shootings of Roanoke television reporter Alison Parker and cameraman Adam Ward near Smith Mountain Lake. Virginia law now requires all licensed gun dealers - those in the business of selling arms - to conduct computerized checks on buyers. But sales between individuals are exempt and that, McAuliffe says, opens a loophole for guns to fall into the wrong hands. A federal law requiring background checks has the same exemption. "It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through guns shows," McAuliffe stated in his Oct. 15 executive order. Christina Nuckols, deputy press secretary for McAuliffe, said the source of the 40 percent figure is a 1997 study by the National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey asking how they got their weapons. The study found that 30 percent to 40 percent of all gun transactions were made through an "off-the-books" transfer in which a background check wasn’t required. The finding has been cited widely by gun control advocates - including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D- Va. - in calling for a federal law mandating universal background checks. But as we and other fact checkers have noted previously, the research is old and limited. Consider: •The 1994 survey was conducted eight months after the federal Brady Act went into effect, mandating background checks on individuals seeking to buy firearms from federally licensed dealers. Survey participants were asked about their gun acquisitions going back to 1991. •Only 251 gun owners answered the survey question about the origin of their weapons. Some of the gun owners weren’t sure how they’d gotten their guns and answered "probably" or "probably not" to whether they got the gun from a licensed firearm dealer. McAuliffe’s statement misses a key distinction in the study: The research looked at all gun transactions - including when a gun was obtained as a gift or as an inheritance - and not just being "sold," as the governor said. The Fact Checker at The Washington Post in 2013 asked one of the co-authors of the study, Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, to crunch the 1994 data just looking at sales. Ludwig replied that 14 percent to 22 percent of guns were purchased without a background check. The 1994 data, we also should note, did not have a category for online sales, as McAuliffe’s statement suggests. Earlier this year, we asked the other co-author of the report, Philip Cook of Duke University, what percentage of guns currently are sold without a background check. In response, he sent us an op-ed that he and Ludwig wrote in the National Review after the December 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. - a time when the 40 percent figure was circulating again. "We’ve been following the give-and-take with some interest because our research is the original source of the 40-percent statistic," they wrote. "Our views may come as a surprise: First, we don’t know the current percentage - nor does anyone else." The lack of current data is due largely because federal funding for gun studies dried up two decades ago. President Barack Obama issued a memorandum in 2013 directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to re-examine gun violence. We also should note that Virginia doesn’t keep data about private guns, said Corinne Geller, communications manager for the state police. As a result, we recently gave a False rating to a statement by state Sen. Tommy Norment, R-James City, that only 2 percent of Virginia gun sales are exempt from background checks. The fact is, nobody knows. Our ruling McAuliffe said, "It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through gun shows." His source is a small-sample survey from 1994 that included firearms that were sold and those that were given as gifts or inheritances. When the results were adjusted to guns sold - the term McAuliffe uses - only 14 percent to 22 percent of the firearms were sold without background checks. The researchers say they "don’t know" if their findings are relevant today. No current national study has been published. McAuliffe did not acknowledge these points, all of which have been reported widely. So we rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-14071	Says "Jacky Rosen has refused to tell us whether she supports Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton."	pants on fire!	/nevada/statements/2016/may/20/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-wrongly-says-jacky-rosen-refused-say-if-she-s/	Republicans are hoping to tie the increasingly fraught battle between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination to down-ballot Democrats. That’s the case in Nevada, where the National Republican Congressional Committee is running automated telephone calls telling voters that Democratic candidate Jacky Rosen hasn’t committed to supporting either Sanders or Clinton. "Jacky Rosen has refused to tell us whether she supports Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton," the recorded call says. So has Rosen, a synagogue leader who was recruited by Sen. Harry Reid to run for the state’s 3rd Congressional District, refused to weigh in on the presidential race? In a word — no. Rosen, who announced her candidacy in January, told Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston on May 12 that she caucused for Clinton back in February. "I caucused for Hillary, and it looks like she’s going to be the nominee, and I’m proud to stand on the ticket with her," she told Ralston. (This comment starts at 20:30.) NRCC spokesman Zach Hunter said in an email that there was a difference between caucusing and endorsing, and that Rosen has generally been dodgy on the issue. "In 2016 when you have such a divide in the Democratic party as it barrels towards a contested convention, the difference is significant," he said in an email. It’s true that Rosen has done few media interviews since announcing her candidacy, but it doesn’t appear that she’s really been asked about who she’s endorsed for president. Articles in the Laughlin Nevada Times and Las Vegas Sun don’t mention a presidential endorsement from Rosen. Associated Press political reporter Michelle Rindels interviewed Rosen on April 27 for an upcoming story and confirmed that the candidate openly supported Clinton. It is curious as to why Rosen didn’t speak up about her presidential preference before Nevada’s presidential caucus in February, despite announcing her candidacy back in January. The Clinton campaign in the state didn’t appear to tout her endorsement, and she doesn’t appear on a campaign list of "100 Nevada women for Hillary" from November 2015. But her endorsement of Clinton on Ralston Live was straightforward. "She spent eight years in the White House, she was a senator, she’s traveled all around the world talking to world leaders," she said. "And she’s a mom and a grandma and I really think she has a lifelong experience in doing this, having a calm, cool, collected head, being analytical and those are the kind of things that are important to me." Our ruling The NRCC says Democrat Jacky Rosen "has refused to tell us whether she supports Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton." PolitiFact was unable to find an instance where Rosen refused to answer questions about her presidential preference. Rosen has said on at least two occasions, one publicly and one to a reporter, that she supports Hillary Clinton.

She gave a statement to the Northeast Times this week saying, "It is shocking to me that Police Commissioner Richard Ross and Mayor Jim Kenney allowed this illegal occupation to go on for hours without taking any action to enforce the law, and I question whether the police department has been ordered to stand down when it comes to addressing this Black Lives Matter action." We zeroed in on the phrase "illegal occupation." Did the BLM protesters, who did not have a permit, commit an illegal act outside officer Ryan Pownall’s home? Asked why White believed the protesters were illegally occupying the area, spokesperson David Foster told PolitiFact PA it was because they lacked a permit and harassed the neighbors. He also offered up the same statement given to the Northeast Times. The protesters kept video of the rally, found on leader Asa Khalif’s public Facebook page. In it, you can see 30 minutes of footage during which a handful of protesters walk back and forth between the street and sidewalks, shouting anti-police remarks on a bullhorn. Throughout the protest, the street and sidewalks mostly remain clear. The protesters did not at any point band together in an attempt to block traffic. However, a police vehicle was parked in the middle of the street for some time. ACLU PA deputy legal director Mary Catherine Roper said Black Lives Matter did nothing illegal. Philadelphia requires permits for demonstrations of 75 people or more and for protests that occur on city streets or sidewalks "without compliance with the normal and customary traffic regulations or controls governing such places." Roper said the protest outside of Pownall’s home was too small to require a permit and didn’t clash with the other required criterion, given the protesters weren’t preventing others from using the sidewalks or the street. "The representative needs to brush up on the law if she’s going to make comments like that," Roper said, "which are simply not accurate." Lauren Hitt, communications director for Mayor Jim Kenney, said a protest of this size did not need to apply for a permit. Some court cases have restricted the rights of protesters in residential areas, such as Klebanoff v. McMonagle in 1988 in the Pennsylvania Superior Court. The judges upheld an injunction against dozens of pro-life protesters who had repeatedly rallied in front of an abortion doctor’s home. But the decision didn’t outwardly ban protesting in residential areas. Roper said the BLM protesters were within their rights given their size and the way they walked around the streets and sidewalks rather than camping out directly in front of Pownall’s home. The 7th District police, which preside over the Bustleton neighborhood where Pownall lives, did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did BLM’s Khalif. Our ruling White said protesters rallying outside the home of Pownall, who shot and killed Jones, were engaged in an "illegal occupation." The protesters, which numbered no more than 10, had not applied for a permit. But Philadelphia doesn’t require demonstrations featuring less than 75 people to apply for permits. The protesters were also not blocking the streets or the sidewalks of the neighborhood, actions that would also call for a permit. We rule the claim False.

pomt-05711	"Today, you can't rely on (the retirement fund for public employees), it's not funded."	false	/florida/statements/2012/mar/07/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-state-pension-fund-not-funded/	Gov. Rick Scott made no secret of his distaste for a judge’s decision to overturn a 3 percent cut in state workers’ salaries on March 6, 2012. Lawmakers in 2011 touted the cut as necessary; they said they were diverting the money to shore up the $124 billion pension fund for state and local employees. The change saved the state $1 billion and local governments $600 million, reported the Tampa Bay Times and the Miami Herald. Circuit Judge Jackie Fulford’s decision throws that plan into chaos. She ruled the pay cut an unconstitutional breach of the state's contract with employees and ordered the money returned with interest. Fulford noted in her order that the 3-percent salary reduction did not actually go toward the retirement fund; legislators used it to balance the budget and left $1.2 billion unspent. Her decision didn't sit well with Scott. "This is an example of a judge wanting to write the law. We all know that this is constitutional, there's no question about it," Scott told reporters. "I want to make sure we fix the plan so individuals can actually rely on it. Because today, you can't rely on that plan, it's not funded," he said. "So it's going to have a big impact on our counties, it has a big impact on our state budget. But it's clearly constitutional." We’ve heard alarming things about Florida’s pension fund over the years, but never that it is flatly not funded. PolitiFact Florida wanted to set the record straight on how the Florida Retirement System works. The truth is that Florida’s pension fund is funded. Is it fully funded? No, but that’s not typical for most state pension funds. The most recent data shows the pension’s worth versus what it owes in benefits is 87.5 percent, as of June 30, 2011. So if everyone in the pension system retired at once, there would not be enough money in the retirement system to pay their full benefits. Still, 87 percent isn’t bad compared to most states. The average level is 77 percent. "87 (percent) is a strong funding level, particularly given the difficult financial market over recent years," said Keith Brainard, research director of the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. Scott spokesman Lane Wright said we were nit-picking the governor’s statement and that he obviously just misspoke. Wright pointed us to past stories on the pension from our site and the Tampa Bay Times, where Scott correctly asserts the retirement system is underfunded. What’s more, Wright said, is that Scott’s office for a few months has been occupied by a big chart comparing the pension fund’s liabilities, assets and payments. His graphic correctly shows the plan as funded at 87.5 percent for fiscal year 2010-11. It also shows how that liability has grown since 2007-08. "He’s had that chart there since at least the beginning of January," Wright said. Not long before storing a daily reminder of the liability gap in his office, Scott attempted to address it in his 2011-12 budget proposal. He called for $300 million to go into the retirement system, including an additional $120 million to address the liability on top of fully funding the normal annual contribution. In his response to the judge’s ruling, though, Scott’s warning was stark, saying "I want to make sure we fix the plan so individuals can actually rely on it. Because today, you can't rely on that plan, it's not funded." That sounds really bad to people who are relying on state benefits. The truth is, it's one of the better funded pension plans in the country. If all public employees retired tomorrow, they still get 87.5 percent of what they were owed. We rate his statement False.

pomt-13553	Says in Washington, D.C., Sen. Richard Burr "took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/aug/25/deborah-ross/attack-ad-hits-sen-richard-burr-votes-cut-taxes-mi/	The first television ad from Senate hopeful Deborah Ross, a North Carolina Democrat challenging Republican Sen. Richard Burr, paints Burr as a self-serving politician. It shows Ross talking on the phone with an actor playing Burr, lounging in a posh office. "You took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut your own taxes and raise taxes on working folks," Ross tells the fictional Burr in the ad. A press release announcing the ad was even more direct: "While Burr’s own wealth has tripled since he has been in the Senate, he has voted to raise taxes on the middle-class and working families while cutting them for millionaires like himself." The ad’s claim is a mouthful, but it makes some hefty allegations. We wondered if it was true that Burr became a millionaire in Washington then voted to cut taxes for millionaires like himself. And did he also vote to raise taxes on middle class and working families? Burr’s growing wealth The ad says Burr "took millions from special interests, went (to D.C.) and cashed in." That’s a bit misleading, since special interests can’t give directly to politicians. That’s called bribery, and there’s no evidence Burr has taken bribes. But his campaigns have received millions from special interests. When Burr first ran for Senate in 2004, he received the most PAC contributions of any Senate candidate, according to a News & Observer report. This year, not much has changed. Burr’s campaign is the No. 1 recipient of contributions from the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Through June 30, 82 percent of the $8.7 million he has raised came from political action committees or large individual donors. By comparison, 74 percent of the $3.9 million Ross raised has come from PACs and large donors. Burr’s successful campaigning gives him a congressional salary of $174,000. That salary – plus investments in real estate and the stock market – helped Burr become a millionaire during his two decades in the House and Senate. He served in the House from 1995 to 2005, and in the Senate since 2005. In that time he has made about $3.6 million in pre-tax salary. We don’t know exactly how much he’s worth because of the rules about what liabilities and assets members of Congress do and don’t have to report. Roll Call, which compiles an annual ranking of members of Congress by minimum possible wealth, said Burr was worth a minimum of $1.6 million last year, ranked 44th in the Senate and 152nd overall. He was worth about $500,000 in 2004, when he first ran for Senate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Taxes on the wealthy Ross’ claim about Burr’s record on taxes is nearly identical to a claim made in a 2012 Wisconsin Senate race that PolitiFact rated Half True. Four years have passed, though, and we were curious if there was any new information. Both that previous claim and Ross’ ad cited votes cast in 2011 and 2012 in support of Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget proposals. Neither budget passed. But Ross spokesman Austin Vevurka said the ad specifically talked about what Burr voted to do, not what he has done. And the ad is correct that Burr did vote to cut taxes on wealthy people like himself. Ryan’s plans both years would’ve lowered the tax rates of all the highest income brackets, including Burr’s. Not counting his stocks, in 2012 Burr made $174,000 in Senate salary and owned real estate that brought in income somewhere between $115,002 and $1,050,000, according to his financial disclosure forms. His taxes would’ve dropped substantially had the budget passed, as it would’ve created just two income tax brackets: 10 and 25 percent. The income tax system, at that time and now, has six brackets and reaches nearly 40 percent at the top. Burr’s votes to help his fellow millionaires haven’t all been unsuccessful. In 2012, he and other Senate Republicans blocked discussion on the so-called Buffett Rule, which would’ve raised taxes on wealthy investors. That wasn’t a vote to cut taxes, but it was a vote to keep them at the same level. Taxes on the middle class The question of whether Burr voted to increase taxes on middle class or working people is trickier. That’s because Ryan’s budgets promised to cut income tax deductions and loopholes – but did not provide many specifics about what would be cut and what would remain, leading to speculation. "Depending on which think tank you ask about the Ryan Budget, you will get a different answer," said Burr’s communications director, Becca Watkins. "This is because the Ryan budget suggested tax simplification, but it did not specify how taxes should exactly be changed." Watkins is right. However, Ryan’s budget was clear that it would’ve kept the low tax rates on capital gains, dividends and other investment wealth. As a result, Peter Orszag, a banking executive and former budget wonk under both Bush and Obama, wrote in 2012 that of what remained to be cut, "most of the other big tax breaks — such as the mortgage interest deduction, state and local tax deductibility, and pension and health tax benefits — help the middle class." That same year, an analysis found that households earning between $50,000 and $100,000 would see their taxes increase by $1,358 annually if Ryan’s budget passed, and upper middle class households making between $100,000 and $200,000 would see an increase of $2,681. However, like anything else analyzing the budget, that report had to rely on speculation. It also was commissioned by a Congressional committee led by Democrats. Ross did cite one piece of evidence the previous Half True claim did not – a 2013 study that found tax reforms that Burr voted for that year (which, yet again, failed) would have possibly raised taxes on middle class families. But again, its numbers were speculative and it was done by a liberal think tank. It also acknowledged there could’ve been ways to avoid increasing taxes on the middle class, such as increasing the deficit. Watkins said Burr didn’t think Ryan’s budgets were "perfect," but he feared budgets proposed by Democrats would’ve led to even higher taxes. "To suggest he supports increasing taxes on the middle class is baseless," she said. Our ruling Ross said Burr "took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks." The part about special interest money needs clarification. The part about tax cuts for the wealthy is accurate, but the part about raising taxes on the middle class is purely speculative – it could be right or it could be wrong, and we simply can’t know for sure. The ad’s claims are partially accurate but need additional information, so we rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/da4eedb5-b710-438e-80ce-82fced947a3e	None	Deborah Ross	None	None	None	2016-08-25T17:03:04	2016-08-22	['Washington,_D.C.', 'Richard_Burr']
pomt-12428	"FBI uncovers evidence that 62 million Trump voters are all Russian agents!"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/17/blog-posting/fake-story-about-trump-voters-being-russian-agents/	A satirical story that said every American who voted for Donald Trump works for the Russian government appeared to have started as a parody on a neo-Nazi website. "FBI uncovers evidence that 62 million Trump voters are all Russian agents!" read the headline on a May 15, 2017, post on USPoliticsInfo.com. The post was flagged by Facebook users as possibly being fake, as part of the social media site’s efforts to crack down on fake news. The story is full of absurd details that make it obvious it’s a joke. It said that anonymous FBI sources had revealed the 62 million voters were employed by Russian intelligence (Trump garnered more than 62.9 million votes in the presidential election, almost 2.9 million less than Hillary Clinton). The story also said Wikileaks was run by Vladimir Putin and conservative media personality Alex Jones’ real name was Alexi Jonesov. An unnamed FBI agent further said in the article that "it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box" during the election. The same story or portions of it also appeared on several other websites. Most of the time, these fake news sites share the story without any attribution at all. But after some digging, we found that the original fake post came from the white supremacist website DailyStormer.com. Dated March 28, 2017, the article carries the fake New York Times byline Yuri Rosenbaum. It falsely cited several real officials like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. The story also said Sen. John McCain, R.-Ariz., called for mass arrests and said Trump himself "began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road" when asked about the allegations. We confirmed with DailyStormer.com publisher Andrew Anglin that his site, which occasionally posts satirical stories, was the source of the article. He said it should be obvious the story is not real, no matter where or in what form it appeared. "My readership — and I hope to God the rest of the literate world — is intelligent enough to understand this is a joke," he said via email. "I didn't know people were syndicating it without crediting me, but I don't really care." This fake news story is ludicrous enough that it’s obviously contrived and meant as a joke. Not so obvious are the article’s white supremacist website roots. We rate the statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-05957	"In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/25/barack-obama/have-private-sector-jobs-grown-22-months-best-annu/	EDITOR’S NOTE: Our original Half True rating was based on an interpretation that Obama was crediting his policies for the jobs increase. But we've concluded that he was not making that linkage as strongly as we initially believed and have decided to change the ruling to Mostly True. The original article is archived here. We also wrote an explanation of our reporting and why we changed the rating here. During his State of the Union address on Jan. 24, 2012, President Barack Obama offered some evidence about the nation’s improving economy. He began by urging listeners to "remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren’t, and personal debt that kept piling up. "In 2008, the house of cards collapsed," he continued. "We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn’t afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people’s money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didn’t have the authority to stop the bad behavior. "It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt and left innocent, hard-working Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly four million jobs. And we lost another four million before our policies were in full effect. "Those are the facts. But so are these. In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we’ve agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like that never happens again. "The state of our union is getting stronger. And we’ve come too far to turn back now. As long as I’m president, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum." We decided to look specifically at Obama’s claim that "in the last 22 months, businesses have created more than three million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005." We checked Obama’s claim by using data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency responsible for compiling employment data. We found that the U.S. economy has seen 22 consecutive months of private-sector job growth, beginning in Feb. 2010. During that 22-month period, the number of jobs grew by almost 3.16 million, or about 143,000 per month. We should note that there has also been a job-growth streak for all jobs in the economy -- not just in the private sector -- but this run of positive jobs numbers has been shorter since job losses in the government sector have offset gains in the private sector for much of that time. If you include both private-sector and government jobs, the economy has seen increases in total jobs for 15 straight months, not 22. But since this isn’t what Obama said, we won’t consider this in our ruling. As for whether 2011 was the best job-producing year since 2005, he’s right if you’re counting private-sector jobs, and slightly off if you’re counting all jobs. In 2011, the number of private-sector jobs rose by about 1.83 million (if you count from the January amount to the December amount) or 1.92 million (if you count from December to December). Either way, the increase in 2011 represented the highest one-year total since 2005, when the number of private-sector jobs increased by either 2.22 million or 2.31 million, depending on the time period used. If you use total jobs, the increase in 2011 was the biggest since 2006, not 2005. But here too, that’s not the measure Obama used, so we won’t consider it in our rating. Finally, there's another dimension. In his remarks, Obama described the damage to the economy, including losing millions of jobs "before our policies were in full effect." Then he describes the subsequent job increases. This suggests that he’s taking a degree of credit for the job growth, which runs counter to the reality that no mayor or governor or president deserves all the blame or all the credit for changes in employment. Our ruling Obama is correct on the numbers. By mentioning his policies, he's making a modest linkage that they deserve credit for the improvement when economists say they are just one factor. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-01-25T11:25:49	2012-01-24	['None']
pomt-05963	Says he eliminated an EPA rule that treated spilled milk like it was oil.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-he-eliminated-epa-rule-treating-/	In making the case for sensible federal regulations, President Barack Obama in his State of the Union address pointed to a rule that he eliminated because it was about as antiquated as a milkmaid. "We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill – because milk was somehow classified as an oil," Obama said in the Jan. 24, 2012, speech. Absurd as it may sound, the Environmental Protection Agency has long regulated milk the same way it does petroleum because of milk’s butter fat content. Vegetable oils fall in the same category. According to the EPA’s website, milk has been regulated under the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure program since 1973, when the Clean Water Act took effect. The law was passed by Congress the preceding year over the veto of President Richard Nixon. The EPA site says "since the SPCC rule became law in 1973, all kinds of oils including petroleum and edible oils (such as animal fats and vegetable oils) have been considered oils. This is because the SPCC rule gets its definition of ‘oil’ from the Clean Water Act." In February 2009, the EPA announced that it intended to exclude milk and dairy farms from the spill rules governing oil products. Here’s what the announcement said: "EPA proposes to exempt milk containers and associated piping and appurtenances from the SPCC requirements provided they are constructed according to the current applicable 3-A Sanitary Standards, and are subject to the current applicable Grade "A" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance," or similar state laws. In simple English, that means large milk storage containers will no longer have to meet the EPA’s oil spill rules, provided storage tanks meet pasteurization laws. The change took effect in April 2011. "EPA determined that this unintended result of the current regulations – which were designed to prevent oil spill damage to inland waters and shorelines – placed unjustifiable burdens on dairy farmers," the agency said in a press release. We’re not addressing Obama’s projection of costs of $10,000 to some farmers, but we note that the EPA estimated that the rule change would save the industry $140 million a year. Our ruling Obama said his administration got rid of a rule that regulated milk in the same manner as oil, as an environmental hazard when spilled. The original regulation had been in effect since 1973, and the EPA under Obama moooooooved it out in April 2011. We rate the claim True.

pomt-15189	"There's not a single, solitary example that" signing the bill to end Glass-Steagall "had anything to do with the financial crash."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/19/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-glass-steagall-had-nothing-do-financi/	Recently, activists have shown up at Hillary Clinton’s campaign events to urge her to bring back Glass-Steagall. What is Glass-Steagall? It’s the Depression-era bank regulation that kept different types of financial institutions separate; then-President Bill Clinton signed legislation reversing it in 1999. Some Glass-Steagall supporters argue that its demise led to the 2007 financial crisis, and some Democrats have put a good amount of effort into restoring it -- such as presidential candidates Martin O’Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. But Hillary Clinton won't pledge to reinstate Glass-Steagall if she becomes president. And Bill Clinton says criticism over the law’s repeal is unfounded. "Look at all the grief I got for signing the bill that ended Glass-Steagall," Bill Clinton said in an interview with Inc. magazine for its September issue. "There's not a single, solitary example that it had anything to do with the financial crash." Given the significant attention on Glass-Steagall among Democrats, we wondered if it’s true that it didn’t have "anything to do with the financial crash." Our research shows the law’s demise was part of a broad deregulatory push that greatly contributed to the financial crisis. But Clinton has a point that a direct line from the 1999 repeal to the market crash in 2007-08 is hard to identify. Too big to fail Congress passed Glass-Steagall in 1933, in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash that led to the Great Depression. The law kept commercial banks (where customers deposit money and take out loans) separate from investment firms (which hold securities and make investments) -- more colloquially, the law separated Main Street from Wall Street. Some experts and lawmakers want to keep these kinds of activities separate, because they’re worried that merging them could put the public’s money at risk. Here’s a simple hypothetical: A bank merges with an investment firm to create a massive company. The investment side makes a huge bet on an investment that fails big time, so the commercial bank side’s money -- money individuals have deposited for safe-keeping -- could be at risk. Because those deposits are federally insured, it might require a government bailout. (Think too-big-to-fail.) Supporters of the law say keeping these activities separate prevents this kind of domino effect. Is this what caused the most recent financial crisis? There’s plenty of room for debate here, given that there isn’t a single what-caused-the-crisis narrative that every economist accepts. It’s safe to say, though, that there is not a prominent group of economists who argue "but for the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall, the crisis would not have happened." Lawrence White, an economist at New York University, doesn’t see Glass-Steagall playing any role in the financial crisis whatsoever. He pointed to the crisis’ biggest culprits: firms such as Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs and AIG, to name a few. He added that much of the crisis hinged on activity by these institutions that would have been possible with or without Glass-Steagall, such as mass investment in notoriously bad mortgage loans. (Clinton’s staff linked us to commentary by several other experts who share White’s view.) We also contacted Barry Ritholtz, a wealth management expert and commentator, who said Glass-Steagall would have done nothing to stop the financial crisis, but not having it made the crisis worse. It encouraged banks to get bigger and to take on riskier investments, so the ripple effects of the crisis were bigger than they would have been otherwise, he said, adding that it wasn’t just the headline-making banks that struggled. The extent over Glass-Steagall’s effect on the financial crisis is a topic on which reasonable people can disagree. More so in Clinton’s favor is the fact that Glass-Steagall was a shadow of its former self by the time 1999 rolled around. Deregulating like it’s 1999 A few decades out from the Depression, starting in earnest in the 1970s, there was a push to roll back financial regulations that continued throughout the administrations of former presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. As part of that movement, banks and lawmakers steadily chipped away at Glass-Steagall and took advantage of loopholes. Banks were engaging in the kinds of activity Glass-Steagall was intended to stop even though the law was still on the books. By the time Clinton signed the Financial Services Modernization Act, commonly known as Gramm-Leach-Bliley, repealing the key components of Glass-Steagall in 1999, the regulation was nearly toothless. The law was simply catching up to what the market had already accomplished in the previous 10 to 15 years, said Kathleen Day, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University and an expert in financial crises. Take for example the poster child of the end of Glass-Steagall: The merger of Citicorp, a bank, and Travelers Group, a financial conglomerate, was announced in 1998 before Glass-Steagall was repealed. Even though this was the exact type of merger Glass-Steagall was intended to halt, the financial industry did not see many obstacles for the creation of Citigroup. "Citigroup and others wanted and got the repeal of Glass-Steagall in order to validate what they had already been allowed to do," said Simon Johnson, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. So the overall, decades-in-the-making decline of Glass-Steagall might have contributed to the financial crisis and its fallout, as it was part of the deregulatory push. But Clinton putting pen-to-paper on the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 probably didn’t make any meaningful difference. But Clinton’s hands aren’t clean of the financial crisis, because his administration played no small part in the longer term deregulatory trend. Clinton and his administration did not make an earnest attempt to maintain oversight over the big, hybrid banks created by the demise of Glass-Steagall, Day said. Additionally, the administration’s firm decision not to regulate other aspects of the financial market played a meaningful role in the crisis -- for example, the absence of regulations regarding over-the-counter derivatives, which were becoming increasingly prevalent, despite internal warnings. Clinton’s claim "might be technically true, but it’s a sin of omission," Day said. Our ruling Clinton said, "There's not a single, solitary example that" signing the bill to end Glass-Steagall "had anything to do with the financial crash." By focusing on the bill that officially repealed Glass-Steagall, Clinton's statement ignores the fact that the demise of Glass-Steagall took place over decades, amid a deregulatory push in which the Clinton administration played a role. By the time the law to repeal hit his desk, Glass-Steagall had been whittled down so much that it wasn’t very meaningful. It's a matter of debate how much of a role the overall demise of Glass-Steagall had in causing the financial crisis, but we couldn't find any economists who argue that the regulation was the sole linchpin keeping the financial system stable until its official repeal in 1999. Overall, we rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2015-08-19T17:22:43	2015-08-11	['None']

pomt-08347	As CEO of WWE, Linda McMahon "was caught tipping off a ringside physician" about a federal investigation into illegally distributing steroids to wrestlers.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/27/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/dscc-claims-linda-mcmahon-tipped-ringside-physicia/	U.S. Senate candidate Linda McMahon's experience as co-founder, along with her husband Vince, of World Wrestling Entertainment has proved to be a double-edged sword on the campaign trail in Connecticut. While McMahon often touts her experience running the pro wrestling empire to boost her real-world business cred, it also has left her open to accusations that the WWE uses sexist story lines and that there is rampant steroid abuse by some wrestlers. In the final week of the race -- which pits Republican McMahon against Democrat Richard Blumenthal -- the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has begun airing an attack ad that attempts to body-slam McMahon for tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into the illegal distribution of steroids to some of the WWE's wrestlers. "Read this," a female narrator begins, as a legal document scrolls in the background. "It's a memo Linda McMahon wrote. Evidence in a federal trial against her company. McMahon was caught tipping off a ringside physician who was later accused of hiding evidence. It didn't work. McMahon's ringside doctor was convicted of illegally distributing steroids to her workers. That's Linda McMahon. A bad CEO. A worse senator." The memo in question -- marked "CONFIDENTIAL INTEROFFICE MEMO" -- was sent on Dec. 1, 1989, by Linda McMahon to Pat Patterson, a fellow executive at Titan Sports, the parent company of what was then the World Wrestling Federation. It became part of the public record as an exhibit in a steroids-related case against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports in the early 1990s. But the story actually goes back a little further, to an investigation into ringside doctor George T. Zahorian for distributing steroids to some of the WWF's wrestlers. As the 1989 memo from Linda McMahon explains, a government official let slip at a fundraising event that "the State of Pennsylvania is probably going to launch an investigation into the use of all illegal drugs including steroids." "In addition," McMahon wrote, "this fellow mentioned that he was aware of Dr. Zahorian and his relationship with WWF." Zahorian was actually assigned throughout the 1980s to attend WWF exhibitions in Pennsylvania by the Pennsylvania Athletic Commission. But following deregulation in 1989, promoters like the WWF were required to hire their own licensed physicians to be present at events. Zahorian was scheduled to be the doctor on hand at an upcoming event in Hershey, Pa., but Linda McMahon's memo makes clear the WWF wanted to distance itself from him. "Although you and I discussed before about continuing to have Zahorian at our events as the doctor on call, I think that is now not a good idea," McMahon wrote in the memo. "Vince agreed, and would like for you to call Zahorian and tell him not to come to any more of our events and to also clue him in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking." It's that last part, telling Patterson to "clue him in" about a possible steroids investigation, that forms the basis for the claim in the campaign ad. In 1991, Zahorian was charged with distributing steroids to a number of WWF wrestlers (none of whom were charged because, at the time, it was not a federal crime to use steroids, only to distribute them). He was convicted and sentenced to three years in federal prison. But that wasn't the end of the matter. In the wake of the Zahorian indictment, federal investigators opened a wide-reaching steroids investigation into the WWF. And in 1992, the government filed an indictment against Vince McMahon and Titan Sports, alleging they conspired to "unlawfully provide WWF wrestling performers with steroids to enhance their size and musculature, and thereby to increase the ticket sales for WWF exhibitions and the profits to Titan and McMahon." In its indictment, prosecutors alleged Titan officials learned of a federal investigation into Zahorian's activities and warned him about it. Linda McMahon's memo was entered in the case as Exhibit #2. According to the indictment, shortly after the memo was sent, "a Titan executive known to the Grand Jury had a telephone conversation with Zahorian and directed him to destroy any records of Zahorian's contact with WWF or WWF wrestling personnel." It was later learned from one of Zahorian's attorneys that after Zahorian got the phone call warning him about the investigation, he shipped files on wrestlers to his attorney's office (so they were not part of the evidence seized when investigators raided his office). But according to longtime WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt, the files were never destroyed and were later made available to prosecutors. "Dr. Zahorian didn't destroy anything," McDevitt said. "It was all given to the government." In any event, the government's case against Titan and Vince McMahon failed miserably. Several counts were tossed before the case even went to the jury -- including two counts alleging that Vince McMahon and the company distributed steroids to wrestlers such as Terry Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan), because the judge said prosecutors failed to establish that the alleged conspiracy occurred in the jurisdiction of the New York court where the case was filed. And on the one remaining count, that they had distributed mislabeled anabolic steroids, both Vince McMahon and the company were acquitted. In other words, none of the charges ever stuck. In an extensive story about the issue in Connecticut's The Day, reporter Ted Mann asked McMahon about the memo. "I don't pretend to remember to go back, to revisit all the aspects of that case," McMahon told The Day. "It has been tried, acquitted and done with, and WWE has evolved its total health and wellness policy over the years, and I'm sure will continue to evolve." According to the story: When asked if her decision to notify Zahorian had led him to destroy records that might have more thoroughly documented his sale of steroids to WWF wrestlers — as prosecutors in 1994 alleged — McMahon's reply was curt. "I can't speak to any of that,' she said. "I have no idea." WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt said he believes the DSCC ad is misleading, because it suggests by innuendo that Linda McMahon sought to obstruct the government's investigation. "There were never any charges against Linda McMahon of any kind," McDevitt said. "There was never any charge of obstruction of justice against anybody." An indictment is nothing more than an allegation, McDevitt said, and the case ended without a conviction against anyone on anything. "You can only gain an acquittal in this country," McDevitt said. "That's all you can do." Everyone agrees Linda McMahon was never charged with or convicted of anything, including obstruction of justice. But the ad from the DSCC doesn't say she was. The ad accuses McMahon of tipping off a ringside physician about a federal investigation into distributing steroids to their wrestlers. How else could one interpret Linda McMahon's direction in the 1989 memo "to also clue him (Zahorian) in on any action that the Justice Department is thinking of taking." It's also true that a government indictment later alleged that, after getting a call from a Titan employee tipping him off to the investigation, Zahorian tried to hide evidence at his attorney's office. But whether Zahhorian tried to "hide" evidence may or may not be true. Zahorian sent files to his attorney, but they were not destroyed, and according to WWE's attorney, they were later made available to investigators. Nothing in Linda McMahon's memo suggests she directed the employee to tell Zahorian to hide or destroy evidence. But again, the ad doesn't say she did. The ad merely says she tipped off the ringside physician about an investigation. She did, according to her own memo. And Zahorian was later convicted of distributing steroids to some of her WWF wrestlers. We rate the ad True.

pomt-03417	A private school tax break in the Wisconsin state budget is "the most generous in the nation."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jun/27/tony-evers/wisconsins-new-private-school-tax-break-most-gener/	When it comes to taxpayer support of private schools in Wisconsin, most of the controversy over the 2013-’15 state budget centered on a limited expansion of the voucher program. But what could really set Wisconsin apart is a lesser known provision of the budget, which Gov. Scott Walker plans to sign into law on June 30, 2013. The provision would give parents, regardless of income, a state income tax deduction of up to $10,000 for sending a child to private school. The measure drew the ire of state schools superintendent Tony Evers, who voiced his objections on the June 23, 2013 edition of "Upfront with Mike Gousha," which airs on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee. "The Legislature expanded the vouchers across the state of Wisconsin. Now they’ve doubled down and decided, well, we’re going to give a tax break to parents that send their kids to private and parochial schools. And it’s going to cost $30 million in one year, and, of course, the next biennium it will be at least double of that," Evers said in the web-only portion of the show. "So, it's taking money out of the system that would normally go to public schools -- and it's the most generous in the nation. If you and I were billionaires and were sending our kids to high-tuition high schools, we would get, as billionaires, get the tax credits for that. It's obviously not progressive and it's going to hurt our public schools." There are plenty of opinions on both sides over the merits of a private school tax break. But would Wisconsin’s tax break be the most generous in the nation? The proposal In refashioning Walker’s initial budget proposal, the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee voted June 5, 2013 to add the tax deduction. As Evers indicated, taxpayers would pay $30 million per year less in income taxes. Parents of the nearly 100,000 students in private schools could get an income tax deduction of up to $4,000 for tuition paid for each kindergarten through eighth-grade student and up to $10,000 for each high school student. For a typical family, according to a rough calculation by the Legislature's nonpartisan budget office, the deduction would result in a tax cut of $240 for each kindergarten through eighth-grade student and $600 for each high school student. Evers’ evidence To back Evers' claim, Evers spokesman John Johnson cited a June 2013 article in Governing magazine. The article cited the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education reform think tank, in saying that only a handful of states offer tax breaks for private school. Those tax breaks, the Governing article stated, are "much less generous" than Wisconsin’s plan. We asked the Fordham Institute’s school choice analyst, Adam Emerson, about that. He said Wisconsin's $10,000 maximum is higher than any other state's. But he referred us to the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, a conservative organization founded by the late Milton Friedman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, for more details. The Wisconsin Budget Project also based its analysis of the Wisconsin tax break on Friedman Foundation figures. The figures include apples and oranges. Some states, like Wisconsin, offer a tax deduction, which reduces the amount of income you pay taxes on; but others offer a credit, which reduces the amount of taxes you owe. Here’s a summary: State Income limit to qualify for tax credit or deduction Maximum tax credit or deduction Illinois None Credit: $500/family Indiana None Deduction: $1,000/child Iowa None Credit: $250/child Louisiana None Deduction: $5,000/child Minnesota* None/$37,500 $2,500/$1,000 Wisconsin None Deduction: $4,000/child for K-8; $10,000 for high school *There is no income limit to qualify for Minnesota’s tax deduction, which is up to $1,625 per child in grades K-6 and $2,500 per child in grades 7-12. But for its tax credit, which is worth a maximum of $1,000, there is an income limit of $37,500 for one child (and the limit goes up for more children). (Alabama also offers a tax credit, up to $3,500 per student, but it’s available only to students who transfer to a private school from a "failing" public school. And North Carolina offers a credit of up to $6,000 per student, but only for students with disabilities.) What’s clear from the chart is Wisconsin’s maximum deduction -- $10,000 for a student attending a private high school -- far exceeds the deductions in other states. However, Louisiana's $5,000 maximum deduction for students in kindergarten through eighth grade exceeds Wisconsin's $4,000 deduction. We wondered about the states offering tax credits. The Friedman Foundation ran some more data. Wisconsin’s $10,000 maximum tax deduction would result in a maximum tax cut, for families with incomes above $155,000, of $775. That's higher than the maximum credits offered by Illinois and Iowa, but less than Minnesota’s maximum credit of $1,000. However, there's no income limit for claiming the Wisconsin tax deduction, whereas Minnesota's credit is only for people earning less than $37,500. Moreover, Minnesota's credit applies only to education expenses other than tuition; Wisconsin's deduction applies to tuition which, of course, is the largest private school expense. All of which makes the point that, depending on a family's income, the number and ages of their children, and the income tax rates in their state, the benefit to them of a state’s private school tax break can vary widely. Our rating Evers said a private school tax break in the Wisconsin state budget would be "the most generous in the nation." It's among the most generous -- for parents with multiple children attending a private high school, for example. But depending on various factors, it's not necessarily more generous than other states. We rate Evers’ statement Half True.	None	Tony Evers	None	None	None	2013-06-27T20:29:41	2013-06-23	['Wisconsin']

That’s the headline of a May 8 article on a website that calls itself New York Evening News. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. You can read more about our partnership with Facebook here. "Head of Catholic Church says those who own weapons are ‘hypocrites,’ not Christians," the article said. "As pressure mounts to tear up the U.S. Constitution once and for all, Pope Francis has added to the sentiment by declaring that gun owners can no longer call themselves Christian." The link for the full text serves up a few more details on a separate website that paraphrases the pope saying that "when people claim to follow the teachings of Christ but also support gun ownership, it leads to a bit of distrust." This is all a bit of a mashup of remarks the pope made three years ago in Turin, Italy, in 2015, when he was at a rally of thousands of young people. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Perhaps most important, the pope wasn’t talking about gun owners. He was talking about war, trust and politics. And he singled out the weapons industry. "People, managers, businessmen who call themselves Christian and they manufacture weapons, that leads to a bit of distrust, doesn’t it?" he said, as reported by Reuters. Notice that he didn’t mention gun owners. That was the invention of the web article. The pope pulls no punches when he talks about war and arms makers. In his 2015 address to Congress, he urged lawmakers to work to "end the many armed conflicts throughout our world." And he added, "Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money: money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood." The New York Evening News article had the pope talking about gun owners when he wasn’t, and gun makers specifically when he was talking about the arms trade in general. Plus, it made it sound as though he was speaking recently and in the context of the current debate over guns after the shootings in Parkland, Fla., when in reality, his speech was three years old. It’s just another example of fake news writers shooting from the hip. We rate the headline Pants on Fire!

pomt-07337	The Obama administration increased the deportation of illegal immigrants convicted of crimes by 70 percent.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/11/barack-obama/obama-says-deportation-criminals-70-percent-under-/	In a speech on immigration reform in El Paso, Texas, President Barack Obama said his administration has focused on deporting illegal immigrants convicted of crimes. "Beyond the border, we’re going after employers who knowingly exploit people and break the law," Obama said in the speech on May 10, 2011. "And we are deporting those who are here illegally. And that’s a tough issue. It’s a source of controversy. "But I want to emphasize we’re not doing it haphazardly. We’re focusing our limited resources and people on violent offenders and people convicted of crimes -- not just families, not just folks who are just looking to scrape together an income. And as a result, we’ve increased the removal of criminals by 70 percent." Obama's claim that under his administration, deportation of criminals increased by 70 percent suggests a significant shift in policy, so we decided to check it out. According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security, the number of illegal immigrants "removed" rose about 6 percent -- from 369,221 to 392,862 -- between the end of September 2008 (four months before Obama took office) and the end of September 2010. But a much larger percentage of those deported were convicted criminals. In 2008, 31 percent were criminals; but by 2010, the percentage jumped to 50 percent. The raw number of convicted criminals who were deported went from 114,415 in 2008 to 195,772 in 2010. That's 71 percent. So that squares with Obama's claim. Data for the first half of the 2011 fiscal year (which began at the end of September) suggests that trend is continuing, with about 52 percent of the deportations involving convicted criminals. In an Oct. 6, 2010, press release, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the numbers reflect the administration's "prioritizing the identification and removal of criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety." "Our approach has yielded historic results, removing more convicted criminal aliens than ever before and issuing more financial sanctions on employers who knowingly and repeatedly violate immigration laws than during the entire previous administration," Napolitano said. Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA, a group that favors reducing immigration into the United States, said it's true that the deportation rate, particularly deportation of convicted criminals, has been higher under Obama. "My sense is that Obama deserves credit, for all the complaints about him, that he has done maybe a little better than Bush on deportations," Beck said. "I think the main context, though, is that the amount of deportations under Bush was rather small." And even under Obama, Beck said, the administration is talking about fewer than 400,000 deportations in a country with an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants. DHS statistics show that under Bush, overall deportations more than tripled between 2001 and 2008 -- going from 116,782 to 369,221. But in the latter part of Bush's presidency, the biggest jump was in the deportation of illegal immigrants who were were not convicted criminals. During the eight years of Bush's presidency, deportation of convicted criminals rose from 71,079 in 2001 to 114,415 in 2008. That's a 61 percent increase over eight years. In the first two years under Obama, the data suggest a policy shift toward prioritizing the deportation of convicted criminals. And Obama is correct that there has been a 70 percent increase.

pomt-00884	"Black people are eight times more likely to be arrested than white people" in Madison.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/09/young-gifted-and-black-coalition/madison-black-adults-are-8-times-more-likely-white/	Two months before the fatal police shooting of an African-American man in Madison, an activist group called the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition decried what it called "the violence of heavy policing and arrest-rate disparities in Madison." In an open letter issued Jan. 9, 2015, the Madison-based group called on Police Chief Mike Koval to "dramatically reduce the number of police contacts with black people and poor people," and it made this claim: "Given that the arrest rate shows that black people are eight times more likely to be arrested than white people, we demand that disparity cut in half by the end of 2015." In the wake of the March 6, 2015 shooting death of 19-year-old Tony T. Robinson Jr., we thought we would take a look at the claim, which was repeated by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) three days after the shooting. Robinson case According to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news reports: Madison police were called shortly before 6:30 p.m. when Robinson started jumping in front of cars on Williamson Street on Madison’s east side. Then in swift succession, Robinson apparently hit a friend and, after entering a house, tried to strangle someone else. A police officer entered the home, got into a struggle with Robinson and shot him. Robinson was not armed. The officer was injured, but did not need to be hospitalized. The shooting quickly drew comparisons by some with other recent high-profile killings by police of black men across the country: Dontre Hamilton at Red Arrow Park in Milwaukee, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. and Eric Garner in New York City. Protests followed Robinson’s death. One protest, three days after the shooting, drew more than 1,000 people to the State Capitol. Nearly a year before he was killed, on April 25, 2014, Robinson, then 18, was arrested with three other people in connection with an armed home invasion at a Madison apartment. He pleaded guilty to felony armed robbery and received three years of probation. The officer who shot Robinson, Matt Kenny, who is white, shot and killed a 48-year-old white man in the line of duty on July 15, 2007, after the man pointed what turned out to be a pellet gun at Kenny. The officer did not know the weapon was a pellet gun, and the district attorney cleared Kenny. The claim The Young, Gifted and Black Coalition based its claim on an October 2013 report on racial disparities in Dane County. So, although the claim was about Madison, the report examined the larger surrounding area. The report was done by the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a Madison-based liberal advocacy group whose research is respected. The report said that in 2012, African-American adults were arrested in Dane County at a rate more than eight times that of whites. Here are the adult arrest rates per 1,000 adults in 2012: Black Adults White Adults Ratio of black to white Dane County 295 36 8.19 Wisconsin 230 53 4.34 United States 82 33 2.48 Erica Nelson, the author of the report, told us the figures were developed from an unpublished report of the state Office of Justice Assistance. She said she is working on developing figures strictly for Madison, rather than Dane County, but wouldn’t speculate on how the Madison rate might differ from the county rate. When the coalition first made its claim in the open letter, the police chief responded in a blog post, saying: "I have always agreed that the harmful impacts of racial disparity in Dane County are not in dispute. An education system that has underserved people of color, high rates of unemployment and underemployment, a lack of suitable guardians or mentors for our youth (leading to greater gang involvement), challenged neighborhoods and a criminal justice system that is fraught with inadequacies are but a few of the drivers that contribute to the malaise we face as a community." But, he added: "Based on the diversity and the strength of character personified in our workforce, the training which is second to none and ever-striving for best practices, coupled with checks-and-balances that serve to bring rogue cops or practices to the light of day, I will not buy into the naive supposition that our community's disparity issues are largely owing to a pervasive pattern of systemic racism by MPD." When we asked Koval about the eight times higher claim, he responded by email through a spokesman, saying that in his initial response to the open letter "I was not disputing the fact that there are racial disparities; I dispute the fact that I have ‘rogue’ cops or policies/procedures which are intrinsically racist. There is no doubt but that the police should be mindful of our role as the gatekeepers to the criminal justice system, and therefore ‘own’ part of this problem." The chief also noted that the figures from the report are for all of Dane County, not just Madison, which "includes big bedroom communities" such as Fitchburg and Sun Prairie. Koval said he has not seen any figures for only Madison. Our rating The Young, Gifted and Black Coalition said "black people are eight times more likely to be arrested than white people" in Madison. A report the coalition relies on says that in 2012, the arrest rate for black adults was eight times higher than for white adults. However, the figures were for all of Dane County, not merely for Madison, the county’s largest city. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page. Note: After we published this item, the author of the research report cited above said she generated new figures strictly for the City of Madison, rather than Dane County, and provided them to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Erica Nelson said that based on a preliminary review of the Madison Police Department’s 2013 annual report, black adults are 10.9 times more likely than white adults to be arrested in Madison.

pomt-09243	Says federal law enforcement officers cut off questioning of the Christmas Day underwear bomber by giving him a Miranda warning after 30 minutes of questioning.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/10/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-says-us-only-questioned-underwear-bomber-/	The government's questioning of two accused terrorists -- Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who is accused of trying to bomb an airliner on Christmas Day 2009 using explosives sewn into his underwear, and Faisal Shahzad, who is being held for the failed Times Square bombing on May 1, 2010 -- has prompted critics to say the Obama administration is too soft on the terrorists and overly concerned with their Miranda rights. On the ABC News program This Week, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani joined many of his fellow Republicans in questioning the wisdom of reading the Miranda warning to suspected terrorists. Those warnings, which stem from the 1966 Supreme Court decision Miranda vs. Arizona, inform suspects in police custody that they have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney. Supporters say that the warnings protect suspects from being coerced to incriminate themselves. But critics have argued that such warnings can prompt an accused terrorist to stop divulging information. In an interview with This Week host Jake Tapper, Giuliani -- a federal prosecutor in the 1980s and who served as mayor during and immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- described himself as someone who has "administered Miranda warnings probably 1,000 times." He argued that "it doesn't make sense to interrupt a terrorist in the middle of his confessing and talking to you." As an example of the risks, Giuliani cited the case of Abdulmutallab, the Christmas Day bombing suspect. "Giving him a warning after -- after 30 minutes makes no sense," Giuliani said. "It makes no sense to do that. So, sure, it may work sometimes; it may not work other times. It's not the best policy to follow. And so far, two in a row, we've gotten lucky. So let's not rely on luck. Let's rely on solid policy." At that point, Tapper interjected. "My understanding, during the Abdulmutallab incident, is that -- is that actually after about 50 minutes they had to take him to get medical care, and that's why he stopped talking then, because he actually -- his life was in danger. But be that as it may, I hear the point you're making." It's worth noting that earlier in the conversation, Giuliani offered a similar, but slightly different characterization of Abdulmutallab's questioning, saying, "to cut it off after 30 or 40 minutes like they did in Detroit on Christmas Day ... doesn't make much sense." We e-mailed Giuliani's office but did not get a reply. We'll steer clear of the question of whether it's smart to offer Miranda warnings to terrorist suspects, because that's an opinion. But because Tapper raised a question of whether Giuliani was correct, we thought it would be worthwhile to sort out whether the former mayor's account is accurate. Right off the bat, we should acknowledge that we are hamstrung somewhat in evaluating this case independently, because the only information on Abdulmutallab's interrogation comes from the Obama administration, which is not a neutral party -- it is playing defense against Republican critics. Also, the administration's accounts of the episode came from federal officials who were not named in media accounts, although Attorney General Eric Holder did not dispute them when he testified before a House subcommittee and Republican senators have referred to the administration's timetable in a bill. That said, the administration's description of the interrogation of Abdulmutallab has been consistent on two key points: that it lasted for about 50 minutes, and that it was interrupted for medical reasons. (While the bomb in his underwear did not explode, it did catch fire, and he experienced serious burns to his groin and legs.) There is broad agreement that Abdulmutallab's pre-Miranda questioning was allowable under what is known as the "public safety exception." The exception was outlined in the 1984 Supreme Court decision in New York vs. Quarles. The court ruled that law enforcement officers may "ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for the public safety" before they administer a Miranda warning to a suspect in custody. The media accounts have been largely consistent. Here's one timeline assembled by the Washington Post from information "provided by administration officials, interviews and past briefings for the media": • "12:03 p.m.: The plane lands, and U.S. customs agents come aboard and arrest Abdulmutallab. After holding him in a special room, officials decide at 12:45 to take Abdulmutallab to the University of Michigan hospital for emergency treatment of his second- and third-degree burns. While the suspect's burns are being treated, the FBI's Detroit special agent in charge picks two agents to carry out the initial questioning of Abdulmutallab. One of the two is a veteran counterintelligence agent with experience in Iraq and Afghanistan; the other is a specialist in bomb material. • "2 p.m.: FBI agents arrive at the hospital and discuss Abdulmutallab's physical and mental state with doctors treating him. • "3:30 p.m.: Agents begin interrogating Abdulmutallab under rules that permit questioning about immediate threats to U.S. security without the reading of Miranda rights. The questions concern whether other bombs were on the plane, whether Abdulmutallab had co-conspirators and whether there were plans for other attacks. 'It's to take advantage of the shock of arrest,' said one law enforcement official. The interrogation produced some useful intelligence, according to this and other officials. After 50 minutes FBI agents end the questioning 'when doctors need to take him in for additional treatment because his medical condition has deteriorated,' according to the chronology." Holder, in testimony before a House Appropriations subcommittee on March 16, confirmed the 50-minute interrogation while responding to criticism from lawmakers. He said, "That's a fairly long period of time. Certainly, not as long as what has happened subsequent to -- subsequent to that. But if you look at the report of interview that was gotten from him in that 50 minutes, hour, there was a pretty substantial amount of information that was got from him ... that proved to be actionable, that proved to be timely, and that continues to be, at least in some ways, the basis for a lot of the cooperation that he ... has shared with us." In addition, a Senate resolution sponsored by seven Republicans relies on the same timetable, saying that "local agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) interrogated Abdulmutallab for 50 minutes, during which time Abdulmutallab disclosed information concerning his training in Yemen and the operation of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula" and that "after 50 minutes, the FBI stopped its interrogation of Abdulmutallab, agreeing to continue the interrogation after he received medical attention for the burns on his legs and groin caused by the failed bomb he had sewn in his underwear." What is less certain -- and relevant to Giuliani's larger point -- is whether federal officials read Abdulmutallab the Miranda warning before it was clear that he would stop cooperating, or whether they Mirandized him only because he already had ceased to cooperate. The Senate Republican resolution agrees with Giuliani that the FBI acted first to read Abdulmutallab his rights, "at which point Abdulmutallab stopped divulging information and remained silent." A Jan. 24, 2010, Associated Press report, based on "a series of interviews" with federal officials, said that as Abdulmutallab was undergoing surgery, FBI headquarters dispatched a "clean team" to the hospital -- a new team of interrogators who would start the questioning anew, untainted by any pre-Miranda contact with the suspect. This is essentially a prosecutorial hedge against a subsequent adverse ruling by a judge to exclude information gathered without a proper Miranda warning. Information gathered by this "clean team" would likely be admissible in court even if the fruits of the first interrogation were thrown out. The AP reported that ultimately, "the 'clean team' of interrogators did not pry more revelations from the suspect. Having rested and received more extensive medical treatment, Abdulmutallab was told of his right to remain silent and right to have an attorney. He remained silent." This suggests that Abdulmutallab was Mirandized first, then stopped talking. In addition, having the clean team come to interrogate Abdulmutallab without Mirandizing him would defeat the purpose of the clean team -- which is to have an interrogation without any lingering threat of Miranda problems. On the other hand, a subsequent account -- the Post's, published on Feb. 15 -- said that "Abdulmutallab 'had begun to wind down' and 'gave indications he was going to stop talking'" even before going into his four-hour surgery, according to a law enforcement official who spoke to the Post anonymously. When the clean team arrived, according to the Post, he "refused to answer their questions and "acted like a jihadi." It was then that he was read his Miranda rights. To recap: There is some truth to Giuliani's claim. He is right that after the initial questioning, federal authorities stopped interrogating Abdulmutallab and then, ultimately, read him his Miranda rights. But Giuliani implied that authorities stopped the questioning in order to Mirandize him. Congressional hearings and news accounts indicate that the questioning went longer than Giuliani claimed -- 50 minutes rather than 30 -- and that it was interrupted because he needed medical treatment. After the treatment, he was read his rights, although the precise sequence of events isn't clear. We find Giuliani's claim Half True.

pomt-12660	Wealthy foreigners can obtain visas through a special program, but only a small number "invest in true high-unemployment areas. Almost every other EB-5 project uses gerrymandering to qualify as distressed."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/21/patrick-leahy/leahy-eb-5-visas/	Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy has called out an immigrant investor program as flawed and running counter to its intended purposes. "The EB-5 program … was designed to bring jobs to underserved rural and urban communities. And for some time it did just that. But the program has strayed from these goals. It's a magnet for fraud. Security violations are common," Leahy said as a witness during a House Judiciary Committee hearing. "And the incentives that Congress created to promote investment in distressed areas had become obsolete due to economic gerrymandering." The Vermont senator offered some figures to back his claims. "Only 3 percent of EB-5 investors now invest in rural areas … Less than 10 percent invest in true high-unemployment areas. Almost every other EB-5 project uses gerrymandering to qualify as distressed," Leahy said March 8. Is that so? His comments reflect a sample of EB-5 petitions filed. EB-5 immigrant investor program The EB-5 program — whose name derives from the employment-based visa granted to participants — was created by Congress in 1990 as a tool to attract foreigners and to stimulate the U.S. economy through jobs and investment. Initially, immigrants invested directly into new projects. But in 1992, Congress expanded EB-5 by creating the Immigrant Investor Program (also referred to as Regional Center Program). It allotted EB-5 visas for individuals who would invest in certain commercial projects associated with regional centers approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the agency that administers the program. Through EB-5, investors, their spouses, and unmarried children under 21 years old become eligible for green cards if they create or keep 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers and if their investment is at least $1 million, or alternatively $500,000 if it is in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA) in the United States. TEAs are defined as rural areas or those that have unemployment of at least 150 percent the national average rate. (More details on TEA classifications are available here.) USCIS told PolitiFact it does not have hard numbers on investments and jobs created through EB-5 but pointed us to a Commerce Department analysis of 562 active projects during fiscal years 2012 and 2013. During that two-year period, there was an estimated investment of nearly $5.8 billion by more than 11,000 immigrant investors, and the projects were expected to create about 174,000 jobs, according to the January 2017 report. (Investment on those projects from sources other than EB-5 was about $10.9 billion.) Government Accountability Office report Still, several reports have found shortcomings in the investor program, including cases of fraud and lax oversight. The senator’s office referred us to a September 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office. The report, produced at the request of the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, analyzed investment in TEAs, how those areas were classified and how high-unemployment TEAs were drawn to meet the required unemployment rate. GAO studied a random sample of 200 of the 6,652 investor petitions filed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. Those petitions had not been decided on at the time GAO began its analysis. Among the report’s findings: • Almost all EB-5 petitioners elected to invest in a project located in a TEA, thus qualifying for the minimum required investment of $500,000. • 3 percent elected to invest in rural TEAs. • 97 percent elected to invest in high unemployment TEAs, yet 90 percent (of the 97 percent) combined census areas in order to meet the required unemployment rate. The other 10 percent (of 97 percent), used the unemployment rate of a single census tract, census block group, or county. In other words, 9.7 percent of all EB-5 petitioners elected to invest in an area that on its own met the TEA criteria. What experts say We asked experts who have researched the EB-5 program to help us evaluate Leahy’s assessment. They said data is scarce and limited, and that GAO’s estimates are the best available. Leahy’s reliance on the GAO report "is fair and reasonable," said Gary Friedland, a scholar-in-residence at New York University Stern School of Business, who along with colleague Jeanne Calderon, has testified on their findings about the program before Senate and House committees. "USCIS is not transparent and does not publicly release data about projects, TEA status of projects or individual petitions," Friedland said. "Similarly, industry (regional centers and developers) is not transparent and very protective of information about projects that utilize EB-5 capital." Unlike conventional investors seeking a risk adjusted rate of return, immigrants invest in EB-5 primarily — if not exclusively — to qualify for the investor visa and accept a very low rate of interest on their investment, Friedland said. As a result, they prefer to minimize their investment on EB-5 projects and seek projects that allow them to qualify for the lower-investment amount permitted for a TEA project, he said. Motivated to promote economic development, states have lenient rules to enable projects to qualify as TEA locations, and USCIS does not impose guidelines, Friedland said. "This has resulted in TEA gerrymandering where the applicant (regional center) is able to artificially expand the area for which the high unemployment rate is to be tested to include remote census tracts with exceptionally high unemployment rates that do not reflect the economic condition of the tract in which the project is located," Friedland said. "The states allow the census tracts to be connected in any direction and to form unnatural shapes." Friedland and Calderon have databases of large scale real estate projects that have raised or proposed to raise substantial amounts of EB-5 capital. "Virtually all of the large-scale projects in Manhattan are located south of Central Park, and generally these projects qualify as TEA locations by taking advantage of the gerrymandering permitted by the state," Friedland said. GAO’s analysis also shows that most TEAs are constructed by combining census areas, said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow at Urban Institute. "Few base it on a single small geographic area," she said. And while GAO's analysis is useful, Singer notes that the sample is indicative only of that specific period of time. (A footnote in GAO's report said petitions from the fourth quarter may not be representative of petitions submitted in other quarters.) "Without data from a longer period of time, there is no way to gauge how representative these trends are — say for the last 10 years, or the lifetime of the program," Singer said. Regarding Leahy’s claim that only 3 percent of EB-5 investors now invest in rural areas, that’s "likely close to correct," said Lazaro Zamora, senior policy analyst at Bipartisan Policy Center. The majority of regional centers are still mostly focused on real-estate development and other investment projects that gravitate toward metropolitan areas, Zamora said. "At the end of the day, this is a program that tries to attract investment, and rural areas typically have a harder time attracting it," Zamora said, though there have been projects that benefitted rural communities, such as a hospital that opened in a rural Arizona town with the help of EB-5 investment. Our ruling Leahy said, "Only 3 percent of EB-5 investors now invest in rural areas … Less than 10 percent invest in true high-unemployment areas. Almost every other EB-5 project uses gerrymandering to qualify as distressed." Leahy based his claims on a 2016 Government Accountability Office report that analyzed a sample of EB-5 petitions filed in the last quarter of fiscal year 2015. Experts say only limited data is available on EB-5 investments but that GAO’s findings are reasonable. GAO’s report reflects a snapshot and estimates of the petitions in one quarter. The program has been around for more than 20 years. We rate Leahy’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-07441	"Almost 37 percent of the total income from Planned Parenthood is from abortions."	false	/florida/statements/2011/apr/21/ronald-renuart/florida-republican-says-abortions-make-37-percent-/	Republican attacks on Planned Parenthood have filtered down from Washington to Tallahassee, where a GOP state legislator is accusing the not-for-profit group of operating a business plan that relies on abortions. State Rep. Ronald Renuart, an osteopathic physician from Ponte Vedra Beach, says Planned Parenthood opposes several anti-abortion measures being considered by the Florida Legislature because Planned Parenthood needs to perform abortions in order to stay in business. During an April 20, 2011, meeting of the Health and Human Services Committee, Renuart let Stephanie Kunkel, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, have it. "In 2008, Planned Parenthood, they put out a report, and it showed that they did 305,000 abortions and the average cost was $450," Renuart said (about 47 minutes into this video). "Their total income for Planned Parenthood alone was $374 million, of that $137 million was actually for abortions. So that's almost 37 percent of the total income from Planned Parenthood is from abortions. And to me, it sounds like they don't want to lose business." Kunkel, standing at a lectern where audience members can address the committee, later said Renuart was mistaken. "Mr. Renuart, 97 percent of the services that Planned Parenthood provides currently in Florida is prevention and education," she said. But Renuart stood his ground. "What I was quoting was a 2008 Planned Parenthood report," Renuart said. "That comes from Planned Parenthood mobile on my Blackberry here. Now are you claiming that, nationally, your organization is misrepresenting statistics and sending out false reports?" We wanted to check out Renuart's bottom line -- that almost 37 percent of the total income from Planned Parenthood comes from abortions. To set the stage, though, we need to explain the difference between what Renuart and Kunkel were talking about. Because they are not the same thing. Kunkel was referencing the services that Planned Parenthood provides, and she's right that abortions make up only 3 percent of the total number of procedures or services the group provides. (That's the figure that got Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl in trouble when he claimed -- incorrectly -- that over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does is abortions). But Renuart is talking about revenue, not the number of services or procedures performed by Planned Parenthood. And because different services or procedures cost different amounts, it's easily possible that abortions could generate more than 3 percent of Planned Parenthood's revenues. Therefore, it's possible that both claims could be correct. We contacted Renuart's office to see where he got his information but did not hear back. After some research, however, we are fairly certain we tracked down Renuart's sources. Planned Parenthood releases an annual report each year detailing its activities. The 2008 report is online, and several of the numbers Renuart cited match the report. In its 2007-08 report, Planned Parenthood said it performed 305,310 abortions in 2007 and that its health center reported total revenues of $374.7 million. Those numbers line up with what Renuart said. But Renuart's other numbers -- that the average cost of an abortion is $450 and that abortions generated $137 million -- are not in the report. Those figures came from pro-life bloggers, who have been making a claim similar to Renuart's for more than a year. We found the information from a blog called Live Action. The blog said the average cost of an abortion is $450 "based on what Planned Parenthood across the country has told Live Action staff. Although it is slightly higher or lower depending on what part of the country it is." Planned Parenthood's web site offers a range of costs for abortions -- which could include the procedure or the taking of a pill. The procedure costs about $350–$950 in the first trimester, Planned Parenthood says. The cost for what Planned Parenthood calls a "medication abortion" ranges from $350 to $650. So using $450 is reasonable. From there, Live Action does simple math. First, Live Action multiplies the number of abortions (305,310) by what it says is the average cost of an abortion ($450) to reach a figure for the total revenue generated by abortions ($137.4 million). Then they take the total revenue generated by abortions ($137.4 million) and divide it by the total revenue generated by the health center ($374.7 million), and conclude that 36.7 percent of Planned Parenthood's health center revenue comes from abortion. So Renuart's right? Not really. What blogs like Live Action specify, and Renuart doesn't, is that they are talking only about health center revenue. That makes up only about 36 percent of all revenue for Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood had $1.04 billion in total revenues in 2007-08, according to the group's annual report. Other revenue came from government grants ($350 million), private contributions ($250 million) and other sources ($69 million). So abortion procedures could generate 37 percent of Planned Parenthood's health center revenue -- but mind you, that's an estimate created by pro-life groups because the organization doesn't release that figure. If true, that's still only 13 percent of the total revenue generated by Planned Parenthood. Renuart didn't make that distinction in his comments during the House committee meeting. He presented his figures and claimed that "almost 37 percent of the total income from Planned Parenthood is from abortions." Renuart should have been more cautious with his words.

pomt-06638	The jobs bill includes "President Obama's tax on soup kitchens"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/15/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-blog-post-attacks-barack-obama-tax-sou/	Republicans portray President Barack Obama as an ineffective leader who has radically expanded government and done little to create jobs. And now, they say, he's out to hurt soup kitchens. In a Sept. 14, 2011, blog post, the office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., took aim at one of the provisions of Obama’s jobs bill. The post was headlined, "President Obama's Tax On Soup Kitchens," and it criticized a tax provision included in Obama’s jobs bill. "Yesterday, it was announced that an astounding one in six Americans are living in poverty," Cantor's blog post said. "President Obama's response? To demand a tax on donations to soup kitchens and other charities that help people desperately in need. The president's proposal will impact approximately 40 percent of all the tax deductible contributions, and essentially penalize soup kitchens, hospitals, and churches that provide essential services to those who need them most. It’s no wonder this tax hike has been rejected on both sides of the aisle." We wondered if it was accurate for Cantor’s office to say that the jobs bill includes "President Obama's tax on soup kitchens." First, we located the section in the jobs bill that Cantor’s office was using to back up its claim. It’s a tax provision designed to pay for the new expenditures and tax cuts that are supposed to spur job growth. Here’s the summary provided by the White House: "This section would limit the value of all itemized deductions and certain other tax expenditures for high-income taxpayers by limiting the tax value of otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions to 28 percent. No taxpayer with adjusted gross income under $250,000 for married couples filing jointly (or $200,000 for single taxpayers) would be subject to this limitation. The limitation would affect itemized deductions and certain other tax expenditures that would otherwise reduce taxable income in the 36 or 39.6 percent tax brackets. A similar limitation also would apply under the alternative minimum tax. This section would be effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2013." In other words, this provision would generate income by limiting how much certain high-income taxpayers can deduct for charitable or other reasons. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said soup kitchens theoretically would be affected if wealthy taxpayers cut back their donations because of the law. "Limiting the tax savings on charitable contributions will reduce the amount that affected taxpayers give," Williams said. "Some of what those folks give goes to soup kitchens. Affected soup kitchens will have less money to feed their clients, who will therefore be worse off." However, Williams added that the change is pretty modest. It would potentially affect only a tiny sliver of taxpayers -- about 2 percent of households. It’s not clear how much of a difference the limit on deductibility would mean for these taxpayers’ willingness to make charitable donations, either to charities generally or for soup kitchens specifically. And there’s no certainty that givers would cut their donations equally to all their charities. That said, while the proposed deduction limit would potentially affect only a tiny fraction of taxpayers, the high-earning taxpayers who would get hit by it give disproportionately to charity -- not surprisingly, since they have the most disposable money to start with. Statistics for the 2006 tax year showed that only 2.9 percent of filers reported adjusted gross incomes of at least $200,000. (Some joint households in this group do not earn enough to be affected by Obama’s proposal, but it’s the closest approximation in the data that we could get.) Yet despite the small size of this group, their itemized charitable donations accounted for 38.4 percent of all the itemized charitable donations made in the U.S. that year, by taxpayers from all income levels. So a tax hit to this group would likely hurt charitable giving more severely than a similarly structured tax hike on lower-income taxpayers. But is it fair to call the provision in the jobs bill a "tax on soup kitchens"? Clearly that's not what it is. The government taxes many things -- cigarettes, gasoline, property, incomes. But it does not tax soup kitchens -- and would not start to do so under this bill. (Quite the contrary -- any soup kitchen that’s a charity is fully tax-exempt.) The proposal’s impact, then, is much more indirect -- it gives slightly less favorable tax treatment to charitable donations, a fraction of which may reach soup kitchens, for a small segment of the tax-paying population. So the headline of the blog post is quite misleading. We also think the explanation in the text of the post, while more accurate than the headline, still goes too far when it says that Obama has acted to "demand a tax on donations to soup kitchens and other charities that help people desperately in need." Obama didn’t "demand a tax" on soup kitchens when he introduced the bill. Brad Dayspring, a Cantor spokesman, said the point of the post was that "eliminating a tax deduction for those who give to charities creates a new tax disincentive for that action, one that has otherwise not existed for a long-standing period of time. Bipartisan Members of Congress agree that this will have a negative effect on charities. … Soup kitchens are one such category of charities. … Ergo, President Obama introduced a new and negative tax treatment for soup kitchens (among others) this week. That is a fact." Our ruling Cantor's blog post was headlined "President Obama's tax on soup kitchens." That is misleading in two important ways. First, Obama did not single out soup kitchens for special tax treatment. And second, the proposal is not a tax on soup kitchens, or any other charitable organizations; it effectively increases the existing tax burden on a small percentage of households, which may indirectly cause disincentives for donations to soup kitchens.

pomt-06728	Every 1 percent increase in the number of Ohioans with bachelor’s degrees "means economic activity growing the next year and for each year thereafter (by) $2.5 billion dollars."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/30/jim-petro/chancellor-jim-petro-says-boosting-bachelors-degre/	Ohio Board of Regents Chancellor Jim Petro was firing up the troops. During a speech Aug. 11, 2011, at Ohio State University to announce a new "enterprise university" plan aimed at cutting red tape for public universities, Petro preached to his audience of higher education types why pushing up the college graduation rate in Ohio is so important. Only 26 percent of Ohioans hold a bachelor’s degree, Petro told his audience. Raising that figure toward the national average of 31 percent would give Ohio’s economy a tremendous boost. While Petro told the crowd he’s seen various estimates of the economic impact of a rising bachelor’s degree rate, he said he had a "solid" and "good" estimate. Every 1 percent increase in the number of Ohioans with bachelor’s degrees, Petro said, would mean multiple billions a year in sustained economic growth. "For every percent we move up, it means economic activity growing the next year and for each year thereafter (by) $2.5 billion dollars," he said. While the correlation between education levels and higher wages for individuals is fairly well-established, we were struck by the specific price tag Petro was able to put on Ohioans getting their sheepskins. So PolitiFact Ohio checked it out. Spencer Waugh, a policy liaison for the Ohio Board of Regents, sent us three documents to corroborate Petro’s claim. In an e-mail, Waugh said Petro’s estimate of $2.5 billion is "fair and conservative" given that some studies show less and at least one study shows more. The first document was a memo from Waugh to Petro which claimed that a 1 percent jump in Ohioans with bachelor’s degrees would net an income increase of $1.09 billion. Waugh’s memo multiples the number of new Ohioans with bachelor’s degrees by $19,000 a year — a figure he says represents the annual gain for those going from holding a high school diploma to a bachelor’s degree. Waugh’s figures were based on a data from the National Center for Education Statistics as well as 2007 census data, according to Kim Norris, Petro’s communications director. The 2007 census data states that the gap is $20,000 per year for adults. The National Center for Education Statistics data shows the gap at $18,000 for males but only $15,000 for females in the age group of 25-34. So $19,000 is in the ballpark. Using the $19,000 multiplier assumes that everyone who went back to school and got the bachelor’s degree had only achieved a high school education. Presumably some in that group would be people who already have associate’s degrees or "some college" and didn’t have far to go to get a bachelor’s degree. People who have "some college" or an associate’s degree generally make more than those with just a high school diploma, and that would have an impact on net benefit to Ohio’s economy. Regardless, the figure is well below Petro’s estimate of $2.5 billion. The second document is a memo from Board of Regents staffer Patrick Maloney to Petro which outlines a 2008 Arizona State University study which found that a 1 percent jump would add $1.5 billion to that state’s economy. The ASU study focuses solely on Arizona and relies on a 2004 Journal of Econometrics paper that estimated the effects on the earnings of all working adults from increasing the proportion of the workforce with a university degree. It used data from the 1980 and 1990 census. However, the paper’s author, Enrico Moretti, didn’t specify how he defined adults nor how he calculated hourly wages. And Moretti finds a "spillover effect" which pushes up wages for all workers on every education level as the share of workers with a bachelor’s degree increases. Because Moretti’s spillover effect requires different calculations over each level of educational attainment, it’s virtually impossible to compare Arizona to Ohio as the states have different profiles. Additionally, Arizona’s labor market is much smaller than Ohio’s with only 1.82 million workers year-round versus 5.11 million in Ohio — nearly three times as many. If the gains projected in Arizona would come true in Ohio, then you could probably assume an economic benefit of nearly three times what was projected for Arizona -- about $4 billion a year. The third study cited by Waugh comes from a CEO for Cities study, which concludes that an improvement of 1 percentage point in each of the 51 largest metropolitan areas in the United State would increase aggregate personal income by $124 billion nationwide. In the report, the authors explain that each additional percentage point in aggregate adult four-year college attainment was associated with a $763 increase in annual regional per capita income. Per capita income refers to the income of each man, women and child. If we apply the increase to Ohio’s 11.5 million population, we get an additional $8.8 billion a year in income. So where does all this leave Petro’s claim? As chancellor of the Board of Regents, Petro wanted to show the importance of more adults getting their college degrees. To underscore this point, Petro claimed that a "good and solid" estimate showed that increasing the number of bachelor’s degree holders in Ohio by 1 percent would increase "economic activity" in the state by $2.5 billion a year. Asked for studies to prove this point, Petro’s staffers muster a pair of memos which assert Ohio’s income would rise by $1.09 billion a year and another which estimates that Arizona’s would rise by $1.5 billion a year. The Arizona estimate would extrapolate to about $4 billion in Ohio given the larger labor market here. Lastly, they cite a study done on the nation’s biggest urban areas, which if applied to Ohio’s population would mean $8.8 billion in additional income. The underlying point in Petro’s statement is accurate -- that raising the percentage of Ohioans who have a bachelor’s degree would benefit Ohio’s economy. What is less clear is how great that benefit would be. Petro’s estimate was $2.5 billion. But the supporting documentation his staff provided shows that estimates very wildly. Is it $1 billion? $4 billion? $8.8 billion? Something in between? That’s a point that needs clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter the claim rates as Mostly True.

pomt-13214	Says Sen. Rob Portman says Ted Strickland earned $400,000 a year as a lobbyist after leaving Ohio for Washington.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2016/oct/20/rob-portman/portman-strickland-duel-over-whos-richer/	There were times during the second debate between Sen. Rob Portman and former Gov. Ted Strickland in which the two politicians quibbled over who’s richer. The feuding over fat wallets emerged in the first debate when Strickland announced that he’d calculated Portman’s hourly earnings at $333.57, after factoring in assets and his $174,000 salary as a U.S. senator. Strickland, a Democrat, juxtaposed the dollar figure with Portman’s stance against raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. Portman didn’t dispute the figure, but in the second matchup between the candidates, he hit back with a calculation of his own. "(Strickland) went to Washington, D.C., and he became a lobbyist," Portman said. "He made $400,000 a year. So he wasn’t living on minimum wage, but he was working against the interests of Ohioans, including the people he used to represent." Strickland sounded surprised, responding, "The senator said I made $400,000. My ... oh, senator, that’s a big whopper. I’ve never made $400,000 in my life." We decided to take a look at Strickland’s earnings. Was he really a lobbyist pulling in $400,000? There are some issues with Portman’s attack. But he isn’t far off with Strickland’s post-Congress earnings, if you’re willing to include a variety of compensation into the picture. The first issue with Portman’s claim: Strickland was never a registered lobbyist. After losing his re-election bid to Gov. John Kasich, Strickland took a job with the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. An amended 2015 financial disclosure filing shows that Strickland earned $199,125 between April 2014 to March 2015. Strickland headed up the political action fund for the think tank. His position is listed as "director/counselor" on the group’s tax forms. So technically, he was not a lobbyist himself, but he oversaw the group’s lobbying arm. When asked why Portman called Strickland a lobbyist, campaign spokesperson Michawn Rich said, "He did not misspeak. Ted ran the lobbying arm of the Center for American Progress. It's a fact." The second problem is that the earnings in question are not as straightforward as a $400,000 salary. You reach that amount by counting income from various jobs and retirement funds. The Center for American Progress Action Fund reports on its 2014 IRS Form 990 that Strickland earned "other compensation" in the amount of $13,623. The 990 form reports compensation over nine months, and Strickland was there for a year. So if you divide $13,623 by nine, monthly compensation comes to $1,513. Accounting for a year’s time in that position, Strickland would have made about $18,164 in addition to the reported $199,125 income. Strickland also disclosed $20,000 in earnings from consulting at the Bipartisan Policy Center, and $25,000 from working as a mediator with the Washington law firm Taft, Stettinius & Hollister. He reported $36,700 from his state retirement, and $25,500 from a PNC Bank-administered IRA fund. Strickland is also earning a federal pension from his 12 years in Congress, which is calculated by taking an average of the three-highest salaried years in Congress, multiplying the average by 1.7 percent, and multiplying the result by years of congressional service. Strickland’s three highest-earning years in office would have been 2004, 2005, and 2006, so the average comes to $161,800. Strickland was in Congress for 12 years, and 12 x 1.7 percent equals 20.4 percent. We will estimate Strickland’s pension, then, to be about $33,000 a year. (No more math after this, okay?) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com David Bergstein, spokesperson for Strickland’s campaign, disagrees that retirement earnings should be included as part of Strickland’s earnings in Washington. Subtracting the IRA and retirement fund, Strickland’s total annual earnings from a few gigs would be $295,289 — or $141.97 an hour. Our ruling Portman said Strickland "went to Washington, D.C., and he became a lobbyist. He made $400,000 a year." Technically Strickland wasn’t a lobbyist; he oversaw a liberal think tank’s lobbying and activism arm. As for his income, if you add his disclosed earnings, figures from public IRS forms and retirement income, you get an estimate around $357,000. Not everyone would tally up annual wealth this way. Portman’s statement is partially accurate but a bit sloppy in the details, so we rate his statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8b114f18-b218-4ac2-9ffa-4217a5401af0	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2016-10-20T17:33:33	2016-10-17	['Ohio', 'Ted_Strickland', 'Washington,_D.C.']

pomt-00850	Beer drinking is not allowed in any Illinois state parks.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/20/howard-marklein/howard-marklein-says-beer-drinking-not-allowed-ill/	Amid the debate over Gov. Scott Walker’s 2015-’17 budget proposal, a number of ideas have popped up about how to generate revenue for Wisconsin state parks. Among them: Beer. Well, sort of. During a March 3, 2015, meeting of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, state Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, suggested to Natural Resources Secretary Cathy Stepp that there was a way to capitalize on all the visitors from Illinois. Wisconsin already charges higher state parks admission fees for visitors from other states. Annual stickers cost $25 for Badgers and $35 for others; a night camping at Devil’s Lake, our most-visited park, is $15 for Wisconsin residents and $17 for outsiders. Marklein said fees could be raised, and the flatlanders -- er, Illinois residents -- would keep on coming to Wisconsin. Why? "They love coming up," Marklein said. "They can drink beer in our parks. They can't there." Wisconsinites have a long-standing love-hate relationship with visitors from Illinois. For many in the hospitality business, Illinois visitors are a vital source of revenue. Others fret that they overwhelm Wisconsin with big city driving habits and attitudes. But aside from the all that, we wondered if Marklein is right. You can pop a brewski at Devil’s Lake State Park, or other parks in Wisconsin, but you can’t do that in the Land of Lincoln? When we followed up with Marklein, aide Crystal Potts said the senator was basing his comments on a list posted in the Illinois Department of Natural Resources website. The list, under the tab "alcohol restrictions," lists 53 state parks and recreation areas -- from Apple River Canyon State Park to Wolf Creek State Park. The page says violators face a misdemeanor that carries a fine of $75 to up to $1,500 and one to six months in jail. That’s pretty steep for a Bud Light by the campfire. In Wisconsin, other than a handful of exceptions, drinking is allowed in state parks. But there are a couple problems with Marklein’s list. First, for many of the parks the list notes restrictions only at certain areas within a park, not the entire park. What’s more, there are many state parks in Illinois that are not on the list at all. The Illinois DNR confirmed that there is not a universal alcohol ban in that state. "Out of the 130 parks, there are 77 (where) alcohol is allowed," said an email from the Illinois DNR. "It is only banned in the parks that are listed." So we’ve got plenty of reasons for visitors to escape to Wisconsin and -- with budget troubles -- perhaps even a new reason to charge them more. But the pleasure of a cold beer on a hot summer night isn’t among them. Our rating Marklein wants to boost state parks’ charges for out of state residents, and -- noting how many people from Illinois come to Wisconsin -- he claimed visitors can’t drink in state parks in Illinois. But you can drink in more than half of the parks in that state. We rate Marklein’s claim False.	None	Howard Marklein	None	None	None	2015-03-20T05:00:00	2015-03-03	['Illinois']
pomt-11661	"Hollywood celebs: We will go on ‘total strike’ if Trump does not resign."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jan/09/Nourtey/hollywood-celebs-didnt-announce-strike-if-trump-wo/	Fake news reports said without evidence that celebrities threatened to go on strike unless President Donald Trump quit. "Hollywood celebs: We will go on ‘total strike’ if Trump does not resign," said a Dec. 30 headline on Nourtey.com, a fake news website that attacks Democrats. The story suggested Rosie O’Donnell was among the celebrities threatening to go on strike. Facebook users flagged the Nourtey.com post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. This story mimics earlier reports that have circulated for at least a year. Shortly before Trump’s inauguration, a similar story surfaced on therightists.com that said celebrities were calling for a strike within the movie industry in hopes that it would urge Trump to resign. Snopes found that the rumor stemmed from an ad in the New York Times by the group Refuse Fascism. The group, which included O’Donnell, called for millions to hold a protest to "create a political crisis that prevents the Trump/Pence fascist regime from consolidating its hold on the governance of society." Thousands of people, including musicians, actors, professors and authors, signed the petition as of Jan. 6, 2017. The celebrities were not calling for a strike barring Trump’s resignation. O'Donnell told NBC Late Night host Seth Meyers in November 2017 that she has been in a "severe depression" since Trump won the presidency and that she spends "90 percent of my waking hours tweeting hatred towards" Trump. The pair have bad blood going back to O’Donnell’s time on ABC’s The View, when she criticized Trump on multiple personal and professional fronts after his decision not to fire a Miss USA accused of drug use and other wrongdoing. We messaged O’Donnell on Facebook to ask if she had threatened to strike and received an automated message: "Please use my memes and articles as a resource to fight against Trump. I read all of my messages. #LoveTrumpsHate #ResistTrump Please don't leave hateful comments or memes on my page. Stay Rosie." So Nourtey.com said, "Hollywood celebs: We will go on ‘total strike’ if Trump does not resign." While O’Donnell was among the celebrities who signed a Refuse Fascism petition calling for protests leading up to Trump’s inauguration and has continued to criticize Trump, we found no evidence that there was a plan for a mass strike among celebrities.

pomt-06959	"Some criminals have learned how to spy on Americans, hacking into our home computers and looking out through the video camera attached to the screen."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jul/17/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-whitehouse-says-criminals-can-hack-home-comput/	Alarmed by reports of computers being hacked in the United States, including at major corporations, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse took to the Senate floor in June to call for a heightened campaign against cyber-crime. The country’s increasing dependence on the Internet, he said, "allows criminals, terrorists and hostile nations to exploit cyberspace to attack America, to invade our privacy, to loot our intellectual property and to expose America’s core critical infrastructure to cybersabotage." Whitehouse, a Democrat, went on to say, "Some criminals have learned how to spy on Americans, hacking into our home computers and looking out through the video camera attached to the screen." We nervously glanced at our webcam, wondering if anyone was watching, and just to be safe covered our mouth when we asked, "Is that true?" Then we reached out to several technology experts to ask whether hackers can seize control of our home computers and secretly keep a digital eye on us. "Yes, it’s absolutely possible to do," said David Sherry, chief information security officer for Brown University and former vice president of information security for Citizens Financial Group. "It’s actually quite easy to do. It’s really nothing new." The know-how has been around since 1998, said Sherry, ever since a group of hackers calling itself the Cult of the Dead Cow designed software that, once downloaded, could be used to control a computer remotely. With the proliferation of webcam-equipped laptops, the potential pool of voyeur victims has swelled immensely, he said. Adam Wosotowsky, a principal engineer at McAfee, a company that sells anti-virus and anti-malware products, agreed. Home computer users can be victimized by hackers who deploy software to exploit unprotected machines, he said. "So if they have a webcam, then you can take advantage of it," said Wosotowsky. How is it done? Typically, when computer operators click on a file, link or pop-up window created by a hacker, they could inadvertently install malicious software on their hard drives. That opens the door for hackers to control victims’ computers remotely. Just because something is possible doesn’t mean people are actually doing it. So we searched for examples of webcam wrongdoing. We learned of several cases. An Ohio man who was a registered sexual offender reportedly got 25 years in prison in 2007 for charges that included hacking into minors’ webcams and secretly watching and recording them in their homes, according to InformationWeek. A disturbing case took place in Texas in 2004. While instant messaging with a friend, a 15-year-old girl suddenly realized that her words weren’t her own. They were vulgar and clearly the work of a hacker. It became clear that the hacker was manipulating her webcam too when he sent a message complimenting her shirt. [He apparently was using the microphone too since he sent messages quoting things that had been said aloud in her home.] The FBI informed us of a 2010 case in California in which a 31-year-old man posed on a social networking site as a friend of teenage girls. By persuading them to download a song, he infected their computers. Soon, he could stealthily search hard drives of hundreds of computers for explicit photos and videos. When he found such material, he demanded his victims send more explicit material or he would expose them. He also was "occasionally successful" controlling webcams to catch his victims in intimate situations. Eric Strom, unit chief within the FBI’s cyberdivision, said that while the technology exists to manipulate people’s webcams, that’s not what most criminals are interested in. For instance, the same man who victimized the California girl also used a "keylogger" program to monitor keystrokes and steal credit card numbers and other personal information, he said. "They are looking for financial gain," said Strom. Still, he said he’s noticed in airports more people "taping up their webcams." That’s a simple step experts recommend to prevent webcam spying, as well as placing objects in front of the camera. If the webcam light comes on when you’re not using it, that’s a telltale sign it’s being operated remotely, they say. Sherry, at Brown University, recommends updating operating systems, keeping firewalls turned on and maintaining antivirus protection that also fights malware and spyware. If you rely on wireless connections to the Internet, he said, ensure that security settings are at the highest level and, when using unprotected public wireless sites, do not conduct sensitive transactions. Also, avoid clicking on anything suspicious. "This is something that can easily be prevented," he said. So let’s return to the senator’s claim that hackers are spying on people through their webcams. The experts say that the technology is readily available for hackers to seize control of home computers, including webcams. And while such cases are seemingly rare, law enforcement officials have arrested people in cases that involved webcam hacking to "spy on Americans," the phrase Whitehouse used. Before we issue our ruling, rest assured of one thing: No one has ever hacked the Truth-O-Meter. We rate this claim True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-13168	Says Marco Rubio "has a 98 percent voting record with the Koch brothers."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/oct/27/patrick-murphy/patrick-murphy-marco-rubio-voted-98-percent-time-k/	At the second U.S. Senate debate, Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy attacked Republican Sen. Marco Rubio for siding with billionaires Charles and David Koch while he was a U.S. senator. "We all know he never shows up to work, but when he does he has a 98 percent voting record with the Koch brothers, a right-wing special interest group," Murphy said of Rubio Oct. 26 in Davie. Murphy brought up Rubio’s alignment with the Koch brothers at both U.S. Senate debates, so PolitiFact Florida decided to see whether it is true. It turns out the 98 percent figure comes from a scorecard from Americans for Prosperity, a Koch-backed political group. The Koch brothers and Americans for Prosperity Charles and David Koch are no strangers to politics. They own Koch Industries, one of the largest privately owned corporations in the United States dealing with manufacturing, trading and investments. The Kochs also lead a vast network of political activist groups, including Americans for Prosperity. The duo provided seed funding for Americans for Prosperity, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit political advocacy group that has spent millions on Republicans in Senate races in states like Nevada, Indiana, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Groups like Americans for Prosperity are not required to disclose its donors and can advocate for political issues as long as it’s not their primary activity. The Koch brothers have ties to Rubio as he pursued the Republican presidential nomination and senatorial race. In February, when Rubio was running for president, the Kochs’ top political advisor, Marc Short, joined his campaign as a senior adviser. Later in July, after Rubio dropped out of the presidential race and slid into the Senate race, the Koch Brothers hinted at throwing support behind Marco Rubio, according to the Tampa Bay Times. AFP is one component of Charles and David’s broad network of money in politics. The brothers are set to to spend $750 million on this election cycle throughout their network. A third of that money will go to multiple political groups with AFP included, according to the Washington Post. In September, however, Charles announced he was merging all of the conservative advocacy groups into one entity — Americans For Prosperity. The leaders of three groups — Concerned Veterans for America, the LIBRE Initiative and Generation Opportunity (all Koch backed groups) — will keep their positions, but the organizations will now be branded under the AFP umbrella. The Koch brothers are not elected officials, so to reach his calculation Murphy is relying on a report card by Americans for Prosperity. The group ranks lawmakers’ floor votes and procedural votes "for economic freedom" each session of Congress, which covers a two-year period (AFP does not track procedural votes.). To Americans for Prosperity, "economic freedom" entails votes for limited government, cutting taxes and reducing business regulation. The number of votes AFP analyzes depends on the issues that were brought up while the Senate was in session. For example, in the 2013-14 session, AFP looked at 20 Senate votes and in 2011-12 session AFP looked at 35. Rubio has a lifetime score of 98 percent since taking office in 2011. (For comparison, Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson has a lifetime score of 5 percent.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Murphy is accurately referencing the the AFP scorecard, but that record is not a vote-for-vote count. The organization only analyzes a sample of votes that align with the group’s agenda. AFP Florida spokesman Andres Malave told PolitiFact Florida that the Federal Affairs team works with AFP leadership to choose which votes to score. He added, "Charles and David Koch do not play a role in developing the AFP scorecard." Our ruling Murphy said Rubio "votes 98 percent of the time with the Koch brothers." Murphy is citing a scorecard given out by AFP, a group funded by the Koch brothers. The duo is clearly involved in this group, but it should be noted that the brothers have not held office, voted or have direct influence over the votes that are analyzed on the AFP scorecard. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-01928	Says Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst "promises to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/27/league-conservation-voters/does-joni-ernst-want-abolish-education-department-/	A new ad from a coalition of environmental groups tries to paint Iowa’s Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst as too extreme. The groups, which include the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, and the Environmental Defense Action Fund, kicked off a nearly $1 million campaign with a 30 second TV spot on June 23, 2014. The ad raises concern over Ernst’s promises "to shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA." It claims that these promises are "why extremist Sarah Palin and the billionaire Koch brother want Ernst in Washington." All in all, the ad concluded that Ernst is "Too extreme for Iowa." It’s not unusual for political ads to distort candidate’s positions. Does Ernst really call for the abolition of the U.S. Education Department and the Environmental Protection Agency? Our research showed that the ad was right on track. Ernst called for the closure of both agencies in April. Will she do away with the Education Department? Ernst is a state senator who won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. She’s running against the Democratic nominee, U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley. Ernst brought up both the Education Department and the EPA in the Republican primary debate on April 24, 2014. One of the moderators asked candidates how they would fund repairs for the nation’s "crumbling road and transportation systems." Ernst suggested cutting the federal budget to free up funds. "I do believe that we can make the cuts necessary within our federal government," Ernst said. She called for "closing the doors to the Department of Education at the federal level. And not just because it would save taxpayer dollars, but because I do believe our children are better educated when it’s coming from the state." We ran those comments by Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel, who said that Ernst wants to see power taken from Washington and put back in the hands of Iowans. She is "about state-driven policy," Hamel said. According to the Education Department’s website the "federal role in education is limited." States handle almost all education policy and issues. But, at the federal level, the Education Department takes on many tasks such as conducting research and overseeing state policy to prevent discrimination. It also awards and distributes federal financial aid in the form of loans and grants. The ad says that if Ernst is elected, 213,000 Iowa students would lose their federal Pell Grants. According to federal numbers, that is the number of Iowans who received Pell Grants in 2011-12. We asked the Ernst campaign what her plan for Pell Grants is, but we didn’t get a response. What about the EPA? While answering the same question that prompted her Education Department response, Ernst also mentioned the EPA. "Let’s shut down the EPA," she said. Ernst gave the same rationale for this slash in government, saying, "The state knows best how to protect resources." So, the ad is on solid ground. Ernst did say that she would shut down the EPA. Agriculture and manufacturing are two of Iowa’s key industries, and they are both heavily affected by EPA regulation. Hamel, Ernst’s spokeswoman, said that "Joni wants to have Iowa make its own decisions." The ad also refers to the Clean Air Act. This raises the question of how states would deal with national issues, like air pollution. Unlike the Education Department, where the states already play a huge role, this could be more complicated for the EPA. Two experts on environmental law told us that abolishing the EPA would dramatically reduce regulations on industry. "Nearly all states have seen significant cuts in the budgets of their state environmental agencies in recent years," said one of them, Joel A. Mintz, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University who specializes in environmental law. "Although some states may have the expertise, resources and political will to subsume EPA’s responsibilities, many — probably most — do not." Our ruling An attack ad aired by the League of Conservation Voters said that Ernst wants to "shut down the Department of Education and abolish the EPA."

pomt-07540	"Every child born today inherits a $30,000 share in a national debt that stands at more than $13 trillion."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/04/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-every-child-born-30000-share-us-/	In his book Courage to Stand: An American Story, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty -- a potential Republican presidential contender in 2012 -- addresses a wide range of policy topics. One of those is the national debt. "Every child born today," Pawlenty wrote, "inherits a $30,000 share in a national debt that stands at more than $13 trillion." We wondered whether his math was accurate. According to the U.S. Treasury, the total U.S. debt held by the public on Jan. 1, 2011, was almost $9.4 trillion. Meanwhile, the 2010 Census just determined the national population to be 308.7 million people. Divide those two numbers and you get $30,419 per person -- right on target for what Pawlenty wrote. But there’s a catch. Remember, Pawlenty wrote that the national debt "stands at more than $13 trillion." The number he’s referring to is different from the $9.4 trillion we used in the previous calculation. The $13 trillion figure refers to something related, but different -- gross federal debt, which is the sum of publicly held debt and debt held by other parts of the federal government. The additional debt included in this number typically is held by trust funds for major government programs, including Social Security and Medicare. Economists have told us in the past that they believe both measures to be equally valid. On Jan. 1, 2011, gross federal debt stood at just over $14 trillion, which works out to $45,433 for every American. So both of the figures Pawlenty used have a basis in reality, but they do not relate to each other the way he suggested. If Pawlenty wants to stick with the $30,000-per-person figure, he should have said that debt stands at more than $9 trillion. Alternately, if he prefers to stick with the "more than $13 trillion" debt figure, he should say that the amount of debt per person exceeds $45,000. Since both of his numbers are right -- just measuring different things -- we’ll give him some leeway and rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-05556	"Mitt Romney’s pledged to protect (oil companies') record profits – and their billions in special tax breaks, too."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/apr/06/priorities-usa-action/mitt-romney-pledged-protect-oil-companies-tax-b/	An ad from a pro-Obama super PAC portrays Mitt Romney and the oil industry as cozy pals pledging big bucks to help each other out. It's a response to a different super PAC ad that attacked President Obama's energy policies. "Who’s behind this ad smearing President Obama?," the pro-Obama ad says. "Big Oil, that’s who. The money they make from high gas prices is going right into Mitt Romney’s campaign. Big oil executives have pledged two hundred million to help him. "And Mitt Romney’s pledged to protect their record profits – and their billions in special tax breaks, too. These guys all profit. You pay the price." We wanted to know if the ad was right that Romney "pledged" to protect oil company profits, so we decided to check it out. We could not find any explicit pledges by Romney to continue tax breaks for the oil companies. Instead, Priorities USA and others making similar claims rely on Romney’s criticism of Obama’s proposals and Romney’s ties to the oil industry. Eliminating oil and gas tax loopholes is one of Obama’s campaign promises that we are tracking on our Obameter. The Senate hasn’t been able to get enough votes to eliminate those subsidies, which the oil industry has vigorously defended. The industry and its supporters argue that the industry still pays hefty taxes and is a major job producer. Taxpayers for Common Sense concluded in a 2011 report that the oil and gas industry are poised to get $80 billion in subsidies during the next five years, and that the industry has doled out $140 million over the past decade to influence federal policy. The Romney campaign has criticized Obama’s energy policy as calling for "higher taxes" and for proposing "a $4 billion tax increase for oil and gas companies." Romney’s policies, meanwhile, call for reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent, but they don’t specifically address tax breaks for oil companies. Romney himself didn’t provide much clarity when asked directly about his position in a Fox News interview on April 2 with host Greta Van Susteren. Romney began his answer by saying "I'm not sure precisely what big tax breaks we're talking about" and then called for reducing corporate taxes: "And then there are various breaks and deductions and exemptions that certain industries have been able to win through lobbying over the years," Romney said. "What I'd like to do is to get the tax rate down so we're competitive with places like Europe, for pete's sake -- get tax rates down and eliminate a lot of the deductions and the breaks and the special deals that a lot of definitely industries get. And I'll look at them one by one." Romney’s silence on the issue has been duly noted. The Sierra Club complained recently that "Romney still has not been forthright about his position on the issue." The group pointed to Romney’s statement about oil subsidies in April 2011, when he declined to take a position on current tax breaks and again talked about lowering overall corporate taxes. The Sierra Club also points to the hefty campaign contributions Romney has received from oil and gas -- more than $750,000 according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- and the pro-Romney Restore Our Future PAC has received almost $1 million. The Sierra Club also notes that Romney’s chief energy adviser, billionaire oil executive Harold Hamm, has urged Congress to maintain the tax breaks for industry members. "Thousands of American jobs they create will be lost if 30 to 40 percent of the capital for drilling is eliminated through the loss of tax provisions," Hamm wrote in 2011. The next year, Hamm wrote that eliminating deductions for the industry "would give us no option but to reduce our drilling programs, resulting in fewer jobs and higher prices." We asked representatives within the oil industry if they view Romney as pledging to maintain oil tax breaks. "From my perspective, having been in the industry for nearly three decades, and having watched various politicians court or ‘diss’ the industry, I wouldn’t necessarily assume anything," wrote Kurt Abraham, executive editor of World Oil, in an email. "We have had politicians in the past, who promised to ‘help’ the industry, who did absolutely nothing, once they got into office. By the same token, I’ve seen politicians that weren’t necessarily thought of as ‘friends’ of the industry, who turned out to be more proactive toward oil and gas than anyone would have imagined. I think that it’s too early to say that Romney will protect the industry’s tax breaks -- I certainly don’t think of him as ‘pledging’ to at this point." Finally, if you’ve read this far, you probably won’t be surprised to know the Romney campaign didn’t respond to our questions about Romney’s position on tax exemptions for the oil industry. The Washington Post’s The Fact Checker also couldn’t get the Romney campaign to clarify his position. Our ruling The Priorities USA Action ad says "Mitt Romney’s pledged to protect their (oil companies) record profits – and their billions in special tax breaks, too." We couldn’t find any pledge from Romney to protect the oil industries’ tax breaks -- if anything, Romney appears to be trying to avoid making any clear statement on how he would handle those subsidies. But there are signs that he is favorable toward maintaining those tax breaks. The most notable evidence is his campaign memo’s criticism of Obama for wanting to increase taxes on the industry and the fact that his energy adviser is an oil executive who opposes "punitive tax increases." Romney hasn’t made a "pledge" but there are signs he supports the existing tax breaks. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Priorities USA Action	None	None	None	2012-04-06T09:35:46	2012-03-30	['None']

pomt-02242	"From 1972 until 2011, the number of EPA employees increased by 107 percent while the number of total federal personnel decreased by 15 percent."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/apr/14/morgan-griffith/rep-morgan-griffith-says-epa-job-growth-outstips-u/	U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith has long blamed regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency for the decline of the coal industry across the nation and in his Southwest Virginia district. Griffith, R-9th, introduced a bill to cut 15 percent of the EPA’s budget, saying the agency has grown "out of control." "From 1972 until 2011, the number of EPA employees increased by 107 percent while the number of total federal personnel decreased by 15 percent," he said on March 25 during testimony before the House Budget Committee. We wondered whether Griffith’s figures are correct. His spokeswoman, Andrea Pivarunas, sent us sources for the numbers. The EPA had a staff of 8,358 in 1972 and it grew to 17,359 in 2011, according to data from the agency. That’s an increase of 107.7 percent -- matching what Griffith said. We should note that EPA dropped to 15,913 employees last year as many cashed in on an early retirement incentive offered to federal workers. So if Griffith had used the the most current data available, the increase since 1972 would have translated to 90.4 percent. The total number of federal employees was 5.2 million in 1972 and 4.4 million in 2011, according to the federal Office of Personnel Management. That’s a decrease of 15.4 percent -- again, what Griffith said. The federal workforce figure requires elaboration because it includes civilians and uniformed military personnel, which have experienced different trends since 1972. Executive branch civilian employees numbered 2.82 million in 1972 and 2.76 million in 2011, a drop of 2.1 percent. Meanwhile, uniformed military personnel numbered 2.36 million in 1972 and 1.58 million in 2011, a decrease of 33.1 percent. So the reduction in federal employees has more to do with a smaller fighting force than with a shrinking bureaucracy. Now, let’s return to the EPA. What accounted for its sharp rise in employment? The answer is that the agency was barely out of infancy in 1972 when Griffith begins his timeline. The EPA was created on Dec. 2, 1970, to consolidate environmental quality programs in several federal departments. For example, the Interior Department worked on water quality and pesticides, while the Department of Health, Education and Welfare worked on air pollution, and the Food and Drug Administration conducted pesticides research. In areas where the federal government didn’t have oversight, state or local governments were left to fill in the gaps. Congress passed a number of laws in the 1970s that expanded the EPA’s authority: Clean Air Act to set national air quality, automobile emission and anti-pollution standards Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention to to restrict lead-based paints in government-subsidized housing, cribs and toys Clean Water Act to control discharges of pollution in surface water Dumping Act to control dumping chemicals and material in the ocean waters Safe Drinking Water Act to regulate public drinking water Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to control hazardous waste from creation to disposal Toxic Substances Control Act to cut health risks from synthetic and organic chemicals Superfund Act to identify those responsible for chemical contamination of land and compel them to clean up the contamination "The 1970s is known as the environmental decade because so much happened so quickly," said Daniel Fiorino, director of American University’s Center for Environmental Policy and a former EPA official. The agency started with 4,084 employees in 1970 and grew to 13,078 in 1980. Employment tapered in the early 1980s, but grew again in the 1990s with a sweeping expansion of the Clean Water Act and as concerns emerged about global warming. The EPA peaked in 1999, with 18,110 employees. From 1980 to 2011, employment at the EPA grew by 32.4 percent while the total number of federal employees -- military and civilian -- dropped by 11.3 percent. Our ruling Griffith said, "From 1972 until 2011, the number of EPA employees increased by 107 percent while the number of total federal personnel decreased by 15 percent." There are a few minor issues with Griffith’s choice of dates and numbers, but we won’t quibble. The EPA increase would have dipped below 100 percent if Griffith had used the most current employment figures from 2013. On the other had, Griffith could have made the growth sound more dramatic if he had started his comparison in 1970, when the EPA was born. We rate Griffith’s statement True.

pomt-03764	Forty aides who serve President Barack Obama "owe $333,485 in back taxes."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/03/blog-posting/bloggers-say-obama-aides-are-delinquent-their-taxe/	April 15, the deadline for filing 2012 income tax returns, is almost here, so it was fitting that a claim about income taxes caught our attention the other day. The claim circulated in the blogosphere and some media reports, then showed up in a published letter to the editor of The Plain Dealer. The claim: Forty aides who serve President Barack Obama "owe $333,485 in back taxes." Sounds outrageous, yes? And after checking with the Internal Revenue Service, we can affirm that the claim is factually correct. Yet there is more to the story. , It turns out that the issue arises every year, regardless of who is president. And it applies to nearly every department of the federal government. "People who work for the federal government are no different from people who work in the private sector or for nonprofits," said Kay Bell, a Texas-based author, journalist, blogger ("Don’t Mess With Taxes"), former congressional staffer and current contributing tax editor for BankRate.com. We contacted her because she has written about the government employee delinquencies for years. "Everybody has tax issues," she said. Let’s break this down with numbers first, then provide some context. We got the latest numbers in an Excel spreadsheet from an IRS spokesman. His agency developed a reporting method in 1992 to comply with a congressional requirement that it provide annual reports on the tax delinquencies of federal employees. In 2011, the last year for which the filing deadline has long passed, 3.62 percent of the civilian federal workforce -- or 107,658 individuals out of 2.97 million federal workers -- had an unresolved federal income tax delinquency. This did not include taxpayers who have made arrangements with the IRS to pay off their tax debts. Rather, these are people who have not, cannot or will not pay. The numbers we presented so far include only federal civilian employees, not military personnel or retirees, because of the implicit rationale made in criticizing these workers: Those who carry out the regular functions of government ought to be keenly aware of the need to pay their taxes. Altogether, these tax delinquents owed just over $1 billion. But if you add active military members, reservists, National Guard and federal retirees, the number of delinquent individuals grows to 311,566, and the total owed climbs to $3.5 billion. Among the major federal departments, the Department of Housing and Urban Development had the highest delinquency rate, 4.42 percent. In exact numbers, 431 HUD employees owed a cumulative $5.9 million. Among large independent agencies, workers in the Government Printing Office were the worst tax delinquents: 167 employees, or 7.6 percent of the agency’s workforce, owed back taxes, to the tune of $2.3 million. As for the White House, the Executive Office of the President had 40 tax delinquencies out of its 1,902-member staff in 2011, for a rate of 2.10 percent. These employees owed $333,485 altogether. The delinquencies are of concern to some in Congress. But guess what? The House of Representatives and Senate have their own share of people who are behind in their taxes. Their tax delinquency rates are even worse than the White House’s. The House, including a staff of 11,812 and 435 lawmakers, had 454 tax delinquents in 2011, owing nearly $8.9 million, giving it a 3.71 percent delinquency rate. That compared with the White House rate (the Executive Office of the President) of 2.10 percent. The Senate, with 100 lawmakers and 6,930 staff members, had a rate of 3.33 percent, with 234 individuals owing the IRS $1.9 million. The IRS, alas, does not disclose the names of the deadbeats. This may pale compared with the public’s delinquency rate of 8.2 percent, but critics, led by Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, note that federal workers are paid by taxpayers. As Chaffetz told Fox News’s Greta Van Susteren on March 20, "if they're not going to pay their taxes, they should be fired!" The only department that may use tax trouble as a reason for dismissal, however, is the IRS, which has an employee tax compliance and auditing program and says it treats indifference to tax laws as a firing offense. Chaffetz would like to extend such treatment to other federal employees. This is a lot of information about various departments, lawmakers and the White House. Yet bloggers ignored almost everything but the White House component. Consider entries such as this, in the blog Poor Richard’s News: "Surprise! Obama White House Aids (sic) owe $333,485 in back taxes." And this: "40 of Obama’s White House aides owe a total of $333,485 in back taxes – media silent," from a blog named "Fire Andrea Mitchell." The media was not silent, actually. The Associated Press had the story on March 8. These and other blog entries appear to build on a partial theme from a March 11 piece in Investor’s Daily Business and its website, Investors.com, by columnist Andrew Malcolm. Malcolm wrote, "This is the third straight year that the chief executive of the United States has been unable to get his own staff members to keep up with a citizen's legal income tax obligations. to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes owed. All this while Obama has made such rhetorical hay about corporations and the wealthy paying their fair share." This was not the third straight year, however, unless you were measuring only one president, namely, Obama (2011 was his third year in office). These delinquencies have occurred every year, not just the last three, with some departments and administrations doing better than others. We know this because there have been other media reports in some of those years. But we also know because we requested multiple years worth of data from the IRS, and a spokeswoman provided us with the spreadsheets for every year dating to 2004. In 2008, the last year of George W. Bush’s presidency, 50 employees of the Executive Office of the President owed $812,917, according to reporting in 2009 by Bell, WTOP Radio in Washington and others. That put the executive office default rate at 2.93 percent, slightly higher than the current rate. The previous year, 2007, had an Executive Office of the President delinquency rate of 2.21 percent, according to a 2008 Washington Post report that highlighted a number of other departments and Congress, too. That’s confirmed in the data the IRS gave us. The lowest rate for the president’s staff during all these years was 2010 (so this was Obama’s staff), when it was 2.01 percent, the IRS data show. But in dollar terms, that was also the year with the most money owed: $833,970. In other words, fewer people were delinquent, but they owed more. The lowest amount owed by the president’s staff during all these years was $188,304, in 2007 (Bush’s staff), with a delinquency rate of 2.21. Yet in three of Bush’s last five years in office, his Executive Office staff owed more than $627,000. Malcolm, an opinion columnist, at least mentioned other government departments, as did subsequent reports -- which were quite balanced -- on Fox News. The partisan blogs, however, did not. Putting all this together, the claim -- that 40 staffers in the Obama White House are tax delinquents -- is accurate. Yet when presented as an Obama White House phenomenon, it omits pertinent facts. It fails to mention that this is neither new nor unique to this president or this branch of government. Based on PolitiFact guidelines, when a claim is accurate but leaves out facts necessary to get the full picture, the Truth-O-Meter is to read "Mostly True." That is how we rate this claim: Mostly True.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2013-04-03T16:50:05	2013-03-28	['None']

pomt-06925	Said his mother had to fight with health insurance companies for treatment because of a pre-existing condition.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/21/barack-obama/obamas-mother-fought-disability-coverage-not-treat/	It's an anecdote President Barack Obama told several times while discussing the need for health reform. "I will never forget my own mother, as she fought cancer in her final months, having to worry about whether her insurance would refuse to pay for her treatment. And by the way, this was because the insurance company was arguing that somehow she should have known that she had cancer, when she took her new job, even though it hadn't been diagnosed yet," Obama said at a town hall meeting in Portsmouth, N.H., on Aug. 11, 2009. But a biography of Obama's mother and additional reporting by the New York Times have shown that a key point of that anecdote is incorrect. Obama's mother was fighting not for treatment but for payments from a disability insurance policy. A Singular Woman: The Untold Story of Barack Obama’s Mother by journalist Janny Scott documents the life of Obama's mother, S. Ann Dunham, an anthropologist who also worked on the issues of development aid and microcredit in Indonesia. The book documents Dunham's final illness -- uterine and ovarian cancer -- in some detail. Dunham's illness became acute when she was working in Indonesia in 1994, and she was diagnosed in Hawaii early the next year. Scott interviewed Dunham's doctor, family and friends for the book and had access to Dunham's correspondence and personal papers. According to Scott's account, Dunham's health insurance covered her treatment. But Dunham also filed a claim for disability insurance. It was the disability insurance company that refused to pay because they said her cancer was a pre-existing condition, according to the book. A Singular Woman goes into detail about Dunham's financial situation at the time she became sick. Dunham made a modest salary and sometimes struggled to pay her bills, according to the book. She was worried about the costs of her treatment, and the disability insurance would have eased her concerns. Dunham filed several rounds of paperwork trying to convince the insurance company to pay the disability insurance, intended as a replacement for lost wages. At one point, Dunham told the insurance company that she would be turning the matter over to "my son and attorney, Barack Obama." Dunham died Nov. 7, 1995. Scott concluded that Obama's memories of the matter were faulty. "Though he often suggested that she was denied health coverage because of a pre-existing condition, it appears from her correspondence that she was only denied disability coverage." The book was published in May. In July, the New York Times reported that the White House finally responded to their repeated requests about the book's findings. (Scott, the book's author, was a reporter with the New York Times who left the paper to finish the book.) The White House chose not to dispute the findings. "We have not reviewed the letters or other material on which the author bases her account," a White House spokesman, Nicholas Papas, told the Times. "The president has told this story based on his recollection of events that took place more than 15 years ago." Papas also said the story was still relevant. "She first could not get a response from the insurance company, then was refused coverage. This personal history of the president's speaks powerfully to the impact of pre-existing condition limits on insurance protection from health care costs," he told the Times. But as the Times story notes, disability insurance was not at issue during the health care debate. Normally, we steer clear of fact-checks about politicians' families or claims that are less than timely. But Obama used the anecdote to make a case for a significant change in the law that affected the national health care system. We find Scott's reporting and the New York Times story to be compelling evidence that he got a crucial detail wrong, and the White House did not dispute that. His mother was fighting for insurance payments as she was dying, but for disability insurance, not health insurance, as her son said he remembered. So we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04796	Says Congressmen Paul Ryan and Todd Akin co-sponsored legislation "to limit federal funding for abortion to victims of ‘forcible rape.’"	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/22/john-wisniewski/paul-ryan-and-todd-akin-co-sponsored-bill-limiting/	Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, have tried to distance themselves in recent days from comments made by a Missouri congressman about pregnancies being rare in cases of "legitimate rape." But the chairman of the New Jersey Democratic Party claimed Tuesday that Ryan, a Wisconsin congressman, and Missouri Republican Todd Akin have both backed a bill limiting federal funding for abortions to victims of "forcible rape." "While Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan rushed to throw Congressman Akin under the bus following his repugnant comments, we know that in reality, Republicans share many of Akin’s most offensive views on the issue of choice," John Wisniewski, a state assemblyman, said in a news release. "Ryan co-sponsored legislation with Akin to limit federal funding for abortion to victims of ‘forcible rape’ - as if there is any other kind of rape?" Wisniewski is correct that Ryan and Akin co-sponsored legislation in July 2010 and January 2011 that, as originally written, limited federal funding for abortions to pregnancies resulting from "forcible rape" and certain other circumstances. But the party chairman failed to mention that the term "forcible" was later removed from the bill before its passage in the House. In a statement, Wisniewski argued that the congressmen became co-sponsors when the legislation still contained the phrase "forcible rape." "While the term was removed after significant public outcry, it is telling that the phrase did not raise any red flags for either Ryan or Akin in July 2010 or January 2011 when they signed on as original co-sponsors," Wisniewski said. Let’s explain the bill’s history. The legislation -- known as the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act -- was first introduced on July 29, 2010 by New Jersey Congressman Chris Smith (R-4th Dist.). Ryan and Akin signed on as co-sponsors at the time of the bill’s introduction. That version of the bill prohibited federal funding for abortions, except in certain cases -- including "forcible rape." But with Democrats still in control of the House, the bill didn't move forward. After the GOP took control of the House, Smith re-introduced the bill on Jan. 20, 2011. Again, at the time of introduction, Ryan and Akin became co-sponsors, and the legislation still contained the phrase "forcible rape." Yet that term ignited an outcry among various critics, who said the phrase would exclude victims of statutory rape or rapes involving drugs. By early February 2011, Smith had agreed to remove the term "forcible" from the legislation. When the House passed the bill in a 251-175 vote on May 4, 2011, the legislation allowed federal funding for abortions in all cases of rape. The final version of the bill said such funding was permissible if "(1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself." Ryan and Akin voted for the bill, along with Smith and the other five GOP congressmen from New Jersey. Seven House Democrats from New Jersey voted against the bill. The U.S. Senate never voted on the legislation. Our ruling In a news release, Wisniewski claimed Ryan and Akin co-sponsored legislation "to limit federal funding for abortion to victims of ‘forcible rape.’" It’s accurate that the two congressmen co-sponsored the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, first in July 2010 and again in January 2011. Both original versions of the bill limited federal funding for abortions to pregnancies resulting from "forcible rape" and certain other circumstances. The term "forcible" was later removed from the bill, allowing federal funding for abortions in all cases of rape. But when Ryan and Akin originally signed on, the legislation included the phrase "forcible rape." We rate the statement True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-07792	Road construction bids "are coming in at the lowest in the modern era."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/19/bob-mcdonnell/gov-bob-mcdonnell-says-virginia-road-bids-are-lowe/	It’s an ideal time to build roads, Gov. Bob McDonnell says. He’s telling everyone that interest rates are low, the improvements are badly needed and bids on highway projects are coming in dirt cheap. The arguments have gained traction in the General Assembly. The House and Senate have passed versions of McDonnell’s proposal to accelerate the issuance of $1.8 billion in bonds to fund road projects across Virginia over the next three years. McDonnell, a Republican, set the goal during his State of the Commonwealth Address to the legislature last month. In laying out reasons to speed up borrowing for roads, he said, "Bids on construction are coming in at the lowest in the modern era." We’ve heard supportive legislators repeat McDonnell’s line about bids -- or versions of it -- and wanted to know if it is true. First, we asked for clarification. How does the McDonnell define the "modern era" when it comes to road bids? "He’s talking about a generation, about 20 years," Tucker Martin, the governor’s chief of communications said. So McDonnell is saying bids for road construction are the lowest in about 20 years. Martin said the information came from the Virginia Department of Transportation and urged us to call Malcolm Kerley, the chief engineer. Kerley could not confirm McDonnell’s claim, explaining that VDOT does not keep annual records of the overall rise or fall in state construction bids. "Historically, we haven’t done it," said Kerley, a 40-year employee at VDOT. "I don’t remember anyone asking for it." Kerley acknowledged that last year bids for large state road projects were indeed low. They came in an average 17 percent below VDOT’s projections, he said. VDOT had not tracked the figure prior to 2010. "I don’t know if we’re making history or not," he said. With the construction industry hurting, Kerley said competition among contractors for road work has increased, resulting in lower bids. Last year, about 130 new firms sought to qualify to bid on state highway work, Kerley said. During a normal year, "10 to 20" new companies seek qualification, he added. We called Jeff Southard, executive vice-president of the Virginia Transportation Construction Alliance, a lobby for road contractors. Although he, too, is also convinced bids are coming in low, he had no data to offer other than what VDOT told us. "People are looking for work and it’s very competitive," Southard said. "You see companies that used to do commercial work bidding on highway work. You see a lot more companies coming in from out of state and expanding their geographical boundaries." OK, we’re convinced road prices are good right now. But is there any historical data that will tell us how good? We found a few interesting charts that cast doubt on McDonnell’s claim bids are the best lowest in 20 years. A Bureau of Labor Statistics index shows the cost of highway construction materials went up 98 percent nationally between 1990 and the middle of 2010. The Federal Highway Administration began a quarterly measure of road construction costs in 2003. The index shows that costs at the end of last June -- the latest time available -- plunged 28 percent since the summer of 2008, when oil prices hit all-time highs. Oil is a key ingredient in asphalt. Even with the drop, construction costs at the end of June were not at the low point in the 7 1/2-year history of the index. They were the cheapest prices since March, 2004. A road building cost index for five Western states goes back 20 years -- exactly the span McDonnell referred to in his speech. Since 1990, construction costs in those five states went up an average of 115 percent. Given these indexes and the lack of any historical data in Virginia, is it possible that McDonnell is right and construction bids are coming in the lowest in two decades? Ken Simonson, chief economist for the Associated General Contractors of America, did not want to weigh in specifically on the governor’s claim, citing the dearth of data from Virginia. But he said the indexes we are using are reliable. Simonson said Virginia may not have seen quite the increase in road costs over the last 20 years experienced by the more mountainous Western states. On the other hand, he added that Virginia has not been immune to a steady rise over two decades in the price of road construction materials such as oil, steel, copper and concrete. Let’s review: McDonnell says Virginia’s highway construction bids "are coming in at the lowest of the modern era." His communications chief says the governor was referring to about 20-year time span. McDonnell offers no statistical proof for his claim because such data has never been kept in Virginia. But there is data that undercuts the governor’s claim. A Bureau of Labor Statistics index shows the price of highway construction materials went up 98 percent over the last 20 years. A Federal Highway Administration index shows road construction prices are the lowest in six years. The Western state index shows highway prices have increased by 115 percent since 1990. While circumstantial evidence certainly suggests the governor statement is inaccurate, we can not establish that beyond all reasonable doubt. We rate McDonnell’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00356	"Puerto Rico’s electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely -- you know, it was largely closed."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/13/donald-trump/puerto-ricos-power-grid-was-weak-not-dead-hurrican/	As Hurricane Florence approached, President Donald Trump relied on his track record to assure the public his administration is ready. "I think that Puerto Rico was an incredible, unsung success," Trump told reporters on Sept. 11. Puerto Rico recovered full power in August, 11 months after Hurricane Maria. Trump attributed the struggle to the territory’s floundering power system. "Puerto Rico got hit not with one hurricane but with two (hurricanes)," Trump said. "And the problem with Puerto Rico is their electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely — you know, it was largely closed." "And when the storm hit, they had no electricity — essentially before the storm," Trump said. "And when the storm hit, that took it out entirely." Was the power system dead on arrival? Trump is exaggerating. The White House pointed to the power grid’s state of disrepair. First, there’s a difference between the electric grid and generating plants. Plants produce electricity using fossil fuels or renewable energies, while the grid ensures that power gets to the areas that need it. Jorge Carmacho, a senior policy advisor at Urban Ingenuity who assessed the electric infrastructure damages after the hurricanes for the government of Puerto Rico, estimated roughly 30 percent of the generating plants were not operational before the storm hit. He identified two reasons. One is non-compliance with Environmental Protection Agency rules, which set limits on fossil fuel burning. The other was maintenance, propagated by unprecedented oversight by Puerto Rico’s recently created Energy Commission. One of the main issues they were trying to fix was the grid, which Trump also mentioned. It is run by PREPA, a government utilities program, which is bankrupt, as Trump said. It faces $9 billion of debt. Trump was right in saying it was in very bad shape. But it wasn’t dead or closed. Before the hurricanes hit, all customers were being serviced, according to James Gallagher, executive director of New York State Smart Grid Consortium, which is working to stabilize Puerto Rico’s grid. About 10 to 15 percent of customers lost power after the first hurricane, Irma. But coverage was spotty even before the hurricanes. In 2016, for example, a fire resulted in a three-day blackout. The consulting firm Synapse Energy Economics estimated that on average, customers face a power outage every three months. "PREPA was in bankruptcy," Carmacho said. "That’s true. But were they pushing electrons to people so they could turn on the lights? Yes. Was it reliable? No. it hasn’t been reliable in 20 years. We might have an outage every three days. That has been the norm." The bulk of Puerto Rico’s generating plants are located in the southern part of the island, while consumption is mostly in the north. The complex system that transfers energy from one side to the other forms its Achilles heel during climate disasters like this one, according to Marla Perez Lugo, a sociologist at the University of Puerto Rico focusing on energy policy. Unlike in the United States, where an outage in Ohio can be fixed by connecting to the grid in Illinois, an island electric system relies on reserves, on which Puerto Rico falls short, according to Carmacho. Our ruling Trump said "Puerto Rico’s electric grid and their electric generating plant was dead before the storms ever hit. It was in very bad shape. It was in bankruptcy. It had no money. It was largely -- you know, it was largely closed." Some electric generating plants, not the majority, were inoperative before the storm hit due to maintenance work. The grid was servicing all customers but had important vulnerabilities. Trump's statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

Statistics show that most smokers are "workers", and they will end up paying more tax. Because the increase will constitute a higher proportion of a "worker's" pay, it will have a greater impact on a "worker's" household budget than a higher income earner. But the data also shows that around 80 per cent of "workers" do not smoke and so will not be affected. Given smoking rates are higher among groups of people with other characteristics, such as being unemployed, on Mr Abbott's argument, tobacco excise increases could equally be described as an "tax on the unemployed".

pomt-00875	"I unsealed my records" at Marquette University.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/12/scott-walker/where-are-scott-walkers-student-records/	The circumstances around Gov. Scott Walker's withdrawal from Marquette University were murky enough to arouse questions, more than two decades later, about whether bad grades or misbehavior may have led him to quit school roughly a year short of a degree. Deep dives into Walker's college days by PolitiFact Wisconsin -- and later by national media as he emerged as a Republican presidential hopeful -- showed Walker was in "good standing" when he dropped out in 1990, taking a job with the American Red Cross and running unsuccessfully for the state Assembly. But no actual documents, such as a college transcript, turned up to shed light on Walker’s academic performance or on a controversy involving his run for student government president. Yet on Feb. 27, 2015, while attending the Conservative Political Action Conference outside of Washington, D.C. with other potential White House contenders, Walker suggested there was nothing murky at all about his time at Marquette, a Catholic university in Milwaukee. During an interview with Dana Loesch, a conservative radio and Blaze TV talk show host based in Dallas, Walker made a claim as Loesch prepared to ask a question. "A lot of folks like myself thought it a little elitist -- because everybody’s vetting you now. You’ve already been more vetted than the current commander-in-chief," Loesch said. "Yeah," Walker interjected, with a chuckle. "And more written about my college days than the president. I unsealed my records." Really? 2010 Let’s start with a closer look at Walker’s claim -- that he "unsealed" his records. First, it suggests he did something proactively -- the way presidential candidates often release their tax returns. Second, it clearly suggests the information involved is complete and unfiltered -- that is, the documents themselves. In 2010, during Walker’s successful campaign for governor, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel requested college transcripts from Walker and two other leading candidates, former Republican Congressman Mark Neumann and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat. Neumann and Barrett provided them. Walker refused. Instead, his campaign said Walker had a grade point average of 2.59. (On a 4-point scale, that's in the range of a C-plus or a B-minus.) Walker also released a letter from Marquette that showed he attended the school for four years, from 1986 to 1990, and would have needed to stay there for at least another year to get a degree. 2013 PolitiFact Wisconsin published its article on Walker’s college days in December 2013. At the time, he was gearing up for re-election and raising his national profile, yet the story of his formative political years remained surprisingly disputed. Indeed, Wisconsin Democrats were claiming the governor was "kicked out" of student elections at Marquette (a claim we rated False) -- and maybe was booted from Marquette altogether. The article reported on Walker’s run, as a sophomore, for student government president. After the Marquette Tribune student newspaper endorsed Walker’s opponent, on the day before the election, there were allegations that Walker supporters emptied editions of the Tribune from racks in high-traffic buildings. Walker’s camp denied the allegations, but Walker lost the election. Marquette ordered an investigation, but details of the alleged dumping of the newspapers were not readily available in the public record, much less evidence of who may have been behind the acts. Asked by PolitiFact if he was "forced out" of Marquette for any reason, Walker said: "I can say unequivocally that isn’t true." And PolitiFact found no evidence that he had. But the article made an important point -- that "publicly available documents cannot fully resolve the question, in part because a federal privacy law blocks release of information on former students unless the person consents. In addition, Walker told us he was sticking to an earlier decision not to release his transcript." With that in mind, PolitiFact asked Walker if he would allow Marquette to comment on his academic and conduct record. He did. Marquette confirmed in a statement that Walker was a student from fall of 1986 until spring 1990 and, when he voluntarily withdrew, was a senior in good standing. At Marquette, being in "good standing" means a student is eligible to register and has no academic or non-academic conduct issues restricting registration. PolitiFact then asked Marquette whether any conduct issues were on Walker’s earlier school record, and was told Walker would have to permit release of that information. Walker did so. Walker was in good standing during each term while he was enrolled at Marquette, and was not suspended or expelled at any time, the school said in a letter. The school made clear that Walker had authorized only that limited release of information and only to PolitiFact Wisconsin. In other words, there was no general release or unsealing of documents. 2015 The pattern continued as Walker’s stock as a presidential contender rose. In February 2015, two weeks after lengthy stories about Walker’s college days appeared in the Washington Post and Boston Globe, Walker released a one-sentence letter showing he had authorized Marquette "to confirm my academic standing for each term and that I voluntarily withdrew from Marquette University in good standing in the spring of 1990." Nothing new there. When we contacted the governor’s office for this fact check, spokeswoman Laurel Patrick forwarded us a copy of that letter. When we asked if that meant there had been no unsealing of documents, she replied by saying: "This effectively unseals his records, which is what he said. It gives Marquette University authorization to provide information about his record." But the limited comments Walker allowed Marquette to make about his record, of course, are far from any unsealing of the records themselves. It is more akin to a statement that you paid your taxes on time, rather than producing the returns themselves. Our rating Walker said he "unsealed" his student records at Marquette University. In fact, he has taken only the very limited step of authorizing the school to confirm that he was in "good standing" during his time at Marquette and that he voluntarily withdrew. We haven’t seen any records. We rate Walker’s statement False.

pomt-14906	"‘Dark money’ spending" in the 2016 election cycle "is 10 times what it was at the same point in the 2012 election cycle," when it topped $308 million.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/05/tammy-baldwin/ten-times-more-dark-money-has-been-spent-2016-elec/	Soliciting contributions to her campaign fund, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin warned her supporters about the dangers of "dark money" -- cash spent on elections by groups that don’t have to disclose their donors. In an Oct. 30, 2015 email, the Wisconsin Democrat wrote that groups backed by conservatives such as Karl Rove and the Koch brothers "have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to make sure they get right-wing extremists elected into office. And it’s only getting worse." "Today," Baldwin’s email continued, "dark money spending is 10 times what it was at the same point in the 2012 election cycle. And in 2012, it ended up topping $308 million." Then she asked for a contribution of $5 or more. A year away from the 2016 general election, is dark-money spending already 10 times higher than it was at this point four years ago? The answer, from the source widely acknowledged as the best in this area: Yes. What dark is We consulted the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign finance research group that runs a website called OpenSecrets.org. (Two other groups involved in campaign finance -- the Sunlight Foundation and the Campaign Finance Institute -- also referred us to the center.) Using data from the Federal Election Commission, the Center for Responsive Politics tracks so-called dark-money spending -- that is, expenditures by nonprofit groups, whose primary function is not supposed to be political activity, that don’t have to disclose their donors. Those groups can receive unlimited corporate, individual, or union contributions. They can use the money for various election activities, including buying ads that advocate for or against a candidate, running phone banks and making contributions to super PACs. But they can’t coordinate with or donate money to candidates. Let’s start with 2011 and 2012 -- that is, the 2012 election cycle. 2012 election cycle The center reports that, as Baldwin indicated, more than $308 million in dark money was spent during the entire 2012 election cycle. Some 86 percent was spent by conservative groups, 11 percent by liberal groups and 3 percent by other groups. The most -- $71 million -- was spent by American Crossroads/Crossroads GPS, which was co-founded by Rove. Americans for Prosperity, founded in part by the billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch, was second ($36 million) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was third ($35 million). The three leading liberal groups, as identified by the center, were the League of Conservation Voters ($11 million), Patriot Majority USA ($7 million), whose priorities include money for public schools and infrastructure, and Planned Parenthood (nearly $7 million). 2016 cycle As for the 2016 cycle, $4.88 million in dark money expenditures have already been made, according to the center. That’s more than 10 times the $440,000 that was spent at this point during the 2012 cycle. The $4.88 million has been spent by six groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ($3 million) and Americans for Prosperity ($1.5 million), The only liberal group was Planned Parenthood, which spent just under $75,000 Richard Skinner, policy analyst at the Sunlight Foundation, told us that the focus of early dark money being spent in the 2016 cycle is on U.S. Senate elections that are considered to be competitive, though some is also being spent on U.S. House races. (Baldwin isn’t up for election again until 2018. But Wisconsin’s other senator, Republican Ron Johnson, is rated as being in a "pure toss-up" race in 2016 from Democrat Russ Feingold, whom Johnson defeated in 2010. No dark money has been spent yet in that race, according to the Sunlight Foundation.) Skinner said he didn’t know whether dark money spending so far means that the total for the 2016 cycle will ultimately be 10 times higher than four years earlier. But he said he expects more dark money to spent in the 2016 cycle than ever before. Our rating Baldwin said "dark money spending" in the 2016 election cycle "is 10 times what it was at the same point in the 2012 election cycle," when it topped $308 million. So-called dark money spending in election campaigns -- by groups that don’t have to disclose their donors -- exceeded $308 million in the 2012 election cycle. So far in the 2016 cycle, it has reached nearly $5 million, more than 10 times the $440,000 that had been spent at this point in the 2012 cycle. We rate Baldwin’s statement True.

A page-by-page analysis of the House health care bill argues that reform will end the health care system as we know it: "Page 29: Admission: your health care will be rationed! ... Page 42: The 'Health Choices Commissioner' will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. ... Page 50: All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services." Most of the e-mail's claims are wrong, and you can read our extended analysis to find out why. One of its most bizarre claims is the one about free health care for noncitizens, "illegal or not." We read the bill and its legislative summary, and could find nothing about free health care for anyone, much less noncitizens. To confirm our examination, we turned to Jennifer Tolbert, an independent health care analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan foundation that studies health care reform. Tolbert has read and analyzed all the major health proposals, including those of the Republicans, and the foundation provides point-by-point analyses of the plans on its Web site. "No one's provided with free health care. That's ridiculous," she said. Page 50, which the e-mail references, is part of Section 152, which includes a generic nondiscrimination clause saying that insurers may not discriminate with regard to "personal characteristics extraneous to the provision of high quality health care or related services." The section says nothing about "non-US citizens" or immigrants, legal or otherwise. In fact, the legislation specifically states that "undocumented aliens" will not be eligible for credits to help them buy health insurance, in Section 246 on page 143. The bottom line here is the e-mail is making things up. The bill does not say anything close to "All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services."

pomt-06568	"We have had over 40 days this summer where it was unsafe to breathe the air."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/30/jennette-gayer/how-dangerous-it-breathe-atlanta-air/	For many Atlanta-area residents, 2011 will be remembered as the long, hot -- no, veryhot -- summer. The high temperature climbed past 90 degrees on 66 days this summer, according to the National Weather Service. Officials warned it was dangerously hot on some days. How dangerous was it to be outside, you ask? "We have had over 40 days this summer where it was unsafe to breathe the air," said Jennette Gayer, staff advocate for Georgia Environment, a group with goals of protecting the state’s air, water and natural resources. The claim surprised us since we’ve seen no widespread reports of Georgians being hospitalized or claiming harm from breathing. We thought we’d check this out. Gayer made the statement during a recent meeting at Atlanta City Hall. She was there to speak out about the proposed 1 percent sales tax to pay for about 150 transportation projects in the Atlanta region. A referendum is scheduled for July 2012. Gayer’s remarks to the packed audience of about 200 people in the City Council chamber were focused on her desire to see more projects she thinks may improve air quality, such as a commuter rail line between Atlanta and Griffin. "[W]e need ... more alternatives to cars," Gayer told us in an email. Gayer based her comments on the state Department of Natural Resources, which monitors air quality in the Atlanta region from 10 different locations. The state uses federal guidelines to measure the level of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (at ground level) and sulfur dioxide. The state sets a ratings scale, green for "good" to purple for "very unhealthy." Some observers contend the ratings are based on flawed conclusions about the impact of pollutants on the environment. Susan Zimmer-Dauphinee, who is in charge of running the state’s monitoring system, said there have been 38 days this year where air quality levels were labeled as "unhealthy" or "code orange." The unhealthy rating is primarily for groups such as young children, the elderly and those with asthma or other respiratory conditions. So is it stretching the truth to say there have been 40 days this summer when it was "unsafe" to breathe the air because the code orange doesn’t include all groups? "The young, the elderly and people with existing respiratory problems would definitely be most impacted, but more and more research is pointing to even healthy adults experiencing problems," Gayer said. Gayer believes the current air quality standards should be strengthened, pointing to arguments from some scientists who lobbied the federal Environmental Protection Agency on that point. The Obama administration earlier this month reversed course on some clean air regulations aimed at reducing smog. Some congressional leaders worried the tougher air quality standards would hurt businesses in the struggling economy. Arthur Winer, former director of UCLA’s Environmental Science and Engineering Program, said Gayer could have been more precise. "In general, the air quality standards and health alerts are focused on the most vulnerable populations, rather than the general public," said Winer, who says he has written more than 200 journal articles and book chapters on air pollution and related topics over the past 30 years. "However, to be rigorous, it would probably have been better if this person had said ‘there were 40 days this summer in which it was unsafe to breathe the air for small children, the elderly and people with respiratory illnesses like asthma.’ " To be more technical, the state’s chart shows 18 of those days were in May and early June, before the official start of summer. Gayer said she based her comments at the meeting on Atlanta’s smog season, which begins May 1 and ends Sept. 30. Gayer’s comment was generally accurate -- with an emphasis on generally. But it also leaves out some key details. We rate it Half True.	None	Jennette Gayer	None	None	None	2011-09-30T06:00:00	2011-09-15	['None']

pomt-06009	Says she got unions to agree to "about $10 million in reduction" of salaries and health benefits while serving as Dane County executive in Wisconsin.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/18/kathleen-falk/possible-recall-challenger-wisconsin-gov-scott-wal/	Bracing for a likely recall election in 2012, Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker tells voters in a TV ad that he saved them "hundreds of millions of dollars" by making public employees pay more toward their pensions and health insurance. In contrast, one of Walker’s potential challengers, Democrat Kathleen Falk, was asked on a Milwaukee public affairs show that aired Jan. 8, 2012 whether she worries about being perceived as "the public employee union candidate." Mike Gousha, host of the WISN-TV show, posed the question after alluding to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report that said two state union leaders tried to help clear the Democratic field for Falk by discouraging Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett from running in a recall. Falk, who resigned from her post as Dane County executive in April 2011, answered Gousha by saying she’d had her own success in Madison in curbing public employee costs. "Well, you know what I've done as the county executive for 14 years," said Falk. "When times got tough, I sat down with eight unions and bargained about $10 million in reduction of their salaries and health benefits by them, voluntarily at the collective bargaining table, agreeing to that." Falk was drawing a pointed contrast. She used collective bargaining with unions to achieve savings on employee costs, while Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature used legislation to force most state and local employees to pay more for benefits. But let’s check Falk’s more specific claim -- that she reduced salaries and health benefits of Dane County employees by about $10 million. We asked Falk spokeswoman Melissa Mulliken for evidence. She provided comments attributed to Dane County director of administration Travis Myren that detailed $9.4 million in reductions, so we decided to contact him directly. Myren has been director of administration since being promoted from deputy director by Falk in April 2009. Myren said the $9.4 million in savings were the result of three Falk initiatives that were agreed to by public employee unions and then applied to non-union employees, so that all 2,200 county workers were covered. He also cited a fourth agreement that would put the savings over $10 million. 2009: Temporary pay cut -- $3.6 million Falk and the employee unions agreed to cut wages 5 percent for six months, saving $3.6 million. The deal was approved by the county Board of Supervisors in June 2009. In exchange, employees got 48 additional hours of "personal leave" time -- paid time off that had to be taken within certain deadlines. The only way that could create a cost to the county is if employees used that additional leave instead of vacation days, banked those unused vacation days and then were paid in cash for them upon terminating their employment with the county, Myren said. He said there is no way to estimate how much, if any, such payouts the county might one day make. So, the county saved $3.6 million with the 2009 pay cut, though it could face some higher cash payouts for vacation days down the road. 2010: Temporary pay cut -- $4.7 million After the 5 percent pay cut expired, putting salaries back at their previous level, Falk and the unions agreed to cut pay 3 percent for one year, saving $4.7 million. That deal was approved by the County Board in December 2009. In exchange, the county agreed to no layoffs in 2010 and a number of other benefit enhancements, including 64 more hours of personal leave; increasing by 50 the number of hours employees can bank in sick leave, which can be used to buy health insurance after retirement; and senior employees got three extra vacation days per year. So, although the county granted some benefit improvements, it saved another $4.7 million in salaries with the 2010 pay cut. 2011: Health insurance changes -- $1.1 million A new employee contract for 2012 through 2014 require employees to pay more for their health benefits. For example, a co-pay for doctor office visits was created and higher deductibles are imposed for certain services. The changes were approved by the County Board in January 2011. Myren said the changes reduced the county’s premiums by $900,000 and the additional employee contributions are projected to save another $200,000, for a total savings of $1.1 million for 2012. In exchange, the county agreed to remove a cap on the pension contributions it makes for employees -- potentially exposing the county to higher pension costs through 2014. Pension funding for Wisconsin public employees is somewhat complicated. A formula, which changes annually, determines what percentage of an employee’s salary is to be contributed to the pension by the employer and what percentage by the employee. However, Dane County, as many public employers in Wisconsin have long done, makes both contributions; in 2011, the employee portion was 5.8 percent of the employee’s salary. Under the 2012-2014 contract, the county agreed to eliminate a 6.5 percent cap on the employee contribution that was in the previous contract. So, if the pension funding formula changes and puts the employee contribution higher than 6.5 percent, the county would have a higher pension cost than under the previous contract. State pension figures show the employee contribution for most public employees -- including all non-elected Dane County employees -- was 5 percent from 1989 through 2011, but that it rose to 5.9 percent in 2012 after the Walker-led legislation took effect. Starting in 2015, after the current contract ends, Dane County employees will be subject to the Walker-led collective bargaining legislation and will be forced to contribute to their pensions. So, the county is exposing itself to potentially higher pension costs through 2014 in exchange for $1.1 million in immediate health insurance savings. "Voluntary leave without pay" program The two pay cuts and the health insurance savings total $9.4 million in reductions in salaries and health benefits -- or, more precisely, the cost of health benefits. That’s just short of the "about $10 million" claimed by Falk. But Myren said another Falk initiative negotiated with the unions -- "voluntary leaves" -- also should be considered. Voluntary leaves -- which differ from personal leaves in that they are days off without pay -- were created in 2003. Through 2011, personal leaves saved the county $1.45 million, Myren said. That would put the total Falk-led employee savings at nearly $11 million. We ran all of this past two of Falk’s political foes on the Dane County Board, supervisors Eileen Bruskewitz and Ronn Ferrell. They described Falk as a friend of public employee unions, pointing out that under the current contract she negotiated, union employees got 3 percent raises at the end of 2011; and that, unlike other local governments, the county can't use until 2015 the Walker legislation to put a greater share of health and pension costs onto employees. But they didn’t dispute the fact that her agreements with the unions saved about $10 million. Our conclusion Falk said she used collective bargaining to reduce Dane County employee salaries and health benefits by "about $10 million." The deals create the possibility that the county will have higher payouts for pensions and vacations in future years, but that is not certain. What is known is that the deals have saved the county more than $10 million in salaries and health benefit costs. We rate Falk’s statement True.

pomt-00921	"In general, it appears" Wisconsin’s right to work bill would "likely apply to" the Green Bay Packers players and their union.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/27/jon-erpenbach/would-wisconsins-right-work-bill-affect-green-bay-/	On Feb. 23, 2015, the night before a hearing that would draw some 2,000 protesters to Madison, state Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) added intrigue to what was already a quarrelsome issue: so-called right to work legislation. Erpenbach, who opposes a Wisconsin right-to-work bill introduced earlier the same day, did a Facebook posting that raised this question: Would the bill -- the object of scorn among some employee unions but almost certain to become law -- affect the beloved Green Bay Packers? As we found in an analysis of polling on right to work, there is a general lack of knowledge among the public about right-to-work laws, which block companies and workers from signing labor contracts that require employees to pay union dues. Of course, in contrast, most folks in Wisconsin know an awful lot about, and have plenty of passion for, the Packers. Indeed, one of the Capitol protesters carried a sign that read: "R-T-W Kills The Green Bay Packers Union." So, is Erpenbach right? Let's start by noting that players for the Green Bay Packers and the other National Football League teams must join the NFL Players Association. (Although, like members of similar unions, they can request refunds for the portion of their dues that are used for political purposes, as opposed to the cost of operating the union.) Under Wisconsin’s right-to-work bill, which Gov. Scott Walker has said he would sign, the Packers players could opt not to join the union. Erpenbach's Facebook posting was a two-paragraph memo written by an attorney with the Wisconsin Legislative Council about the Republican-backed right to work bill. The council is a nonpartisan state agency that responds to legal and policy research questions from lawmakers. "Sen. Erpenbach asked whether these provisions of the bill apply to employees of professional sports teams in Wisconsin, such as the Green Bay Packers, and the labor organizations representing those employees," the memo concluded. "In general, it appears that the provisions likely apply to such employees and labor organizations." The author of the memo, Jessica Karls-Ruplinger, confirmed to us that that was her conclusion. And Marquette University law professor Paul Secunda, who directs the law school’s labor and employment law program, told us he agrees that the bill would apply to pro athletes and their unions. But Secunda, a self-described vocal opponent of right to work and an avid sports fan, said he believes the Wisconsin measure would hurt many Wisconsin workers. But it is "likely not to have impact on professional sport unions," he said. That's true for several reasons, he said: Those unions are small and their solidarity is strong; union dues are a tiny percentage of player salaries; the unions have won many things for players, such as pensions and minimum salaries; Moreover, even in long-term right-to-work states such as Georgia, there have never been instances of players on a wide scale opting not to pay union dues. A spokesman for the NFL Players Association, which is part of the AFL-CIO, didn’t respond to our calls. The union did issue a statement opposing the bill, saying "devoted food and commercial workers who spend their Sundays servicing our players and fans at Lambeau Field will have their well-being and livelihood jeopardized by right to work." And in an interview with the Capital Times of Madison, the union’s executive director, DeMaurice Smith, also didn’t raise such concerns. Twelve of the NFL's 32 teams are in states that have right-to-work laws, which means players in those states can't be compelled to pay union dues to keep their job, the article said. But Smith said that hasn't been a significant issue for the union, according to the article. (Unions representing Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League each issued statements that echoed the views of the NFLPA. But like the NFLPA statement, neither expressed concerns for the players unions themselves.) Erpenbach, meanwhile, told us he requested the memo because most of the discussion about Wisconsin’s right to work bill had centered on trade unions and he wondered if it would apply to pro athletes. But the lawmaker acknowledged he didn't know whether the bill would have any practical effects on the Packers players or their union. Our rating Erpenbach said: "In general, it appears" Wisconsin’s right to work bill would "likely apply to" the Green Bay Packers players and their union. The nonpartisan state Legislative Council arrived at that conclusion -- though, as a practical matter, it’s not clear the bill would have any noticeable effect on the players union. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-03189	Half of Oregon university students are on Pell Grants.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/aug/31/jim-francesconi/are-half-oregon-university-students-pell-grants/	As a member of the Oregon State Board of Higher Education, former Portland city Commissioner Jim Francesconi recently wrote a guest column on the importance of a university degree. He urged more public and private support of low-income students going to college. We’ve already checked one of the statistics Francesconi cited in his column, about the percentage of poor children in Oregon. Now, we turn to an assertion about Pell grants, the federal program for financially needy students. "Education after high school is the way, but it is out of reach for many children, especially in rural Oregon. Nearly half of Oregon's children are poor. Half of Oregon university students are on Pell Grants. The average student debt is more than $25,000." We figured this would be a straightforward check: Are half of Oregon university students receiving Pell grants? The Federal Pell Grant Program helps undergraduate students with money awards that don’t have to be paid back. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the maximum award for the 2013-14 school year is $5,645. Nationally, more than 9 million students received Pell aid in 2011-12. Pell grants can be an indication of how well a university fares in educating and graduating students from across the economic spectrum. We assume that Francesconi is speaking of students in the Oregon University System, as he is a board member writing about the importance of making state universities accessible to residents. We’re also thinking that he’s limiting himself even further to students who graduate from Oregon high schools. More on that later. We turned to our trusty "OUS Fact Book," which gives details of Oregon’s seven public universities. There were nearly 85,500 undergraduates counted in fall 2012.There were nearly 28,900 students who received Pell grants in 2012-13. Our calculator tells us that’s 34 percent, not half. We checked with College Insight, affiliated with the Institute for College Access & Success, for a national take. For 2010-11, it says 31 percent of undergraduates at Oregon’s four-year public universities received Pell grants. That’s higher than in Washington, which is at 25 percent, and lower than in California, which reports that roughly 42 percent of undergraduates at public universities received Pell grants. Nationally, the statistic is 34 percent. In any case, 31 percent or 34 percent is not 50 percent. What gives? We turned to the university system, and its data expert Bob Kieran, who is Assistant Vice Chancellor for Institutional Research and Planning at Oregon University System. Kieran said Francesconi is accurate because, in 2010-11, the university system awarded bachelor’s degrees to more than 11,100 Oregonians. More than 5,500 of those graduates had received Pell grant money at some point in college. That’s just about half. "Half our undergraduates are not necessarily receiving a Pell award in any given term or year, but half of the Oregonians receiving a bachelor’s degree have benefited from a Pell award during their academic program within OUS," Kieran wrote in an initial email. Francesconi confirmed using the statistic cited by Kieran to back up his statement. "Half of students are on Pell Grants during their college years and I will leave it to you and your readers to determine the significance of the difference," Francesconi wrote in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. We admit it. We were really confused. To us, that 50 percent of students who graduated in one year relied on Pell grants sometime during college is not the same thing as saying that 50 percent of Oregon university students are on Pell grants at any given time. Those are different measurements. Francesconi’s statement, at this point, was not accurate. The Fact Book numbers didn’t show he was right, and the statistic he relied on did not prove his statement right. We persisted. In a follow-up email, Kieran then explained that the 34 percent Pell grant figure is inaccurate because it’s based on a larger universe of students, including those from abroad or out of state. He said we should focus on Oregon residents since the gist of Francesconi’s op-ed is to encourage ways to help Oregon students thrive in higher education. That number, he said, is this: In fall 2012, nearly 25,000 of nearly 55,000 resident undergraduates enrolled received Pell grants. That’s 45 percent -- which is much closer to 50 percent. We asked Kieran to calculate for previous years. In 2007, 30 percent of resident undergraduates were on Pell grants; in 2010, the figure was 43 percent and in 2011, 45 percent. As you can see, nearing the 50 percent mark is a recent development. A side note here. We don’t doubt Francesconi’s sincerity in urging greater investment in public education. Still, we think it important to get the numbers right when making a point. For example, Francesconi also wrote that the average student graduates with $25,000 in debt. That would only apply to the 59 percent of students who graduate with debt. We know because we checked a similar statement by Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and another higher education board member pointed out that 41 percent of OUS students graduate with no debt. Now, we return to our regular program. Francesconi said that half of Oregon university students are needy enough to be on Pell grants. This is within the ballpark of accurate if you limit the count to Oregon residents at Oregon’s public universities. And we can accept these qualifiers given the overall thrust of his guest column -- even as we find the original explanation provided by the speaker and university system to be seriously flawed. Last year’s snapshot figures show that 45 percent of Oregon resident undergraduates were on Pell grants, up from 30 percent in 2007. The Oregon University System eventually unearthed statistics to back up Francesconi’s statement, making it accurate but requiring clarification and additional information. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Jim Francesconi	None	None	None	2013-08-31T06:00:00	2013-08-07	['Oregon']
pomt-14848	Climate change is "directly related" to the growth of terrorism.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/16/bernie-sanders/fact-checking-bernie-sanders-comments-climate-chan/	The Democratic debate in Iowa began with a moment of silence for the victims of the Paris terror attacks before pivoting to a discussion on how to address terrorism. Bernie Sanders, who vowed to "rid our planet" of ISIS in his opening statement, also said at a previous debate that the greatest threat to national security is climate change. A day after the terrorist attacks, did he, asked moderator John Dickerson, still believe that? "Absolutely. In fact, climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism," Sanders said on Nov. 14. "If we do not get our act together and listen to what the scientists say, you’re gonna see countries all over the world — this is what the CIA says — they’re going to be struggling over limited amounts of water, limited amounts of land to grow their crops, and you’re going to see all kinds of international conflict." A day later on CBS’ Face the Nation, Sanders doubled down on his statement, elaborating, "When people migrate into cities and they don't have jobs, there's going to be a lot more instability, a lot more unemployment, and people will be subject to the types of propaganda that al-Qaida and ISIS are using right now." We were curious about the link between climate change and terrorism that Sanders highlighted. While there is a body of literature backing his broader point that climate change contributes to the growth of terrorism, Sanders is overstating the "direct" connection. A complicated relationship The Sanders camp referred us to statements from President Barack Obama and leaders of the defense community, as well as a Defense Department report that suggests indirect links between climate change and terrorism: • Obama in a May 2015 speech: "Understand, climate change did not cause the conflicts we see around the world. Yet what we also know is that severe drought helped to create the instability in Nigeria that was exploited by the terrorist group Boko Haram." • The Defense Department in a 2014 report: "In our defense strategy, we refer to climate change as a ‘threat multiplier’ because it has the potential to exacerbate many of the challenges we are dealing with today — from infectious disease to terrorism. We are already beginning to see some of these impacts." • Adm. Samuel J. Locklear, then-commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, said in 2013 that the significant upheaval related to the warming planet "is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen … that will cripple the security environment." We found a few other federal and academic reports naming climate change a threat to national security, but that’s not the same thing as "directly related to the growth of terrorism." That’s not to say that climate change isn’t contributing to existing problems. Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley used more accurate language when he said, "One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation-state of Syria and the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that region, wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis." We rated his comments Mostly True. Sanders was more sweeping in his comments, though. "I wouldn’t have said it as strongly, but (climate change) is an accelerant to conflict and helps produce instability," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the national security think tank the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. "Within the national security sphere, more and more see climate change as a real problem. They would agree with the broader point." Climate change, however, is not "hermetically sealed from other risks," writes Francesco Femia and Caitlin Werrell of the Center for Climate and Security in a blog post. "The impacts of climate change interact with other factors to make existing security risks worse." That’s why experts and the Pentagon prefer the term "threat multiplier." Here’s how: Climate change can lead to food and water scarcity, which may in turn increase poverty, the spread of disease, and mass migration — in short, instability. In places with already weakened governments, this breeds the conditions for terrorism to thrive. Factors that contribute to terrorism Of course, there are myriad conditions that motivate terrorism. Ideology and political interests are much more direct factors, according to Michael Doran, who served on the National Security Council and in the Defense Department under President George W. Bush. The latest Global Terrorism Index report lists political, nationalist and separatist movements as well as weak political systems and a lack of political legitimacy as main drivers. It found that countries with high levels of terrorism share three "statistically significant factors": • Hostility between different ethnic, religious and linguistic groups; • State-sponsored violence such as extrajudicial killings, political terrors and high levels of group grievances; • Violence from organized conflict, demonstrations and crime, and perceptions of criminality. According to the Global Terrorism report, 66 percent of deaths from terrorist attacks in 2013 were caused by four extremist groups: ISIS, Boko Haram, the Taliban and al-Qaida. Their commonality is, obviously, religious extremism. Our ruling Sanders said, "Climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism." We couldn’t find any evidence of a "direct" relationship between climate change and terrorism, though many reports have noted an indirect link. There are, of course, many other factors that contribute to terrorism, including religious and ethnic tensions and political repression. We rate Sanders' claim Mostly False.

pomt-00366	Says Beto O’Rourke's campaign "told Texas VFW to remove their American flag" because O'Rourke has "an aversion to the American flag and symbols of patriotism."	mostly false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/12/blog-posting/orourke-campaign-request-remove-american-flag-rall/	Two people asked to take down the American and Texas flags before a campaign rally in Navasota, Texas, but whether they were with the candidate’s campaign is unclear. Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke held a town hall at the Navasota Veterans of Foreign Wars post on Aug. 25. O’Rourke is looking to unseat one-term incumbent and 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz in the 2018 midterm election. The Navasota Examiner article about the rally quoted the VFW post commander Carl Dry about a request he says he received while the O’Rourke campaign was setting up for the event. "They wanted to open the doors (to the Flight Deck Lounge), and I couldn’t allow that, and they wanted to take the flags down. I didn’t only say no, I said hell no, you don’t take the flags off the wall," Dry is quoted saying in the newspaper. "I can’t believe any American would ask us to do that, and I don’t know why he wanted them down or what he was going to put up instead." Websites such as TopStoriesUSA.com picked up Dry’s quote in early September, saying that the O’Rourke campaign had made the flag removal request and that the request showed a theme of the campaign’s "aversion to the American flag" and patriotic symbols. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its newsfeed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) TopStoriesUSA.com editor Vic Medina attributed the content of the site’s story "Beto O’Rourke Campaign told Texas VFW to remove their American flag" to The Examiner report. "Dry does not identify specifically who on O'Rourke's campaign made the request, or if O'Rourke himself made the request of him," Medina said. The O’Rourke campaign didn't respond to our inquiry, but the campaign has denied making the request to remove the flags before the rally. "Our campaign absolutely did not request that any flags be removed or taken down from the walls," campaign spokesman Chris Evans wrote in an email to the Bryan-College Station Eagle newspaper. "It is incorrect to say that we did. We have hosted dozens of town halls in VFW posts across the state, and always ensure that the flags are prominently and respectfully displayed." Dry told us two people, about 10 minutes apart, asked him to remove the American and Texas flags before the event. He said they were not wearing name tags or other identifiers related to the O’Rourke campaign. Dry said he assumed the two individuals were part of the campaign because they came to him from the room where the event was being held and returned to it after he told the first "no," and the second "hell, no." "I had to assume they were Mr. O’Rourke’s campaign people," Dry said. "Whether they were or not, I don’t know. I did not ask." The TopStoriesUSA.com story also speculates that "there seems to be an aversion to the American flag and symbols of patriotism" with O’Rourke’s campaign and that the event "was attracting some that might have been offended to see the American and Texas flags on display behind O’Rourke." O’Rourke’s campaign is not distancing itself from the American flag. The most prominent image on the campaign website’s homepage is a photo of O’Rourke, with the American flag behind him. He performed at a July 4 concert this year with Willie Nelson in front of the flag. There are also numerous photos and videos on social media of him speaking in front of the American and Texas flags from other events this summer. It’s not unreasonable to assume, as Dry did, that the people who asked to "take down" the American flags at the Aug. 25 rally were from the O’Rourke campaign. But it is an assumption, and furthermore it’s not clear why they were asking: It’s possible they wanted to move them to another location or feature them in some other way. We can say that the campaign definitely does not show an "aversion" to the flag or to patriotic symbols, as it has used them in many other settings. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-09706	Research shows the employer mandate in the House health reform bill would "place millions 'at substantial risk of unemployment' — with minority workers losing their jobs at twice the rate of their white counterparts."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/04/house-republicans/republicans-study-employer-mandate-health/	A few months ago, a chain e-mail purporting to be a line-by-line analysis of the House health care reform bill reached in-boxes all over the country, warning people of the dire consequences of the Democratic plans for reform. Taking a page from the same playbook, the House Republican Conference has created a similar list for the new health care bill that will be coming to the House floor in the next few weeks. You can read our fact-check of the Republican analysis in its entirety. Here, we're looking only at the statement, "Page 313 - Section 512 imposes an 8 percent 'tax on jobs' for firms that cannot afford to purchase 'bureaucrat-approved' health coverage; according to an analysis by Harvard Professor Kate Baicker, such a tax would place millions 'at substantial risk of unemployment'—with minority workers losing their jobs at twice the rate of their white counterparts." This point refers to the House bill's employer mandate, which requires large employers to offer health insurance for their workers. (This is a major difference with the Senate bill, which is not expected to include an employer mandate.) So the House bill does tax employers that don't offer insurance. The Republicans say that Baicker's research shows that millions would be at risk for unemployment, and her research does show that. But the number of people who would actually lose their jobs, according to her projections, is much smaller. Baicker and co-author Helen Levy identified workers who lacked insurance and whose wages are so close to the minimum wage that employers will not be able to reduce their pay in order to pay for health insurance. That pool of uninsured, low-wage workers is 5.5 million. Of those, however, she concluded that a much smaller number — 224,284 — were "likely" to lose their jobs. And about 136,342 were likely to be racial and ethnic minorities, she concluded. Baicker and Levy also wrote that those numbers would be fewer if small employers were exempt from the mandate. And the House bill does just that: It exempts employers with a payroll of less than $500,000. We contacted Baicker, who also added the following note of clarification: "Our estimates were done years ago and were meant to model a stylized mandate policy, not any of the actual policies under consideration at the moment. The effect on employment will be driven by a lot of the details, such as which workers are included based on number of hours worked and which firms are included based on firm size." So the House Republican Conference takes a study that looked at a general policy, not the details of the current House bill. Additionally, the exemption for small employers would reduce the number of workers who would be at risk for losing their jobs. So we rate this statement Half True.

pomt-13784	Says Donald Trump "always pays his bills promptly."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/20/phil-ruffin/businessman-friend-donald-trump-says-he-always-pay/	Phil Ruffin, a Las Vegas casino magnate, took to the podium at the Republican National Convention on July 20 on behalf of his friend and business associate Donald Trump. At one point in his address, Ruffin said of Trump, "He always pays his bills promptly. You won't hear that. Promptly, no discounts." However, that assertion clashes with an extensive investigation by USA Today, which ran a story in June headlined, "Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn’t pay his bills." Here’s the crux of that USA Today story: "(We) found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades — and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans … who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them. "At least 60 lawsuits, along with hundreds of liens, judgments, and other government filings reviewed by the USA Today Network, document people who have accused Trump and his businesses of failing to pay them for their work. Among them: a dishwasher in Florida. A glass company in New Jersey. A carpet company. A plumber. Painters. Forty-eight waiters. Dozens of bartenders and other hourly workers at his resorts and clubs, coast to coast. Real estate brokers who sold his properties. And, ironically, several law firms that once represented him in these suits and others. ... "The actions in total paint a portrait of Trump’s sprawling organization frequently failing to pay small businesses and individuals, then sometimes tying them up in court and other negotiations for years. In some cases, the Trump teams financially overpower and outlast much smaller opponents, draining their resources. Some just give up the fight, or settle for less; some have ended up in bankruptcy or out of business altogether." One example alleged by USA Today was that of Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr., who had a $400,000 contract with Trump to build several types of furniture for his casinos in Atlantic City in the 1980s. "The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward’s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort’s builder," USA Today reported. "Edward’s son, Paul, who was the firm’s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came. ‘That began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company … which has been around since my grandfather,’ he said." Trump and his daughter Ivanka spoke to USA Today for the story, saying that if someone wasn’t paid fully, it was because Trump or his executives were dissatisfied with the work. "Let’s say that they do a job that’s not good, or a job that they didn’t finish, or a job that was way late. I’ll deduct from their contract, absolutely," Trump told USA Today. "That’s what the country should be doing." Trump also acknowledged to Reuters that he sometimes "renegotiates" with vendors. "I'll do that with probably 10 or 15 percent of contractors," he told Reuters. USA Today noted that "Trump and his companies have prevailed in many legal disputes over missing payments, or reached settlements that cloud the terms reached by the parties." However, the newspaper added that some cases are of recent vintage. "Just last month, Trump Miami Resort Management LLC settled with 48 servers at his Miami golf resort over failing to pay overtime for a special event," the newspaper wrote. "The settlements averaged about $800 for each worker and as high as $3,000 for one, according to court records." Neither the Trump campaign nor a public relations firm for one of Ruffin’s properties, the Treasure Island casino in Las Vegas, replied to a request for comment for this article. We should note that Ruffin’s prepared remarks differ in a small but important way. According to prepared remarks distributed by the Trump campaign shortly before his speech, Ruffin was supposed to say, "I believed in him, and for three tough years we worked together to keep (their joint project) afloat. Through it all, Donald always paid his bills promptly, with no discounts." The italicized sentence from the prepared remarks refers specifically to Ruffin’s personal dealings with Trump on their project in Las Vegas -- a much narrower universe of business dealings than the sweeping statement Ruffin actually offered from the podium in Cleveland. In a case like this, PolitiFact considers the spoken words to be more important, since they are heard by millions of people on live television. And they are contradicted by the USA Today report. Our ruling Ruffin said that Donald Trump "always pays his bills promptly." But the USA Today investigation found a large number of lawsuits -- at least 60, plus hundreds of liens, judgments and other filings -- because people have accused Trump of failing to pay for services rendered or products delivered. The complaints even come from law firms that had formerly represented Trump in these types of lawsuits. "Always" is a strong word, so if even just a tiny fraction of the cases uncovered by USA Today are accurate, that would be enough to make Ruffin’s statement incorrect.

pomt-11905	On preserving 60-vote threshold to end a Senate filibuster.	full flop	/texas/statements/2017/oct/20/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-flip-flops-60-senate-votes-end-filibuster/	U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, famous and infamous for his 2013 filibuster-like talk-a-thon that included his reading a Dr. Seuss story to his daughters watching from home, no longer favors preserving a rule that makes it hard to stop filibusters. Did the Texas senator flip-flop? We inquired. In the 100-person Senate, a filibuster (from a Dutch word meaning pirate) can’t be broken unless the senator in the spotlight gives way or foes raise 60 votes to invoke "cloture," bringing debate to a close. Senators set that threshold, which breaks out to a three-fifths majority, in 1975. For decades before, according to a Senate web page, it had taken a two-thirds vote to invoke cloture. Cruz, a Republican lawyer, said in 2015 he wouldn’t support elimination of the 60-vote hurdle--even to advance his goal of repealing the Obamacare law put in place by Democrats. According to a Roll Call news story, Cruz initially told Heritage Action’s Jan. 12, 2015, policy summit that Republicans should do "everything humanly possible to repeal Obamacare." But, the story said, Cruz said afterward he believed Senate Republicans, while in the majority, shouldn’t eliminate the filibuster as a tactic to get more legislation to then-President Barack Obama. "No, we should not," Cruz said. "We should preserve the procedural protections in the Senate for the rights of the minority." Cruz then borrowed an analogy used by the framers of the Constitution by saying the Senate is "like the saucer under the tea cup to cool deliberations, and I think those checks and balances were inspired. And one of the ways to limit rash decision-making is the requirement in the Senate of a 60-vote threshold to overcome a filibuster." In September 2017, though, according to a Texas Tribune news story, Cruz said at a Texas tea-party forum that he’s changed his mind and now favors an end to the 60-vote threshold to end a filibuster. At the forum, the story says, Cruz was asked whether, like President Donald Trump, he supports ending the filibuster rule. The story said Cruz called for ending the filibuster rule, acknowledging it is an "issue on which I’ve changed my mind over the last five years." We asked Cruz spokesman Phil Novack if Cruz’s position had changed. Yes, Novack replied, pointing us by email to a Facebook-posted video of the Sept. 30, 2017, NE Tarrant Tea Party meeting where Cruz was asked about eliminating the 60-vote threshold. At the meeting, Cruz replied, to applause: "Long and short out of it, I would end the 60-vote filibuster right now." His answer went on: "Now let me give you some context on that because that’s actually an issue on which I’ve changed my mind over the last five years. "So if you’d asked me five years ago, I would have had a different answer. And the reason is as follows: I think over time, the 60-vote threshold for legislation has had a small ‘c’ conservative effect in that it has slowed down the operation of Congress. Since World War II, we’ve had three Democratic super-majorities: the first gave us the New Deal; the second gave us the Great Society; the third gave us Obamacare and Dodd-Frank. "So, getting rid of the filibuster means any time there’s a Democratic majority, you have a Democratic supermajority. So a lot of bad legislation would pass without the 60-vote threshold. So, if you’d asked me five years ago, I would have said no, I don’t think we should get rid of it because it slows down bad legislation at a time when the Democrats are in control. "Why have I changed my mind? Because I don’t believe Democrats will be bound by it. I ...think the next time the Democrats have a majority, particularly with a Democratic president, I think they’ll end the filibuster in a hurry. So if I believed it were a credible threat, that it actually would restrain Democrats in the future, then I might well support keeping it now. I don’t." Cruz’s reply closed with a comment including a word we couldn’t make out: "I think it’s stupid that it’s a one-way (unintelligible), that it only limits us, it doesn’t limit them." Our ruling Cruz once favored keeping the 60-vote requirement to end a Senate filibuster. He no longer does. On the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter, that’s a FULL FLOP.

pomt-06354	Says "over the last 48 years, every governor at the midterm of his first term or her first term has lost seats in the Legislature, with the exception of Jim McGreevey in 2003."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/06/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-nearly-every-governor-more-48-/	Even if nothing changes, Tuesday’s election would be a historic win for Republicans. Gov. Chris Christie said in a recent radio interview that decades of history show governors lose seats in their first midterm election. But he said this year will be different. "Over the last 48 years, every governor at the midterm of his first term or her first term has lost seats in the Legislature, with the exception of Jim McGreevey in 2003, who was working off a newly gerrymandered map," Christie said Oct. 26 on WCBS 880 AM. Christie said the Republicans face a gerrymandered map this year, "gerrymandered in favor of the Democrats" "But despite that we're going to make history. You will not see the Republican party lose seats ... in two weeks. And my prediction is you'll see us gain seats," he said. All 120 seats in the state Legislature are on the line Tuesday. Of those, Democrats hold 71 and Republicans hold 49. As Tuesday approaches, Christie -- and his party -- have repeated in public speeches and internal memos the claim about historical midterm losses. PolitiFact New Jersey found it’s true. Since Richard Hughes, a Democrat, took office in 1962, the governor’s party has lost seats in the Legislature in the governor’s first midterm election. McGreevey, also a Democrat, is the only exception. Some New Jersey governors faced worse losses than others. William Cahill lost 26 Republican seats in the 1971 election. Fellow Republican Christine Todd Whitman lost two seats in 1995. In 1991, Republicans gained control of 31 Democratic seats in Jim Florio’s first -- and last -- midterm election. Fellow Democrat Jon Corzine lost one legislative seat to Republicans in 2007 in what would also be his only midterm election. McGreevey picked up six Democratic seats in the state Legislature in 2003. He was the first governor to gain seats since Robert Meyner, a Democrat, did in the 1950s. This trend is not unique to New Jersey. Since Harry Truman became president in 1945, the president has lost seats in Congress in the midterm of his first term, except George W. Bush in 2002. So what gives? The public has a somewhat schizophrenic attitude toward politicians, said John Weingart, associate director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. On one hand the public thinks "they are all useless, at best," he said. On the other hand the public expects "great things from them. And then there is a disappointment when they’re not able to change the world in two years or four years." Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said "governors typically come in on a wave and when the governor is no longer at the top of the ticket some of the people who were elected during the gubernatorial election might not be as strong." They "ride in on somebody’s coattails and then you don’t have the coattails anymore," he said. But, Dworkin said, the Republicans have "have been downplaying expectations" and have positioned themselves "to be able to spin a positive message regardless of what the results are" on Tuesday. "If the Republicans just stay even," it’s a victory, he said. But if the Republicans "win one or two or potentially five or six seats" between the Senate and Assembly it’s a "huge, huge victory, even if they don’t take control of the Legislature." Our ruling Christie said for more than 48 years, every governor of New Jersey has lost legislative seats at the midterm of his or her first term, with the exception of McGreevey in 2003. Besides McGreevey, you have to go back to the the 1950s to find a governor who has picked up legislative seats from his or her party in the first midterm election. We rate Christie’s statement True.

pomt-13537	On drilling off the Atlantic coast	full flop	/virginia/statements/2016/aug/29/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-reverses-stance-offshore-drilling/	Republicans say Tim Kaine is melding his views to match those of the Democratic presidential ticket he joined recently. In an Aug. 15 post, the Republican National Committee accused Kaine of flip-flopping on several issues. Tops on their list is Kaine’s position on offshore drilling. "Kaine recently told activists he supports banning offshore drilling off the Atlantic Coast despite being a strong advocate for offshore drilling for years," the GOP says. We decided to pull out the Flip-O-Meter to see if Kaine’s position has shifted on that issue. The prospect of drilling for oil and natural gas off Virginia’s coast and other Atlantic states has been hotly debated for years. At the start of this decade, energy leases to explore off Virginia’s coast were scheduled to begin. But a moratorium on those activities has been in place since the 2010 explosion on BP’s Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2013, Kaine’s first year in the U.S. Senate, he co-sponsored a measure with fellow Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner that called for opening the waters off the coast of Virginia to oil and gas drilling. The legislation called for state coffers to get a 50 percent cut of the energy royalties from drilling off Virginia’s coast. It also said that drilling wouldn’t be done in any area where it would threaten military operations or national security. "Virginia is well-positioned to be a national leader in offshore energy exploration. A comprehensive energy strategy – including oil, gas, wind, solar, tidal and other areas – can transition us to a clean energy future while bridging that transition with secure U.S. fuels we don’t have to import," Kaine said in a joint 2013 statement with Warner. "Virginia’s diverse energy portfolio is a model for the nation. This legislation will bolster our energy security, create jobs, and direct revenues to Virginia that will support important priorities across the state." A couple months later, in June 2013, Kaine penned an op-ed in The Washington Post in which he said "I support development of offshore energy (gas, oil, wind and tidal) in the Atlantic." In April 2015, Kaine was among eight senators who signed a letter to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee asking for legislation that would provide Atlantic Coast states a share of revenues from offshore oil and gas exploration if that area was opened to new energy leases. "Bipartisan support for oil and gas development on the Atlantic OCS (Outer Continental Shelf) can be found at the federal, state and local levels," Kaine and the other senators from Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia wrote. "Our states want the opportunity to create new jobs, generate new revenue." The Obama administration had been examining whether to allow oil and natural gas drilling off Virginia and those three other Atlantic Coast states, and it included them in initial plans to open areas off the coast for oil and gas leases from 2017 to 2022. But the U.S. Department of the Interior, on March 15, said it had decided not to open the waters off Virginia and the other Atlantic Coast states for oil and gas exploration. It released an updated five-year offshore energy plan that proposes leasing operations in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. The Interior Department said it was particularly moved by opposition from coastal communities as well as objections from the Department of Defense that the drilling could affect military operations along the coast in places including Hampton Roads. The same day of the Interior Department’s announcement, Kaine said he long had called for the federal government to reconsider its moratorium on drilling off the Atlantic Coast. But in that prepared March 15 statement, Kaine signaled his position was softening: "I am particularly struck by the material objections of the Department of Defense to the incompatibility of drilling with naval operations off Virginia’s coast, cited by the BOEM (Bureau of Oceanic Energy Management) as one of the three principal reasons for their decision. I have participated in this debate for over a decade as a governor and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The DOD has been relatively quiet during this public debate and has never shared their objections with me before. I look forward to additional discussions with DOD to understand its position." Fast forward to August 2016. Kaine was asked after an Aug. 13 rally in Manchester, N.H., if he supported a ban on offshore drilling. "Well, I actually am now in that position, because the Obama administration has decided not to do offshore drilling because the Defense Department objects, and I share those objections," Kaine said in a video of his response that was tweeted out by 350 Action, an environmental advocacy group. The Richmond Times-Dispatch noted in an Aug. 15 story that Kaine’s opposition put him in line with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who expressed support for the Department of the Interior’s position. We asked Amy Dudley, Kaine’s national spokeswoman, for elaboration for the reasons of Kaine’s shifting stance on offshore drilling. "As a member of the Armed Services Committee, Sen. Kaine met with DoD (Department of Defense) officials to further discuss the impact that oil drilling would have on our military operations in Hampton Roads, and concluded we should not be undertaking speculative drilling activities that could potentially impact installations in the region," Dudley wrote in a prepared statement. "Sen. Kaine recognizes the Navy is a key economic pillar of the Hampton Roads economy and must be protected." With the Flip-O-Meter, we don’t take a stance on whether a policy shift is a good or bad thing. We’re examining whether a change of position has occurred. Here, there’s little doubt that Kaine, who pushed for opening waters off the Virginia coast to drilling in 2013, opposes it now. His spokeswoman says he has come to that conclusion on the basis of additional information from Pentagon officials. So we rate this a Full Flop.

pomt-10895	"James Clapper Flips On Live TV, Admits Obama Behind Entire Russia Witch Hunt! (Video)"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/06/americanjournalreviewcom/article-wrong-clapper-said-obama-behind-trump-russ/	A website accused James Clapper of throwing President Barack Obama under the bus for ordering the Trump campaign "witch hunt." The headline published on AmericanJournalReview.com says, "James Clapper Flips On Live TV, Admits Obama Behind Entire Russia Witch Hunt! (Video)." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This story is drawn from an interview on CNN in which Clapper pushed back against President Donald Trump’s claim that Obama failed to address Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The clip shows Clapper, the former director of national intelligence under Obama, telling Anderson Cooper: "One point I'd like to make, Anderson, that I don't think has come up very much before, and I'm alluding now to the president's criticism of President Obama for all that he did or didn't do before he left office with respect to the Russian meddling. "If it weren’t for President Obama, we might not have done the intelligence community assessment that we did, that set up a whole sequence of events which are still unfolding today, notably, Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation. President Obama is responsible for that. It was he who tasked us to do that intelligence community assessment in the first place." Clapper is talking about an assessment that Obama asked the intelligence community to carry out beginning in early December 2016, around the time the CIA had concluded Russia meddled in the election to help Trump and hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But Obama’s request for an intelligence deep-dive into Russian meddling doesn't support what the headline claims. The article is referring to a different aspect of the Russia probe, which didn’t emerge until several months after Obama left the White House. The key distinction here is the difference between the intelligence community assessment Obama ordered in December 2016, and the appointment in May 2017 of Robert Mueller as special counsel. Mueller was tasked to investigate both Moscow’s election interference as well as ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. According to Kenneth Gray, a criminal justice professor at the University of New Haven, an intelligence community threat assessment is one method developed in response to Pearl Harbor. Agencies wanted to prevent surprise attacks against the United States and identify potential threats. The article wrongly conflates the Obama-directed intelligence assessment with Mueller’s investigation of possible collusion by members of Trump’s campaign. It’s also important to note that it was a Trump appointee, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel. Obama may have been a distant link in a causal chain, but it was a Trump appointee who is directly responsible for the ongoing special counsel probe. A close reading of Clapper’s interview makes clear he never said Obama was the proximate cause of the Mueller investigation, as the article alleges. Clapper has also rejected the notion that the investigation is a "witch hunt." Part of our reporting process is to reach out to the author of claims we’re checking. The author of this story, Adriana, has no last name in her byline or contact information on the website. The article also has no published date. Our ruling The headline on an article from AmericanJournalReview says, "James Clapper Flips On Live TV, Admits Obama Behind Entire Russia Witch Hunt! (Video)." In the video the article references, Clapper said Obama tasked intelligence officials to assess threats after the CIA concluded Russia meddled in the 2016 election. Obama requested the threat assessment in December 2016 and the special counsel wasn’t appointed until May 2017. The article inaccurately conflates these two events. It’s inaccurate to say Clapper "flips" in his statement. He is referring to a different aspect of the Russian investigation than the article suggests. We found no change of position from Clapper. We rate this claim False.	None	AmericanJournalReview.com	None	None	None	2018-08-06T13:15:07	2018-07-20	['None']

pomt-06544	On how he measures his promise to create 700,000 private-sector jobs in seven years.	full flop	/florida/statements/2011/oct/04/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-changes-math-700000-jobs-pledge/	Rick Scott, the candidate, ran on a platform of creating jobs. That's why the businessman-turned-politician won a bruising Republican primary last summer, he said. That's why he squeaked by Democrat Alex Sink in November 2010. "That was my whole campaign," he said in February. "Seven steps to 700,000 jobs over seven years." And more than a year since candidate Scott rolled out his 7-7-7 plan, Gov. Scott still talks frequently about those 700,000 jobs. But just how do you keep track? Scott the candidate offered one measure: "Our plan is seven steps to 700,000 jobs," he said in a debate a year ago, "and that plan is on top of what normal growth would be." Now Scott the governor is offering another. "700,000," he told reporters Oct. 4, 2011, when asked how many jobs he promised to create. "But the initial promise was to create 700,000 on top of projected growth," Scott was asked. "No," Scott said. While the creation of those jobs is a central promise we're tracking on the Scott-O-Meter, we wanted to rate Scott's statements about his promise on our Flip-O-Meter, which PolitiFact Florida created to measure whether a candidate's shifting on any particular position. Scott: 'We're going to grow 700,000 more jobs' Let's rewind to July 2010. State economists had already estimated Florida's recession rebound — no matter who the new governor might be — would add more than 1 million jobs by 2017. On July 21, Scott unveiled his 7-7-7 plan. He would introduce "accountability budgeting." He would reduce government spending. He would cut regulation. He would focus on job growth and retention. He would invest in world-class universities. He would shrink property taxes. He would get rid of the state's corporate income tax. Those changes would create 665,000 jobs over seven years. He rounded up, and the 700,000 jobs promise was born. Reporters wanted to know: If the state's expected growth alone was projected to restore 1 million jobs, did that mean Scott's structural changes to spending, regulation and the tax code would add 700,000 more? "Are those jobs that are in addition to the number of jobs that are going to be created automatically, just without any change in tax policy over the next five or 10 years?" a reporter asked Scott while traveling on his campaign bus. (We know, because we have the video.) Scott answered yes, then pointed out that jobs aren't created automatically. The reporter then corrected himself. "Well, projected. The job creation that is projected over the next five years," he said. "It's what's projected, yeah. It's what's projected, yeah," Scott said, nodding. "It's on top of that. If you do these things we're going to grow 700,000 more jobs." Reporters had their answer. Scott's plan would "grow 700,000 more jobs" than Florida would generate without him. Three months later, Scott made pretty much the same statement during a debate sponsored by Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association. (We have video of that, too.) "Our plan is seven steps to 700,000 jobs, and that plan is on top of what normal growth would be," Scott said. The debate moderator later noted that would mean creating about 1.7 million jobs, when only about 1 million Floridians were currently unemployed. "We're going to grow the state," Scott responded. In November, Florida elected the jobs governor. Scott: 'I don't know who said that' Not long after that, Scott moved the goalpost. The new promise: Create 700,000 jobs. Period. In June, Scott spokesman Brian Burgess touted news that Florida had added 50,000 jobs since January, saying that Scott was going to count every one toward keeping his promise. In the same few days, another Scott spokesman, Lane Wright, brushed off a question about Scott's original promise to create 700,000 jobs "on top of what normal growth would be." "Gov. Scott committed to creating 700,000 jobs in seven years, and we are on track to meet that goal," Wright said. In August, the governor himself weighed in. An Associated Press reporter reminded Scott that his jobs plan was designed to generate 700,000 jobs on top of those restored by the state's expected growth. "No, that's not true," Scott said. So, the reporter pushed, statements by his campaign were totally wrong? "I don't know who said that," Scott said. "I have no idea." Last week, the governor again faced the question he was asked as a candidate, nearly a year prior. This time, instead of a debate audience, Scott faced members of the Sun Sentinel editorial board. "Your pledge was for 700,000 in addition to normal growth, wasn't it?'' Scott was asked. No, he replied. The problem with Scott's new position is that there are at least two times during the campaign -- captured on video -- where Scott said the exact opposite. And in both those cases, someone asked Scott a follow up question. And in both replies, Scott reinforced his position -- 700,000 jobs, on top of normal growth. Now, Scott says it's just 700,000. To be clear: That's a difference of about 1 million jobs. The governor's plan was on the record, and it was specific. His policy changes, from regulatory reform to spending cuts, would result in job growth. Instead, his office has counted every net new private sector job — starting from before the governor had a chance to change policy. For the governor, that means a tally of more than 71,000 jobs since January. On the Flip-O-Meter, that counts as a Full Flop. See the WTSP version of this fact check here.

pomt-13115	Says Ron Johnson "is benefiting from several super PACs, I am not."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/03/russ-feingold/russ-feingold-falsely-claims-only-his-opponent-ben/	Democrat Russ Feingold, locked in a tight rematch with Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, called a recent attack ad from Johnson’s camp "simply false" and "intentionally misleading." The ad accused Feingold of starting his Progressives United committee to pay himself and his staff, not to support progressive candidates. (We rated Half True a similar claim from the state GOP) When speaking to reporters in Milwaukee October 27, Feingold said about the ad: "They don’t want to talk about the fact that Senator Johnson not only loves the current finance system, but he is the one who is benefiting from several super PACs. And I am not." We took a look at claim about who benefitted from the Progressive’s United fund. In this item, we are looking at Feingold’s response: That Johnson is benefiting from several super PACs, but he is not. We wondered if that was right. Unpacking the PACs The day after Feingold’s statement, a major Democratic super PAC announced a $2 million ad buy on his behalf. But we’re considering Feingold’s claim at the time he made it. Feingold himself has a history with campaign finance reform — he was half of the McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, which limited the amount of money national parties can raise and spend on behalf of their candidates. The act was an attempt to reign in spending, but some say it pushed donors to super PACs that can raise unlimited amounts of money but can’t donate the money directly to a candidate. Which brings us to 2016. At the time of Feingold’s statement, both candidates had already benefited from super PACs, according to data from the Federal Election Committee’s website. Two super PACs — For Our Future and Working America Coalition — had spent around $50,000 to support Feingold. And four super PACs had spent around $950,000 to support Johnson: Citizen PAC, Club for Growth Action, Freedom Partners Action Fund, and Let America Work. Of course, money spent to oppose a candidate also benefits the other and there was even more spent there. Four super PACs spent almost $640,000 to oppose Johnson: For Our Future, Working America Coalition, Planned Parenthood Votes and the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund. And five super PACs spent more than $2.5 million to oppose Feingold: Americas PAC, Citizen PAC, Club for Growth Action, The New Prosperity Foundation and Reform Wisconsin Fund. So at the time of Feingold’s statement, super PACs had reported spending around $690,000 on Feingold’s behalf and nearly $3.5 million on Johnson’s. (As noted, an additional $2 million was directed to Feingold the next day.) Feingold’s camp pointed to the fact that Johnson had benefited from a much larger share of super PAC spending. Maybe so. But that’s not what Feingold said. Our rating Feingold said Johnson is "benefiting from several super PACs. And I am not." Simply put, he was. Though such spending for Johnson has been higher, Feingold has received significant super PAC support. Our rating is False.	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2016-11-03T15:18:08	2016-10-27	['None']
pomt-14411	Says Barack Obama "has the legal authority to let in really however many refugees he wants, from whatever country."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/11/ron-johnson/how-much-authority-does-barack-obama-have-allowing/	U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, who is bracing for an election rematch with Democratic challenger Russ Feingold, was asked at a public forum how concerned he is about the government’s plans to accept 10,000 refugees from Syria -- a move that stoked fears about terrorism in the U.S. In his response, the Wisconsin Republican made a claim that suggests President Barack Obama has unilateral powers when it comes to resettlement. "President Obama has the legal authority to let in really however many refugees he wants, from whatever country," Johnson said Feb. 5, 2016 at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee. "That’s his legal authority." The statement by Johnson, who is chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, overstates the president’s authority. By law, the president sets the framework for accepting refugees -- setting an annual ceiling on the number and setting priorities on which countries are included. But the ceiling figure can’t come out of thin air -- it must be chosen in consultation with Congress. Moreover, the president and Congress set budgets for the agencies involved in resettlement. Trouble in Syria A refugee is defined as a person fleeing his or her country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion In Syria, unrest began in 2011 with protests against President Bashar al-Assad, in the wake of the pro-democracy Arab Spring. Assad’s regime responded with violence, and the country spiraled into a civil war. Civilians have been fleeing unrest in Syria — where more than 200,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Almost 130,000 Syrian migrants have reached Europe by sea just during the first two months of 2016, according to the International Organization for Migration. The crisis in Europe led Obama in September 2015 to tell his administration to take in at least 10,000 displaced Syrians over the next year. That was up from fewer than 2,000 over the previous 12 months. The law The federal Immigration and Nationality Act, specifically Section 207, spells out the process for setting parameters on the number of refugees to be admitted. Prior to the start of each federal fiscal year (which begins Oct. 1), the president must determine the number of refugees --"as justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest." The president must arrive at the number, as well as the allocation of refugee slots, after consultation with the House and Senate judiciary committees. As Johnson indicated, speaking strictly about legal authority, the president sets the framework and Congress has no specific power to change the framework. The president does take the lead, but in consultation with Congress, on setting what becomes a ceiling on the number of refugees expected to be accepted each year and the priorities in terms of which countries the refugees come from. As a practical matter, the president wouldn’t be able to pick a number out of thin air. Moreover, Congress holds the power of the purse in funding the agencies involved in resettlement. The figures for the annual ceiling, and for the number of total refugees actually admitted, have been relatively stable during Obama’s time in office, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The ceiling was 80,000 in fiscal 2009, 2010 and 2011. It dropped to 76,000 in fiscal 2012, then to 70,000 the next three years, before rising to 85,000 in fiscal 2016. Actual admissions didn’t reach the ceiling until fiscal 2013. The process Refugees are processed and admitted to the United States from abroad. The State Department handles overseas processing of refugees and the Department of Homeland Security makes final determinations about eligibility for admission. Which brings up an important point: Those agencies rely on both the president and Congress to for funding. That joint authority was underscored in January 2016 when Obama designated up to $70 million from a special fund set up by Congress to handle the 2016 increase in refugee settlement. It’s also important to remember that, regardless of the refugee numbers set by the president, refugees actually admitted into the U.S. must pass a variety of reviews -- a process that typically takes 18 to 24 months. Security, of course, is a major concern. Terrorism-related grounds for refusing applicants "have been amended to lower the threshold for how substantial, apparent, and immediate an alien’s support for a terrorist activity or organization may be," according to the Congressional Research Service report. An alien, according to the report, "is generally inadmissible for engaging in terrorist activity if he or she gives any material support, such as a safe house, transportation, communications, or funds, to a terrorist organization or any of its members or to a person engaged in terrorist activity." At the same time, there are so many refugees seeking asylum in the U.S. that even if many applicants are rejected, there are more than enough others to take their place before the ceiling is reached. Our rating Johnson said Obama "has the legal authority to let in really however many refugees he wants, from whatever country." Federal law requires the president each year to set a ceiling on the number of refugees to be admitted to the United States in the next 12 months and to set priorities on which countries they come from. But the president does not have unilateral authority. The president must set the framework in consultation with Congress. And both the president and Congress determine funding for the federal agencies involved in the resettlement process. For a statement is that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2016-03-11T11:00:00	2016-02-05	['None']
pomt-12522	"No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/24/donald-trump/how-do-donald-trumps-first-100-days-rate-historica/	As he neared the end of his first 100 days in office, President Donald Trump touted his first three months as a rousing success. "No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days," Trump told an audience in Kenosha, Wis. That’s a pretty high bar, especially for an administration that has registered historically low levels of support in public-approval polls for presidents this early in their terms. The White House didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article, but when asked about some of the president’s 100-day accomplishments during the April 19 press briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer cited a series of executive orders, including some on regulatory reform; a drop in border crossings; and job creation. He said more details would be offered as the 100-day mark approached. We interviewed historians and considered the 100-day track records of presidents back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While there’s a lot of nuance in gauging accomplishments, Trump doesn’t have much evidence to back up his boast that his administration has accomplished the most. First, some caveats All presidencies are different, and there’s an especially big difference between those that began after an election and those that got their start suddenly. The latter category includes presidents who took over after the death of their predecessor (such as Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson) or their predecessor’s resignation (Gerald Ford). In addition, it’s easier for a president to put points on the board quickly if they enter office in the midst of a national crisis. This was true for Roosevelt (the Great Depression), Truman (the end of World War II), Ford (the Watergate scandal), and Barack Obama (the Great Recession). Without a crisis, Congress is less likely to act quickly. Perhaps most notably, there is widespread agreement among historians that the 100-day standard is arbitrary. Just because a president signs a significant law outside the 100-day window doesn’t make it less of an accomplishment. For instance, Johnson and Ronald Reagan "laid the groundwork for gigantic accomplishments" such as on civil rights and taxes, respectively, that fell outside the 100-day window, said Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz. And both Truman and Dwight Eisenhower were preoccupied with wars during their first 100 days, said Max J. Skidmore, a University of Missouri-Kansas City political scientist who has written several books on the presidency. This meant they "did not have much in the way of legislative achievements during that period," Skidmore said. All in all, "most presidents have not considered 100 days a significant milepost," said H.W. Brands, a presidential historian at the University of Texas-Austin whose books include Traitor to His Class: The Privileged Life and Radical Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. "It's largely a media thing." The numbers Let’s start with the raw numbers, Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker did some calculations comparing Trump’s bill-signing output to that of his predecessors during their first 100 days. The Post counted 28 bills signed by Trump -- the highest since 1949, but well below the 76 signed by Roosevelt in 1933. Moreover, many of Trump’s bills were "minor or housekeeping bills," and none met a longstanding political-science standard for "major bills." By contrast, at least nine of Roosevelt’s did. Meanwhile, by the time of the Kenosha speech, Trump had signed 24 executive orders, 22 presidential memorandums, and 20 proclamations, the Post noted. Some of these started the ball rolling to overturn federal regulations. While these may eventually have a significant impact, it’s worth noting that many new presidents routinely issue orders during their first 100 days that overturn actions of their predecessors of the opposite party. For instance, just two days after taking office, President Bill Clinton signed orders overturning restrictions on abortion imposed during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, and with equal speed, President George W. Bush overturned Clinton’s opposition to a ban on aid to international groups that participate in abortions. "Everyone does that, so it doesn’t give him a comparative edge," said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University historian who has written books about Presidents Richard Nixon and Calvin Coolidge. Trump’s accomplishments Historians we checked with mostly agreed that Trump’s appointment of Neil Gorsuch to fill a Supreme Court vacancy was a significant event, and one that could influence public policy long after Trump leaves the White House. That said, some cautioned against making too much of Gorsuch’s confirmation, arguing that it followed the nearly year-long blockage of Obama nominee Merrick Garland by the Republican Senate. "It was really (Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell's achievement," said Jeff Shesol, author of books on Roosevelt and Johnson and a former speechwriter for Clinton. Meanwhile, Trump’s military actions -- his missile strikes on Syria and the dropping of an unusually large bomb on an ISIS bunker -- are hardly unprecedented for a president’s first 100 days. George W. Bush attacked Iraqi radar sites to enforce a no-fly zone, and Obama pledged to double the number of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan. Trump’s decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement echoes George W. Bush’s decision to pull out of the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming. And the Trump administration’s successful effort to win the release of Aya Hijazi, an American aid worker jailed for three years in Egypt on dubious charges, isn’t unprecedented either. Moments after taking office in 1981, Ronald Reagan announced the imminent freeing of American hostages held in Iran for over a year. Several historians said Trump has faced some significant setbacks as well. His first big legislative push -- to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act -- stalled without even a final vote, and he has been slower than his predecessors in making sub-cabinet appointments. Trump also failed to submit a detailed budget proposal of the kind his predecessors had typically submitted by now. Then there’s Trump’s immigration ban, which would likely count as a major accomplishment if it’s enacted, but which is frozen for now. It was issued, blocked by the courts, rewritten, and then blocked again. "The fact that he has gotten so little done while having Republican majorities in both houses of Congress is a terrible indictment," Shesol said. The champion: FDR The 100-day record of just one president -- Franklin Roosevelt -- would be enough to cast doubt on the accuracy of Trump’s claim that no administration has accomplished more. The 15 major bills Roosevelt signed included those that created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority (both of which still exist) and the Home Owners Loan Corp. He signed the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established farm subsidies, and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which started public-works efforts to reverse the Great Depression. He signed legislation to legalize the manufacture and sale of beer and wine, and he issued executive orders to establish the Civilian Conservation Corps and to effectively take the United States off the gold standard. All in all, Roosevelt pushed the federal government to take a much bigger role than it had previously, said Adam Cohen, author of Nothing to Fear: FDR's Inner Circle and the Hundred Days That Created Modern America. "When FDR took office, the banking system had collapsed," Cohen said. "His emergency banking act got the banks open again and the system up and running. He got the Securities Act of 1933 enacted. It was the first major federal regulation of the stock market, which laid the groundwork for the kind of government regulation we now take for granted." Other presidents’ 100-day achievements Other presidents have chalked up significant achievements as well. Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, while Obama signed not only a nearly $800 billion stimulus package to combat a spiraling recession but also the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and a law expanding the Children’s Health Insurance Program. He also implemented two urgent economic programs formally passed in the final weeks of George W. Bush’s presidency -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the auto industry bailout. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Other presidents have taken executive actions at least as significant as Trump’s. Kennedy established the Peace Corps (later ratified by Congress). Ford, meanwhile, pardoned his predecessor, Nixon, and offered amnesty to Vietnam War draft dodgers. Truman’s first 100 days were a whirlwind of foreign-policy actions -- the end of World War II in Europe, the writing of the United Nations charter, the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan, and Japan’s unconditional surrender. Sometimes, a president’s biggest accomplishment is intangible. Roosevelt calmed a nation gut-punched by the Depression, while Johnson reassured Americans after the shock of Kennedy’s assassination. "The main accomplishment of LBJ's first 100 days -- and this should not be discounted just because it did not involve a bunch of bill signings -- was to give the nation and its government a sense of stability and continuity after one of the most wrenching events of the century," said his biographer, Shesol. Evaluating Trump’s 100 days One of the biggest impacts of Trump’s first 100 days may fall into this "intangible" category. "Even if there are not many major tangible accomplishments, his administration has changed the political and cultural trajectory of the country -- not as much as FDR did following Herbert Hoover, but more than the average new president does," Cohen said. "It has been somewhat amorphous and hard to quantify, but it is certainly something many Americans are feeling." John Frendreis, a political scientist at Loyola University in Chicago, said Trump’s 100 days seem most similar to Clinton’s, which were also disorganized, short of focus and marked by the failure to pass an economic stimulus package. That said, he added, "it is instructive to note that Clinton’s presidency turned out to be reasonably successful after this rocky start, so this suggests a similar turn-around is possible for Trump." Whatever happens down the road, Trump, like his predecessors, is getting a dose of reality, Brands said. "The big story of Trump's 100 days is how much reality has intruded on his notions of what a president can accomplish," he said. "Every newcomer to the White House is sobered by the experience. Trump had more sobering to do to most." Our ruling Trump said, "No administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days." Trump has had some achievements in office, but at the very least, they are much less numerous and far-reaching than those of Roosevelt, the standard against whom all presidents are measured. In more recent years, other presidents, including Obama, have accomplished more in their first 100 days than Trump has, historians say. We rate the claim False.

pomt-06349	"You’re paying for...(state Sen. Diane Allen’s) health care, and she took yours away."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/07/carl-lewis/olympic-medalist-carl-lewis-calls-out-state-senato/	A prolonged legal battle kicked him off the ballot in Tuesday’s election, but former Democratic State Senate candidate Carl Lewis has taken aim at a Republican incumbent who "took" away health care from the public. At a recent appearance in Willingboro, Burlington County, the nine-time Olympic gold medalist accused state Sen. Diane Allen (R-Burlington) of receiving taxpayer-funded health care, but stripping away coverage from her constituents. Allen is seeking reelection Tuesday against Democratic challenger Gail Cook. "Your senator right now is dancing across the stage, just had...a cancer scare and you know what, guess what? Every single person in this room is paying for her health care. Did you know that? But she took yours," Lewis told the crowd. Soon afterwards, Lewis added: "So you’re paying for…her health care, and she took yours away." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Lewis is exaggerating Allen’s impact on health care in Burlington County. Allen does receive state health benefits and, in July, she abstained from restoring $7.5 million in state funding for family planning services. But that cut only impacted a limited number of Burlington County residents and, across the state, many affected New Jerseyans have been able to receive services from other health centers. Lewis spokesman Chris Walker confirmed the claim was in reference to the $7.5 million, and said Lewis would speak to us. But we never heard back. First, let’s explain Allen’s health care coverage. Allen is receiving health coverage for herself and her husband through the State Health Benefits Program, according to Bill Quinn, a state Treasury Department spokesman. Still, like other state employees, Allen must pay a percentage of her premium costs. Now, let’s talk about whether Allen "took" away health care from Burlington County residents. Nearly a year after Gov. Chris Christie eliminated $7.5 million for family planning services, the Democrat-controlled Legislature tried this past summer to restore the funding. Christie vetoed that spending, and the Democrats failed in July to get enough votes to override his veto. Allen abstained from that vote -- counting her as a no -- but even if she voted yes, the Senate still would have been one vote shy of restoring the funding. The funding cut made last year led to the closure of six of the state’s family planning centers, including two clinics in Burlington County. But according to county spokesman Ralph Shrom, those two locations served a combined total of about 1,500 patients in 2010. That’s less than 5 percent of the population of Willingboro, where Lewis made his remarks. The patients formerly served at those clinics are referred to two federally qualified health centers in the county, Shrom said in an email. Shrom said: "Those close to this situation would say it did leave people without care, and there are probably individuals who did not follow up on the referral or may have found the alternatives inconvenient." Shrom added, "On the other side of the equation, those who did follow the referral advice now have a ‘medical home’ -- that is, they are now going to a clinic that can attend to all the health care needs of themselves and their families and seeing a doctor who can keep continuing records." Katherine Grant-Davis, president and CEO of the New Jersey Primary Care Association, which represents the federally qualified centers, said that in many cases across the state, former family planning patients have turned to the federally qualified centers. "We are the safety net," Grant-Davis told us. Allen said she would have liked the $7.5 million to remain in the state budget, but she abstained from the override vote because the state couldn’t afford it. The senator noted how she has been honored by different health organizations. "I’ve worked very hard on making sure health care’s available for everybody," Allen said. Our ruling At a recent rally in Willingboro, Lewis accused Allen of receiving taxpayer-funded health care, while taking health care away from the public. Allen receives state health benefits, and she must contribute toward her premium costs. But Lewis’ larger claim about her taking away health care is off base. The governor eliminated the funding for family planning services and a yes-vote from Allen wouldn’t have changed that. Also, the funding cut has affected a fraction of her constituents and similar services are being offered at other health centers. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-02382	Seneca Jones Timber Co., aiming to increase logging and allay fears that old growth will be cut, says mills have shifted to second-generation trees. An ad from the company asks: "Do you know that most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years?"	true	/oregon/statements/2014/mar/14/seneca-jones/have-most-all-oregon-sawmills-retooled-over-past-2/	A good way to get an argument roaring louder than a chain saw is to bring up Northwest forest policy. Topics ranging from clear-cutting to what constitutes "old growth" are bound to spark tussles. Forestry issues are again in the news as U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and other members of the state’s congressional delegation pitch plans to increase harvest levels from the so-called O&C lands -- 2.4 million acres of federally owned forestlands sprawled across 18 western Oregon counties. Many are watching closely, knowing decisions coming out of Washington, D.C., could have controversial implications for Oregon. Among those following the debate are Aaron Jones’ three daughters. Jones opened his Seneca Jones sawmill in Eugene more than 60 years ago. Becky, Kathy and Jody Jones are taking out newspaper ads touting the benefits of "forestry stewardship," among other things. An ad that ran in Oregon newspapers, including The Oregonian, on March 2, 2014, presses for more timber harvests and seeks to allay fears that old growth will be cut. It says mills are now focused on second-generation trees, and claims: "Do you know that most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years?" We revved up our saw and checked. We called Kathy Jones. She said the ads are aimed at influencing the debate over O&C lands, which could yield increased timber for Oregon sawmills. "Some people keep saying we are ruining the forests, that we are cutting old growth at every opportunity," Jones said. "It’s just not true. What is true is that almost every mill still operating in Oregon has retooled to accept second-growth logs. "And I’m fine with that. I love those big cathedral forests. They should stay just as they are." Jones said her definition of old growth begins when a tree’s diameter reaches 48 inches. The logs Seneca accepts average about 30 inches, she said. As for Seneca’s own retooling efforts, Jones said lasers now scan all incoming logs. Computers tell operators what sizes of studs and other lumber are most in demand at the moment, and the cutting begins. "We have almost as many computer operators as we do people out on the floor," Jones said. "That’s how this industry operates these days." We called Paul Barnum, executive director of the Oregon Forest Resources Institute. The Legislature created the group in 1991 to bring forest scientists, public agencies, forest landowners and community and conservation groups together. Barnum referred us to a 2012 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Pacific Northwest Research Station. A chapter assessing Oregon’s sawmill sector said, in part, "Technological improvements have made Oregon mills more efficient in numerous ways. Log size (diameter and length) sensing capabilities linked to computer determine the best sawing pattern for logs to recover either the greatest volume or greatest value from each other." We asked Barnum about the Seneca Jones claim. "There may be three or four mills that still process old-growth timber, which comes pretty much from private forestlands," he said. "The mills still operating have retooled to concentrate on getting more value from second- and third-generation timber." Barnum also passed along a report from Paul F. Ehinger & Associates, which said that in 2010 -- the last time the numbers were updated -- Oregon had 106 operating sawmills. For another view, we called Steve Pedery, conservation director at Oregon Wild. The group has long fought clear-cutting and old-growth harvesting, but has won U.S. Forest Service awards in recent years for helping design timber-restoration sales. Pedery passed along an Oregon Wild report detailing nine westside mills that still accept large logs. "What this highlights," he said, "is that there is still an appetite for old growth out there. If they could get it, they would." Regarding the retooling claim, he said: "Saying ‘most’ misses the point of the policy debate. There are still mills looking for large-diameter trees and they are all in southwest Oregon, where the remaining big trees are." One of the mills in the report, D.R. Johnson Lumber in Riddle, is currently mothballed, according to both the report and an employee who answered our call there. Another listed as accepting large-diameter logs is Rough & Ready Lumber Co. in Cave Junction. Coincidentally, that operation announced this month that it will soon reopen a retooled small-log mill that’s been closed since last year. "Unless you are a real niche operation looking for the occasional large log that comes along, you’ve retooled," said co-owner Jennifer Phillippi, whose grandfather founded Rough and Ready 92 years ago. "You wouldn’t still be in business otherwise." The ruling The owners of Seneca Jones sawmill in Eugene want harvest levels from federally managed O&C lands increased but with primarily second- and third-generation trees. They say the timber industry agrees, adding, "Most all mills in Oregon have retooled over the past 20 years" to accept smaller trees. A key environmental group maintains that old-growth cutting would commence if rules pertaining to federal lands are changed. The ongoing debate over timber policy in Washington, D.C., will determine whether they are. But we can look at the numbers, which show that of the 106 or so mills in Oregon, only a handful have not retooled and still look to buy large-diameter logs. The overwhelming majority, according to a forestry group created by the Legislature, use machinery that’s been added in recent years to accept smaller logs. It bears out the assertion that "most all" sawmills have retooled. We rate the claim True. Return to OregonLive.com/politics to comment on this ruling.

pomt-06285	"Community banks … are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/21/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-dodd-frank-destroying-community/	No politician will ever lose votes by coming down on the side of community banks. Unlike the mega-banks of Wall Street that helped fuel the world’s dive off an economic cliff, community banks have a better reputation. They avoid exotic financial deals and, for the most part, stick to their knitting. GOP hopeful Newt Gingrich offered himself as their defender when he spoke to supporters at campaign headquarters in Manchester, N.H. "Community banks are 12 percent of the banks right now and 40 percent of the loans to small business," Gingrich said. "And they are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank." Dodd-Frank is the financial overhaul bill passed by Congress in 2010. Gingrich says it should be repealed, in part because of its impact on these local banks. We asked the Gingrich campaign to give us the data that informed the former House speaker’s belief. Staffer R.C. Hammond replied "It was his observation. How do you source an opinion?" But Gingrich didn't say, "I think community banks are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank. He asserted it as a fact. The first thing to note is that one year after the passage of Dodd-Frank, community banks are healthier. By convention, any bank with assets of less than $1 billion is a community bank. According to the latest report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, for that group of banks, a key measure of profitability, return on assets, has doubled in the past year, growing from 0.26 percent a year ago to 0.57 percent in the second quarter of 2011. Return on assets has been higher this year than in any quarter going back to the start of 2008 before the great meltdown. While it wouldn’t be fair to give Dodd-Frank full credit for that improvement (the improving economy is probably a factor), neither is it accurate to credit the law with the demise of the industry when the reports of that demise are premature. Not only are they not dead, "community banks on the whole are healthier than they were last year," said Chris Cole, senior vice president of the Independent Community Bankers of America. The trade group that represents some 5,000 of these smaller banks views Dodd-Frank as a mixed bag. Cole said it has done some good things. High on the plus side, it will save his members about $4.5 billion over three years in the fees they pay to the FDIC. "The assessment rates was a big benefit," said Cole. Community banks have "experienced 30 to 40 percent decreases in their assessments. For many community banks, Dodd-Frank has not been all that bad," he said. In a letter marking the one-year anniversary of Dodd-Frank, ICBA’s President Camden Fine also praised the law for making inroads in supervising the mega-banks and putting non-bank financial firms, which can range from insurance companies to hedge funds, under more of a regulatory microscope. ICBA is not head-over-heels in love with the financial reforms. It doesn’t like the limits the new law puts on the fees banks can charge each time a customer uses a debit card. Initially, the rate was capped at 12 cents per swipe. Regulators later changed that to 21 cents. If there is one overarching fear that smaller banks have with Dodd-Frank, it is the prospect of new regulations. "We are expecting compliance costs to increase dramatically," Rose Oswald Poels, president of the Wisconsin Bankers Association, told the Milwaukee BizTimes The president of the American Bankers Association, Frank Keating, warned in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece of a "mountainous regulatory burden" that will overwhelm small banks. "Federal regulators have issued 4,870 Federal Register pages of proposed or final rules affecting banks, " Keating wrote. "Many more are still to come—for a grand total of more than 240 rules." What Keating fails to mention is that many of the rules under Dodd-Frank specifically exempt community banks. "A lot of the stuff in Dodd-Frank is really meant to be targeted at the big guys, not the small ones," said Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at George Washington University Law School who testifies regularly on Capitol Hill on banking issues. Wilmarth said many more rules could exempt smaller banks depending on how they are written. The ultimate decision on debit card fees is a good example. Not only did regulators raise the allowable fee, the law exempted all banks with assets under $10 billion from the new rule. The ICBA's Cole makes a larger point -- that one should hold judgment on the new law. "The implementation of Dodd-Frank is just halfway through," he said. "It’s too early to say what it is." Cole said so far, regulators have been very responsive. "They’ve been willing to listen and reach out to us." A major goal of lobbyists for community banks was to pass a law that treated small banks differently from large ones, and the ICBA says they achieved that in Dodd-Frank. One sign of this divide: when the ICBA -- representing small banks -- and the ABA -- representing banks both large and small -- listed their lobbying priorities for 2011, there was virtually no overlap. The ABA for example wants to change the oversight of derivatives, but small banks rarely touch derivatives trading. And the two organizations totally part ways on deposit insurance. The ABA wants to trim back the Dodd-Frank changes, while the ICBA members want to keep the savings they gained from the law. Wilmarth and others criticized Dodd-Frank for not going far enough to deal with banks that are to big to fail, but, in most ways, it is tougher on the big banks than it is on the small ones, they said. Our Ruling: Gingrich said that community banks "are being destroyed by Dodd-Frank." But as a whole they are healthier than a year ago. No doubt the improvement in the economy has helped, but community banks also have benefited from a reduction in fees paid to the FDIC as a result of Dodd-Frank. From the point of view of community banks, Dodd-Frank is imperfect and still unfolding. But it has exempted community banks from many new regulations. That said, the shape of the rules to come will make a big difference in its final impact on them. To say that this industry is being destroyed by Dodd-Frank is untrue and unlikely to be true in the future if regulators continue to respond to the concerns of small banks.

pomt-00131	"President Donald Trump signed DEPLOYMENT ORDERS for the 82nd Airborne Division of the United States Army, instructing them to deploy from Ft. Bragg, NC, to the U.S. southern border at Mexico."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/26/blog-posting/no-trump-didnt-sign-orders-82nd-airborne-division/	Sometimes a hoax can morph into something of reality. As a large caravan of migrants marches for the United States, we have seen our share of unfounded claims about the events. In one Facebook post on Oct. 22, a user announced that "minutes ago, prior to taking the stage in Houston, TX: President Donald Trump signed DEPLOYMENT ORDERS for the 82nd Airborne Division of the United States Army, instructing them to deploy from Ft. Bragg, NC, to the U.S. southern border at Mexico." This particular story is a hoax. But it turns out, Trump has decided to send some troops to the border. More on that in a second. The poster went on to say that 1st Armored Division of the Army stationed in Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, was given 72-hour ready-standby orders to start shipping armored vehicles to the border and that "covert intelligence" had confirmed the caravan had grown to more than 10,000. An additional 40,000 Mexicans were staging to join them in northern Mexico. "The OPEN PLAN THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING is for more than 50,000 of these so-called ‘migrants’ to physically storm the U.S. border to gain entry into our country," according to the post. "Our President Trump is not going to allow that. Article 4, Section 4 of the US Constitution REQUIRES the federal government to protect each of the states from invasion. The ‘migrant caravan’ is now classified as ‘an invasion force’ against which the US government will take action." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what really did happen: Trump was in Houston; he spoke at a "Make America Great Again" rally in support of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is up for re-election. And a few days before the rally, the president threatened to deploy the military to shut down the border to stop the migrants march north. "I must, in the strongest terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught," Trump tweeted, "and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!" On Oct. 22, Trump told a USA Today reporter that he would send as many troops as necessary to block the caravan. He called their trek "an assault on our country," according to the newspaper. But there’s no evidence that Trump deployed the 82nd Airborne or that troops in Kentucky were put on notice. While we were writing this fact-check, credible reports did surface that the president is preparing to send to the border at least 800 U.S. Army troops, including engineers to help construct tents and fencing, doctors for medical support and "potentially some personnel to operate drones along the border," the New York Times reported. Still, none of what was said about deploying specific troops to respond to an "invasion," as the Facebook post described, has been reported by legitimate media. Next, the migrant caravan was growing. It’s the largest caravan of it’s kind in recent years, according to The Washington Post, which put the number of migrants at "more than 5,000." On Oct. 22, the United Nations estimated that about 7,200 people are currently walking north. One of the caravan’s organizers told CNN that 7,500 people are now participating, according to the news organization. Wired called a number listed for an anti-immigration militia on a similar post. "The militia member who answered said that the 42,000 number was bogus, and that government officials have told the group that the caravan consists of around 7,000 people," the magazine said. One newspaper, El Universal in Mexico, reported on Oct. 22 that more than 14,000 Hondurans were at the Mexico-Guatemala border. The paper attributed the figure to municipal authorities, a regional diocese and the National Migration Institute. There doesn’t appear to be evidence that the group will merge with 40,000 Mexicans, though. Our ruling Elements of this Facebook post contain granules of factual information: The caravan is large and has been growing, though size estimates vary and there are now reports that weary walkers are turning back. Trump has also threatened to deploy troops to the border. Reports indicate he may send about 800 troops there to offer support. But Trump has not signed deployment orders for the 82nd Airborne Division, as this post specifically claims. We rate this statement False.

pomt-01445	"We have a retiree that is collecting a $17,000 paycheck a month . . . tax free."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/05/jorge-elorza/jorge-elorza-says-providence-paying-17000-month-ta/	If you're looking for reasons why Providence is in financial trouble, Democratic mayoral candidate Jorge Elorza says a good place to start is the city's pension costs. During a Sept. 30, 2014, mayoral debate, he was asked about the city's huge pension debt. Elorza blamed one of his opponents, Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr., an independent, for signing a consent decree when he was mayor that provided for 5- and 6-percent cost of living allowances for retirees. "Now we have a retiree that is collecting a $17,000 paycheck a month . . . tax free," Elorza said. "How many families in Providence don't make $17,000 a year." "You can thank the court for that," Cianci retorted. We were curious about whether that $17,000 monthly paycheck -- equivalent to $204,000 in annual tax-free income -- is real. Providence officials sent us the 2014 list of the 49 people receiving the largest pension payments. Thirty seven retirees are receiving checks totaling over $100,000 per year, or at least $8,333 each month. All but eight were firefighters. The rest were police officers. At least 28 of those 37 are tax-free disability pensions. Four others may be disability pensions but it's not clear from the list because the money is going to a surviving spouse. At the top of the list: Gilbert McLaughlin of Warwick, who retired in October 1991 with an accidental disability pension. He served as chief for 15 months before retiring, citing health problems stemming from a job-related injury to his neck and shoulders. His annual payment from the city as of May 2014: $196,813. That's $16,401 per month, or $599 shy of the $17,000 cited by Elorza. McLaughlin retired as the city's fire chief at the age of 55. At retirement, his base salary was $63,537 per year plus $6,959 in longevity pay for his 36 years, six months and eleven days of service. Total: $70,496. He received 83.7 percent of that as his pension, or $59,001 a year, according to Lawrence J. Mancini, the city's acting director of administration and finance. His payment grew so large because he received an annual 5-percent compounding cost of living adjustment that was increased to 6 percent in 1996, Mancini said. (Cianci's second stint as Providence mayor ran from 1991 through most of 2002.) All of this was part of a long-running legal war over pensions in the city. The stage was set around 1977, near the beginning of Cianci's first stint as mayor, when the General Assembly gave the city's unions a controlling number of seats on the city's Retirement Board. A 1983 City Charter change, when Cianci was still in office, gave the board extra power to make pension decisions. In 1989, with Joseph Paolino as mayor, the board granted compounded cost-of-living adjustments of 5 and 6 percent for all present and future public safety retirees and 3 percent for non-uniformed workers. In 1991, in the midst of a court battle over pensions, Cianci was back in office and he signed a consent decree that locked in some of the benefits, a decree that he would come to regret. In 2012, in an agreement Mayor Angel Taveras negotiated with the police and fire unions, the city ended the big compounded cost of living adjustments, so his annual pension remains frozen at $196,813. To put this in context, the salary of the current fire chief, Clarence Cunha, is $164,736 a year, including longevity pay. If McLaughlin's initial pension had risen with inflation, and not at 5 or 6 percent, it would be worth $103,036 today, or just under $8,586 a month. Our ruling Jorge Elorza said, "We have a retiree that is collecting a $17,000 paycheck a month . . . tax free." The city's biggest retirement check goes to a retired fire chief who is getting $16,401. Although Elorza overstated the amount a bit, its close enough to rate his statement True.

pomt-02949	Emergency rooms account for "2 percent of all health care spending."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/28/nick-gillespie/does-emergency-care-account-just-2-percent-all-hea/	In recent years, advocates for universal health coverage have regularly decried a side effect of having no health insurance -- the use of emergency rooms as a substitute for basic health care services. For instance, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said in August 2009, "We have 48 million people with no health care. As a result, they walk into emergency rooms. It's costing every American who is insured $1,100 to pick up the cost of uncompensated care that goes on at the emergency room." We gave Boxer’s claim a Mostly False, largely due to questionable assumptions that undermined the calculations Boxer cited. But other Democrats in favor of a health care overhaul, including Hillary Clinton in 2008 and Barack Obama in 2009, also pointed to the use of emergency rooms by uninsured Americans as an argument for passing a health care overhaul. Given the frequency of this talking point, it came as something of a surprise to hear Nick Gillespie, the editor of Reason.com, a libertarian publication, say recently that emergency room costs actually represent a tiny share of health care spending. During the Oct. 22, 2013, edition of CNN’s Crossfire, Gillespie had an exchange with Van Jones, one of the show’s liberal co-hosts. Jones argued that Obama’s health care law should be able to bring uninsured Americans into the health care system in less costly and more efficient ways, cutting the use of emergency rooms for front-line care. Gillespie countered that "emergency rooms (are) 2 percent of all health care spending. It's not a huge amount. That's a big red herring in this." We wondered whether Gillespie was correct. We easily found the source of the statistic -- a calculation publicized by the American College of Emergency Physicians. Obviously, this is a group with a dog in the fight, but the calculation they made was pretty straightforward and is based on federal data. The group used figures from 2008 collected by the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a study undertaken by a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. The survey found that the total amount of money spent on emergency care -- including physician and other emergency-room services -- was $47.3 billion. That’s slightly less than 2 percent of the same survey’s $2.4 trillion estimate of total health care expenditures that year. We asked a number of experts in health care economics whether they saw any red flags with that kind ofcalculation. Both Austin Frakt of Boston University and Katherine Baicker of the Harvard School of Public Health said the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey is a credible source of data. Their concerns, to the extent they had any, focused on whether the survey under-reports health care costs. Indeed, there is at least one study that suggests just that. A paper in the Annals of Emergency Medicine used different data and an alternative accounting method to determine emergency room costs. The study -- by Michael Lee and Brian Zink of Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School and Jeremiah Schuur of Harvard Medical School -- used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, which tallied approximately 130 million ER visits, a much higher number than the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which counted 49 million visits. Based in part on this discrepancy, the authors said the actual percentage may range anywhere from 4.9 percent to 10 percent, rather than 2 percent. The American College of Emergency Physicians stands by its calculations but acknowledges that other calculations can be legitimate. The data that produced the 2 percent figure "comes from reputable sources, and the calculation is correct," said spokeswoman Julie Lloyd. "At the same time, we know that the numbers could be calculated in different ways." Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, agreed that the percentage of health care spending devoted to emergency rooms could change depending on what figure is used for the denominator. "All these expenditure figures are at best approximations," Wilensky said. "There is no really good, precise way to calculate it." Several experts added that the total amount of money going to emergency care is ultimately less important than making sure that emergency rooms are used for the right type of care. Services provided in the ER do tend to cost significantly more than services provided in a primary-care setting. "Getting anything other than true emergency care in an emergency department tends to be an expensive, fragmented way to receive care and should be avoided if any other reasonable alternative is available," Wilensky said. That said, recent academic studies have suggested that the economics of emergency rooms and the larger health care system are more nuanced than previously thought. For instance, one study by the Rand Corp. suggested that it may be overburdened primary-care doctors -- not patients -- who are driving traffic toward the ER. According to Arthur Kellermann, one of the authors of the RAND paper, doctors described the ER to researchers as their "overflow valve" where they "send complicated patients" for diagnosis. Even Lee, who co-wrote the paper suggesting that ERs could account for as much as 10 percent of health care spending, has said that heavy use of emergency rooms is not necessarily a problem. "Diverting non-emergency care may simply shift costs onto primary care offices and clinics which may not have the infrastructure to accommodate a large volume of unscheduled care," Lee told Science Daily. Our ruling Gillespie said emergency rooms account for "2 percent of all health care spending." Experts told us that’s not the only way to calculate it, but it’s a credible way, and even if that figure is too low, other calculations put it in the single digits. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Nick Gillespie	None	None	None	2013-10-28T10:58:46	2013-10-22	['None']

pomt-10442	There are prototype cars that get between 100 and 150 miles per gallon and "we could have those cars in your garages in a couple of years."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/06/hillary-clinton/supercars-unlikely-in-a-couple-years/	With the price of gasoline soaring, the presidential candidates have all talked about long-term plans to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. In a speech at the North Carolina Democratic Party 2008 Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Raleigh, N.C., on May 2, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton weighed in with this claim: "And we will also make it clear that it is no longer going to be America over the oil barrel — the $120 oil barrel — that we're going to invest on a fast track like an Apollo project in cars that get greater gas mileage. "There are prototypes on the roads of America today that get between 100 and 150 miles per gallon. If we had a president who actually decided that this would be America's priority, we could have those cars in your garages in a couple of years. "In my energy plan, I would give you a $10,000 tax credit to buy a car that got greater gas mileage, to create a market." Industry experts say Clinton is talking about plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or PHEVs. These cars are a combination of the hybrid cars on the market today and battery electric cars that need to be plugged in and recharged. Some of the prototypes of these cars may be able to get more than 100 miles per gallon, as Clinton said, but there are significant obstacles to getting these from the prototype stage to mass market production in just a couple years. The technology isn't ready, the cost of the cars would likely be prohibitive for mass appeal and there are few American manufacturers of some of the necessary technology. Toyota, GM and Ford have all announced intentions to introduce PHEV vehicles in the coming years. Some of those prototype cars boast gas mileage north of 100 miles per gallon. But the numbers are squishy. One example is the Chevy Volt, a plug-in hybrid scheduled to hit the market in late 2010. The way these cars work, it would run purely on electricity, without emitting exhaust, for up to 40 miles. Then it would switch over to a gas motor, which would also recharge the battery (much as a standard hybrid works today). If the car is only used for relatively short trips, it would achieve gas mileage ratings like the ones cited by Clinton. But if you drive longer distances, the gas mileage rating goes down. A GM official in March estimated the cost, before tax incentives, might be about $48,000. "Broadly speaking, she (Clinton) is correct" about the prototypes' potential mileage, said Mike Millikin, founder and editor of Green Car Congress, a Web site for information on eco-friendly auto technology. The question then is whether, with a presidential push, these kinds of cars could be mass produced "in a couple years" and whether there would be a market if they could. People with expertise in auto technology are wary, at best. "I think that's pretty dubious other than in small, symbolic numbers," said John DeCicco, a senior fellow of automotive strategies for the Environmental Defense Fund. DeCicco said new cars get about 25 miles per gallon so to go from there to 100 miles per gallon in "a couple years," is unrealistic. First off, these cars are prototypes. Automakers have yet to work out issues like durability, reliability and safety, said Jennifer Moore, a spokeswoman with Ford Motor Co., which is working on a plug-in hybrid. "It is not a small step from prototype to mass commercialization," Moore said. Technology aside, there's also the question of whether the public would be willing to buy the cars. "Cost is clearly an issue," Moore said. Currently, it would cost about $20,000 for a battery needed to power a plug-in hybrid car, Millikin said. That's over and above the cost of the car itself. Clinton's plan for a $10,000 tax rebate for people who buy the cars is a good start, Millikin said, but it's not enough to cover the added cost. DeCicco said the country couldn't possibly afford to pay $10,000 tax rebates to enough people to make a significant dent in getting to where we want to be. There are 16-million new cars sold in the United States each year. "You just can't bribe everyone to buy a supercar," DeCicco said. Tax credits given to those who bought hybrids "haven't really moved the needle," he noted. There are a lot of factors besides gas mileage that go into a consumer's decision to buy a car, things like personal image and driving needs. There's another issue with the batteries. There is not an advanced lithium ion battery (the kind used by the plug-in hybrids) supplier or manufacturing base in the United States. We'd need one if the point is to decrease dependence on foreign energy sources. "We don't want to substitute one imported fuel with another imported fuel technology," said Edward Kjaer, director of electric transportation for Southern California Edison, which has partnered with Ford to develop plug-in hybrid prototypes. Millikin said Clinton's plan would require a sea change in the auto industry. "The likelihood of that, at this point in time, is not very good," Millikin said. Said DeCicco: "You can't transform an industry overnight just with prototypes. We've been there and done that and it didn't work. She (Clinton) should know." A similar Apollo-style program for hyper fuel-efficient cars was initiated under Bill Clinton's administration in the 1990s. Introduced in a Rose Garden ceremony and funded with a billion dollars in government money, the so-called Supercar project, formally known as the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, was a joint venture between the government and the Big Three automakers to create marketable and affordable ultra fuel-efficient cars. It resulted in hybrid prototypes and, in fact, the GM prototype topped the 100 miles per gallon threshold, DeCicco said. But none made it past the concept phase. Still, the industry is working on it. And several manufacturers plan to introduce plug-in hybrids in the coming years. The potential upside is massive, said Kjaer. "It could be a game-changer for the energy industry," he said. Obstacles like technology advances and cost will improve, Kjaer said. Advances in battery technology are progressing quickly, he said. And if the plug-in hybrids start to take off, he said, it will create a volume base for battery companies, which will bring down the cost of batteries. Many experts agree much will depend on the public's view of the immediacy of global warming. Perhaps even more important, the public's response probably will be determined by whether gas prices continue to skyrocket. Lee Schipper, an energy expert and visiting fellow at University of California at Berkeley, said Clinton is weakening her case for the high-mileage cars by urging a holiday on gas taxes to lower the price per gallon during the summer. "Bringing a prototype to market to save fuel really takes convincing both companies to make them and a buying public convinced that high oil prices are here to stay," he said. "Candidates cannot both expect the prototypes to appear and try to argue for lower oil prices." Clinton is correct about there being prototypes that get more than 100 miles per gallon (at least according to some measures). But experts believe it is unlikely these plug-in hybrids will or even could be mass produced in just a "couple years" — as Clinton suggests. We hate to rain on Clinton's optimism, but the fact is that she significantly overstates the status of high-mileage vehicles. Best we can do is Barely True.

pomt-09732	Health proposal would create a "40% tax on health care benefits of middle-class workers."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/21/health-care-america-now/excise-tax-cadillac-middle-class/	Unions are usually supporters of the Democratic plans for health reform, but there's one thing they don't like: an excise tax on high-dollar health care plans, popularly known as "Cadillac" plans. Health Care for America Now, a coalition that includes unions, has launched an ad attacking the excise tax, which was included in a version of health reform authored by Sen. Max Baucus and approved by the Senate Finance Committee on Oct. 13. Here's what the ad says: "We all know America needs real health care reform, but there's a right way and a wrong way to pay for it. Some senators say they want to tax so-called 'Cadillac' health care plans, but those proposals will also tax the benefits of millions of middle-class workers. There's a better way. Let's ask individuals making more than $250,000 to pay their fair share." We're checking the facts behind the text that flashes on the screen during the ad: "40% tax on health care benefits of middle-class workers." The excise tax works in a roundabout way. Under the Senate Finance proposal, insurance companies would have to pay a 40 percent excise tax on health insurance policies that exceed $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families. We spoke with three economists on both the left and the right, and they all agreed that insurance companies will not simply absorb the new tax; they will pass it along in the form of higher premiums. Employers will then try to avoid the new higher costs by buying cheaper health plans. Finally, the economists agreed that if employers have to scale back on health plans, they will eventually pay higher wages as they seek to retain workers. At this point, disgruntled workers may say "Yeah, right," but the economists were adamant that it is the case. Those higher wages are taxable, and that's how it becomes a tax increase for workers. An analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is nonpartisan and advises Congress on tax policy, confirmed this point. The Joint Committee found that many people affected by this make less than $200,000. (For more details on this Joint Committee analysis, see our report on someone else who doesn't like the excise tax: Sarah Palin .) So here's what that means: If workers end up getting paid more, they'll also be taxed more. Another point worth emphasizing is that the 40 percent tax is on the portion of the health plan that exceeds $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for families. It's not on the whole plan. We should point out here that many workers have no idea what their health plans cost. How do you know if you have a "Cadillac" plan? If you're sick of paying more and more out of pocket for health care, you probably don't have a Cadillac plan. On the other hand, if you feel like your health plan is quite generous, you might. These are plans that generally have very low co-pays and lots of extras. A Boston Globe report described one plan for state employees in New Hampshire as offering free surgery, low-cost prescriptions, free rehab for alcoholism, a stipend for gym memberships and reimbursements for yoga classes. CEOs have these types of plans, but so do some unionized workers. An economist we spoke with said they are commonly offered by state and local governments and universities, the types of jobs that are said to have "great benefits." Estimates we've looked at suggest that, by 2019, the excise tax would affect as many as 25 percent and as few as 17 percent of all tax filers. The ad says the proposal is a "40% tax on health care benefits of middle-class workers." But that's an overstatement that fails to mention it's an excise tax that would only affect workers with health care benefits above a certain level. Most middle-class workers won't be affected at all. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Health Care for America Now	None	None	None	2009-10-21T18:03:33	2009-10-15	['None']

pomt-14376	Says Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland "voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/mar/18/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-wrongly-says-merrick-garland-voted-ba/	Even if Republican senators agree to consider President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, his record on gun rights alone will stop his confirmation, says Fox News host Bill O’Reilly. On his show March 16, O’Reilly acknowledged that Obama’s pick — Merrick Garland, chief judge of the federal court of appeals for the D.C. circuit— is "not some crazy left-wing bomb thrower." "But he voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens, and the Supreme Court of course said no, that is unconstitutional," O’Reilly added. "But he voted to keep the guns away. Just that vote, and you must know this, alienates most in the Republican Party, so they never would vote to confirm him." A few conservative groups and figures have already attacked Garland for his position on guns since his nomination. We’re putting O’Reilly’s specific claim that Garland voted "to keep guns away from private citizens" on the Truth-O-Meter. D.C. gun ban O’Reilly’s statement refers to a landmark case on gun rights, District of Columbia vs. Heller. In its 2008 ruling, the Supreme Court found that Washington’s gun regulations — essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home — were unconstitutional. This ruling was significant because it was the first time the court held that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to own a firearm for self defense. Up until Heller, the widespread understanding of the Second Amendment was that the right to bear arms did not necessarily extend beyond militia service. Before the case went to the Supreme Court, though, it appeared in the federal court of appeals for the D.C. circuit, where Garland has been a judge since 1997, as Parker vs. District of Columbia. In a 2-1 decision, a panel of three D.C. Circuit judges came to the same conclusion as the Supreme Court: The Washington handgun ban was unconstitutional. Based on O’Reilly’s claim, one might assume that the single dissenting vote in this D.C. Circuit opinion belonged to Garland. However, it was Judge Karen Henderson who dissented, while Judges Laurence Silberman and Thomas Griffith signed the majority opinion. Garland didn’t vote on this case at all. After the D.C. Circuit handed down its 2007 decision, the city of Washington asked the court to rehear the case en banc, meaning all of the court’s judges would reconsider the case, not just the panel of three. The court ended up denying the city’s petition, but Garland was among the group of D.C. Circuit judges who was in favor of rehearing the case. It’s not fair to conclude that Garland supported the Washington gun regulations because he wanted to reconsider the case, as he did not take a formal position on the merits of the case. Rehearing a case en banc is generally used when a case goes against precedent or presents a question of significant importance, and that was true of the Heller case. D.C. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a well-known conservative, joined Garland in voting to reconsider the case. And the Bush administration, though supportive of the notion that the Second Amendment protects individual rights, filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court asking them to send Heller back to the lower courts for consideration, noted Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment law expert at the University of California Los Angeles Law School. "Garland voted for his court to consider the constitutionality of D.C.'s law," Winkler said. "Such a vote does not tell us one way or another how Garland feels about the Second Amendment." We should also note another case, which some critics say indicates that Garland has a left-leaning opinion of the Second Amendment. In 2000, he joined the majority opinion in a 2-1 finding that the FBI could hold on to gun purchase records for six months for auditing purposes, to make sure the instant background check systems worked. The National Rifle Association called the six-month record retention an "illegal national registration of gun owners," while the court found that it was a common-sense auditing system, not a national firearm registry, according to news reports from the time. Our ruling O’Reilly said Merrick Garland "voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens." Garland never heard the case about Washington gun laws from the bench, and so he never voted on it. He voted in favor of reconsidering the case, but it’s impossible to extrapolate from that vote his position on the merits of the case. We rate O’Reilly’s claim False.

Government numbers indicate that's an accurate statement. The most recent statistics compiled by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, cited in recent reports about the subprime lending crisis, say 40 percent of Hispanic homeowners have subprime mortgages. By comparison, 52 percent of black homeowners have subprime mortgages while only 19 percent of non-Hispanic whites do.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2007-09-10T00:00:00	2007-09-09	['None']

pomt-01636	"Over the last 40 years, real wage growth has been flatlined because of the policies of the Federal Reserve ... It was all driven by the Federal Reserve."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/26/herman-cain/herman-cain-says-wages-flat-thanks-federal-reserve/	Earlier this year, President Barack Obama asked Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10, following a national conversation about wages and income inequality. But according to 2012 Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain, a higher minimum wage isn’t enough, since the real value of paychecks hasn’t budged in four decades. Appearing on Aug. 11’s Varney and Co. on Fox News Business, Cain criticized former Bill Clinton labor secretary Robert Reich who blamed a rise in income inequality on the financial elite. Cain told host Stuart Varney it’s the Federal Reserve that is responsible. "This is a fact, Stuart, over the last 40 years, real wage growth has been flatlined because of the policies of the Federal Reserve," Cain said. "It had nothing to do with greedy CEOs, nothing to do with what companies wanted to do. It was all driven by the Federal Reserve trying to control unemployment with the faulty control of wage growth." We wanted to see if real wages -- which is a worker’s salary adjusted for inflation -- have indeed seen no growth for four decades and whether that could be tied to Federal Reserve policies. Cain’s research associate Rich Lowrie, his former economic adviser and one of the creators of Cain’s 9-9-9 tax plan, referred us to this video. The video takes its data from the World Top Incomes Database, a project of leading economists whose calculations are based off of income tax records. As for the theory that the Fed’s policies are responsible for real wage stagnation, that was Lowrie’s and other Cain researchers’ independent conclusion. "We think it’s unmistakable that there is a connection," Lowrie said. For this fact-check, we talked to Lowrie, researchers at think thanks with various political leanings, and a number of independent economists. What we found was that this claim is about competing theories on labor economics and monetary policy. Cain's viewpoint is an outlier. Incoming fail We’ll start by assessing Cain’s claim that real wage growth has flatlined over the past 40 years. Later we’ll talk about the role of the Federal Reserve. Cain got the stat after analyzing data from a reputable source, the World Top Incomes Database. But Cain off the bat made a mistake of describing his analysis as measuring wage growth. Really, the statistics he looked at measure income growth. (Wages refers to the paychecks a worker receives within a certain time frame and constitute a part of income. Income also includes investments, rent checks, and other sources of incoming cash.) Between 1972 and 2012, real income has grown by an average of 0.52 percent from year to year. Paltry growth, but growth. Lowrie, a corporate financial adviser, said Cain was focusing on a group Lowrie called the "striving majority," the bottom 90 percent of American wage earners. Real income for that group has actually decreased annually at an average 0.16 percent, according to the World Top Incomes Database. As you can see, income growth hasn’t literally flatlined -- it’s bounced up and down a bit. Real income growth was the most stagnant in the 1970s, but saw some gains in the 1990s before falling in the 2000s. Cain "just ignores the ups and downs," said Mark Bils, a professor of macroeconomics at the University of Rochester. "Forty years is a long span." And average incomes, even adjusted for inflation, don’t capture the differences in working conditions between 1972 and today, according to Bils. Working hours are different and purchasing power has risen. All quiet on the wage front What happens when we focus on wages? Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the liberal think tank Economic Policy Institute, looked at real wage growth from 1979 to 2013, using data from the Bureau of Labor Economics. The results show that Americans who earn less have seen very little wage growth while top earners have made gains. For the 70th percentile workers (those who make more than 70 percent of all workers), hourly wages saw virtually no growth between 1979 and 1995. The years 1995 to 2000 were an exception, with an annualized growth rate of 1.4 percent. So in sum, if you factor in inflation, the average American has been bringing home the same amount of bacon for the past four decades, while the economic elite earn more from year to year. That doesn’t necessarily tell the entire story, economists told us, noting that wages do not factor in things like health benefits, tuition assistance, vacation time and sick leave. But by Cain’s yardstick, he is largely correct. Federal reservations Cain, however, did not simply say wage growth has flatlined. He blamed the Federal Reserve. That view is an outlier. According to Bivens, the claim is "not very grounded." John Makin, a former economist at Federal Reserve banks in Chicago and Atlanta currently at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, and University of California, Berkeley labor economist Michael Reich said they have not seen any research that ties Federal Reserve policies to real wages flatlining. Both Makin and Reich (a colleague of Robert Reich’s, but no relation) pointed out that neither Cain nor Lowrie are economists. At best, the Federal Reserve has "a marginal effect on the long term trend of real wage growth," said Kenneth Rogoff, author of This Time is Different and a professor economics and public policy at Harvard University. Though economists don’t give much credence to the general claim, they helped us dissect Cain’s theories, which boil down to how the Fed affixes the value of the dollar, how the Fed sets interest rates, and how the Fed defines and measures inflation. Fed policies, according to the Fed Fed policies, according to Cain and Lowrie Real wages Cannot directly affect real wages, which is determined by largely nonmonetary factors. Treat real wages as inflation, thus intentionally kept stable. Inflation Aim for inflation rate of 2% to stabilize prices and maximize employment Keep inflation down and thus real wages as well. Price index Use the personal price expenditures index largely, as well as many other indices, to measure inflation. Use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to measure inflation, but in reality substitute real wages for the CPI. Value of the dollar Do not target the exchange value, but take into account the effect of the dollar on the U.S. economy. Used to measure inflation, keeping the value stable. Now float the dollar, letting the value fluctuate. Sources: Federal Reserve FAQ and interviews with Lowrie The dollar Lowrie pinpoints 1971 as the year when real income began to flatline, which is also the year when the United States stopped tying its currency to gold. The theory goes that when the dollar was backed by gold, real wages were growing increasingly; and when the gold exchange standard was nixed, the dollar began to float -- subject to fluctuation on the foreign currency and exchange markets -- and wages flatlined. With a stable currency, material costs for businesses flatlined and thus rose wages, Lowrie said. This is the debased currency argument -- a floating dollar has less purchasing power, leading to inflation and thus depreciating real wages -- and one virtually all economists are skeptical of. At best, the theory is "hand-wavy," according to Bivens. "You would really need to see an increase in inflation for this to make sense, and that’s not the story of the past decades for sure," he said. What’s more, the value of the dollar is largely under the U.S. Treasury’s purview, not the Fed’s. Interest rates According to Lowrie, the Fed will lower interest rates when the economy is expanding, making it easier for businesses to borrow money and boosting wealth. When the economy begins to contract, the Fed raises interest rates to curb inflation but instead leading to less investment in business and thus a decrease in wages. Lowrie's description of interest rate policies sits well with economists. Bivens said that the Fed is certainly "quick on the trigger" when it comes to enacting policies that heat up and cool down the economy, potentially affecting wages immediately. But the idea that policies have a direct or even significant impact on real wages is a tall order, experts said. "Productivity has grown steadily over the postwar period, but only since 1980 have real wages failed to grow with productivity growth. Interest rate policy has not changed during that period," Reich said. While it’s true that higher interest rates generally increase unemployment and slow nominal wage growth (not adjusted for inflation) in the time immediately following the hikes, they don’t do much for real wages, according to Reich. "Over 40 years, it’s not going to matter," said Bils. "Maybe they create some asset run-rups in the short term, but it doesn’t follow that wages would decrease." Inflation Lowrie’s third point suggests that the Fed treats real wages as inflation and attempts to keep growth down to keep inflation down. Lowrie said the Fed uses lagging data, namely the CPI, to measure inflation but because the data doesn’t reflect the market in real time, the Fed defaults to using real wages as a proxy. Since part of the objective of the Fed is to stabilize prices, they stabilize real wages instead. Economists take issue with the characterization of how inflation is measured. The Fed focuses on general rises in prices, not wages, to evaluate inflation, but to predict inflation, other factors like GDP growth and unemployment are also taken into account. Bivens compared it to baseball projections. "Looking at strikeouts and walks is a better predictor of wins than past wins," he said. And according to Makin, the very definition of inflation means that real wages can’t be its proxy, because doing so would discount the other part of the equation -- wages. "Real wages are nominal wages adjusted for inflation," he said. "If the Fed caused the price level to rise more rapidly, then prices would rise faster than money, and real wages would go (down) fast. If prices rise slowly, then real wages would go up." In other words, in order for real wages to grow, nominal wage growth would have to rise faster than inflation. Since inflation has been below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent, it’s the lack of nominal wage growth that’s keeping real wages down. In real-wage-ality If it’s not the Fed, what’s actually been holding real wages down? Economists attribute it to many factors. An economist at the Fed itself wrote that labor market conditions are to blame. Bils listed changes in technology, risk taking and investing, and human capital. There’s also increased international trade, fluctuating demand for different skill levels and income tax policy, said Stephen Moore, a former senior economist at the congressional Joint Economic Committee who now works at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Makin and Biven pointed to a rise in labor productivity combined with a weak demand for labor. And Reich said all of the above: increased competition from low-wage countries, technological change that has reduced the need for jobs in the mid-level pay scales, while encouraging growth in low-paid occupations, the decline of unions and the decline of real minimum wages. "While professional economists' opinions on the relative importance of each of these varies, I have never seen a statement that Fed policies regarding inflation are at all a factor," Reich said. Our ruling Cain said, "Over the last 40 years, real wage growth has been flatlined because of the policies of the Federal Reserve." Cain’s research associate was looking at real income growth, but the findings are consistent if you measure income or wages. In short, wage growth has remain relatively flat. But Cain goes too far in blaming policies of the Federal Reserve, both conservative and liberal economists told us us. Various nonmonetary policy factors are much more likely to cause a lack of wage growth. Cain’s claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-09925	Says President Obama was wrong "about Muslims' historical contributions to mankind, such as algebra (actually that was the ancient Babylonians), the compass (that was the Chinese), pens (the Chinese again) and medical discoveries."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/19/ann-coulter/ann-coulter-criticizes-obama-muslim-history/	Conservatives had lots of reasons to criticize President Barack Obama’s speech in Cairo. Some thought Obama went too far in praising his Muslim audience, some thought he was too harsh on Israel, and some thought he shouldn’t have been there in the first place. Ann Coulter had her own angle. She went after Obama's accuracy. "Obama listed, incorrectly, Muslims' historical contributions to mankind, such as algebra (actually that was the ancient Babylonians), the compass (that was the Chinese), pens (the Chinese again) and medical discoveries (huh?)," she wrote in a June 10, 2009, op-ed on the Human Events Web site. (The words in parentheses are Coulter's as they appeared in the column.) She said Obama was ingratiating himself to the same community that launched the 9/11 attacks. "All these inventions came in mighty handy on Sept. 11, 2001! Thanks, Muslims!!" she wrote. Here's exactly what Obama said in the Cairo speech: "As a student of history, I also know civilization's debt to Islam," said Obama in his June 4, 2009, speech. "It was Islam — at places like Al-Azhar — that carried the light of learning through so many centuries, paving the way for Europe's Renaissance and Enlightenment. ... It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra; our magnetic compass and tools of navigation; our mastery of pens and printing; our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed." Obama's larger point is that elements of Islamic culture are found throughout Western society. "I consider it part of my responsibility as president of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear," he said. So, what of these inventions that Obama praised and Coulter critiqued? Was he wrong? Our friends at FactCheck.org already did some digging and found he was generally correct, but we wanted to address Coulter's criticism more directly. Let's start with Obama's assertion about algebra. (Don't worry. We're dealing with history here, but no linear equations.) Indeed, algebra does have roots in Islam. Baghdad-born Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi is "the father of algebra" according to the United Kingdom-based Foundation for Science Technology and Civilization, an organization devoted to explaining Muslim contributions to science. His seminal work, Hisab al-jabr w'al-muqabala — or The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing — was written in 820 A.D. and is widely considered the first book on algebra. In fact, the world al-jabr from the title is the root of the word "algebra." Nevertheless, others have contributed to algebra, including Diophantus, a Greek who some historians say should share the prestige of being the father of algebra with al-Khwarizmi. Diophantus lived some time between 200 and 298 A.D., some 500 years before al-Khwarizmi. His book, Arithmetica , is significant because it prompted the rebirth of number theory, or the study of positive numbers, according to Encyclopedia Britannica . Regardless, al-Khwarizmi's role in developing algebra is largely without dispute. And though the Babylonians did live in what we consider modern-day Baghdad, Coulter incorrectly identifies the origins of algebra. Moving on to navigation and the creation of the compass, Coulter is correct that Obama is on shakier ground. While many cultures used primitive navigation devices, the Chinese are usually credited with popularizing the magnetic compass, which, in its earliest form, involved a magnetized spoon-shaped stone that aligned with Earth's magnetic field. There is strong evidence, however, that Muslims made navigation tools easier to use; an astronomer named Azarchel, for example, created an all-in-one astrolabe, a device used to determine direction using the constellations. Writing instruments come from ancient Egypt, where people used pens made from river reeds to inscribe papyrus. However, Al-Mu'izz, a Muslim who ruled Egypt from 953 to 975, is credited with inventing the fountain pen. So, Obama's claim that the "mastery" of pens originated in the Muslim world is in the ballpark. Printing, however, is decidedly of Asian origins; the Chinese and Koreans developed woodblock and movable type printing. And around 1440 A.D., a German named Johannas Gutenburg invented the printing press, his most well known project being the Gutenburg Bible. Obama overstates the role Muslims played in printing. He would have been more accurate if he pointed out that followers of Mohammed were instrumental in disseminating the printed word, according to Jonathan M. Bloom's Paper Before Print: The History and Impact of Paper in the Islamic World . Lastly, Obama contends that Muslims developed certain aspects of modern medicine, which is partly true. According to the National Institutes of Health, the Greeks influenced healing practices in the Islamic world, but then the work of many Muslims influenced the ideas and practices in late medieval Europe from which early modern medicine eventually arose. Dr. Max Gross of Georgetown University's Prince Alwaleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding said it’s fair to say that Muslims created or contributed significantly to all the inventions Obama outlined in his speech. "I have no difficulties with what Obama said," said Gross. Nevertheless, Gross pointed out that innovation can develop in different places at nearly the same time, so there is inevitably some disagreement with where certain tools or ideas originate. He used the astrolabe to emphasize his point. Muslims did not "create all navigation tools, they refined the astrolabe," he said. "The astrolabe is what Europeans used to navigate the oceans." Let’s review this little history lesson by revisiting Obama's words. He didn't say Muslims were the sole inventors of these disciplines, he merely said their innovation contributed to the development of disciplines. We find Coulter is incorrect about Obama's statement about algebra, that she's largely right about navigation, that she's wrong about pens and that it's fuzzy about how much Muslims contributed to modern medicine. So we find her criticism to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02828	On changing the rules for filibusters on presidential nominees	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/22/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-among-flip-floppers-senates-nuclea/	"To correct this abuse, the majority in the Senate is prepared to restore the Senate’s traditions and precedents to ensure that regardless of party, any president’s judicial nominees, after full and fair debate, receive a simple up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. It is time to move away from advise and obstruct and get back to advise and consent." Sen. Mitch McConnell, remarks on Senate floor, May 19, 2005 "Let me say we are not interested in having a gun put to our head any longer. If you think this is in the best interests of the Senate and the American people to make advise and consent, in effect, mean nothing—obviously you can break the rules to change the rules to achieve that. But some of us have been around here long enough to know that the shoe is sometimes on the other foot." Sen. Mitch McConnell, remarks on the Senate floor, Nov. 21, 2013 After years of partisan threats and retreats, the Democratic Senate majority on Nov. 21, 2013, enacted a controversial rule change called the "nuclear option." The change eliminated the filibuster -- a blockage of floor action, typically by the chamber’s minority party -- for executive branch nominations as well as judicial appointments short of the Supreme Court. Under the new rule, the Senate only needs a 51-vote majority instead of a 60-vote supermajority to end a filibuster and move to a final vote on a nomination. The question of whether to change the rule has long divided the chamber’s majority and its minority. In fact, supporting or opposing the "nuclear option" has been much more closely linked to a senator’s position in the majority or the minority than whether they’re a Republican or Democrat. This means that both Republicans and Democrats made different arguments in this recent faceoff than they had in previous iterations of the battle. Before and after Thursday’s vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., strongly condemned the nuclear option. He even accused the Democrats of breaking the Senate rules by going through with the change, which was then implemented with the support of all but a few Democrats and no Republicans. But eight years ago, when McConnell was the majority whip of a then-Republican Senate, he supported invoking the nuclear option himself. Time to take out the Flip-O-Meter! PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter rates politicians' consistency on particular topics from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on whether the change is justified or not. It simply looks at whether they did, indeed, change their stated position. We’ll take a look back to 2005, when the partisan lineup was substantially different. President George W. Bush had recently won a second term, while his fellow Republicans had a majority in the Senate. (The House was also controlled by Republicans, but the House isn’t directly involved in the filibuster fight.) In the Senate, the Democratic minority had filibustered a number of Bush’s judicial appointments, displeasing Republicans who started a campaign to stop any more such filibusters by invoking the nuclear option. McConnell, at the time the second-highest-ranking Republican in the chamber, described his party’s plan in a speech on the Senate floor on May 19, 2005: "The majority in the Senate is prepared to restore the Senate’s traditions and precedents to ensure that regardless of party, any president’s judicial nominees, after full and fair debate, receive a simple up-or-down vote on the Senate floor." "It is time to move away from advise and obstruct and get back to advise and consent," he added. The threat to go nuclear eventually went away when a bipartisan group of senators – the "Gang of 14" – signed a memorandum to block the effort. Seven Republicans promised not to vote with their colleagues to invoke the nuclear option, while in turn seven Democrats agreed to no longer support their party’s filibusters on judicial nominees. Fast-forward to 2013. Now, Democrats held the White House and a Senate majority. The Republican minority had been stalling nominations and appointments by Obama, including filibustering the nomination of former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense. Senate Democrats decided to go nuclear after the Senate GOP made clear that they had no intention of allowing three vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to be filled. Led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., they successfully invoked the rule change in a near-party-line vote, 52-48. The nuclear option was met with a storm of protest by the Senate Republicans, who took the opposite view of the one they expressed had in 2005. In a last push before the actual vote, Minority Leader McConnell said, "we are not interested in having a gun put to our head any longer. If you think this is in the best interests of the Senate and the American people to make advise and consent, in effect, mean nothing — obviously you can break the rules to change the rules to achieve that," McConnell said on the Senate floor. Then he added: "Some of us have been around here long enough to know that the shoe is sometimes on the other foot." This acknowledged the time when he was in the majority. In a press conference after the rule change went through, McConnell further lamented the decision: "I think it's a time to be sad about what's been done to the United States Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the world," he said. Our ruling In 2005, McConnell was part of the Republican majority that proposed a "nuclear option" rule change. This week, when the Democratic majority enacted a nuclear option, he strongly condemned it. We rate this a Full Flop.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2013-11-22T18:33:15	2013-11-21	['None']

pomt-06310	"[A]n extra 8 million Americans [are] projected to join state Medicaid programs in the next few years."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/nov/15/phil-gingrey/gingrey-says-8-million-extra-people-join-medicaid/	U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey thinks states need financial wiggle room in these tight times, and is offering health care legislation to give them room to stretch. Gingrey’s 2011 State Flexibility Act would nix a lesser-known requirement of last year’s health care reform bill that critics think would make Medicaid, the federal government’s health care program for the poor, too costly for states. "With an extra 8 million Americans projected to join state Medicaid programs in the next few years, state governments need the flexibility to make cost-saving reforms to Medicaid in order to balance their budgets," Gingrey, a Marietta Republican, said in a Sept. 15 press release. We know Medicaid is supposed to grow because of health care overhaul, but what’s this about an "extra" 8 million people? Gingrey’s point was that updated estimates published after the passage of last year’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act show that there will be millions more people eligible for Medicaid than legislators were originally told, Gingrey spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said. This means health care reform will be even more costly than lawmakers anticipated, and states need the help that Gingrey’s bill provides. Is that true? Before we delve into Gingrey’s claim, here’s more on the 2011 State Flexibility Act, which repeals certain federal restrictions on Medcaid funds. The federal government generally pays half or more of the Medicaid bill. The remainder falls to the states, which administer the program and set some of its rules. The federal dollars come with strings attached. The state has to distribute the Medicaid money; State rules have to meet basic federal requirements. Health care reform expands Medicaid in 2014 to give coverage to people with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. This change could be costly, so some states want to drop some federal requirements to ease their budget troubles. Backers of the State Flexibility Act want to give these states the leeway they want. Bill opponents say allowing these changes could leave hundreds of thousands of people, most of them children, uninsured. Now, let’s take a look at Gingrey’s claim. As you’ll recall, his point is that 8 million more people are projected to sign up for the program than legislators were originally told. There’s little doubt that health care reform will increase the overall number of people on Medicaid. But Gingrey’s take on the facts is flawed. While legislators battled over the reforms in 2009 and 2010, the Congressional Budget Office, which reviews legislation that could impact the federal budget, issued cost projections. They also estimated how much Medicaid enrollment would grow. About five months after the legislation passed, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which helps administer Medicaid, issued its own estimates. Its numbers were higher than the CBO’s. By 2014, the CBO expects that Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which covers low-income kids who aren’t qualified for Medicaid, will cover 9 million more Americans than it would have without reforms. It would be 16 million in 2016, then 17 million in 2021. By 2014, CMS expects rolls for Medicaid and CHIP will be 23.3 million higher in 2014, then drop to slightly more than 20 million in 2018 and 2019. CMS published its estimate Oct. 2010 in Health Affairs, a peer-reviewed health policy journal. There is a big gap between the CMS and CBO estimates, though Gingrey’s number is a bit off. The difference varies from about 4 million to more than 14 million, not 8 million, depending on the year. But the higher CMS estimate is not an update of the CBO figure. Instead, they are two separate projections based on different data and assumptions. They’re not comparable. Medicaid is such a complicated program that calculating enrollment is tougher than you’d think. CBO bases its enrollment numbers on the Survey of Income and Program Participation, which is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. CMS’ projections use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which is conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Also, the CBO predicts that the percent of eligible people who join Medicaid will remain roughly the same under health care reform, said Benjamin Sommers, a Harvard University professor who has studied Medicaid enrollment. CMS assumes that a far greater percentage will sign up. Another difference is that CMS expects enrollment will spike immediately after Medicaid expands in 2014. But the CBO thinks enrollment will take place gradually, their charts show. The estimates become more similar over time, Sommers noted. Projections by independent groups also vary, but those we reviewed are in line with CBO and CMS estimates. For example, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation’s Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured said that enrollment would be between 15.9 million and 22.8 million higher, depending on how eager people are to join, and the success of the outreach effort. The Urban Institute estimated that 16.8 million more people would be covered by Medicaid if health care reform took effect in 2010. How do we rule? The fact that CBO estimates released in March 2010 were lower than CMS estimates released later that year is not proof that "extra people" will join Medicaid, as Gingrey said. Different government agencies simply arrived at different results, based on different data and assumptions. Since they’re making projections for an unprecedented overhaul in the country’s health care system, it’s reasonable for their results to vary. All projections foresee a major increase in Medicaid rolls, and Gingrey rightly noted a significant difference between two federal estimates. But he made a mistake when he understood CMS’ estimate as an update of the CBO figures. Gingrey’s statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We therefore rate his claim Half True.	None	Phil Gingrey	None	None	None	2011-11-15T06:00:00	2011-09-15	['United_States']

pomt-00413	Wisconsin is "49th out of 50 states in infrastructure."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/30/tony-evers/tony-evers-cherry-picks-old-statistic-claiming-wis/	At a rally for Democrats who had won their primaries, Tony Evers lamented that various things he described as Wisconsin values "have been trashed." "Another thing that’s a Wisconsin value is infrastructure, whether it’s roads or bridges," the party’s gubernatorial nominee said in Madison on Aug. 16, 2018, two days after the elections. "My God," he declared, "we are 49th out of 50 states in infrastructure." Are Wisconsin’s bones in such bad shape? Evers made the 49th-in-infrastructure claim before he defeated seven other Democrats to win the nomination. And he has made it clear he’ll criticize Republican Gov. Scott Walker on infrastructure ahead of the general election. There’s room to criticize Walker on infrastructure, particularly when it comes to roads. But Evers went beyond just roads in making his claim. And he cherry picked a ranking that is too-narrow and not up to date. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. ‘Infrastructure’ definitions vary Let’s start by noting there is not a universal definition of infrastructure, as various rankings show. U.S. News & World Report, in its "Best States 2017" ratings," ranked Wisconsin 39th in infrastructure — which included an assortment of factors, such as roads, bridges, renewable energy usage, broadband access and others. Road quality was where Wisconsin ranked 49th. That’s where Evers got his statistic. Tens of millions in tax money directed to a Milwaukee streetcar at the expense of police, schools? Mostly False. But again, roads are only one part of infrastructure. And there are at least three more recent rankings on infrastructure — including the current one by U.S. News -- where Wisconsin is in the middle, or even higher: U.S. News & World Report: In the magazine’s "2018 Best States" report, released in February 2018, Wisconsin ranked 26th overall on infrastructure. That included a ranking of 14th in energy — for electricity price, power grid reliability and renewable energy usage; 41st in internet access — for broadband access and ultra-fast internet access; and 34th in transportation — for road quality and bridge quality, commute time and public transit usage. (Specifically on road quality, Wisconsin ranked 44th, up a bit from 49th.) Wisconsin is "49th in the country in internet speed." Half True. CNBC: The business news TV network said it evaluated road and bridge quality, commute time, the availability of air travel and other factors to rank the states on infrastructure. For 2018, Wisconsin ranked 23rd. 24/7 Wall Street: The financial news website ranked the states in early August 2018 with an index using the share of bridges, roads and dams that are "in a state of disrepair or potentially hazardous," and it looked at state highway spending per person. On that measure of infrastructure, Wisconsin ranked 15th — as in 15th worst, as this ranking was done differently. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. We’ll also note that the American Society of Civil Engineers rates the nation’s infrastructure in 16 categories, including roads and bridges. Its most recent report, for 2017, gave the nation a grade of D+. That report says that in Wisconsin, "driving on roads in need of repair" costs each driver $637 per year and 8.7 percent of the state’s bridges are rated structurally deficient. But the report doesn’t give grades to the states and doesn’t rank the states. It’s also worth noting, with regard to roads, that we rated Mostly False a Walker claim that he had invested $3 billion more in the state’s transportation system than his predecessor did. And our rating was Mostly False when Walker said state road projects "are staying on track or getting done sooner." Our rating Evers says Wisconsin is "49th out of 50 states in infrastructure." His statement relies on a too-narrow ranking that isn’t current, and it ignores other rankings. In 2017, U.S. News & World Report ranked Wisconsin 49th in road quality — but 39th in overall infrastructure, based not only on roads but bridges, renewable energy usage, broadband access and other factors. Moreover, the magazine’s 2018 report ranks Wisconsin 26th in infrastructure. And Wisconsin is well above the bottom, though not great, in two other national rankings. We rate Evers’ statement False.

pomt-04928	Says "millions of dollars in tax breaks" were paid for "by busting unions, cutting BadgerCare, and raising taxes on the poor and the middle class, thanks to Elizabeth Coggs' help."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/31/we-are-milwaukee/democratic-wisconsin-lawmaker-helped-gop-gov-scott/	A campaign brochure with a picture of Republican Gov. Scott Walker and headlines referring to Rep. Elizabeth Coggs, D-Milwaukee, claims "millions of dollars in tax breaks" were paid for "by busting unions, cutting BadgerCare, and raising taxes on the poor and the middle class, thanks to Elizabeth Coggs' help." In a word: Really? Walker’s legislative changes in 2011 transformed him into a Republican star and one of the nation’s most divisive political figures. And yet the group circulating the material, We Are Milwaukee, claims a Democratic Assembly member helped make it all possible. Distribution of it comes ahead of the Aug. 14, 2012 primary election in which Coggs and four other Democrats are seeking the seat being vacated by Coggs' cousin -- state Sen. Spencer Coggs, D-Milwaukee -- who was elected city treasurer in April 2012. So let’s return to the wildly partisan times of 2011 and see what role Coggs played in advancing Walker’s agenda. "Paid for" We Are Milwaukee Inc., which says it works for social and economic justice, registered with the state Government Accountability Board as a political committee in March 2012. Its registrant was Peter Rickman, who has been active in public demonstrations against Walker and as part of the Occupy Wall Street movement. The front of the We Are Milwaukee brochure against Coggs (which lists a return address in Wauwatosa) says: "We need leaders who will stand up to Scott Walker." The attack on Coggs, on the back, cites three 2011 votes. It says Coggs "voted with" Walker on one bill that the group says provides "millions of dollars in tax breaks to big corporations and the super-rich." It goes on to say Walker and his allies paid for for the tax breaks "by busting unions, cutting BadgerCare, and raising taxes on the poor and the middle class, thanks to Elizabeth Coggs’ help." Cited are Walker’s budget-repair bill and his 2011-2013 state budget bill. Rickman referred our questions to We Are Milwaukee spokesman Eric Hogensen, who argued that the tax breaks bill "opened the door" to cuts made in the budget-repair and budget bills because they created a "deficit." Hmmm. The budget deficit Walker faced exceeded $3 billion. Just how pivotal was the single tax breaks bill that We Are Milwaukee cited? Let’s examine the three bills, all of which became law and are footnoted in the flyer. 1. Tax breaks As we reported in analyzing a July 2012 claim made by state Rep. Kelda Helen Roys, D-Madison, against state Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, in a congressional race, Assembly Bill 3 wipes away taxes for two years for businesses that move to Wisconsin. The state estimates the bill will mean $1 million over two years in lost revenue. Coggs voted for the bill, but so did many other Democrats. It was approved in the Assembly overwhelmingly, 82-12, in January 2011. So, Coggs did vote "with Walker" for a bill that could, over a period of years, create tax breaks amounting to millions of dollars. But her vote was hardly as decisive as the group portrays it. 2. Budget-repair bill After a 61-hour debate in February 2011, the GOP-controlled Assembly adopted the budget-repair bill in a chaotic fashion. The bill gave Walker broad powers to reshape health programs, use borrowing and make employees pay more for benefits to fill a $137 million hole in the two-year state budget ending June 30, 2011. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported: "Just after 1 a.m., Republicans cut off debate on Gov. Scott Walker's bill and in pell-mell fashion the body voted 51-17 to pass it. In the confusion, nearly one-third of the body -- 28 lawmakers including 25 Democrats, two Republicans and the body's lone independent -- did not vote on the bill at all." Coggs was among those who did not vote, Assembly records show. But the lack of her vote wasn't an important factor, given the margin the bill was approved by. And the $137 million deficit far exceeded the estimated loss of $1 million in revenue over two years from the tax breaks bill Coggs did vote for. Yet We Are Milwaukee says the $1 million paved the way for the $137 million -- and more. 3. Budget bill As for the two-year state budget, the Assembly passed it, 60-38, in June 2011. Records show Coggs voted no. The Walker-GOP budget cut spending on schools, local governments and public workers' benefits to meet the two-year shortfall -- which was more than $3 billion. Indeed, it would have taken more than 3,000 tax breaks at $1 million each to "pay for" the cuts. Our rating We Are Milwaukee said "millions of dollars in tax breaks" were paid for "by busting unions, cutting BadgerCare, and raising taxes on the poor and the middle class, thanks to Elizabeth Coggs' help." The idea that some $1 million in tax breaks over a two-year period supported by Coggs and most other Assembly Democrats needed to be paid for by some $3 billion in budget cuts is false and ridiculous.

pomt-09954	"You've heard endlessly about waterboarding. It happened to three terrorists."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/21/dick-cheney/dick-cheney-says-only-three-terror-suspects-were-e/	President Barack Obama and former Vice President Dick Cheney squared off in dueling speeches on national security on May 21, 2009. Not surprisingly, Cheney defended the controversial interrogation techniques used during the Bush administration on some terror suspects after the 9/11 attacks. And, he said, despite all the hand-wringing and public debate about waterboarding over the last couple years, the technique was used on only three detainees. "You've heard endlessly about waterboarding," Cheney said in his address at the American Enterprise Institute. "It happened to three terrorists. One of them was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, who has also boasted about his beheading of Daniel Pearl. "We had a lot of blind spots after the attacks on our country, things we didn't know about al-Qaida. We didn't know about al-Qaida's plans, but Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and a few others did know. "And with many thousands of innocent lives potentially in the balance, we did not think it made sense to let the terrorists answer questions in their own good time, if they answered them at all." Public records support his claim about the three detainees, who collectively were subjected to waterboarding at least 267 times. The use of waterboarding — an interrogation technique that simulates drowning — was first publicly acknowledged by then-CIA director Michael Hayden during a Senate intelligence hearing on Feb. 5, 2008. He said it was used on three terror suspects in 2002 and 2003. "Let me make it very clear and to state so officially in front of this committee that waterboarding has been used on only three detainees," Hayden said. "It was used on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. It was used on Abu Zubaydah. And it was used on (Abd al-Rahim al-)Nashiri. The CIA has not used waterboarding for almost five years." According to a memo released by the Attorney General's Office in April 2009, waterboarding was removed from CIA’s authorized list of techniques sometime after 2005. Also in April 2009, the Justice Department released 2005 legal memos that detailed the use of the waterboarding technique in 2002 and 2003, including the revelation that it had been used 183 times against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-described planner of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Cheney is correct that during a military tribunal in 2007, Mohammed claimed responsibility for the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2002. The memos also noted that the CIA used waterboarding at least 83 times in August 2002 against Abu Zubaydah, described by the CIA as one of Osama bin Laden's key lieutenants. And lastly, the technique was used on Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the alleged mastermind of the 2000 USS Cole bombing. In all three cases, Hayden said, "We used it against these three high-value detainees because of the circumstances of the time. Very critical to those circumstances was the belief that additional catastrophic attacks against the homeland were imminent."

pomt-00452	Says Mike Braun has supported two proposals and a lawsuit to end coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/20/joe-donnelly/mike-braun-end-coverage-pre-existing-conditions/	Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana is accusing his Republican challenger of flip-flopping on health care. "Mike Braun now says he’s for pre-existing conditions," Donnelly said in a video he posted to Twitter on Aug. 13. "There’s only one problem. Mike has said time, after time, after time, he’s against it." Donnelly said Braun has supported a House and Senate bill, as well as a lawsuit that "would have ended coverage for pre-existing conditions." Is that true? Braun indeed supported these actions, but Braun also maintains he supports coverage for pre-existing conditions. During a meeting with Republican Party activists in Indiana’s conservative Hamilton County on Aug. 7, Braun answered a question on whether insurance companies should cover pre-existing medical conditions. "Definitely; yes. Nobody should go broke because they get sick or have a bad accident," Braun said. Braun’s campaign repeated this talking point to us. "Mike Braun supports covering pre-existing conditions, and believes plans that work for Hoosiers will come from market-driven solutions, not more of what big government and the insurance industry force upon them," campaign spokesman Josh Kelley said. But health care experts told us that’s nearly impossible. "It is hard to make private competitive health insurance work for people with pre-existing conditions absent government intervention," said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "That’s just the nature of risk spreading -- it doesn’t work without subsidies or a mandatory market." Braun’s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment on how he could square opposing Obamacare yet supporting one of its central tenets. The House bill In August 2017, just after joining the race, Braun urged his two Republican primary opponents who are representatives in the U.S. House, Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, to sign a discharge petition that would force Congress to vote on an Obamacare repeal bill. "The people of Indiana want a full repeal of Obamacare and every Republican in Congress needs to sign the petition forcing leadership to bring this bill up for a vote," Braun wrote in a letter to the editor of the Kokomo Tribune on Aug. 16, 2017. "Congressman Messer and Rokita voted for the same legislation before, so why not do everything possible to get something done? … When I’m in the Senate, I’ll take action and keep pushing for the full repeal of Obamacare." The bill in question would have ended the most important Affordable Care Act subsidies: tax credits for premiums, cost-sharing subsidies, the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. "So it would take away coverage for everybody, it’s not specific to whether you have a pre-existing condition, but by removing the subsidies, you would get a death spiral that would make coverage in the individual market unaffordable for everybody," Pollitz said. The Senate bill Braun similarly supported the Senate version of the bill. In several interviews, Braun criticized Donnelly for voting in favor of the Affordable Care Act and opposing repeal of the Affordable Care Act. "They want somebody that's going to be independent when they get to D.C. and I think that and attacking my business is when you've got a record that says you voted for Obamacare and then you were the deciding vote to repeal it," Braun said on the Ed Morrisey show on Aug. 14. "So, all of us as Republicans I think have a better message and we have the message of tax reform. I don't think Joe Donnelly had passed one piece of legislation in 12 years. He voted for Obamacare as a congressman, was the deciding vote against repealing it," Braun said during an IN Focus interview with Dan Spehler on July 22. "So, all of us as Republicans I think have a better message and we have the message of tax reform. You know, Joe Donnelly voted for Obamacare, you know back when he was a congressman and was a deciding vote against it (the GOP healthcare plan)," Braun said in an interview with Abdul Hakim-Shabbaz on July 23. There were several versions of the Senate bill depending on amendments. Regardless of which one we look at, Linda Blumberg, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute, told us in June coverage for people with pre-existing conditions would have been more expensive and less accessible under the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. The lawsuit On Feb. 26, 2018, 18 attorneys general and two governors challenged the Affordable Care Act as unlawful in a lawsuit filed in a U.S. district court in Texas. Braun told Politico reporter Burgess Everett he endorsed the lawsuit. That, too, would effectively end mandatory coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. "There would be much more damage beyond the issue of people with health problems being denied coverage, but that would in fact be one outcome," Blumberg told us. Our ruling Donnelly said Braun has supported two proposals and a lawsuit to end coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. His campaign referred us to Republican proposals in the Senate, House and a lawsuit to end the Affordable Health Care Act, which entails ending key provisions like mandatory coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Braun’s campaign reaffirmed such positions, but argued for a non-Obamacare way to cover pre-existing conditions. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-08971	"We don't get a lot of calls from this White House… I have, frankly, never had a call from them."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/jul/19/rick-perry/governor-rick-perry-says-hes-never-fielded-phone-c/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who seems to relish bashing Washington, suggested a complete lack of outreach by President Barack Obama and the White House in a Fox News Channel interview aired July 13. Speaking to anchor Neil Cavuto, Perry said: "We don’t get a lot of calls from this White House." Asked about his relations with the Democrat’s administration, the Republican governor said: "I have, frankly, never had a call from them." Perry’s remarks came after Cavuto asked the governor about federal plans to push afresh for a moratorium on the drilling of deep-water oil wells. According to a transcript posted online by Fox News, Cavuto said: "Did they consult on this? Did they consult you on this, sir, did anyone ..." Perry: "They don't..." Cavuto: "...run this, ‘Hey, we ought to give Rick Perry a call on this?’" Perry: "We don't get a lot of calls from this White House." Cavuto: "Really? How would you describe your relations with the Obama administration?" Perry: "You know, I have, frankly, never had a call from them. So they may have checked in at some staff levels that I'm not aware of." From "the standpoint of the White House caring what Texas thinks -- look... ," said Perry, ticking off some administration ideas he said would be injurious to Texas. "This is an administration that clearly has Texas on its radar and it’s in a bad way." We asked Perry’s office for elaboration on his no-call status with Obama and also contacted the White House, whose spokesman, Matt Lehrich, disputed Perry’s description. Lehrich pointed us to indications that Perry has been part of White House conference calls. On April 29, 2010, according to a press release on the White House website, the president called the governors of states on the Gulf of Mexico, including Perry, "to discuss the BP oil spill situation and assure the governors that the administration will continue to use every single available resource at our disposal in the response efforts." The release continues: "The president described the range of federal actions that are underway to respond to the spill and stressed the importance of maintaining close coordination with the governors as this event continues to evolve. All of the governors appreciated the call and the actions being taken by the federal government." An earlier release, from July 6, 2009, says Perry was among five governors to participate in a conference call with Vice President Joe Biden. Of late, Lehrich said in an e-mail, Perry has been invited to be on a call with senior administration officials involved in the response to the oil spill every day since May 4. Perry "has participated on a number of those calls and has been represented by his staff on many more," Lehrich said. We shared this information with Perry’s office and got no response. Next, we checked Perry’s state schedule covering April 1 to mid-July. There were no entries indicating White House calls April 29 or May 4. But Perry’s schedule for June 29 has an 8:15 a.m. entry stating "Phone Call: White House Intergovernmental Affairs/BP Oil Spill." Does the Democratic president routinely seek the Texas Republican’s counsel? We doubt it. But both the White House’s information and Perry’s own schedule contradict his claim he’s never had a call from this White House. Presuming his state schedule reflects what actually happened, Perry got such a call two weeks before the Fox interview aired. Pants on Fire!

pomt-01188	Says a man in Ferguson, Mo., was photographed holding a sign that said, "No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/04/chain-email/viral-photo-ferguson-protester-doesnt-withstand-cl/	In the wake of several high-profile confrontations between white police officers and unarmed African-Americans recently, social media has become a major source of accusations, arguments -- and hoaxes. Recently, a reader sent us a photo that has been circulating on social media, showing an African-American protester standing in front of a fire station and holding up a hand-lettered sign that reads, "No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store." The sign is an obvious reference to the death of Michael Brown, the black teenager who was shot and killed in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014. Brown’s death became a focus for both peaceful protests and rioting in Ferguson, and it attracted attention around the nation and the world. On Nov. 25, a grand jury decided not to indict, setting off a new wave of demonstrations. The phrase "every time he robs a store" refers to surveillance footage showing Brown earlier that day robbing a store of cigarillos and assaulting a store employee. Supporters of Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Brown, have said the robbery is an important piece of context in explaining Wilson’s shooting of Brown. Still, the PolitiFact reader asked us whether the photo was real or manufactured, so we decided to take a look. The version we received is cropped to focus on the African-American man holding the sign, with a partial view of a woman standing to his left. Other versions, such as one analyzed by Snopes.com, include a fuller view of the woman, holding a sign that says, "Shame on Ferguson Police," as well as another man, an African-American, holding a sign that says, "We the People." The starkly divergent messages of the three signs provide a clue that something is amiss. And indeed, something is amiss. In the original photograph -- published on the Riverfront Times’ news blog on Oct. 1 -- the sign read, "No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he leaves home" (emphasis added). It also includes the hashtags #blacklivesmatter and #stayhuman. But words on the sign were doctored by a user of the social media site Imgur. Initially, the user posted this statement with the retouched photograph: "The black community has every reason to be angry with the police, and the brutality they inflict. But making a martyr out of the kid that robbed a store and attacked a police officer is just mind boggling. Micheal (sic) Brown is one of the worst things to happen to race relations in a long time." At some point after the doctored version of the image began circulating, the user acknowledged that he had changed the picture: "Edit: Yes, I shopped this. It captured mine, and many others, frustration with this whole situation." Our ruling A photograph that went viral purports to show a protester in Ferguson, holding a sign that said, "No mother should have to fear for her son's life every time he robs a store." However, the photo was manipulated by a social media user, who later acknowledged the alteration. The change in wording turns the sign’s message completely on its head, so we rate the claim Pants On Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2014-12-04T17:01:38	2014-12-02	['Missouri']

pomt-10500	McCain's "plan for the economy is to extend George Bush's tax cuts for billionaires and give a $100-billion additional corporate tax cut."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/02/hillary-clinton/thats-not-the-whole-plan/	Speaking to union workers in Philadelphia, Sen. Hillary Clinton began "a blistering attack on the presumptive Republican nominee" concerning economic issues, according to the New York Times. "His plan for the economy is to extend George Bush's tax cuts for billionaires and give a $100-billion additional corporate tax cut," Clinton said. Blistering or not, Clinton's attack fairly recites some of McCain's economic proposals. It's worth noting, however that extending existing tax cuts and lowering the corporate income tax rate is not the entirety of McCain's plan for the economy. Among other things, McCain also proposes eliminating the alternative minimum tax, which was designed to make sure wealthy people paid a share of taxes but has become a problem in recent years for upper middle class families, too. Still, McCain's support for extending President Bush's tax cuts is well known. We checked it out not one , two , three , four , but five times because former candidate Mitt Romney and various political groups have harped on the fact that McCain originally opposed the Bush tax cuts before supporting them. McCain's camp could argue with the word "billionaires" because the Congressional Budget Office found the Bush tax cuts most benefited the top 1 percent of earners who had an average salary of $1.25-million. It goes without saying that billionaires are in the top 1 percent, too, but clearly most people in that tax bracket wouldn't fit that definition. But it's also clear they aren't hurting, financially, either. Clinton doesn't embellish at all when it comes to describing McCain's additional $100-billion corporate tax cut. She clearly is referring to his proposal to slice the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, as McCain has outlined on his campaign Web site. McCain's chief economic aide, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, told the Wall Street Journal it would cost $100-billion a year. McCain's campaign estimates the entirety of its tax cuts would total $400-billion a year. Clinton didn't mention that part, which causes us concern. Her statement suggests that McCain has only two ideas for helping the economy, and that's not true. Yes, she accurately describes those two elements of McCain's economic proposal, but she's wrong to suggest that's all McCain has in mind. For that, we give her a Half True.

pomt-14984	"I am very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service I have had no scandals."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/oct/14/lincoln-chafee/chafee-says-no-scandals-his-watch-s-true-ri-standa/	It was the grandest of stages for a former Warwick mayor turned U.S. senator, turned Rhode Island governor, turned presidential candidate. Rhode Island’s Lincoln Chafee was in a nationally televised debate Tuesday night with a chance to shine against just four rivals. Chafee set out to distinguish himself in his opening statement, making a number of claims we’ve heard before as well as this boast: "I’m very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals," Chafee said. No scandals? Nothing in almost three decades? A bold claim, especially for a Rhode Island politician. It’s true Chafee has never been charged, indicted, convicted or imprisoned. During those 30 years, one governor, the mayor of Providence and a gaggle of others have gone to prison. But scandal isn’t strictly a legal term. According to the dictionary, a scandal is a public disgrace. We kept that in mind as we reviewed Chafee’s 30 years of public service. One story jumped out at us. A controversy about the purchase of frogs — yes frogs for the mayor’s aquarium — as well as toboggans, theater tickets, flowers and other items totalling thousands of dollars a year. Chafee’s office bought the four frogs, which cost $1.99 each in 1997, and the rest of the stuff with taxpayers’ money from a discretionary account for the Warwick mayor’s office. The story blew up in 2000 as Chafee ran to keep his U.S. Senate seat. Chafee said other mayors had used the same account. But, he said, he was the first mayor to keep records on expenses. Unimpressed, Chafee’s critics charged he had inappropriately spent taxpayer money. One, mayoral candidate, Michael Woods, the 43-year-old brother of actor James Woods, called for a state police investigation. The Journal’s archives include two chapters in Chafee’s life that are more personal. For some politicians, college escapades involving cocaine or other narcotics, are fodder for scandal, especially when it’s something that’s concealed initially. Chafee’s experience with cocaine was still under wraps in the late ’90s and when the much anticipated questions finally came, he took pride in his transparent response. He immediately admitted his use of cocaine. And moved on with his career. As governor, there was another controversy surrounding the state’s handling of an underage drinking party thrown by Chafee’s 18-year-old son Caleb Chafee on the family’s Exeter property in 2012. The younger Chafee pleaded no contest to a criminal charge of violating the social host law; the state police never released the records on their investigation of the governor’s son. Some suggested that this raised questions about the possibility that there was something to hide. As governor, Chafee made an appointment in the final days of his administration that critics saw as a violation of the state’s revolving-door law. Chafee nominated a top aide and political ally, Richard Licht, for a state judgeship. The state ethics commission allowed the nomination, but critics argued the law should have been applied to Licht, the state’s director of administration. Finally, in the first six months of the Raimondo administration, revelations about the management of the Department of Transportation and the Department of Children, Youth and Families have raised questions about conduct in those departments under Chafee. Our ruling In his opening remarks Tuesday night Chafee said: "I’m very proud that over my almost 30 years of public service, I have had no scandals." We’re not entirely sure what Chafee considers a scandal. We reached out to Chafee’s spokeswoman to get the candidate’s definition, but she said she would need more time to respond. The dictionary again says a scandal is a public disgrace. Over the past 30 years, Chafee has had his share of controversy, and an occasional brush with scandal. But scandal, a full blown public disgrace? Probably not. After all, in the broader scheme of things, is it disgraceful to buy four frogs for $7.96 to amuse visitors to the mayor’s office?

pomt-04530	Says Ronald Reagan "was behind in the polls in 1980 going into the debate with Jimmy Carter and then turned around 10 days later and won 40 states."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/01/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-ronald-reagan-won-40-states-/	Mitt Romney may have hit a rough patch on the campaign trail, but Gov. Chris Christie recently suggested a winning debate performance this week could propel the Republican presidential candidate to victory in November. Just like the 1980 debate took Ronald Reagan from trailing in the polls to winning 40 states on Election Day, the governor said. The New Jersey governor offered that history lesson last week as Romney and President Barack Obama gear up for their first debate Wednesday. Obama has been leading Romney in most national polls. "Ask Ronald Reagan if he were around, you know, who was behind in the polls in 1980 going into the debate with Jimmy Carter and then turned around 10 days later and won 40 states," Christie, a Republican, said at a Sept. 24 news conference. "These debates matter. They’re very important." It’s true that Reagan won 44 states in the 1980 election, but it’s not entirely accurate for Christie to say Reagan "was behind in the polls" going into the debate with Carter. Leading up to that Oct. 28, 1980 debate -- a week before Election Day -- some polls showed Carter with a slight advantage over Reagan, but other polls had Reagan ahead of the president. Still, given the margins of error attached to the polls, the race appeared too close to call, according to various news articles. The governor’s office did not respond to two e-mails seeking comment. Let’s review some of those poll results. In a Gallup poll released the day before the debate, Carter was leading Reagan by three percentage points, 45 percent to 42 percent. That poll was based on a sample of 1,100 registered voters, including 800 likely voters. Another poll done for ABC News and released around the same time offered the exact opposite results: Reagan stood at 45 percent and Carter at 42 percent among likely voters. But news articles said that because of the margins of error for those two polls, the "race is essentially even" and a "virtual dead heat." An Associated Press-NBC News poll around the same time showed Reagan with a greater lead over Carter. Among likely voters, 42 percent supported Reagan and 36 percent backed Carter. That poll still had a margin of error of three percent. "Generally, comparable results from all these polls fall within the error margins of such surveys, meaning the race is really too close to call," the Associated Press wrote. The week before the debate, a CBS News/New York Times poll showed Carter leading Reagan, 43 percent to 41 percent among undecided voters. But given that poll’s sampling error, "Mr. Carter’s lead thus was highly uncertain, and it is quite possible that Mr. Reagan may actually be somewhat ahead," according to a New York Times article. Still, Reagan’s debate performance has been considered a deciding factor in his ultimate victory. "It is my contention that there was significant change in presidential preference by the public starting with the Carter/Reagan debate that accelerated through election day," Warren J. Mitofsky, a pollster for CBS News, later wrote. However, leading up to Election Day, polls failed to capture the scope of Reagan's landslide win. As Mitofsky noted, all of the major published polls "seriously understated" Reagan’s margin of victory over Carter. In terms of the popular vote, Reagan received about 51.6 percent, beating Carter’s roughly 41.7 percent. The 1980 presidential race also included Independent candidate John B. Anderson, who received about 6.7 percent of the popular vote. Our ruling At a news conference, Christie claimed Ronald Reagan "was behind in the polls in 1980 going into the debate with Jimmy Carter and then turned around 10 days later and won 40 states." Reagan went on to win 44 states, but it was not necessarily the comeback victory described by Christie. Reagan was behind in some polls and ahead of Carter in others. Given the margins of error for the polls, the race was "too close to call" and a "virtual dead heat," articles show.

pomt-14096	Says 80 percent of North Carolinians support "the concept that men should not be in women’s restrooms, changing rooms, bathrooms, etc."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/may/14/tim-moore/nc-house-speaker-says-80-percent-think-bathrooms-s/	As the battle over who should be able to use what bathroom rages on in North Carolina and nationwide, opponents of transgender-friendly rules say public opinion is on their side. Tim Moore, the speaker of the N.C. House of Representatives, said it’s an overwhelming consensus. "The one thing where we’ve seen nearly unanimous – well, nothing’s unanimous – but 80 percent support out there is the concept that men should not be in women’s restrooms, changing rooms, bathrooms, et cetera – that that shouldn’t happen," Moore said in a May 5 discussion with reporters. We looked into polling on bathroom policy and found a wide range of results. Most don’t reach 80 percent, but clearly substantial numbers of people in North Carolina have told pollsters they oppose letting transgender people choose what bathroom to use. Polls have found safety concerns are also on some people’s minds. No one can say that there will never be any privacy or safety issues – of course there could be. But in a previous fact check, we looked for instances of sexual predators using the cover of transgender-friendly bathroom laws to dress up as the other sex and prey on people in bathrooms, the scenario many have said they’re concerned about. We found it Mostly True that such a scenario has never happened. We didn’t give it a True because there have been a few unproven allegations in the U.S. and one conviction in Canada. The Obama administration also hasn’t put stock in those concerns, and has said banning transgender people from the bathroom of the gender with which they identify is a civil rights violation. It was in that context, along with the administration’s threat to withhold federal funding from North Carolina, that Moore made his "nearly unanimous," "80 percent" claim. Uncertainty abounds We did find one poll from the conservative Raleigh-based Civitas Institute that was close to backing up Moore’s claim. We’re not sure if it’s the poll he was citing or if he was citing a poll at all – Moore didn’t respond to our questions – but we’ll proceed anyway. The poll asked: "Do you agree or disagree with a Virginia federal court ruling ordering girls and boys in public middle schools to share locker room, bathroom and shower facilities? The poll did find that 80 percent of people said they disagreed with the court ruling. However, we have several issues with the question. The question is not only leading and inflammatory but also fundamentally misconstrues what the court ruled. No boys and girls were ordered to shower, change or use the bathroom together. Instead, a federal appeals court ruled that a judge in Virginia had to reconsider a transgender boy’s request to use the boys’ facilities at school. The court also said the Obama administration acted legally in defining sex-based discrimination to include discrimination against transgender people. That’s the part that may have given rise to the poll question’s wording, since the student is likely to win now. Yet the Obama administration has repeatedly said that although schools should recognize transgender students’ rights, schools should also recognize other students’ right to privacy and that no student should be forced to openly share a changing area. In school districts around the country that have already recognized transgender students’ gender identities, officials have typically put private stalls in locker rooms and/or offered unisex one-person bathrooms. Given the issues with that question, let’s look at another. Another earlier poll from Civitas asked people a more accurate and nuanced question about transgender people in bathrooms, describing the arguments on both sides. This poll came before the state overturned Charlotte’s LGBT ordinance. "The Charlotte City Council passed a new bathroom ordinance for transgender people that allows biological men and biological women, who identify as the opposite sex, to use the bathroom or locker room of their choosing," the question stated, asking people to pick sides. Nearly 70 percent said they opposed the idea. Not 80 percent, but close. But what about polls from groups with less political bias? According to a joint poll from SurveyUSA in partnership with Time Warner Cable News, 51 percent of North Carolinians think transgender people should not be able to choose which bathroom to use. That’s not "nearly unanimous" like Moore said; it’s barely a majority. Another joint poll from SurveyUSA and a different TV station, WRAL, found 56 percent in agreement that transgender people shouldn’t be able to choose which bathroom to use – again, a majority, but not close to 80 percent. Our ruling A prominent conservative group, Civitas, did find 70 and 80 percent in two polls, although we had some serious doubts about the question that found the 80 percent support. Two polls from the less partisan SurveyUSA in partnership with local TV stations have found 56 percent and 51 percent of North Carolinians support the idea. That’s still a majority, but it’s certainly not the "nearly unanimous," "80 percent support" that Moore claimed.

pomt-08593	"Under Gov. Kitzhaber, unemployment rose 65 percent, state spending went up 57 percent and personal incomes declined compared to the rest of the country."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/sep/24/chris-dudley/chris-dudley-says-oregons-economy-tanked-john-kitz/	Chris Dudley, the Republican running for governor, wants to make sure Oregonians remember how bad things were back in the day -- that is, when his Democratic opponent, John Kitzhaber, was running the state. At every opportunity, Dudley notes the damage done in the early 2000s by a faltering economy and the end of high-tech’s rapid expansion in Oregon. That was when then-Gov. Kitzhaber was nearing the end of a second term marked by steep job losses and bitter fights with Republicans over state budget cuts. "Under Gov. Kitzhaber," Dudley said in a recent speech in Albany, "unemployment rose 65 percent, state spending went up 57 percent and personal incomes declined compared to the rest of the country." We wondered about two things: Was it really that bad? And how much can you blame Kitzhaber for what happened? So let’s take a look, first at the unemployment number. In 1995, when Kitzhaber took office, Oregon’s economy was streaking at a record pace and unemployment was as low as it had ever been, 4.7 percent. The rate hovered around 5 percent for most of his career as governor because the economy remained healthy. But joblessness began to spike upward in his final two years as the national and state economies went into a deep recession. National unemployment figures followed a similar trend, although remained about a percentage point below Oregon’s. When Kitzhaber left office, Oregon’s unemployment rate stood at 7.8 percent. So Dudley’s correct: at the end of Kitzhaber’s tenure, the unemployment rate was up 65 percent. What about that state spending figure? That’s a little trickier. The hot economy in the 1990s produced record-setting tax revenues for the state. Total state spending, which includes federal pass-through money, such as Medicaid and food stamp payments, indeed increased by 56 percent over Kitzhaber’s eight years, rising from $22.6 billion to $35.3 billion. General fund spending, however, rose by a more staid 26 percent -- from $8.2 billion to $10.3 billion -- and that’s widely considered the more accurate measure of state spending fluctuations. (Oregon's population grew 11 percent between 1995 and 2003. Inflation between those two years was 28 percent.) Worth noting: Republicans controlled the Legislature throughout Kitzhaber’s tenure, and approved all general fund spending increases. Last, we checked on personal income. The dot-com boom benefited not just Oregon but the rest of the nation, too. Even though Oregonians were making more money, they weren’t keeping up, and per-capita income rates fell slightly in relation to other states. In 1995, Oregon’s per capita income stood at 97 percent of the nation’s, when Kitzhaber left office it had dropped to 95 percent. So Dudley’s math mostly holds up. But is it accurate to attribute those numbers to Kitzhaber’s leadership? We checked with state economist Tom Potiowsky, who monitors the ups and downs of Oregon’s financial health. He said Oregon’s economy, which is based heavily in manufacturing, is at the mercy of national and global economic factors. When home building goes down, Oregon’s lumber products aren’t needed. When computer sales are down, Oregon’s chips go unsold, he said. "Those were very much national economic factors, really pushing us around," during Kitzhaber’s final years, Potiowsky said. University of Oregon economist Tim Duy had a similar take. What happened at the end of Kitzhaber’s administration was caused by the national business cycle and was largely out of his control. Yet Oregon didn’t help itself much, notes Duy and John Tapogna, president of ECONorthwest, a Portland economic consulting firm. When high-tech firms were expanding, the state -- and Kitzhaber’s office -- wasn’t exactly helping them navigate the state’s strict land use rules. So is Dudley right to hang Oregon’s economic decline around Kitzhaber’s neck? -- His statement is factually accurate on unemployment, spending growth and the decline in per capita income relative to the rest of the nation during Kitzhaber’s term. -- Oregon, however, was knocked for a loop by the same dot-com bust that sent the nation’s economy into a tailspin. Realistically, there’s not much a governor can do about those kind of macroeconomic factors. -- Oregon enjoyed a robust economy for six of the eight years Kitzhaber was governor. But when things started to go south, Kitzhaber was at the helm. We find the claim to be Half True. Comment on this item.	None	Chris Dudley	None	None	None	2010-09-24T11:41:02	2010-09-15	['None']
pomt-13735	California has "the sixth largest economy on planet Earth."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/jul/26/kevin-de-leon/does-california-really-have-sixth-largest-economy-/	State Senate leader Kevin de León spotlighted California’s economic and social achievements during his speech this week at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The Democrat from Los Angeles touted the state’s newly established $15 per hour minimum wage, efforts to keep college affordable and California’s hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs. "We’ve made unprecedented progress in every area," De León told a cheering crowd. "And when we elect Hillary Clinton as our next president, I know that our progress will be America’s progress." The state senator then repeated a talking point California leaders love to make on national and international stages, about the size of the state’s economy: "These are the progressive policies that have made California the sixth largest economy on planet Earth," De León said. We won’t wade into the debate over whether progressive or other policies have positioned the state’s economy on such a high perch. But we will examine the provocative "sixth largest economy on planet Earth" claim by itself. State Senate leader Kevin de León makes the "sixth largest economy" claim at the 1:45 minute mark in this video. Our research State leaders have made this hypothetical comparison for years, examining California’s gross domestic product against nations across the globe. With nearly 40 million people, the state has a larger population than many countries. It also boasts a diverse set of industries from technology to tourism and entertainment. In June, Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration released figures showing California, with a GDP of more than $2.4 trillion in 2015 had jumped two spots in these unique world rankings ahead of France and Brazil and into sixth place behind the United Kingdom. First on the list is the United States, followed by China, Japan and Germany. California’s place on the list has fluctuated over time. It had been 10th as recently as 2012 due to the effects of the financial and housing slumps. The rankings use International Monetary Fund data. California is the only state on the list of nations. Experts have said California’s rise in the rankings reflects its strong economic growth compared with the rest of the world. They have cited Silicon Valley’s continued tech boom as a critical factor. "It speaks to California doing relatively well in a sluggish global economy," Jeff Michael, director of the University of the Pacific’s Center for Business and Policy Research, told the Sacramento Bee in June. A more complex picture De León’s statement, made in a short 4-minute speech, did not include much context. When adjusting for the state’s high cost of living, California’s GDP ranking drops to 11th in the world, according to the California Legislative Analyst’s Office. A tweet on June 14, 2016 from the California's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office. Carson Bruno, who studies California policy at the conservative Hoover Institution, says there’s a lot missing from the "sixth largest economy claim." In California, "housing costs more; electricity and gas cost more; and even most goods and services cost more than the national average," he wrote in a post on RealClearMarkets.com. "In many respects California's cost of living is much more like a Western European nation than it is like the rest of the U.S. The widely reported global rankings ignore this reality." De León’s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Our rating State Senate leader Kevin de León recently claimed at the Democratic National Convention that California has "the sixth largest economy on planet Earth." This hypothetical comparison rests on California’s $2.4 trillion GDP, which moved slightly above that of France and Brazil in 2015 to sixth in the world. The ranking, and De León’s statement, however, ignore California’s sky high cost of living and Silicon Valley’s role in the state’s economic growth. The state’s GDP drops several places when adjusted for cost of living. De León’s statement, while accurate, could have used this additional information or clarification.

pomt-07762	Gov. Rick Scott's sale of the state planes was "not proper."	true	/florida/statements/2011/feb/24/jd-alexander/gov-rick-scott-and-senate-budget-chief-spat-over-s/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott is at loggerheads with powerful Senate budget chief J.D. Alexander over whether Scott was allowed to sell the two state airplanes. The decision fulfilled a campaign promise, but Alexander believes the sale was "not proper" because it needed approval of the Legislature. Citing statutes and the Florida Constitution, the Lake Wales Republican made his case in a trio of letters to Scott starting on Feb. 17, 2011. The governor, Alexander wrote, failed to respect "the Legislature's constitutional duty to appropriate funds and your duty to spend appropriated funds in accordance with the law." Scott countered in a pair of statements to the press that he did nothing wrong. PolitiFact Florida wanted to step in here and try to referee the disagreement between these two top Republicans. The background: On Feb. 11, Scott announced the sale of the state's two airplanes -- a 2000 King Air 350 and a 2003 Cessna Citation Bravo jet. The King Air fetched $1.77 million, while the jet sold for $1.9 million; $3.67 million all together. Most of the proceeds actually went to pay off the $3.4 million the state still owed on the Cessna. The money went from the buyers directly to the bank the state owed the money. What remained was deposited into the Aircraft Trust Fund -- $84,072.13 was deposited on Feb. 14, and $176,500 was deposited on Feb. 17, according to Alexis Lambert, spokeswoman for Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater. Scott said the money budgeted for the aircraft program would also be returned to the general revenue fund, saving about $556,000 this current budget year, and $2.4 million in future years. Alexander's problem Alexander, for the record, doesn't oppose the sale. Just how it happened. On the merits of this particular case, his debate with Scott is somewhat academic. The planes already have been sold and are gone, and Alexander is willing to retroactively approve the arrangement. But the disagreement could have broader implications that result in shifting previously sacrosanct budget powers away from the Legislature and to the executive branch. The roles of the branches of government generally have been well defined. The Legislature passes the budget every year, and the governor carries out the budget as passed (after having the opportunity to veto parts of the budget, or the entire budget). Alexander's contention is that Scott's sale of the two airplanes violates that balance. He believes that: Scott unilaterally overrode the current 2010-11 state budget law by effectively eliminating the $2.4 million budget line item to operate the two state planes; That Scott does not have the authority to spend state funds on his own to pay off the balance due on the Cessna jet. The money to pay off the lease was generated from the revenues created by selling both planes; And that Scott may have erred by not placing the proceeds of the sales into the treasury. Most of the money went from the buyers to the bank that held the lease on the state jet. What would stop Scott from not spending money on Medicaid, then? Or from selling other state property to finance deeper tax cuts? "The Constitution doesn't allow executive agencies to embargo appropriated funds," Alexander said. "When money is appropriated, there is an obligation to spend it." He recently made a similar claim when discussing Scott's decision to reject federal funding for high-speed rail. Alexander said that the state already had budgeted money for the project and that Scott couldn't just pull out without legislative approval. PolitiFact Florida found Alexander's claim in that case to be accurate, but noted that Scott held most of the cards to kill the rail line anyway. We found the claim, overall, to be Half True. When it comes to the state planes, Scott is prohibited by statute from impounding state money, which is defined by statute as "the omission of any appropriation or part of an appropriation in the approved operating plan." Put another way, Scott cannot simply stop or ignore budget appropriations that are law except when necessary to avoid a deficit. The governor also is prohibited from taking money from the state treasury unless appropriated by law. Buying out the lease may constitute a violation because the payment wasn't authorized by the Legislature. However, the money went straight from the companies that bought the planes to the bank the state owed $3.4 million to, to pay off the Cessna. In that case, there also are specific regulations regarding the selling of state property, and the money received from those sales. According to statutes, money received from the sale of state property must be retained by the custodian and may be disbursed for the acquisition of exchange and surplus property and for all necessary operating expenditures. The custodian shall maintain records of the accounts into which the money is deposited. In this case, the custodian of the plane is the Department of Management Services, which is under the governor's direction. The other side We asked the governor's office to cite statutes supporting Scott's decision to sell the plane without legislative input, and we asked to speak to the general counsel or any person who advised Scott that the sale complied with Florida law. We did not hear back. Interim general counsel Rick Figlio did respond to Alexander on Feb. 24. Figlio said he advised Scott that it was legal to sell the state planes "subject to the condition that the purchaser clear outstanding debt." He then asked Alexander to provide specific statutes restricting the disposal of state property in the way Scott sold the state planes. "If any such restrictions exist, I would appreciate your counsel directing me to them as they will assist this office in advising the Governor regarding the scope of his powers as they relate to future transaction," Figlio wrote to Scott. An outside opinion We asked Bruce R. Jacob, dean emeritus and professor of law at Stetson University, to sort through the back-and-forth. In short, he sides with Alexander. Jacob said it appears that Scott failed to comply with state statutes prohibiting him from withholding appropriated funds. The key, in this case, is that Scott never adequately went through a process to determine that there was a budget deficit, which could have given him cover for selling the planes. Scott would have needed to consult with the state's Revenue Estimating Conference -- a legislative body -- and certified that a deficit will occur in the general revenue fund. "What Alexander is complaining about is that, under this section, where the Legislature has appropriated money for the expense of the planes, the governor is required to spend that money," Jacob said. "I am sure the governor from time to time does not spend money that the Legislature has appropriated for a particular purpose, and I doubt that anyone gets upset about it. "However, the main point, it seems to me, is that if the governor was thinking of doing this, he needed to consult with the leadership of the Legislature," he said. "Common courtesy called for such consultation. The governor and the Legislature have to work together. The governor should not be allowed to 'go it on his own,' so to speak, in a situation such as this." Jacob also says Alexander has a "point" by claiming that the amount owed on the Cessna should have been appropriated by the Legislature and paid from the state treasury. "Money of the state should not be spent unless it is for an authorized purpose and complete records should be kept so that anyone in the state can see what was spent and for what purpose. In this case it seems to me that the governor short-circuited the process," Jacob said. Senate President Mike Haridopolos, R-Merritt Island, said Scott's intention wasn't to be deceptive. "This is his first month on the job. If he made a mistake, he'll fix it," Haridopolos said. "His intent was the correct intent. I don't think he meant any malice by it ... no one thinks the governor tried to pull a fast one." Our ruling The majority of the evidence and a legal expert side with Alexander in this argument about the sale of the state's two airplanes. Alexander said the sales were "not proper," and cited specific state statutes. Most germane is a statute that requires the governor to spend the money allocated for a specific purpose in the state budget. The governor's office offered no rebuttal, and as such, we see no evidence that Alexander's wrong. We rate his claim True.	None	J.D. Alexander	None	None	None	2011-02-24T17:47:10	2011-02-23	['None']
pomt-14280	"We got a million jobs."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-correct-florida-created-1-million-jobs-/	During his confrontation with an unhappy constituent at a Gainesville Starbucks, Florida Gov. Rick Scott heard an earful. But he also dished some out. At one point in the now-viral exchange, Scott responded to the barrage of criticism by customer Cara Jennings with what appears to be an estimate of the jobs created on his watch. "We got a million jobs," Scott said. Jennings wasn’t satisfied -- she ripped Scott by responding, "A million jobs? Great. Who here has a great job or is looking forward to finishing school? Do you really feel like you have a job coming up?" Whoever you think won this face-off, we wondered whether Scott was right that Florida "got a million jobs" on his watch. So we took a closer look. As we always do when faced with this type of question, we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks job data on the federal, state and local level. Since Scott’s brief riposte didn’t specify what type of jobs Scott was talking about, we will assume he was referring to total non-farm employment -- the bureau’s most basic measurement -- rather than private-sector employment, which is a different, narrower category that Scott often refers to. Scott began his tenure in January 2011, so for the full comparison, we can contrast the most recent employment level in the state to the level in either December 2010 or January 2011. As it turns out, both produce the 1 million in gains that Scott referred to. Between December 2010 and February 2016, total nonfarm employment in Florida rose by 1,041,400. And between January 2011 and February 2016, it rose by 1,028,100. (These are net jobs gained, which is the standard measurement economists use.) So Scott’s boast that Florida "got a million jobs" is well supported. That said, we’ll note one caveat that we always raise when analyzing claims such as Scott’s: It’s a stretch for the governor (or the president, or a mayor) to claim credit for such gains. Governors do have an impact on their state’s economy. They can push an agenda of taxing and spending that may help the economy, though the actual impact of such policies on economic growth is always somewhat speculative, since you can’t run an independent experiment with an economy governed by the opposite policies. But even if governors do deserve some credit for how the economy performs on their watch, there are other things over which they have no control that can have impacts that are at least as big, if not bigger. These include changes in technology, fluctuations in the national and international economy, demographic shifts (the Census Bureau estimates the state’s population has increased by about 1.46 million people since April 2010, for instance), and events like natural disasters. Indeed, governors -- like presidents -- tend to get too much credit when things are going well, and too much blame when things are going poorly. "Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office," Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless has told PolitiFact previously. "Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered." This critique is especially relevant in Scott’s case. Scott took office not long after a severe recession bottomed out. It was no shock that whoever was elected governor in 2010 would benefit from some degree of job growth, since the worst of the recession would be behind them, and the economy tends to run in cycles. As we have previously noted, Scott said the "7-7-7 Plan" he ran on in 2010 would create 700,000 jobs on top of the 1 million jobs state economists predicted Florida would add by 2017 no matter what policies came out of Tallahassee. He later denied saying that, but in tracking Scott’s campaign promises, PolitiFact Florida continues to hold him to his pledge to create 1.7 million jobs. (That promise is currently rated In the Works.) In other words, Scott should be pleased that 1-million-plus jobs were created on his watch, but he ought to be humble about how much of a role he played in making it happen. Our ruling Scott said "we got a million jobs," referring to employment in the state of Florida on his watch. On the numbers, Scott is on target -- the figure is actually a bit higher than 1 million net, new, nonfarm jobs. We’ll just note, as we always do in cases like this, that the governor is not solely responsible for this improvement -- other factors played a role too. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2016-04-06T16:00:48	2016-04-05	['None']
pomt-07919	Regulations on developers have thwarted construction on county-owned land in Milwaukee’s downtown Park East corridor.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/31/jeff-stone/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-jeff-stone-sa/	Seven years after the former Park East freeway spur came down on the north edge of Milwaukee’s downtown, a move aimed at spurring development, some buildings have risen nearby -- but not on Milwaukee’s County’s prime portion of the land. Why? At a Jan. 21, 2011 forum sponsored by the Milwaukee Press Club and Marquette University Law School, the five candidates in the special election for Milwaukee County executive were asked to assign blame for the eyesore. They pointed to the bad economy, the financial crisis, excessive bureaucracy and mismanagement by former county executive and current Gov. Scott Walker – or a combination of those factors. All, that is, but state Rep. Jeff Stone, R-Greendale. Stone, by his own account, helped make the freeway demolition possible as a state lawmaker. He squarely -- and solely -- blamed county rules that favor developers who pay union-scale wages and hire local residents. He was referring to the so-called "community benefits" policy approved in 2005 as part of the Park East Redevelopment Compact. It was backed by labor, religious and environmental groups over the objection of Walker, who said it would hinder development. Said Stone: "What we’ve seen in the county is that we pile on requirements above and beyond what the market requires or will allow, and so the property sits there, unused, underutilized, wasting an opportunity for our taxpayers, for people that want to get jobs..." Is he right? The requirements are to blame? Asked to support his claim, Stone said the requirements generate extra costs during construction and for ongoing management, and force higher rents that can turn off prospective tenants. In a statement, Stone offered this solution: "The county should consider removing the restrictions placed on county-owned land, and either (sell) the land to the City of Milwaukee or come up with some creative partnership with the city to minimize the obstacles to development." The evidence Stone provided essentially was his opinion. It did not include any example to show the benefits were the sole -- or even primary -- cause of the lack of development on county land, while adjacent city-owned land has been developed. We turned to county and city development officials, developers and elected officials for their perspective on the contrast between the city- and county-owned land. Rocky Marcoux, the city’s development chief, said the wage and hiring rules play no role in discouraging development in the Park East. In 2009, the city approved rules similar to those the county put in place in 2005 -- and has still managed to attract major housing and hotel developments on its share of the Park East corridor. Marcoux blamed the county’s failure on its inexperience on real-estate deals and a failure to coordinate efforts with the city. One example he cites: The county put large parcels up for sale -- entire blocks -- discouraging interest by small developers. A prominent official with one of the state’s largest commercial real estate brokerage firms had a different take. Jim Barry III, president of Cassidy Turley Barry, said he does not think there is one particular reason for the lack of progress, which he calls "shameful." But he thinks the two biggest factors are the wage-and-hiring standards -- they stigmatized the land, in his view -- and an "elephantine" approval process requiring developers to get both city and county OK for projects on the county-owned land. He said the city’s rejection of a special financing district for one proposed development on county land killed the project. The developer of the proposed Palomar Hotel and condos wanted $18 million in city financing assistance for the $158 million project — a request city officials rejected. Dallas-based Gatehouse Capital Corp. said it needed more city cash because of tight credit markets and weak demand for downtown condos. The developers did not cite the wage-and-hiring rules as a concern. One of the main movers behind the wage and hiring standards, Kathleen Mulligan-Hansel, a co-founder of the Good Jobs & Livable Neighborhoods coalition, says there have been unrealistic expectations on how quickly the Park East would redevelop. She said the nationwide housing crash caused retrenchment in downtown development across the county. Marcoux made a similar point. Milwaukee is one of dozens of cities to adopt the approach. Mulligan-Hansel, has heard the criticism that community benefits might have been just enough to squelch development in a city as small as Milwaukee. But she pointed out Pittsburgh adopted the approach as well and has been successful. The idea, said Mulligan-Hansel, is that when public lands are developed, a chunk of the developer’s profits should be redistributed to the public in the form of wages and jobs, thus helping to relieve poverty. Supervisor Theodore Lipscomb, chairman of the county’s Economic Development Committee, said developers who have made offers to purchase county land have blamed financing problems and lack of demand for the failure to complete deals -- not the wage and hiring rules. Many big developers already pay prevailing wage scale, and don’t see the rule as a problem, Lipscomb said. Despite his declarative statement at the candidate forum, Stone seems to agree in part with a couple of the factors cited by the experts and insiders we contacted. He told PolitiFact Wisconsin the financial markets have "not been conducive to new development" and city-county approval processes were a "daunting hurdle." But he noted the financing crunch was not until late 2009, five years after demolition of the Park East freeway spur. Let’s top this item off. At a candidate forum, Stone cited community benefits rules as the reason why gulls -- not graders -- populate the county-owned Park East land. But, as city development officials note, similar requirements are in place for city-owned parcels, where progress has been made. What’s more, even one of the toughest critics of the rules did not contend they are the sole problem, and Stone himself later reframed his position to recognize those factors. We rate Stone’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-10844	"In every single country, she had a majority of the vote -- or more of those who'd already made up their minds."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-is-famous-in-europe/	Former President Bill Clinton seized on a poll by a Canadian firm, Angus Reid Strategies, showing that more than 40 percent of people in France and Germany, and more than 30 percent in Canada, Britain and Italy support Sen. Hillary Clinton's candidacy for president. He said it "shows you what people around the world think of her." The former president has his numbers right, but he's overreaching by saying this indicates strong international support. "I think what that's telling us is that the poll is measuring, in some ways, name identification," said Karlyn Bowman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who analyzes public opinion. "Hillary is known by virtually everyone in the U.S. and pretty well known abroad." Carl Sferrazza Anthony, the author of several books on first ladies and the consulting historian for the National First Ladies Library in Canton, Ohio, declared Clinton "the most traveled First Lady in history." While many of her trips were virtually ignored by the U.S. media, the international press covered them heavily, and she earned kudos abroad for her support of micro loans, women's rights, healthcare, democracy and other issues, Anthony said. Still, roughly four in 10 of those polled by Angus Reid were undecided about who they'd prefer to inhabit the White House, said Mario Canseco of Angus Reid. "At this early stage of the campaign, the media in Europe is not yet paying attention to the U.S. presidential race," he said.

pomt-03581	"The Affordable Care Act is bringing the cost of health care in our country down."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/16/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-obamacare-bringing-down-health-c/	House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says Democrats care about frugality — and the president’s health care law is one example. It’s bringing down the cost of health care, she told MSNBC host Chris Hayes. While key elements of the Affordable Care Act don’t go into effect until 2014, we wondered if the law has already brought down the cost of care. It depends partly on what you mean by "down." Growth rate Hayes and Pelosi chatted May 13, 2013, about Republicans’ focus on reducing the deficit. "It strikes me that they have been remarkably successful in doing that," Hayes said. "When you look at the debt ceiling debacle that led to the Budget Control Act, which has now led to the sequester, that actually …" Pelosi interrupted. "Oh, please, thank you for this question. This is so far off the course. "First of all, the actions taken by President Obama and the House Democratic Congress, House and Senate, when he became president was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. "Many of the initiatives that he passed are what are coming to bear now, including the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act is bringing the cost of health care in our country down in both the public and private sector. "And that is what is largely responsible for the deficit coming down." We asked Pelosi’s office for evidence that the Affordable Care Act "is bringing the cost of health care in our country down." She meant that the law has reduced the speed of growth in health care costs — not that they’re actually lower than before, a spokesperson said. "Down does not mean below zero," said spokesperson Drew Hammill. "It means below recent projections and compared to historical trends." U.S. health care spending has grown at historically low levels, just 3.9 percent a year in 2011 and 2010. But it was also at 3.9 percent in 2009, before the law passed. "Health care costs have not been going down. They have been rising more slowly," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who’s a vocal critic of the law. What’s behind the change? There's controversy among health care economists over just why that slowdown's happening, whether it'll continue, and what role the law may play. The recent slowdown actually began in 2003, noted Jessica Stone, a policy analyst for budget-hawk group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, and continued to fall as the economy weakened. But four recent studies agree that there’s more at work than just the economy. Does the Affordable Care Act play a role? It might. "They all agree that the unexplained part is large, making the ACA one likely explanation," said David Cutler, a Harvard economist who advised Obama during the 2008 campaign. His study, published in the May issue of Health Affairs, says the 2007-09 recession accounted for 37 percent of the slowdown. Eight percent he attributes to a decline in private insurance coverage and cuts to some Medicare payments. That leaves 55 percent of the slowdown "unexplained." He points to a few ways the Affordable Care Act is involved, including a reduction in Medicare Advantage payments and greater efficiency from health care providers — such as a reduction in hospital-acquired infections and readmissions, which he says are directly related to payment incentives in the health care law. "So, the ACA is a big deal in this — not the only factor, to be sure, but one important factor," he said. A second analysis, by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Altarum Institute, found a much larger role for broader changes in the economy: 77 percent. Structural changes in the health care system "may be playing a modest role." And, it noted, changes yet to come under the Affordable Care Act could also affect such trends "significantly." Savings in Medicare and creation of health insurance exchanges could curb growth. Meanwhile, spending might bump upward as people who were previously uninsured get covered next year. (Indeed, the Medicare actuary assumed back in 2009 that increasing the number of folks who are insured would for a time outweigh the law’s downward impact on growth rates.) But that will likely happen around the same time as the economy strengthens, which may raise health care spending on its own. So once again, it’ll take closer study to tease out the role of changes under the law. "We will only know a couple of years after robust economic growth is occurring and the current round of innovation has had some time to play itself out," said Gail Wilensky, a health care analyst who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush. "Everything until then is reading tea leaves — frequently through a biased filter." Our ruling Pelosi said "the Affordable Care Act is bringing the cost of health care in our country down." But it’s the rate of growth that’s dropped, not the actual cost of care — which is still rising. Meanwhile, recent studies agree that something more than just the recent recession has driven that lower growth rate. Some experts argue that includes provisions of the health care law, such as lower Medicare Advantage payments and incentives for greater efficiency from hospitals. Others say it's simply too soon to say. Spending may increase as more people become insured, but for now, there's divided support for Pelosi's statement. We rate it Half True.

pomt-03738	Says the 2010-11 New Hampshire budget ended with an $18 million surplus, while the Republican-led 2012-13 budget has a $40 million deficit.	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/apr/11/new-hampshire-democratic-party/nh-democrats-say-they-left-state-budget-surplus-an/	Just like baseball, New Hampshire's budget season is just getting under way. But even before legislators got their first swing at this year’s spending proposal, political leaders were already checking the score. N.H. Democratic Party leaders took aim at the current 2012-13 budget on Twitter last month. They contrasted the Republican-led spending plan, crafted two years ago by Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley and former House Speaker William O’Brien, with the 2010-11 budget, passed by Democratic Gov. John Lynch and Senate President Maggie Hassan, the current governor. "NH FACT: Lynch/Hassan 2010/11 budget ended in $18m surplus," Democratic chairman Ray Buckley tweeted Friday, March 29th. "OBrien/Bradley 2012/13 budget has $40m deficit." With nearly three months left in the 2013 Fiscal Year, the budget projections are constantly on the move. But, the 2010-11 figures have been set for a while. So, we decided to go back and check the record books. To start, we approached Democratic Party officers, who pointed to a PolitiFact check we conducted back in August looking into the 2010-11 budget. At the time, we checked a claim by the New Boston Republican Committee, that suggested Democrats had built up a deficit of $1 billion in Fiscal Year 2010-11. As we noted then, the $1 billion figure came from a report released in January 2011 by the Legislative Budget Assistant, a nonpartisan office that reviews the state spending plans. The report, intended as a point-in-time projection rather than a final budget tally, identified $845 million in spending that could have posed concerns for the new legislature if all fiscal policies remained the same. "I was talking about appropriations that would go up by virtue of formula driven things," Jeff Pattison, the budget assistant, said at the time. "Things that would happen if nothing was done about them." But, state legislators, required by law to balance the budget, made the necessary adjustments, and by the end of the year, they had built a $17.7 million surplus, according to the state’s annual report. Some political leaders argued at the time the numbers were skewed because lawmakers relied heavily on borrowing (more than $130 million, according to some reports) and on one-time federal funds ($80 million-plus) to balance the budget, leaving a "structural deficit" heading into the next budget cycle. That year, Lynch, Hassan and other Democratic leaders removed the State Liquor Commission off state spending books by putting its $90 million budget in an independent enterprise account, and they saved another $90 million by issuing state-backed bonds rather than paying cash to cover school construction costs. Still, others maintained the surplus came through a range of budget cuts and tax hikes common to the budget cycle. They cut more than $233 million, laying off nearly 200 state workers, closing some programs and making the university system return $25 million in state aid, among other actions. Either way, the $17.7 million surplus officially left from the 2010-11 budget roughly matches the Democratic Party’s $18 million claim. So, Buckley is on target on the first part of his claim. Now, on to the 2012-13 budget. To support their $40 million deficit claim, Democratic Party officers directed us toward a Fiscal Year 2013 snapshot, released last month by the budget assistant’s office. As Buckley suggested, the worksheet, released March 12, did report a $40.7 million revenue shortfall, most of which comes from shortages in Medicaid Expansion Tax revenues ($36.8 million). But, like the 2011 report, Pattison, the budget assistant, intended this release only as a point-in-time projection to give legislators an idea of what could happen in the months to follow. The projections change frequently, Pattison said. "I’m not saying it changes on a daily basis, but it can change fairly quickly," he warned last week. By the end of March, the projections had changed course. According to a monthly revenue report released Tuesday, April 2, by the Department of Administrative Services, state officials closed March with revenues up $26.6 million over the initial budget projections. If those numbers stand, that would leave the 2012-13 budget facing a $14 million deficit, and further revenues could level the spending by the end of the fiscal year, said Linda Hodgdon, commissioner of the administrative services department, who authored the March report. "We're hopeful that because March was such a good month, April will also be a good month," Hodgdon said. "If we have another good month, it could potentially close the gap. That’s what I’m hoping." Our Ruling Buckley and the Democratic Party are right on with their claim about the 2010-11 budget. That year, lawmakers closed the spending plan with an $18 million surplus. And, though the numbers change constantly, Buckley, the Democratic chairman, is on target regarding the 2012-13 spending plan, as well. Or he was at the time, anyway. Recent reports show the projections have changed, as they will continue to do throughout the rest of the fiscal year, But those numbers, released this week, were not available yet March 29 when Buckley tweeted his claim. Instead, Buckley deferred to a March 12 report, which showed the $40 million deficit. Comparing final state budget figures to a point-in-time snapshot is not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, since this budget will likely end with a different deficit than Buckley claims. But, at the time of his tweet, Buckley’s numbers were right on the money. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	New Hampshire Democratic Party	None	None	None	2013-04-11T16:45:48	2013-03-29	['None']

pomt-03047	Virginia is "the number one state per capita in screening out people with mental illness from gun purchases."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2013/oct/07/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-virginia-no-1-stopping-mentally-il/	GOP gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli says the state has made strides in keeping guns away from the mentally ill since the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech. "What we’ve done in Virginia is we have become the number one state per capita in screening out people with mental illness from gun purchases," Cuccinelli said during a Sept. 25 debate with Democrat Terry McAuliffe. We wondered if Virginia really is No. 1. To support his statement, Cuccinelli campaign spokeswoman Anna Nix pointed to a chart in the Seattle Times that ranked states on that measure.The chart was based on figures compiled by Mayors Against Illegal Guns -- a gun control group started by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Those figures show Virginia had submitted 2,254 mental health records to the national background check system for every 100,000 residents in the state. That was the highest ratio among all states in late 2011. The gun control group said in a November 2011 version of its Fatal Gaps report that Virginia had been sharing records with the national background check database for a decade, but the volume of records shared increased after the 2007 Virginia Tech tragedy. In that case, Seung-Hui Cho, was able to purchase two handguns he used to kill 32 people despite going through federal and state background checks at licensed gun dealers, according to a 2009 panel report on the shooting to then Gov. Tim Kaine. Cho had been deemed a danger to himself by a Virginia court, and that normally would have made him ineligible to buy the weapons. But his information was not shared with the federal National Instant Background Check System, the panel said, because of ambiguities in Virginia’s guns laws. The Virginia Tech shootings sparked a nationwide examination of the national background check system. Congress passed a 2008 law providing incentives for states to submit mental health records to the national background check system, but they are under no requirement comply. Virginia also passed legislation expanding the mental health records that have to be sent to the federal and state background check databases. Mayors Against Illegal Guns notes on its interactive chart that in the wake of the massacre, Virginia became the national leader in submitting mental health records to the national background check system. It remained at the top of the group’s list until October 2012, Erika Soto Lamb, a spokeswoman for Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in an e-mail. Since, then, however, Pennsylvania has vaulted from the bottom of the pack to the top. That month, according to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, the Pennsylvania State Police resolved lengthy legal and technical problems and transmitted 643,167 mental health records to the NICS. The submission means that Pennsylvania has submitted about 5,003 mental health records to the national background check system per 100,000 residents. Virginia was a distant No. 2 in the latest report by the mayors’ group, which counts all submissions through Oct. 31, 2012. Virginia had sent 180,338 mental health records to NICS. That breaks down to about 2,220 records per 100,000 residents. Rounding out the Top 5 were Delaware, California and Washington. The Bottom 5, in descending order, were Oklahoma, Louisiana, North Dakota, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The gun control group plans to issue an updated report in the coming weeks. Our ruling Cuccinelli said Virginia is "the number one state per capita in screening out people with mental illness from gun purchases." His claim is based on outdated numbers. Virginia used to be No.1, but was surpassed by Pennsylvania last year. Now, we’re a distant No. 2. That’s still impressive. So Cuccinelli’s statement is largely accurate but needs the clarification.

pomt-08315	She "led the fight to stop health insurance rate hikes and saved Rhode Island families over $150 million."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/30/elizabeth-roberts/printed-words-undercut-truthfulness-lt-gov-roberts/	In her bid for reelection, Lt. Governor Elizabeth Roberts cites her efforts to keep health insurance costs down in Rhode Island. In her television ad called "Clear," a narrator says: "Elizabeth Roberts? She led the fight to stop health insurance rate hikes and saved Rhode Island families over $150 million dollars." Meanwhile, the words on the screen say "Elizabeth Roberts," "stopped insurance rate hikes," and "saved over $150 million." So what you see is a claim that Roberts "stopped insurance rate hikes" and what you hear is "led the fight to stop health insurance rate hikes." We wondered what was behind the claim. Roberts campaign manager Daniel Meuse told us that the ad referred to a 2009 request by Blue Cross and UnitedHealthCare of New England to raise rates. (Our files show the requested increases were as high as 16.3 percent. The insurance companies ultimately withdrew their requests, but succeeded in getting increases this year.) First of all, Roberts, as the lieutenant governor, has no ability to block rate hikes. That authority lies with Health Insurance Commissioner Christopher Koller. Meuse acknowledged that Roberts lacks any authority to stop a rate hike. But he said that she deserves credit for leading the campaign against the hikes, which is the claim made by the narrator. Meuse said Roberts met with business groups and rallied them against the proposal. "She was the only public official who went and testified." So we decided to check on her role as a leader of the opposition. A June 2, 2009 Providence Journal story about a Warwick news conference reported that Roberts joined business leaders to protest the proposed increases. We got through to three of the five business people mentioned in the story and asked whether Roberts led the fight. All agreed. J. Michael Vittoria, president of the Rhode Island Business Group on Health, which represents 75 small and large employers, said there was plenty of opposition to the rate hikes proposal and it probably would have been expressed to some degree, but Roberts and her office successfully focused it. "If the question is whether she was responsible for making that happen? My opinion is, yes she was. I'm not saying it wouldn't have happened without her doing it, but I think she was the point of the spear there," said Vittoria. "Essentially, she led the way in terms of getting a number of different businesses together to articulate what everybody felt anyway." "I would absolutely characterize her as someone who led the fight for the repeal of this increase," said Donald Nokes, president of NetCenergy in Warwick, who joined Vittoria and Roberts to lobby against the plan on talkradio. "It came at a very bad time and it just wasn't something we felt should be accepted." Linda Lulli, an associate vice president for human resources at Bryant University, agreed that Roberts helped rally opposition. "In think the visibility and that level of involvement of the stakeholders, I think, had some influence on the changes that were made by the [insurance] carriers and their positions." As for the $150 million estimate, Koller told us in an email that "the 150 figure was my office's estimate, at that time, of the annual aggregate incremental costs which employers would have paid for health insurance had the rates submitted by the three insurers been approved." One other important point: Roberts talks about saving Rhode Island families over $150 million dollars. But in employer-sponsored health plans, employees usually pay a portion of the premium. It's the businesses that save most of the money. In addition, many employees do not have families. For that reason, when it comes to the verbal claim, the Roberts assertion isn't completely true. And because the words that appear on the commercial make the untrue claim that she blocked the increase, it further undercuts her -- to use the Stephen Colbert word -- truthiness. So rate her seem claim as Half True.	None	Elizabeth Roberts	None	None	None	2010-10-30T00:01:00	2010-10-28	['Rhode_Island']
pomt-02821	Mark Warner cast "the tiebreaking vote" to pass Obamacare.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/nov/25/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-warner-cast-tiebreaking-vote-obama/	Republican Ken Cuccinelli’s narrow loss in the Nov. 5 gubernatorial election has spurred talk about whether he’ll challenge U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat who’s up for reelection next year. In a Nov. 18 article in The Washington Post, Cuccinelli said he found the idea of running against Warner "tempting," particularly given the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act, which Warner helped pass in the Senate. "You were the tiebreaking vote," Cuccinelli said of Warner and his support for the ACA, also known as Obamacare. We wondered whether Warner really did cast the tiebreaking ballot that allowed Obamacare to survive. Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Cuccinelli, told us Warner provided the critical vote in 2009 that prevented a Senate filibuster on the ACA. "(Sixty) votes were needed to avoid a filibuster and allow the legislation to pass, so there was not one vote to spare" Gottstein wrote in an e-mail. "Mark Warner provided that vote." Gottstein was referring to the Senate’s cloture rule that requires 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to end debate on most types of legislation and allow an up or down vote on the bill. On Dec. 23, 2009, the Senate voted 60-39 to halt debate on Obamacare. Warner joined all of his fellow Democrats and two independents in voting to stop a threatened Republican filibuster. The next day, the Senate passed Obamacare with an identical 60-39 vote. But Warner’s vote wasn’t as important this time because only a simple majority was required to approve the legislation. So let’s return to the filibuster-breaking roll call. No doubt, Warner’s vote was crucial to ending debate, as were ballots of 59 other senators. But does that mean that Warner was "the tiebreaking vote," as Cuccinelli says? It turns out that Republicans and conservative groups across the country have accused a lot of the Democratic senators of casting the key vote that unchained Obamacare. PolitiFact national noted in June 2012 the 60 Plus Association ran an ad claiming Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., cast "the deciding vote" that passed the law. In Ohio’s senate race last year, Republican Josh Mandel said Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown cast "the deciding vote." In Michigan, Pennsylvania and Missouri, conservatives charged that Democratic Sens. Debbie Stabenow, Bob Casey and Claire McCaskill, respectively, were each "the deciding vote." And let’s not forget New Hampshire, where GOP candidate Jim Rubens said earlier this month that Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen was "the deciding vote" to pass Obamacare. That’s six "deciding votes" even before Warner was added to the list. Warner’s vote was hardly a mystery in late 2009 as the Senate neared the 60-vote majority to end debate. The Virginia Democrat, in a floor speech that Sept. 23, urged Congress to move forward on health care reforms. The Los Angeles Times, in a Dec. 24, 2009 article, said the final two holdouts to join the super majority were Sens. Joseph Lieberman, I-Conn., and Ben Nelson, D-Neb. Our ruling Cuccinelli said Warner provided "the tiebreaking vote" that allowed Obamacare to become reality. There’s a sliver of truth here in that Warner did indeed provide a crucial vote that helped Democrats get to the 60 votes needed to advance the Affordable Care Act. But it’s misleading to say he cast "the vote" when Warner was joined by 59 other senators who, by Cuccinelli’s rationale, also would have cast the tie-breaking vote. Warner was not among the last holdouts that boosted the Senate to a super majority; he made his intentions known three months before the vote. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-05446	Says George Norcross said the "TAKEOVER OF RUTGER$ CAMDEN WILL COST NEW JER$EY BILLION$."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/26/r2rmerge/student-group-r2rmerge-claims-george-norcross-said/	An official estimate of the cost to merge two universities in southern New Jersey has not been released, but a student group claims a Democratic power broker put a multibillion-dollar price tag on the proposal. R2RMerge, a student movement at Rutgers-Camden, has taken to the web and to the streets to rally opposition to a plan to merge their school with Rowan University in Glassboro. The group is soliciting signatures for an online petition, as well as distributing literature to stop the controversial merger. A flier from the group found April 15 in a Jersey City grocery store states: "TAKEOVER OF RUTGER$ CAMDEN WILL COST NEW JER$EY BILLION$" The flier attributes the statement to a Feb. 7 interview South Jersey power broker George Norcross did on WHYY’s Radio Times program. With the lack of an official cost estimate, PolitiFact New Jersey questioned whether Norcross, who supports the reorganization, put a number on the proposal. Norcross did not, although he did say New Jersey taxpayers would need to approve multibillion-dollar bond issues to boost investment in higher education. During the Feb. 7 interview, Norcross cited a statistic that many have used to highlight the need for more investment in New Jersey colleges: the state ranks 47th nationally for higher education appropriations. Later in the interview, while discussing that the merged schools would not carry the Rutgers name, Norcross said: "I believe the students that are at that campus today are entitled to have their diploma say Rutgers University. I think there is a legitimate debate and discussion that needs to take place as to what happens after that because change is never easy. "But the amount of money that is involved in a reorganization of higher ed and an initiative to advance New Jersey from 47th in the country to the top 10 in the country is going to involve the voters of this state approving multibillion-dollar bond issues and southern New Jersey, undoubtedly, would receive its fair share of capital dollars, which historically it has not," he said. Norcross elaborated on his point to PolitiFact New Jersey. "What I was talking about was the long-awaited and sought capital spending initiative for higher education that would accompany a reorganization agreement statewide," he said. The proposed merger of Rutgers-Camden and Rowan is part of a larger reorganization plan that includes the restructuring of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark, as well as the merger of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, the Cancer Institute of New Jersey and the School of Public Health from UMDNJ to Rutgers-New Brunswick. Norcross mentioned a recent Bloomberg News article about a plan for New Jersey to sell up to $3.5 billion in bonds for capital investments at state colleges. "That’s not the cost of the reorganization," Norcross said. "That’s to invest in the universities and colleges." A spokesman for R2RMerge, Michael Edelman, said in an e-mail that "it’s easily discernible from the punctuation, word-choice, design, and spelling that the flier is not meant to be a direct quote from George Norcross." "Thus, we think the issue shouldn’t be framed as whether George Norcross literally said that verbatim, but whether his comments reasonably lead to that conclusion. And, in that sense, we think it safe to draw the conclusion we did," Edelman said. Our ruling A flier distributed by the student group R2RMerge claims Norcross said during a February radio interview that the takeover of Rutgers-Camden will cost New Jersey billions. A cost estimate for the merger has not been stated publicly. During the interview Norcross said efforts to restructure higher education in New Jersey and boost the state’s national ranking for investment in higher education is "going to involve the voters of this state approving multibillion-dollar bond issues and southern New Jersey, undoubtedly, would receive its fair share of capital dollars, which historically it has not." Norcross’s comments referred to overall restructuring and investment in higher education, not folding Rutgers-Camden into Rowan University. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04211	Says legislation supported by gay rights activists would strip "mother" and "father" from future Texas birth certificates.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/nov/30/texas-values/conservative-group-says-legislative-proposal-would/	The leader of a conservative group launched this year warns that legislation supported by gay rights advocates would amend every future birth certificate. In a Nov. 19, 2012, interview with Austin’s KTBC-TV, Channel 7, Jonathan Saenz, president of Texas Values, which says it seeks to preserve and advance a culture of family values, said he doesn’t expect the measure to pass into law. But "if this change is made in the law," Saenz said, "it affects everyone’s birth certificates. That means the birth certificates the way they are now, the forms, would not say ‘mother’ and ‘father.’" Mom and Dad absent from birth certificates? Asked the basis of his claim, Saenz told us by email the proposal filed by Rep. Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas, for consideration by the 2013 Legislature strips references to a mother and father from supplemental birth certificates, which describes certificates mostly issued in adoption cases. Saenz said in the TV interview: "So if you wanted them, any parent wants them," meaning birth certificates, "they’re not going to have ‘mother’ and ‘father’ on there. So this isn’t just about the homosexual lobby wanting their rights. It’s partly about that issue, but this change in the law would impact everyone’s birth certificates." Chuck Smith, executive director of Equality Texas, which says it lobbies for the elimination of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression, said in an email and online post that partly because Anchia’s House Bill 201 only applies to birth certificates issued in adoption cases, Saenz’s claim is incorrect, a critique that Anchia echoed by telephone. Smith initially brought Saenz’s claim to our attention. Nearly 30,000 so-called "supplemental" birth certificates were filed by the state from September 2011 through August 2012, according to Christine Mann, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, which filed nearly 388,000 regular birth certificates, the kind issued after babies are born, in the period. Both types, once issued, look the same, she said by email. Anchia’s proposal would replace a provision in the Texas Health and Safety Code saying that on a supplemental birth certificate, one parent must be a female, named as the mother, and the other a male, named as the father. The law would say instead that the "supplementary birth certificate of an adopted child must be in the names of both adoptive parents," not specifying genders. The measure would take effect in September 2013. The way the law now works for same-sex couples is that one adoptive parent must choose to be designated as the father, in the case of a male couple, or the mother, in the case of a female couple, and the other parent is not listed on the resulting birth certificate, according to information posted online by State Health Services. By email, Mann confirmed that the 1997 Legislature put the gender-specific requirement in place of the previous law requiring only that parents be listed. So, would mother and father fade from Texas birth certificates in general? We noticed that the fiscal note for a similar proposal offered by Anchia in the 2011 session quotes State Health Services as saying relevant forms would be modified to show "Parent 1" and "Parent 2." In contrast, the "Certificate of Adoption" form now filled out to obtain a supplemental birth certificate has spaces for applicants to designate the child’s mother and father. By phone, two lawyers with expertise in adoption cases told us they do not read Anchia’s proposal as Saenz does. Michael Lackmeyer of Killeen said the proposal solely relates to birth certificates in adoption cases, not the vast majority issued after babies are born. Also, he said, he believes the state could keep the existing application for supplemental certificates, perhaps amended with instructions stating the adopting mother need not be a female nor the father a male. "I don’t really think it’s going to do quite what the opposition thinks it’s going to do," Lackmeyer said. Jeff Barnett of Austin agreed, saying nothing in the proposal should lead to certificates issued after birth losing "mother" and "father" designations. All the proposal does is remove the hurdle that one adopting parent be male and the other female, Barnett said. In contrast, Mann of State Health Services offered an uncertain analysis, saying by email that while the proposal may not appear to affect all certificates, that remains a possibility. If the "modification is made to only supplementary birth records, it may have the effect of identifying adopted persons," Mann wrote. "If you modify just the supplementary birth records of adopted persons by including only gender-neutral references to the parents (e.g. ‘parent 1’ and ‘parent 2’) and leave all other birth records with the ‘mother’ and ‘father’ references, that gender neutral reference/record distinguishes adopted person’s records and thus identifies them, which under current state law, is prohibited. As a result," she said, "we would have to have a consistent reference on all birth certificates going forward so as to not bring attention to those which are for adopted persons." We had asked Mann if Anchia's proposal would result in "mother" and "father" entries going away from all certificates. She replied: "The answer may be no if we can find a way to add ‘or parent’ ‘or co-parent’ or some other additional category along with ‘mother’ and ‘father’ to provide the gender-neutral option provided by the (legislation) on all certificates such as ‘Mother or Parent 1’ and ‘Father or Parent 2.’ This may be an issue of space on the certificates, so it’s unclear at this point if this is an option." Mann also said the agency "would need to modify more than 20 forms which currently reflect the names of the mother and father to show parent and co-parent to comply with this bill. These modifications would result in programming changes which must be made to the Texas Electronic Registrar and Remote Issuance systems, as well as the Texas.gov web portal. These changes would affect all birth certificates yet to be issued. It would not affect birth certificates already issued." Finally, we ran her comments by Saenz, Smith and the outside lawyers. Saenz said they uphold his claim. Smith stressed that no form changes are required by Anchia’s proposal. Lackmeyer said by email that "even though the changes address only supplemental" birth certificates, "who knows what any state agency will do to the entire system to implement that minor change?" By email, Barnett said the proposal still does not mandate the removal of "mother" and "father" from certificates. Our ruling The leader of Texas Values says a proposed change in law would strip "mother" and "father" from Texas birth certificates. The proposal would eliminate a requirement that adoptive couples seeking a birth certificate list a male father and female mother. But nothing in the proposal explicitly removes mother and father entries on certificates and it seems reasonable to us that any needed tweaks could be made without Moms and Dads vanishing from them. Then again, the state agency spokeswoman was uncertain about the proposal's effect, which sways us to say that Saenz's claim has an element of truth. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13272	"Refugees are subject to more rigorous screening than the average tourist in the U.S."	true	/global-news/statements/2016/oct/13/barack-obama/refugee-summit-obama-claims-refugees-us-are-screen/	As the Syrian civil war rages on, the refugee crisis was a major subject of debate at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York last month. Many nations remain suspicious of refugees from the Middle East, fearful that some may be terrorists or criminals. In a speech to the Leader’s Summit on Refugees on Sept. 20, President Barack Obama strongly pushed back against this suspicion. He made an impassioned argument for countries to increase humanitarian aid to conflict zones and accept their fair share of refugees. "In recent years, in the United States, we’ve worked to put in intensive screening and security checks, so we can welcome refugees and ensure our security. In fact, refugees are subject to more rigorous screening than the average tourist," he said. Officials at government agencies have made similar statements, saying that refugees are subject to the most intense screening of any visitors to the United States. His claim comes at a time when politicians such as Donald Trump are casting doubt on the government’s ability to vet refugees and make sure they don’t pose a threat to the country. We were interested in comparing the screening process for tourists and refugees to see whether Obama’s claim is correct. Comparing the protocols We first looked at the Department of Homeland Security’s official protocols for tourist and refugee screening, and outlined the major components of each one below: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com First, travelers from 38 countries such as the U.K., Australia, and Japan can apply for the visa waiver program. This allows them to travel to the United States for 90 days or less without applying for a visa. Applicants must have passports with special security features, and need to obtain approval through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, an automated screening system for passengers. Visitors that don’t apply for a visa waiver need to apply for a visitor’s visa. Prospective visitors need to have a valid passport, resume, and photo ID in order to complete the DS-160, which is the major online nonimmigrant visa application. They also need to pass a visa interview, where they’re often asked to provide evidence of their trip’s purpose. For example, a visiting scientist may have to bring a document proving that they will attend a research symposium in the United States. The waiting time to obtain a visitor’s visa depends on the traveler’s country of origin, but typically takes between several weeks to several months. A visitor’s visa usually lasts six months, but can be extended through an additional application process. The listed screening process for refugees is more complicated, and frequently takes at least two years to complete. According to the White House’s website, refugees are first identified, assessed, and interviewed by UNHCR, the United Nations’ refugee agency. Applicants then go through a strict screening process while still overseas. They face security checks and interviews with at least four federal agencies, such as the FBI and the State Department. The Department of Homeland Security then interviews the candidate again with specially trained officers from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. Applicant’s fingerprints are also gathered and cross-referenced to terrorist watch lists, and they must pass medical screenings and attend cultural orientation classes. Refugees from Syria face additional security checks and may be referred to fraud detection experts in Homeland Security. According to the State Department, around half of refugee applicants are ultimately admitted to the United States. Obama was correct in saying that the refugee screening process is more rigorous that the tourist screening process, at least in theory. But does it always turn out that way in real life? The risk of admitting terrorists with each process David Martin, professor of law at the University of Virginia, told us that Obama’s statement is accurate. "The procedures are not merely theoretical," he said. "DHS has worked hard to develop procedures and effective lines of inquiry specific to refugee populations, and they are fully employed." For example, even if refugee applicants initially passes a certain stage, they face the prospect of recurrent vetting. If they provide any new biographical information in the vetting process, the entire round of security checks with federal agencies is repeated. Additionally, pending applications are constantly reviewed against terrorist databases to watch for new threats. If any potential concern comes up, the application is paused and reviewed again. Martin acknowledges that no security screening is completely foolproof. One of the largest challenges facing refugee screening is a lack of access to government data in war-torn countries. Because the U.S. government can only work with the data it can obtain, verifying people’s identities in countries where records may be missing or destroyed is more difficult. In fact, the tourist screening process could potentially be more prone to letting terrorists in, according to Anne Speckhard, associate professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University. Of particular concern to her and other experts is the relative laxity of the visa waiver program. "In my view the most danger of an ISIS cadre making it to the United States is the visa waiver form, so for instance, a European ISIS cadre who comes as a ‘tourist’ but is really a terrorist," she said. "It’s hard for me to believe an ISIS cadre would expose himself to so long vetting process and wait for two years to enter the United States when it’s so much easier to get here through visa waiver." Speckhard said that the majority of Syrian refugees pose no danger to the United States and simply wish to flee repression from either ISIS or the Syrian government. She argued that some refugees are highly educated and have much to contribute. Matt Mayer of the American Enterprise Institute told us that Obama’s use of the word "average" makes his claim correct, due to the low level of screening that visa waiver applicants receive. But because refugees are coming to the United States permanently, as opposed to tourists’ brief visits, Obama is making a false comparison. Mayer said refugees should be extensively screened due to widespread problems with document fraud and verifying people’s identities. Our Ruling Obama said, "Refugees are subject to more rigorous screening than the average tourist in the U.S." Reviewing the government’s vetting protocols confirms that refugees face a far stricter and longer process than tourists for entering the United States. The experts we consulted agreed that the refugee protocol is strictly enforced and more difficult than the screening process that tourists go through.

pomt-02173	"Some of the wealthiest Americans are African-American now."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/29/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-some-wealthiest-americans-are-african-ame/	There’s the truth, there’s distortions and then there’s Rush Limbaugh’s April 28, 2014, radio show. In it, the conservative American radio talk show host decided to discuss the racist comments allegedly made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling. At one point, Limbaugh described Sterling as "a typical Hollywood Democrat." That’s incorrect (Sterling is a registered Republican -- to the extent it matters). "The only reason (Sterling’s) in trouble right now is he did not give enough money to Obama," Limbaugh proclaimed. That’s highly speculative, so we can’t fact-check Limbaugh on this point. At another point in his Sterling talk, Limbaugh discussed how things generally are going for African-Americans in the United States. Limbaugh’s diagnosis: pretty darn good. "You've got a black president. You've got a black attorney general. You've got the wealthiest TV performer in American history is a African-American woman. That would be The Oprah," Limbaugh said. "Some of the wealthiest Americans are African-American now." That last line is quite incorrect. The go-to source to learn about the wealthiest Americans is Forbes, which tracks the fortunes of the world’s elite. It publishes an annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans and a list of the world’s billionaires. The most recent Forbes list was released in March 2014. (Bloomberg also publishes a less expansive list of the world’s billionaires.) For some perspective, the folks at the bottom of Forbes’ wealthiest Americans list are worth an estimated $1.3 billion. At the top is Bill Gates, who is worth an estimated $72 billion. How many African-Americans make up the American Top 400? One, according to Forbes. Oprah Winfrey is worth an estimated $2.9 billion -- ranking her 184th on the list. For the record, it isn’t only rare for African-Americans to be billionaires in the United States. According to Forbes, there are only nine black billionaires in the world. So who are the wealthiest African-Americans besides Winfrey? We found two other lists using Forbes data that are a few years old. Here’s a list, with the date of the last update: Entertainer Sean "Diddy" Combs, $550 million (April 2012) BET founder Robert Johnson, $550 million (May 2009) Golfer Tiger Woods, $500 million (September 2010) Former basketball player Michael Jordan, $500 million (September 2010) Former basketball player Magic Johnson, $500 million (May 2009) That means no African-American other than Oprah Winfrey is even close to cracking the Top 400 list. Our ruling Limbaugh said, "Some of the wealthiest Americans are African-American now." We reached out to Limbaugh with our finding but have not heard back. Of the top 400 wealthiest Americans, exactly one is African-American -- that’s .25 percent. Also, no other African-American is really all that close to breaking into the Top 400. Limbaugh’s claim severely distorts reality. We rate it False.	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2014-04-29T12:14:59	2014-04-28	['United_States']

pomt-06974	House Bill 2301 never had a public hearing	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/jul/14/oregon-education-association/did-controversial-online-charter-school-bill-reall/	In order for Gov. John Kitzhaber to get what he wanted on education reform this session -- a new investment board, for example -- legislators agreed to vote on a package of 14 education-related bills. One of those bills, House Bill 2301, will allow online charter schools to add more students and was vigorously opposed by the public teachers’ union, the Oregon Education Association. Just before the Fourth of July holiday, the group submitted a guest column on Blue Oregon, pleading with the governor to veto House Bill 2301: "What makes this whole debacle even more unpalatable is that the public was completely shut out of the backroom dealing. HB 2301 never had a public hearing. Parents, educators, and school leaders were never given the opportunity to weigh in and talk about how this will impact kids in the classroom." The sentiment is one that we’re bound to hear again. Democrats complained about the lack of process over the education bills, with then-House Democratic Leader Dave Hunt of Gladstone arguing that there were "no public hearings, no vetting of amendments, no real fiscal analysis." Rep. Sara Gelser, D-Corvallis, and co-chairwoman of the House Education Committee echoed his frustration. But a fed-up Rep. Brian Clem, D-Salem, shot back that there had been hearings on the bill, back in February. (Clem also said, we can’t help but add, "You're either going to be a mature adult and be at the big kids’ table and figure out how to make things work, or you're going to throw tantrums and write press releases and sit at the little kids' table. And I'm going to be at the big kids’ table." Ouch.) So what gives? Who’s right? Did House Bill 2301 get a public hearing? Well, yes and no. A bill with that number was the subject of two public hearings Feb. 11 and 14, 2011, in the House Education Committee. But that wasn’t the bill that lawmakers approved in the final days of the Legislature. The bill as introduced was 62 pages long, with parts stemming from a comprehensive State Board of Educationreport on virtual learning to the Legislature. Part of the reason why the bill is so long is that the board wanted to separate virtual school law from charter school law. The proposal also contained provisions to increase the enrollment cap and to establish funding per child since in Oregon, state money follows the student. The final bill is six pages long. It contains two key elements important to virtual schools, not to the broad expanse of online education. One, the legislation states that at least 95 percent of instructional time be delivered by a state licensed teacher. Two, the legislation also allows online charter schools to enroll as much as 3 percent of a school district's population without getting permission from the district. Currently, students need to get permission from their local school districts to enroll in an online school. The teacher licensing requirement was not in the original bill. The 3 percent enrollment cap was in the original bill. What happened is in legislative lingo called a "gut and stuff." Lawmakers take a bill already in process, "gut" the contents and "stuff" in a new bill under the old number. (Even the bill’s carrier on the floor, Rep. John Huffman, R-The Dalles, called the amended version "a complete gut and stuff of the original bill.") Audio records of committee hearings show that the amended version cropped up days before the House floor vote and moved through two budget committees without discussion or debate because of the deal struck by Kitzhaber and Republicans. So if the final bill bore little to no resemblance to the original bill, were there hearings on the issues in it? (Hint: Does a slice of pie look like a whole pie, especially when there’s a piece of cake frosting on top of the slice?) We listened to those two public hearings in February. The public comments were broad, general. Fans of Oregon Connections Academy, a popular for-profit virtual school known as ORCA, testified on the benefits of online schooling and pleaded for more state money. An ORCA instructor said the school would have to drop advanced course offerings if teachers were required to acquire state teaching licenses and live in Oregon. There were some questions by committee legislators, including the issue of licensing. Rep. Matt Wingard, R-Wilsonville, and the other co-chairman of the House Education Committee, said the issues included in the original legislation were aired in February, and the teachers’ union had plenty of time then and in months leading to the floor vote to pipe up. Wingard also says the final version of the bill was negotiated by both Democrats and Republicans. PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t have a problem with legislative dealmaking. It happens. But we don’t agree with Wingard that public hearings on the original bill mean hearings on the version that passed. There was no public discussion -- and there was no discussion among lawmakers in public -- on the details of how taxpayers should govern, encourage, monitor and pay for online education, including online schools. There was no negotiating in public the version put to legislators as part of a final deal. The bill that passed bypassed the comprehensive nature of the original House Bill 2301. Elements of the final bill were discussed, in passing, but the heart of it did not receive a public hearing. The claim that the legislation received no public hearing is Mostly True -- accurate but needing additional clarification. Comment on this item.

pomt-01266	"One-hundred times as many people worked their way from poverty into the American middle class" during his presidency compared to Ronald Reagan's presidency.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/nov/07/bill-clinton/did-100-times-more-people-ascend-middle-class-unde/	Campaigning for Mary Burke in Milwaukee on Oct. 24, 2014, Bill Clinton reflected on his presidency, sizing it up against Ronald Reagan's. "The thing I'm proudest of was that, as compared with President Reagan's term, we created 45 percent more jobs," Clinton said during a speech for Burke, who 10 days later lost her bid to unseat Gov. Scott Walker. He continued: "But 100 times -- listen to this -- 100 times as many people worked their way from poverty into the American middle class. That’s the way this economy should work." Clinton made the same claim a month earlier on CNN. One-hundred times as many? Now, that’s a statistic begging to be checked. Background on the issue Clinton, a Democrat, was elected in November 1992 and served two terms, from January 1993 to January 2001. Reagan, a Republican, was elected in November 1980 and also served eight years, from January 1981 to January 1989. Clinton’s spokesman cited census figures showing that there was a net decrease of nearly 7.7 million people living in poverty from 1993 to 2000. That’s 100 times more than the 77,000 fewer under Reagan from 1981 to 1988. But there’s some cherry picking going on in that comparison. Why? A president is elected in November but does not take office until January. To be consistent, you need to stick to one or the other. Earlier in 2014, Hillary Clinton made a claim similar to the one Bill Clinton made in Milwaukee. PolitiFact National rated it False. Our colleagues looked at two-eight year frames: Election years, which were 1992 to 2000 for Clinton and 1980 to 1988 for Reagan; and the years the men took office and left office -- 1993 to 2001 for Clinton and 1981 to 1989 for Reagan. Our colleagues found similar trends for each time frames, then reported figures based on the second time frame. During the eight years under Clinton, the number of Americans in poverty declined by 6.5 million -- 22 times more than the 294,000 under Reagan. That’s a lot, but it’s not 100 times. There’s one other problem with Clinton’s claim, given that he cited not simply the number of people no longer living in poverty but those that moved from poverty to the "middle class." His spokesman provided no evidence to indicate how many people moved into the middle class. Jonathan Schwabish, economist and senior researcher at the Urban Institute, told us there is no consensus on what constitutes the middle class. He also said it would be hard argue that all of the people who climbed out of poverty had entered the middle class. Indeed, a person whose income was $1 above the poverty line would no longer officially be living in poverty, but probably wouldn’t feel as though he or she had suddenly joined the middle class. Our rating Clinton said "100 times as many people worked their way from poverty into the American middle class" during his presidency compared to Reagan's presidency. Measured one way -- from the year each president took office to the election year in which each last served -- the number of people no longer living in poverty under Clinton was 100 times more than the number under Reagan. But a consistent measure -- from the year each president took office to the year each president left office -- shows the figure under Clinton was only 22 times higher. What’s more, Clinton provided no evidence that all the people lifted out of poverty during his tenure had entered the middle class. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-00469	A proposed constitutional amendment "will pave the way for making abortion illegal under North Carolina’s constitution."	pants on fire!	/north-carolina/statements/2018/aug/14/bluenc/could-nc-constitutional-amendment-make-abortion-il/	This election, North Carolina voters will have the option of making six changes to the state Constitution. One of them, commonly referred to as the "victims’ rights" or "Marsy’s Law" amendment, would add more protections and rights for crime victims in the legal process. The amendment was pushed by an advocacy group, Marsy’s Law for All, founded to prevent situations like the one experienced by the family of Marsy Nicholas. Nicholas was stalked and killed by her ex-boyfriend in 1983, according to the Marsy’s Law for NC website. A week after Marsy’s death, her family was confronted by her accused murderer in a grocery store and the family "had no idea that he had been released on bail," the site says. The proposed amendment would include granting victims’ families the constitutional right to be present at court proceedings of accused felons, the right to be informed of a jury’s ruling, and the right to know if the convicted perpetrator has escaped or been released from prison. Among the most common criticisms of the proposal is that it might slow the legal system and add costs. However, a completely different worry recently emerged on the BlueNC blog, which is run by former Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Protzman. Protzman created a poster describing each of the amendments. "Victim’s rights will be extended to any class of people the legislature wants, including fetuses. This amendment will pave the way for making abortion illegal under North Carolina’s constitution," the Blue NC description of the victims’ rights amendment says. PolitiFact doesn’t often focus on blogs unless their content becomes widely distributed. In this case, the poster was shared on Facebook by Wayne Goodwin, chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, and Goodwin’s post was shared more than 700 times. ‘Who knows?’ Abortion is legal in the United States but regulations vary by state. For example, in North Carolina, there are restrictions on abortion after 20 weeks, and taxpayer money can’t be used for abortions except for pregnancies caused by rape, incest or where the mother’s life is endangered, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an advocacy group that promotes sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States. North Carolina also gives medical providers the right to refuse abortion services and requires potential abortion patients to wait 72 hours after a consultation, the institute says. When contacted by PolitiFact, Protzman explained by email he’s critical of all six amendments because they’re vague. He pointed to this line in the legislation: "The victim or, if the victim is a minor, is legally incapacitated, or deceased, a family member, guardian, or legal custodian may assert the rights provided in this section." "So let’s say you’re the estranged husband of a woman who has an abortion. Under this amendment, you could assert all the rights of a family member on behalf of the fetus, and then impose the requirements of the amendment on your estranged wife. You could even assert, on behalf of the ‘victim,’ that felony murder took place," Protzman said. "Would this happen? Who knows? But it could. And given the willingness of Sen. Berger and Speaker Moore to bend legislative rules to suit their agendas, I wouldn’t bet against it," he added. But that hypothetical scenario is not only extremely unlikely, experts said, it’s also irrelevant. The victims’ rights amendment, which has no mention of abortion or reproductive rights, would still have no bearing on the legal status of abortion in North Carolina. ‘Absurd’ Gregory Wallace, a professor at Campbell University School of Law, noted the amendment applies only to people who are victims of a crime, and identifies specific procedures the court must follow to grant those rights. He described Protzman’s claim as "absurd." "The proposed amendment does not authorize a person to accuse someone of a crime or to make something a crime that is not already unlawful," Wallace said in an email. "Under the Constitution and current law, the aborted child is not treated as a victim of a crime," Wallace continued. "The aborted child therefore would not have any rights under the proposed amendment, nor does the proposed amendment do anything to change current abortion law." Marsy’s Law for NC, the group pushing the amendment, echoed that sentiment. "Marsy’s Law is not about abortion rights — it’s about strengthening rights for victims of crime," the group said through Chris Sinclair, general consultant for the Marsy’s Law for NC campaign. "Special interest groups are in high gear on social media spreading misinformation about Marsy’s Law, the amendment that will strengthen constitutional rights for victims of crime in North Carolina," the statement says. "Their glib misinformation campaign is an attempt to mislead voters, and ultimately will hurt crime victims and their families who deserve equal rights in the state constitution - rights that the accused and convicted already have." Skye David, an attorney with New Frame in Raleigh, focuses on victims of sexual assault as part of her lobbying work. She told PolitiFact in an email the proposed law could, in theory, apply to an abortion case. But it’s "unlikely that it could qualify as felony murder because there would be no attempt to commit a felony under (statute)." "I’m certainly open to hearing how this could/would be more common, but don’t think that this would be a common or even uncommon case." The proposal is unlikely to pave the way for making abortion illegal, she said. Federal law trumps state law John Dinan, an expert on the N.C. Constitution who teaches at Wake Forest University, says he has kept track of the states that started adopting victims’ rights amendments, a trend that started in the 1980s, and then the second wave of states that adopted Marsy’s Law amendments. "Of the various critiques that have been advanced about these amendments during the campaigns — and there have been various critiques — concerns about the effects on abortion rights have not figured prominently in the debates and campaigns about the amendments," Dinan told PolitiFact in an email. "Far more common have been concerns about whether these amendments will place an undue burden on prosecutors and court systems." The proposed North Carolina constitutional amendment is no different, he said. "In looking at the original victims’ rights amendment (added to the North Carolina Constitution in 1996) and then examining the changes that would be made by the 2018 Marsy’s Law amendment, it is not clear to me which of the 2018 changes would have the claimed effect on abortion rights," Dinan said. Jeff Powell, an expert at Duke University, emphasized that the state can’t pass any new abortion restrictions that violate federal law. And the Supreme Court has ruled that abortion rights are protected by the U.S. Constitution. "As long as there’s a federal constitutional rule on abortion, that trumps whatever North Carolina will do," Powell said. Our ruling BlueNC said the proposed victims’ rights constitutional amendment will "pave the way for making abortion illegal." Attorneys and legal experts say the path to such fallout not only is unclear, but unlikely. One expert described the claim as "absurd." And Protzman failed to offer evidence that an amendment which is completely unrelated to reproductive rights could outlaw abortion. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-14405	"Seventy percent of Missourians support voter photo ID legislation."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2016/mar/14/caleb-rowden/rowden-mostly-right-about-missouri-residents-supp/	The debate over whether to require photo identification to vote continues in Missouri. Republicans argue photo IDs are necessary to safeguard the voting process from fraud, while Democrats warn that legislation would disenfranchise minority and poor voters. At a League of Women Voters’ town hall meeting in Columbia, state Rep. Caleb Rowden said most people are behind the idea. The Columbia Republican said "70 percent of Missourians support voter photo ID legislation." We decided to look into that. Rowden said he based his 70 percent figure on a poll conducted by Remington Research in Missouri Scout, a political subscription service. He also said he has internally polled the district he represents. The survey Rowden cited put the question this way: "The legislature is proposing to require voters to show a valid Missouri driver’s license or other valid identification in order to vote. Do you agree or disagree with this?" Remington’s poll said 70 percent of Missourians said they agreed, with results varying city-to-city. The hitch is that the poll does not clarify what "other valid identification" entails. Defining what does and does not constitute "valid identification" is the crux of a proposed Missouri bill. As Missouri law stands now, any form of ID issued by Missouri, the federal government or another state is accepted as proof of identity to vote. Those forms include driver’s licenses from another state, birth certificates, student IDs, utility bills and bank statements. Not all of those include a photo. In contrast, the Missouri bill would require one of four documents, all of which include photos: a Missouri driver’s license; a Missouri non-driver’s license (state ID); a military ID; or a national government-issued form of ID with a signature and photograph. Marvin Overby, MU professor of political science at , said changes in phrasing when it comes to survey research can lead to different results. "To a lot of people, it’s just common-sense rhetoric that you need a photo ID to do lots of things in life, including voting," he said. "But if the wording laid out more exact points, such as the fact that the proposed legislation doesn’t include student IDs or out-of-state licenses, you might get a different response." That said, evidence from national polling suggests Rowden might be on solid ground. Nationwide support for photo ID The Pew Research Center found that 77 percent of Americans supported photo voter ID requirements. A poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports this summer illustrated a similar trend, showing more than three-quarters of Americans are in favor of requiring a photo ID to vote. That poll asked, "Should voters be required to show photo identification such as a driver’s license before being allowed to vote?" Unlike the poll cited by Rowden, the Rasmussen Reports poll specifically defined a valid ID as one requiring a photo. Rasmussen Reports Managing Editor Fran Coombs said the goal is to keep any potential bias out of survey questions. "As a rule, we just try to keep the questioning as simple as possible," she said. "The important thing is not to influence the responses with the wording of the question." Even those who disagree with the idea of requiring photo identification don’t dispute that surveys show a high level of support for the idea. Missouri’s League of Women Voters’ Voter Protection and Service Director Kathleen Farrell said people might not know the details of the legislation that surveys ask about. "The average person might not know just how strict Missouri’s proposed legislation is," she said. "They also may not know how expensive it could be to require photo ID for all voters." The bill’s fiscal note allows for up to about $10.7 million dollars of funding; if the necessary funds were not allocated, the requirements for photo identification to vote would not be implemented. Our ruling Rowden’s statement that "70 percent of Missourians support voter photo ID identification" isn’t fully supported by the poll he provided. The poll Rowden cited only asks about "requiring Missouri driver’s licenses or other valid form of ID to vote." It doesn’t specify that the proposed legislation restricts valid identification to IDs that have photos. But national polls show about 75 percent of Americans support requiring a photo ID to vote. The wording in the poll Rowden cited is confusing, but the results mirror the national trend. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-12888	"There's one (study) that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/25/sean-spicer/sean-spicer-wrongly-uses-pew-study-bolster-claim-n/	Even after being sworn in as president, Donald Trump isn’t letting go of his unsubstantiated belief that millions of people voted illegally in November, costing him the popular vote. Now, he’s calling for a "major investigation" into voter fraud, he wrote in a Jan. 25 tweet. We have debunked Trump’s claims of massive voter fraud again and again and again (and again and again and again and again) over the past year. Trump has not yet produced any evidence that supports these claims — because none exists. In the Jan. 24 daily press briefing, a reporter asked White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer how Trump came to believe that it’s possible illegal votes were to blame for his popular vote loss. "I think there's been studies," Spicer responded. "There's one that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens. There's other studies that have been presented to him. It's a belief he maintains." Spicer is conflating a couple different studies that have been erroneously used to prop up claims that noncitizens have swayed elections by voting illegally. There is no study that shows 14 percent of the votes cast in 2008 were cast by noncitizens. That would have added up to more than 18 million fraudulent votes — an implausible assertion, considering the total noncitizen population was about 22.5 million in 2010. Pew study misinterpreted The study that "came out of Pew in 2008" actually came out in 2012, and it’s about outdated voter rolls, not fraudulent votes. The 2012 Pew study — titled, "Inaccurate, Costly, and Inefficient: Evidence That America’s Voter Registration System Needs an Upgrade" — makes no mention of noncitizens voting or registering to vote. Rather, it found that about 24 million, or one in every eight, voter registrations in the United States are inaccurate or no longer valid, but it did not find evidence of actual voter fraud. The study was about record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray. Here’s what the former director of Pew’s election program said about the study in November: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Old Dominion study contested The study that shows "14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens" has been widely criticized for its methodology, and Spicer cites the findings incorrectly. The study Spicer likely meant to reference was conducted by professors at Old Dominion University and published in 2014. The researchers wrote in the Washington Post that about 14 percent of noncitizens in their sample said they were registered to vote, and they deduced that about 6 percent of noncitizens actually voted in the 2008 election. (That would mean somewhere in the ballpark of 1.3 million votes, using Census estimates of the noncitizen population.) So the study doesn’t show the statistic Spicer says it does. Beyond that, many credible researchers have panned the study as methodologically unsound for using an opt-in Internet poll originally designed to survey citizens and not considering possible survey response error. In a recent blog post, one of the authors, Old Dominion professor Jesse Richman, said he stands by his study, but "our results suggest that almost all elections in the US are not determined by noncitizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions." There might be a problem of noncitizens voting, but it’s not nearly as large as the statistic Spicer cites. These studies do not prop up Trump’s belief that millions of illegal votes cost him the popular vote. Hillary Clinton won almost 3 million more votes than Trump. So erasing Trump’s popular-vote deficit requires the assumption that all 3 million of these votes were cast illegally, and every one of them went to Clinton and not Trump. Further, no official sources or reputable academic sources have produced any evidence of large-scale voter fraud in the 2016 election, and numerous studies have shown that voter fraud is rare. Read our full debunking of Trump’s Nov. 28 claim that he "won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally." Our ruling Spicer said, "There's one (study) that came out of Pew in 2008 that showed 14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens." Spicer is both conflating and misquoting two studies: A 2012 Pew report about outdated voter rolls and a 2014 Old Dominion University study that found 6 percent of noncitizens surveyed voted in 2008. The Old Dominion University study has been widely criticized for its methodology. No study has found the statistic Spicer cites. If 14 percent of all voters in 2008 were noncitizens, that would have to mean that more than 80 percent of America’s noncitizen population voted. Spicer’s claim is False.

pomt-14694	"Our businesses have created jobs every single month since (Obamacare) became law."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/12/barack-obama/business-has-created-jobs-every-month-obamacare-be/	President Barack Obama touted the success of Obamacare during his final State of the Union address. He said the Affordable Care Act has led to nearly 18 million more people gaining health insurance and has helped to slow health care cost inflation. He added that the law didn’t destroy the job market, despite pessimistic predictions from critics. "Our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law," Obama said on Capitol Hill on Jan. 12, 2016. We hadn’t heard that particular Obamacare talking point before, so we decided to take a look. Because Obama referred specifically to "our businesses," we looked at private-sector employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics starting in March 2010, when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act. Of the 70 months since, Obama is correct that every single one has seen positive job growth. That’s a record for uninterrupted job growth, according to our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker. This graph from BLS shows monthly change in private-sector job growth (in thousands) since the start of 2010: From early 2010 on, the data is above the zero line, showing positive job growth. The fact that the country has gained jobs despite the health care law also might not assuage critics’ argument that job growth, and other aspects of the economy, would have been stronger absent the law. For example, in a January 2015 fact-check, we found that the law might have caused many thousands of employees to have their hours cut from full-time to part-time. But independent studies haven’t backed up claims that the law would end up reducing employment. In 2011, we rated a claim from former Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., that Obamacare is "job killing" False. Former Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in 2014 that Obamacare is "expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs." We rated that claim Mostly False. Our ruling Obama said, "Our businesses have created jobs every single month since (Obamacare) became law." The private sector has seen job growth every single month since Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010. There’s room for argument over what the growth would have looked like absent the health care law, but Obama’s statistic is on target. We rate this claim True.

pomt-10177	"President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion...[wrote a] letter of resignation to the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/26/john-mccain/mccain-flubs-military-history/	Early in the first presidential debate, Sen. John McCain veered into military history during a discussion of the financial crisis. To make a point about accountability, he relayed an anecdote about Dwight D. Eisenhower. Only McCain got the story wrong in a way that undermined his point. After moderator Jim Lehrer pressed McCain on whether he would support the financial bailout package Congress is crafting, McCain said, "I hope so, sure." Then he said: "But there's also the issue of responsibility. You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower. President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room and he wrote out two letters. One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and Allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever. And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation to the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy. Somehow, we've lost that accountability." McCain went on to link Eisenhower and his letter to McCain's repeated calls in recent days that Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Christopher Cox resign for his role in the financial crisis. McCain was almost certainly referring to this note , which Eisenhower, then the U.S. Army general commanding the Normandy assault, prepared and stuck in his wallet on June 5, 1944, the day before the invasion in case the mission failed. It says: "Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone." A noble sentiment — but not a letter of resignation. "That must be what McCain is referencing," said David Fitzpatrick, a military historian at the University of Michigan. "I never heard that Eisenhower had prepared a letter of resignation. That would be incorrect." The invasion was a success and Eisenhower did not have to use the note. McCain ought not use it either — at least not as an example of prewritten resignation letter. Though Eisenhower did intend to take responsibility for the failure, that's quite different from preparing to resign his generalship. We find this anecdote to be False.

But that isn't substantiated at all. "Lisa Page squeals: DNC server was not hacked by Russians," said the July 17 headline by Your News Wire which frequently publishes fake news. This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no credible evidence to back up the headline. Your News Wire largely drew from a story by The True Pundit about Page’s closed-door House hearings on July 13 and July 16. The True Pundit said the information came from "federal sources" and "well-placed FBI sources." The True Pundit said that Page alleged that the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed "assets" had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 30,000 "missing" emails. In 2016, the U.S. intelligence community concluded that the Russian government directed the recent theft of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. Despite that, Trump has questioned whether the Russian government tried to interfere in the U.S. election. In 2016, Trump said it could have been China who hacked emails of Democratic operatives and the Democratic National Committee. Or someone "sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds." Page, a former FBI lawyer, has drawn attention from lawmakers because she and former FBI agent Peter Strzok exchanged anti-Trump text messages while having an affair. Both worked on the FBI's Russia investigation and for a brief time on Special Counsel Robert’s Mueller’s investigation. Strozak testified publicly for 10 hours on July 12. We don’t have access to Page’s testimony because it occurred in a closed-door session. News reports said Page didn’t answer reporters’ questions before or after her testimony and lawmakers revealed little. However, of the information that has emerged about her testimony and reported by the mainstream media, none of it indicated she blamed the Chinese. Conservative news outlets included Breitbart and The Daily Caller said that lawmakers indicated Page contradicted Strzok about their texts and focused on the issue of political bias at the FBI, but those articles didn’t indicate that she blamed China, either. The Washington Post reported that Republican lawyers said that Page provided new information that further convinced them that political bias marred the investigations of Hillary Clinton's emails and the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia. Page denied bias. Several right-wing websites have repeated the claim that Page contradicted the U.S. intelligence community and pointed the finger at China. We sent an email to Your News Wire and did not get a reply. PolitiFact evaluates information using on-the-record sources and information as of the time that a person or website makes a claim.

pomt-12925	"House GOP rules package bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/12/keith-ellison/keith-ellison-wrong-cbo-cant-analyze-cost-obamacar/	House rules don’t often become big news. This year was somewhat different. The biggest news in the 2017 rules package was an amendment to curb the power of the independent Office of Congressional Ethics. After a big public backlash and critical tweets by President-elect Donald Trump, the amendment was withdrawn. Somewhat less widely noticed, but which has come up periodically in pro-Democratic web posts and social media, was a provision that seemed to prevent the Congressional Budget Office from analyzing the cost of repealing the Affordable Care Act. If true, this would be significant, since the CBO, Congress’ number-crunching arm, is a respected independent referee on questions of how much legislative proposals will cost the federal treasury. If this happened, it would make it easier for Republicans to avoid answering the question of why they want to repeal a law at significant cost to the U.S. treasury. At least one lawmaker made an issue of this rules provision on Twitter: Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., who has taken on a higher profile due to his bid to become the next Democratic National Committee chairman. "House GOP rules package bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal," Ellison tweeted on Jan. 5, 2017. It was retweeted more than 2,400 times and received 1,600 likes. The House rules package governs how the U.S. House of Representatives handles its basic procedures for the two-year duration of a congressional session. We wanted to know if it really contained what Ellison said. Spoiler alert: It doesn’t, as Ellison’s office now acknowledges. What the rules package says The passage in question can be found here in section 3, subsection h. The provision is laden with jargon, but the gist is this: The rules package established a new requirement for CBO to undertake an unusually long-term analysis for legislation, and then specifically freed the ACA repeal from this type of analysis. The rules package says that "the Director of the Congressional Budget Office shall, to the extent practicable, prepare an estimate of whether a bill or joint resolution reported by a committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations) ... would cause, relative to current law, a net increase in direct spending in excess of $5 billion in any of the four consecutive 10-fiscal year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 fiscal years after the current fiscal year." According to the rule, any bills flagged as adding to the deficit by this required CBO analysis would be considered out of order, effectively sidelining them. However, the rules package went on to list a specific exception to this requirement, including repealing or reforming the Affordable Care Act or a portion of the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010. These were the two legislative vehicles that were used to enact President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. What the provision actually means But while Ellison tweeted that the package "bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal," it actually doesn’t say CBO can’t analyze the law’s costs. Rather, the provision in the rules package lifts the requirement that CBO track the cost of repeal or reform over the unusually long period mandated by the rules provision -- that is, 50 years after the first year CBO measures. Analyses over more typical -- and shorter -- time periods are not barred. "People have misinterpreted this exemption to conclude that CBO wouldn't provide a cost estimate for ACA legislation at all," said Ed Lorenzen, a senior advisor to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a former senior aide to House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland. "But the exemption only applies to the new requirement for additional information regarding long-term costs in CBO estimates of legislation." The Congressional Budget Act requires a cost estimate covering the next 10 years for all legislation considered by Congress, he said, and "the rules package doesn’t change that." Lorenzen added that the rules package doesn’t prevent CBO from making a long-term analysis of the costs of an ACA repeal — it just says that doing such an analysis isn’t mandatory. "There’s obviously a difference between saying something is not required and actually prohibiting it," Lorenzen said. "There’s reason to believe that CBO would probably provide information about a ballpark estimate of budgetary effects of legislation related to the Affordable Care Act beyond the 10-ten year window even without a requirement to do so, given the magnitude of the impact and interest among members of Congress in the long term budgetary effects of the ACA." Lorenzen said that he and his organization would have opposed a provision of the type Ellison assumes in his tweet. "But that’s not what’s happening here," he said. Donald Wolfensberger, a former House Rules Committee aide who is now a scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, agreed with Lorenzen’s analysis. "This is a new point of order and exemption from it, and implicitly does not alter existing budget rules and requirements, including the ability of CBO to make cost estimates," Wolfensberger said. Ellison’s office backed off after PolitiFact relayed Lorenzen’s analysis and acknowledged that the interpretation in the tweet was incorrect. Our ruling Ellison tweeted that the "House GOP rules package bars CBO from counting spikes in deficit spending spurred by an ACA repeal." In reality, the rules package doesn’t bar CBO analysis of ACA repeal proposals. Rather, the rules package says that CBO is not required to conduct an extra-long-term analysis that goes 50 years into the future, although the office could do one if it wants. It also doesn’t prevent CBO from doing the more typical, 10-year analyses it does for proposed bills. We rate the statement False.

Greg Abbott recently celebrated the 2015 Texas legislative session, which ended last June, as the "most conservative ever." Abbott, rousing delegates to the Republican Party of Texas convention in Dallas, said in his May 2016 address: "As just one example, we passed the fewest laws in 20 years, proving that better government doesn’t have to be more government." Setting aside what this proves or not, we wondered if indeed the 2015 Legislature approved the fewest pieces of legislation since 1995, 10 regular biennial sessions before. This didn’t take long to confirm; the Texas Legislative Reference Library presents relevant bill statistics for every regular and special session since 1879. And according to the library’s compilation, the 1,280 Texas House and Senate bills that made it into law in 2015 were the fewest since 1,063 measures made it into law in 1995, the first year of Republican George W. Bush’s tenure. Over the two decades, the next-lowest count of bills passed into law was 1,334 in 2003, followed by 1,354 in 2011 and 1,369 in 2005, according to the library. A few earlier sessions had low law counts (though, of course, Abbott’s claim didn’t reach to these years). Those 140-day sessions occurred in 1983 (1,092 bills-into-law); 1985 (979 bills-into-law); 1989 (1,264 bills-into-law); 1991 (924 bills-into-law); and 1993 (1,050 bills-into-law), according to the library. For this check, we didn’t count other indicators of legislative activity such as proposed constitutional amendments, which lawmakers place before voters (without a governor’s say). Our ruling Abbott said the 2015 Legislature "passed the fewest laws in 20 years." So it did, making this statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

We are adding that information to this report. Despite the new evidence, it still accounts for a small part of Romney's fortune, so our rating is unchanged. The King of Bain documentary tells viewers, again and again, that Mitt Romney is a very wealthy man. The video, released by a super PAC backing Newt Gingrich, flashes dollar signs and suitcases full of cash, along with images of Wall Street landmarks, to hammer home its Romney-as-corporate-raider message. Here, we’re looking into the film’s claim’s about Romney’s personal worth. At the end of the 28-minute film, white letters flash on a black background as somber piano music plays. "Romney’s own financial statement shows his personal fortune to be at least a quarter billion dollars." "No one knows for sure..." "The bulk of Mitt Romney’s personal wealth remains in blind trusts and overseas bank accounts." What we found is that some, but not all, of what’s in those statements is accurate. The size of his fortune Last year, Romney filed a financial disclosure Form 278 with the Office of Government Ethics, as required by all presidential candidates. It’s 28 pages long, listing bank accounts, mutual funds, stock holdings, speaker’s fees and more. That form only requires filers to select a range, for example between $100,001 and $250,000, for the value of each asset. King of Bain cites a Washington Post story that said the top end of the range of Romney’s wealth is $264 million. The low end is $85 million. In that same story, the Romney campaign told the Post that "a more accurate range" is between $190 million to $250 million. So the King of Bain narrator’s statement that Romney is now worth "somewhere over a quarter of a billion dollars" goes right for the high end of the range cited by the Washington Post. But the actual amount could be considerably less. Blind trusts and offshore accounts Romney’s disclosure form includes an attachment addressing the blind trust issue. It states: "Other than assets and income sources listed on page 1 of Schedule A, all of the assets listed in this Report are held by the W. Mitt Romney Blind Trust, the Ann D. Romney Blind Trust, Mr. Romney's IRA or Mrs. Romney's IRA (collectively, the 'Reporting Entities'). In each case, R. Bradford Malt, as Trustee (the 'Trustee'), has complete investment discretion over the assets held by these investment vehicles, except where the Trustee has delegated that discretion to third-party investment managers. "The management of the assets of the Reporting Entities was deemed blind by the Massachusetts State Ethics Commission. Since January 1, 2003, neither Mr. Romney nor Mrs. Romney has had any control over any of the assets acquired or disposed of by the Reporting Entities and neither Mr. Romney nor Mrs. Romney has previously received any reports identifying specific assets currently held by any of the Reporting Entities." Politicians commonly put their money in blind trusts while they hold office to prevent conflicts of interest. If they don’t know what investments they own, they can’t pass laws benefiting themselves, the theory goes. Bill Allison, editorial director for the Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for openness in government, said that even though the rules aim to prevent self-dealing, they aren’t airtight. "I think a lot of times politicians with blind trusts do have a pretty good idea what they own," he said. News stories have raised questions about the "blindness" of Romney’s trust. Still, the intent of blind trusts is to avoid conflicts of interest. So the video is correct in stating that much of Romney’s wealth is in a blind trust -- all but about $1.5 million, according to the form. But what about offshore accounts? We asked Winning Our Future to provide us with support for that claim but didn't receive any. The evidence emerged when Romney released two years of his personal tax returns in January 2012. The documents showed he previously had a Swiss bank account -- $3 million that a trust in his wife’s name reported holding in a Swiss money-market account, according to a story in the New York Times. Malt, the trustee, told reporters that he had opened the account with the United Bank of Switzerland in 2003 and closed it in 2010. The Times said the interest it accrued in 2010, about $1,700, was reported on tax documents. Malt told reporters the account was opened ''for diversification.'' ''It is a bank account, nothing more, nothing less,'' he said, according to the Times. The tax returns also revealed investments in low-tax locales including the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Ireland and Luxembourg. But it’s impossible to tell how much of Romney’s fortune comes from his holdings in offshore funds and institutions, according to numerous news reports. "You really can’t determine where his wealth is from tax returns because they’re just reporting income," Allison said. Allison inspected Romney’s returns and noted that on his 2010 return, Romney reported $2.7 million in gross foreign income. That’s out of $27.3 million in total gross income. "The thing that jumped out at me is that his foreign income is just a fraction of his total," Allison said. He added that it’s possible that Romney has other foreign assets not reported on the tax return because they aren’t producing income. Romney’s financial disclosure form lists other investments held by firms in Europe, including PNB Paribas, in France, and Rabobank Nederland, which is Dutch. But that type of investment isn't different from holdings in many people's 401(k) retirement savings funds. Allison said that based on publicly available records, foreign assets and income do not "appear to be the bulk of his wealth." "But the forms that we’re looking at really aren’t designed to answer these kind of questions," Allison added. "And that’s the problem with the disclosures we require of our presidential candidates." Our ruling Winning Our Future’s movie puts Romney’s personal fortune at $250 million and says most of it "remains in blind trusts and overseas bank accounts." According to one analysis of Romney’s financial disclosure, his wealth may total $264 million -- but it may also be closer to $85 million. It’s clear that most of it has been held in blind trusts since 2003, which is common practice among elected officials to avoid conflicts of interest. But the super PAC didn't provide, and we didn't find, good evidence that "the bulk" of Romney’s money is in overseas accounts. His tax returns show he previously had a Swiss account and that he made almost $3 million in foreign income in 2010. But the tax returns and financial disclosures indicate that a relatively small share of Romney’s wealth is overseas. Taken all together, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-13712	Says Donald Trump promised "the mass deportation of Latino families."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/28/karen-bass/mass-deportation-latino-families/	U.S. Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has achieved one thing in the Democrats’ favor: He has united them with divisive policies. "Donald Trump, when you take pride in your outright ignorance of world affairs, when you promise the mass deportation of Latino families, when you dismiss officer-involved shootings of African-Americans, when you degrade women, Donald Trump, you unite us," Bass said on the third night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. That prompted us to revisit Trump’s comments about immigrants and deportations. Bass said Trump has promised to deport Latino families, but only characterizing those families as "Latino" misses an important distinction in Trump’s plans. Trump has promised to deport undocumented immigrants. Not all Latinos in the country are undocumented, and not all undocumented immigrants are Latino. That said, the majority of undocumented immigrants are from Latin American countries. Pew Research Center’s most recent estimates pegged the number of unauthorized immigrants in the nation at 11.3 million, or about 3.5 percent of the U.S. population. Mexicans account for about half of the unauthorized population, according to Pew. So what exactly has Trump said about mass deportations? Earlier on in his campaign, Trump said he would round up "in a very humane way" the millions of undocumented immigrants in the country and send them back to their native countries. In an interview that aired in September 2015 on CBS’ 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley pressed Trump about what he would do with the population. Pelley: "Eleven, 12 million illegal immigrants --" Trump: "Or whatever the number is." Pelley: "Still in the country, what do you do?" Trump: "If they've done well, they're going out and they're coming back in legally. Because you said it--" Pelley: "You're rounding them all up?" Trump: "We're rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And they're going to be happy because they want to be legalized. And, by the way, I know it doesn't sound nice. But not everything is nice." Trump has also discussed having a "deportation force" to remove undocumented immigrants from the country, though he’s also said he would let some come back legally. Trump stuck to the deportation plan for all undocumented immigrants in some of the GOP primary debates. During the CNN/Telemundo debate on Feb. 25, 2016, host Wolf Blitzer asked about his deportation force idea and whether his plan to let "good ones" back in amounted to amnesty. Trump said "we either have a country, or we don’t have a country." "We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally," he continued. "They will go out. They will come back -- some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine. They're going to get in line with other people." In March, Fox host Megyn Kelly asked Trump whether he told the New York Times editorial board in an off-the-record interview that he was "flexible" on his deportation plan. Trump said, "Not very flexible. No, not very flexible. ... But there's always give and take. ... But we need give and take in government. If you don't have give and take, you're never going to agree on anything." Change of heart? So Trump clearly has said he would seek to remove the 11 million or more undocumented immigrants. But he also has suggested he may be softening that position, without offering specifics. On a recent trip to Scotland, Trump said President Barack Obama "has mass deported vast numbers of people -- the most ever" and that Trump would have "not only the best policies, but I will have the biggest heart of anybody," Bloomberg Politics reported June 25. He said he would not label his approach "mass deportations." "No, I would not call it mass deportations," Trump told Bloomberg Politics. He said he would "get rid of a lot of bad dudes who are here." Trump’s campaign website contains no mention of deporting the entire undocumented population. Instead it focuses on the mandatory return of criminal aliens and nationwide use of the E-verify system, among other policies. Our ruling Bass said Trump has "promised mass deportation of Latino families." Off the bat, Bass’ attack is imprecise. She said Trump wants to deport Latino families, when he has not promised that exactly. He pledged to remove the undocumented population, which is certainly comprised of Latinos but is not exclusive to them. (And obviously, not all Latinos in the United States are here illegally.) The underlying issue is tough talk Trump offered earlier in his campaign about rounding up undocumented immigrants in the country and sending them back to their native countries — with the "good ones" able to come back, possibly. Trump reiterated that stance several times as journalists asked how it would work. But the Republican presidential nominee appears to have recently softened his view over the last month, and his official immigration plans don’t mention deporting undocumented families en masse. We rate Bass’ statement Half True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/568ac30a-79bf-4015-a2c1-0301adb3788e	None	Karen Bass	None	None	None	2016-07-28T01:39:57	2016-07-27	['None']

pomt-09131	"BP is setting up claims offices throughout the state."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/15/charlie-crist/bp-bringing-claims-centers-florida-charlie-crist-s/	Among the Gulf state governors, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist has been the most supportive, or maybe least critical, of the federal government's response to the Deepwater Horizon oil explosion. But that hasn't stopped him from tossing some jabs at perhaps an easier target -- BP. In an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley, Crist echoed comments by Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink that some Florida businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy because of BP's slow processing of claims. "We are demanding that they do better," Crist said on June 6, 2010. "And what I mean by that is that the attorney general, Bill McCollum, and I have asked former attorneys general Bob Butterworth and Jim Smith to set up a task force of lawyers in order to be prepared for additional compensation when that becomes necessary. And we are pretty certain that it will. We have some of the best attorneys in the country here in Florida. And they have dealt with issues like this in the past, some other maritime issues that we have had to be faced with. So we are putting that together. "But in the near term -- in the short-term, if you will, we want these claims to be responded to much more quickly. BP is setting up claims offices throughout the state. But we want them to answer those claims more rapidly, because these people need help. And we have to be there to try to make them as whole as we can during this very difficult process. There are a lot of businesses impacted by it. It is not just restaurateurs and the hoteliers, it's fishermen, it's oyster fishermen and a lot of people along the coast who really depend on the Gulf of Mexico for their very livelihood." With the oil spill continuing to threaten Florida, we wanted to check Crist's statement about the claims process, specifically if BP has set up offices throughout Florida. Under federal law, BP is obligated to pay for the cost to clean up the spill. But its liability is limited to $75 million when it comes to paying economic damage claims from businesses and people affected by the spill. BP has said it will pay all "legitimate" claims, even those beyond the $75 million cap, and some Democrats in Congress are considering whether to lift the $75 million cap and apply it to BP retroactively. BP has organized an extensive process to manage economic damage claims. The company announced on June 15 that it has paid out $16 million to businesses that have filed claims in excess of $5,000, and already issued 25,000 claims checks totalling $63 million. By June 20, BP says it will have paid out $85 million. Claims are coming in through BP's website, www.bp.com/claims and through a 1-800 number, company officials say. As Crist suggested, BP also has set up 25 claims centers scattered around the affected areas. There are 10 claims centers in Florida, more than any other state (Louisiana has seven, Alabama has five and Mississippi has three). Eight of the 10 Florida claims centers are clustered in the Panhandle, between Escambia County and Wakulla counties. The other two centers are in the Florida Keys in Key West and Marathon. You can see a complete list here. (If you're considering filing a claim in person, BP asks that you first get a claim number by calling 1-800-440-0858.) Crist said "BP is setting up claims offices throughout the state," to help process economic damage claims from businesses and people affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion. BP has opened 10 claims centers in Florida, more than in any other state. Crist's use of the word "throughout," kind of has us stumbling a bit. The claims centers are concentrated primarily in the Panhandle, with two others in the Florida Keys. There are no centers between Cedar Key and Naples on the west coast of the state and none on the east coast. While it is true that reports of oil have been concentrated to the Panhandle and the Keys, the spill has the potential to impact all parts of the state, regardless how close the oil is to the shore. Trying to balance it all out, we rate Crist's statement Mostly True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-06-15T15:25:41	2010-06-06	['None']

pomt-06473	The health care law was "a 2,733-page bill! . . . No amendments!"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/18/joe-pitts/pitts-healthcare-long-no-amendments/	Continuing their battle against the health care overhaul, a group of Republican congressmen held a press conference on Oct. 5, 2011, outside the Capitol, waving a petition they say was signed by 1.6 million Americans calling for a repeal of the law. The Washington Post’s Dana Milbank, in an Oct. 6 column, criticized the Republicans for dithering about the past rather than enacting job-creating legislation that could better position their party to take back the White House next November. Milbank plucked verbal nuggets from several GOP lawmakers, concluding with a truncated quote from Rep. Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania. "Monstrous!" contributed Rep. Joe Pitts (Pa.). "This was a 2,733-page bill! . . . No amendments! . . . Partisan vote!" The entire quote, which we found in a transcript of the press conference, goes like this: "This was a 2,733-page bill that went directly from Harry Reid's desk to the Senate floor, bypassed Senate committee, no amendments, passed on a partisan vote, directly from the Senate floor to the House floor, bypass the committees, no amendments, passed on a partisan vote, without one member having read this bill." A lot of claims are packed into that one sentence, but we thought we’d dig into just a couple of them. One, is the bill really that long? And two, were there no amendments at all during its long road to passage? The page count We asked Pitts’ office where the 2,733 came from, and his spokesman said Pitts was referring to "how long the bill was the week it was considered in the House." According to the Library of Congress, which catalogs all versions of the different bills, the one that passed the Senate in December 2009 numbers 2,409 pages. The following March, the House passed the same bill and both chambers passed a reconciliation bill that modified the law (and appeased Democrats in the House). It numbers 55 pages. Added up, the total is 2,464. Pitts’ spokesman acknowledged that the law is shorter now, but said "if you go back to March 2010, you can find a number of contemporary references to the bill as numbering 2,700 pages." We looked at other versions of the bill but could not find any that had that number. Still, while Pitts is off slightly because of different versions and how the document is broken into pages, his underlying point is right: It was a very long bill. No amendments? Whether the bill had no amendments is a much trickier claim. If you remember your Civics 101 class (and Schoolhouse Rock), you might recall how a bill becomes law: Usually, the House and Senate pass different versions of a bill, then they work out their differences in a conference committee. A unified bill comes out of that committee, and both bodies vote again on the new bill. Then the president signs it. For the health care bill, back in 2009, the House and Senate had each passed different versions. It was widely expected the two bills would be stitched together in conference committee, then voted on again. But before that could happen, the Democrats lost their 60-seat, filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. (Republican Scott Brown in January 2010 won the seat formerly held by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.) Anything that came out of conference committee at that point could have been held up in the Senate, blocked by 40 Republican senators. Democrats decided to get around this by having the House simply accept the Senate’s version of the bill. Obama signed that version into law. Then the Democrats used a different measure -- a reconciliation bill, which requires only a simple majority -- to modify the law they had passed. The House version of the bill -- the one that never made it to conference committee -- did have amendments, particularly as it was considered by committees. In fact, Pitts himself offered one of them, a provision restricting abortion coverage. (It was better known as the Stupak amendment because it was co-sponsored by Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich.) Several Senate versions of the bill also had amendments. But Pitts is right that the Senate version -- the one voted on in December that became the basis of the new law -- did not have amendments. This is because Sen. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, decided to create a new version of the bill in the form of a manager’s amendment. At that point in the process, negotiations with Senate Republicans had gone on for months, and it seemed very likely that none of the Republicans were going to support the Senate bill, with amendments or not. We should note that President Barack Obama claimed back in September 2009 that legislation in the works was bipartisan. At the time, we rated his characterization Barely True. (It would now be called Mostly False.) The two parties were never very close together on what a new health care law should include. Our ruling Pitts said, "This was a 2,733-page bill that went directly from Harry Reid's desk to the Senate floor, bypassed Senate committee, no amendments, passed on a partisan vote, directly from the Senate floor to the House floor, bypass the committees, no amendments, passed on a partisan vote, without one member having read this bill." As far as the number of pages go, Pitts is largely correct. If we’re going to put an official page count on the bill, we would put it at 2,464, but we recognize that the bill had several different versions as it was on its way to becoming a law. As for "no amendments," Pitts is right as it related to the floor passage of the Senate bill. There were no amendments to the bill that passed. But that’s like describing only the last two minutes of a football game. What about the other 58? The health care bill began in committee in both chambers of Congress, as virtually all bills do. There was ample opportunity to amend it, and the bill was in fact amended by both Democrats and Republicans, if only mostly on technicalities by the party opposed to it. But Pitts made a blanket statement that there were "no amendments," without taking the earlier part of the process into account. Given all that, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-05869	"Statistics bear out that any time a country, a state, makes more restrictive abortion laws ... fatalities go up and abortions actually increase."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/feb/10/nickie-antonio/nickie-antonio-says-restrictive-abortion-laws-actu/	While GOP lawmakers focused their energy last year on abortion legislation, some have fought those laws with similar conviction. Rep. Nickie Antonio, a freshman lawmaker from Lakewood, has been among the steady voices in opposition to Republicans’ anti-abortion efforts. Antonio recently attempted to contrast the GOP’s agenda with a resolution to designate a week in January as "Reproductive Rights Awareness Week." The aim of the resolution is to promote public awareness and support "reproductive rights and justice." During a Jan. 24 news conference to announce the resolution, Antonio talked about the dangers associated with restrictive abortion laws. "Statistics bear out that any time a country, a state, makes more restrictive abortion laws — restricts women’s access to comprehensive reproductive health care — fatalities go up and abortions actually increase," Antonio said. Abortion is an emotional issue that has been a persistent topic of discussion as Ohio lawmakers have considered several abortion-related bills for the last year-plus. Antonio’s statement raised PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity because she was suggesting that the anti-abortion bills Ohio Republicans have supported would actually cause an increase in abortions. Since the beginning of last year, Republican lawmakers who control the Senate and the House of Representatives have approved a late-term abortion ban and legislation that makes it more difficult for minors to obtain abortions without their parents’ permission. The late-term ban prohibits abortions when a pregnancy is 20 weeks along unless a doctor determines a fetus cannot live outside the womb — a condition known as viability. The House of Representatives also has approved a controversial "heartbeat bill" which would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected. The Senate has not yet voted on the measure. PolitiFact Ohio contacted Antonio’s office for evidence to back up her claim. Her staff cited a recent study published Jan. 19 in The Lancet, a British medical journal published since 1823. The study, "Induced abortion: incidence and trends worldwide from 1995 to 2008," examined abortion rates and the corresponding abortion laws on a country-by-country basis. The study, authored by Gilda Sedgh of the Guttmacher Institute in New York, addressed international abortion laws and, to an extent, fatalities related to abortion. It concluded that restrictive abortion laws did not coincide with lower abortion rates; that rates were higher in regions of the world where abortion is illegal. The study’s findings do not connect restrictive abortion laws to fewer abortions. But neither does the study show that these laws lead to more abortions, as Antonio claimed. Sedgh said in an e-mail that the Lancet study did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between restrictive abortion laws and abortions. She said lower abortion rates in countries with liberal abortion laws could be attributed to easier access to affordable contraception. "In other words, the abortion laws don’t cause the abortion rates," she wrote in an e-mail. "The abortion laws appear to be irrelevant when it comes to what women do in the face of an unintended pregnancy." Regarding fatalities, the study said nations with more liberal abortion laws tend to see fewer health consequences from unsafe abortion. It cited a drop in abortion mortality in South Africa when its law was liberalized, and in Nepal after the country made abortion legal on broad grounds. The Lancet study did not examine abortion laws of individual states. In fact, one of the study’s authors said Ohio would still be considered to have "liberal" abortion laws if it passed the controversial heartbeat bill. "So, even if that legislation were passed, Ohio would be classified as having a liberal abortion law. The gestational limit would however, be somewhat severe compared to those in other countries with liberal laws," Sedgh wrote in an e-mail. PolitiFact Ohio checked further with advocates on both sides of the abortion issue for guidance about the impact of states’ abortion laws. Michael Gonidakis, executive director of Ohio Right to Life, said Antonio’s claim is baseless because Ohio’s abortion rate has been declining for the last 10 years. The Ohio Department of Health’s most recent annual report on abortions confirms the number of abortions has declined each year from 2001 (37,464) to 2010 (28,123). Gonidakis’ point, however, does not directly address Antonio’s claim because the statistics he cited predate the anti-abortion laws, passed last year, that have driven the current abortion debate in Columbus. Jaime Miracle, the policy director for NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, said she knows of no studies that examined states’ abortion laws and their corresponding abortion rates. "The problem is there really isn’t domestic research on that," she said. Miracle, who attended the Jan. 24 news conference with Antonio, said The Lancet study and others support Antonio’s general claim – that restricting access to abortion and reproductive health care does not reduce incidents of abortion. But that does not mean those restrictive laws increase abortion rates, and we did not find research that reached such a conclusion. Miracle provided us with a copy of a study by Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good. The 2008 study looked at the effect of socioeconomic factors on abortion. "There is little evidence that state policies restricting access to abortion (such as enforced informed and parental consent laws and partial birth abortion legislation affect the abortion rate," the study said. So where does that leave Antonio’s claim that when abortion restrictions are enacted, fatalities go up and abortions actually increase? Her statement contains an element of truth. The study her staff cited from The Lancet did find that restrictive abortion laws did not coincide with lower abortion rates and that rates tended to be higher in countries where abortion is illegal. Regarding fatalities, the study noted that abortion mortality in one country, South Africa, dropped as the country’s abortion laws became less restrictive. In Nepal, abortion mortality fell as abortion became legal. But the study did not specifically say that more restrictive laws drive up abortion rates and fatalities, as Antonio claimed. One of the study’s authors, in fact, specifically said the study did not establish that cause-and-effect relationship and that other factors were in play. Nor did the study look at abortion rates and fatalities for individual states -- something Antonio mentioned in her statement. Those are critical facts that would give a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, Antonio’s claim rates Mostly False.	None	Nickie Antonio	None	None	None	2012-02-10T06:00:00	2012-01-24	['None']

pomt-13474	Barack Obama has "doubled our national debt. Doubled it. It's going to be close to $20 trillion when he leaves."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/sep/12/donald-trump/trump-solely-blames-obama-doubling-debt/	Donald Trump says this White House is leaving behind a lot of red ink. "Barack Obama has doubled, during his fairly short period of years, he’s doubled our national debt. Doubled it. It’s going to be close to $20 trillion when he leaves," Trump told supporters at a Sept. 6 rally in Virginia Beach. Did Obama double the national debt? We checked. The Trump campaign’s press office justified his statement by sending us a link to U.S. Treasury Department figures on the size of the national debt. On Jan. 20, 2009, the day Obama took office, the total national debt stood at $10.6 trillion. On Sept. 6, the day Trump made his statement, it was $19.5 trillion. Over the past year the debt has grown by more than $1 trillion, so Trump’s estimate that the debt will be "close to $20 trillion" by the time Obama’s term ends in January is reasonable and is close to doubling the amount from when the president entered office. These indebtedness figures take into account all obligations, including about $5.4 trillion in intergovernmental debt that the U.S. government owes itself, such as the Social Security and Medicare trust funds that are invested in Treasury securities. When looking at the size of the U.S. debt, some experts prefer tallying just the amount of debt held by the public in Treasury bills, savings bonds and obligations to foreign governments, because that’s the debt the government owes to outside entities. But even by that measure, the debt has risen sharply. Public debt this month stands at $14.1 trillion, a figure that’s more than double the $6.3 trillion total when Obama took office. But Trump’s statement implies that Obama is solely to blame for the rise in the debt, and that misses a key part of the story. While Obama proposes spending and signs it into law, all of the spending bill first must pass Congress. In other words, the rise in the debt is not a solo act by Obama. Other factors beyond elected officials’ actions contributed to the debt increase. Robert Bixby, executive director of the centrist Concord Coalition, told our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin in July that given the fact that Obama took office as the Great Recession sapped government revenues, the debt "would have exploded certainly during (Obama’s) first term, no matter who was president." Our ruling Trump said Obama "doubled the national debt. Doubled it. It’s going to be close to $20 trillion when he leaves." The figures are correct, and we don’t doubt the president shares some of the blame for the increased indebtedness. But Trump’s statement leaves out some key points. First of all, the added debt wasn’t solely the responsibility of Obama; Congress had to approve it as well. And the recession that began before Obama took office in 2009 cut government revenues and led to some of the higher debt incurred during the president’s term. We rate Trump’s claim Half True.

pomt-04568	Says "One of the state’s largest governments made charging this tax one of their top priorities just this year."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/sep/25/Yes-on-79/did-city-portland-make-charging-real-estate-transf/	The chief backers of Ballot Measure 79 submitted a voters’ pamphlet statement this summer brimming with reasons to enshrine a ban on real estate transfer taxes in the Oregon Constitution. The tax is already prohibited in Oregon, with the exception of Washington County, but advocates want to make sure the state doesn’t implement a tax or allow local governments to impose one. The reasons put forth by the Oregon Association of Realtors basically boil down to this: Home prices are down, property taxes are high enough, and you don’t want another tax that would make it harder to buy or sell a home. The group also plants a bug of fear in tax haters with this: "Politicians have considered the idea of charging or allowing multiple layers of transfer taxes each and every legislative session for the last decade, and in fact one of the state’s largest governments made charging this tax one of their top priorities just this year." (our emphasis) Obviously, we wanted to know which large government made charging this tax a priority. Who was it and what happened? (Was it the tax-happy city of Portland?) We contacted the Realtors’ association and received a response from Jon Coney, spokesman for the Yes on 79 campaign, previously known as Protect Oregon Homes. It turns out the campaign was indeed talking about the city of Portland. As evidence that this large government body had "made charging this tax" a top priority this year, Coney shared a draft of the 2012 Legislative Agenda for the city of Portland. An agenda! We got a copy of the final agenda. One of seven items on it was to "strongly oppose any legislation that would preempt the City’s authority and support legislation that proposes to lift preemptions." Preemption, for those who don’t know, is when a superior government body regulates in a given area and pretty much trumps a lesser government’s ability to do the same. The state trumps cities, and the feds trump states. Cities and counties generally dislike preemption, because it usually ties their ability to raise revenue, also known as taxes and fees. Two particularly vexing subject areas -- taxing cigarettes and alcohol, and levying real estate transfer fees -- are indeed specified as examples in the city’s 2012 legislative agenda. That’s all accurate. But we asked Coney how supporting flexibility to be able to maybe one day pass a real estate transfer tax -- along with higher alcohol and cigarette taxes, if you follow the group’s reasoning -- is the same as making the imposition of such a tax a top priority this year? He said he didn’t want to get into a fight over semantics, but one leads to the other. "It’s pretty clear for us, in 2012, putting this on their legislative agenda clearly is a strong signal that they want to pursue this taxing mechanism," Coney said. Are the two acts one and the same? He said, "It is our position that asking that the (prohibition) be lifted is essentially leading to the institution of the real estate tax." So this is the evidence the campaign provides for making the claim that the city of Portland made charging this tax a top priority this year: A legislative agenda in which the tax is given as an example among several examples on one issue out of seven. And by the way, legislation wasn’t even drafted. And the Realtors know this. Maybe we missed talk of a real estate transfer tax somewhere? At a city council meeting at some point? Nope, the campaign can provide no other evidence. They can, however, point to previous legislative attempts, which got nowhere. "I don’t remember it being raised," said Nick Fish, the city commissioner in charge of housing. "It’s been on a laundry list of preemptions we object to on principle. Other than this campaign brought by Realtors, I don’t even remember a conversation about the real property tax in the last year or two." We asked Martha Pellegrino, lead lobbyist for the city of Portland, if the city would go ahead with a transfer tax if the prohibition were lifted. The answer is no, she said: "Just because the state repeals a preemption of local authority does not mean that the City, or any other local government, would automatically act." We’re certain some of you don’t care what Pellegrino or Fish -- or any other government official says -- they will or won’t do. And it’s absolutely accurate to say that Portland officials could levy a tax on every transfer of property as soon as the pesky state prohibition is gone. But the only evidence the campaign provides is a legislative agenda for a short legislative session in which no legislation was drafted. How does that translate into making "charging this tax one of their top priorities just this year?" It doesn’t. And that makes the statement both inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Yes on 79	None	None	None	2012-09-25T17:59:33	2012-08-20	['None']

pomt-14729	Says American polling shows Russian President Vladimir Putin has "an 80 percent approval rating."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-about-putins-popularity-russia/	Russian President Vladimir Putin recently called Donald Trump "brilliant" and "talented," and Trump wears those compliments as a badge of honor. On NBC’s Meet the Press on Dec. 20, host Chuck Todd asked the real estate mogul and Republican presidential front runner why he is so comfortable praising Putin, noting that Trump has called Putin a "strong leader." "He is a strong leader. What am I going to say, he’s a weak leader?" Trump responded. "He’s making mincemeat out of our president." Then Trump turned to his reliable measure of a person’s success: the polls. "He’s got an 80 percent approval rating done by pollsters from, I understand, this country. Okay?" Trump said. "So it’s not even done by his pollsters. He’s very popular within Russia; that may change." An 80 percent approval rating is pretty darn high. For comparison, President Barack Obama’s job approval rating is currently about 46 percent and peaked at 64 percent in February 2009, his second month in office, according to Pew Research Center. So we wondered if Trump is correct that American polling shows Putin has such a high rating among the Russian people. In a first for Trump on the Truth-O-Meter thus far, he is. By the numbers A November study written by four American researchers backs up Trump’s point, finding about 80 percent of Russians really support Putin. "What Trump said is consistent with what we found," said Scott Gehlbach, a co-author of the study and a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Given that Putin achieved strikingly high public approval ratings, the study asked whether Putin’s popularity is real or if respondents have been lying to pollsters. A primary concern for the researchers was the possibility of "social desirability bias," the idea that a person who does not support Putin might tell a pollster that they do support him out of fear of retaliation or going against social norms. To correct for this, the researchers used a list experiment, a technique used to broach sensitive issues because it does not require respondents to say explicitly that they do or do not support Putin. Pollsters gave Russian respondents a list of several Russian leaders and asked how many they support, but not which ones. By comparing the difference between a control group, which was presented with a list that did not include Putin, with a group that received a list that did include Putin, the researchers were able to estimate overall support for the Russian president. After conducting four list experiments in January and March of this year, Gehlbach and his co-authors concluded that the high level of support for Putin is real. If anything, their finding of 80 percent support might be an underestimate. Gehlbach noted, though, that the study did not account for how many of the 80 percent are devout supporters versus those whose support is fleeting. Further, it’s likely that the Kremlin manipulates public opinion of Putin through tight control of the media. "It’s reasonable that some people support Putin because of what they see on the evening news," Gehlbach said. This study is evidence that Putin is genuinely popular in Russia, wrote Joshua Tucker, a political science professor at New York University, in a Nov. 24 post on the Washington Post’s Monkey Cage blog. In sum, "the findings suggest both that the West will likely be dealing with a popular leader when it interacts with Putin in the days to come," Tucker wrote. One potential wrinkle in Trump’s claim is that while the American researchers designed the study, a Russian polling company, the Levada Center, actually conducted the survey. But Gehlbach said that doesn’t dilute Trump’s claim because the Levada Center is well-regarded as independent from the Russian government. Karlyn Bowman, a public opinion expert and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, also said the Levada Center is held in high regard and its findings are consistent with related research by the U.S.-based Pew Research Center. This past summer, Pew found 88 percent of Russians "have confidence in (Putin), to do the right thing regarding world affairs." Putin’s standing is substantially lower among Americans, with just 21 percent saying they have confidence in him. Gehlbach’s article, which will be published in the journal Post-Soviet Affairs, also mentions how Putin’s high approval ratings are often confirmed by Western researchers’ polls. The study cites an Associated Press-NORC at the University of Chicago poll that found Putin’s approval rating to be about 81 percent in 2014. Our ruling Trump said American polling shows Russian President Vladimir Putin has "an 80 percent approval rating." Multiple American polls have found Putin’s approval rating to hover around 80 percent among the Russian public, including a recent study that aimed to adjust for any possibility that respondents have been lying to pollsters out of fear or social expectations.

pomt-13360	Says Tom Nelson "backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/30/mike-gallagher/house-race-mike-gallaghers-false-claim-about-tom-n/	The competitive race for an open congressional seat in the Green Bay area has been marked by attack ads on Social Security. Democrat Tom Nelson and Republican Mike Gallagher are vying in the Nov. 8, 2016 election to succeed Reid Ribble, a Republican who decided not to run for a fourth term. The Rothenburg and Gonzales Political Report, as well as the Cook Report, both recently shifted the race from "toss up" to "leans Republican." On Sept. 1, 2016, Nelson, the Outagamie County executive, released a TV ad accusing Gallagher of having a plan that would "cut Social Security benefits for two-thirds of seniors." Our rating was Half True. Gallagher, a former U.S. Marine and former congressional aide, has not made such a proposal. However, he has praised a proposal that would make those cuts, saying he is most influenced on Social Security by the proposal’s author. On Sept. 12, 2016, it was Gallagher’s turn. He released a TV ad accusing Nelson of having "backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million." Let’s see how this one rates. 2005 votes Gallagher points to a vote that Nelson, then a member of the Wisconsin Assembly, took on the 2005-’07 state budget -- a 394-page document with thousands of figures and provisions. One provision in the budget, which was adopted by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, eliminated state income taxes on Social Security benefits. So, despite Gallagher’s claim, there was not a proposal for higher taxes on Social Security. But eliminating the tax did save Wisconsin Social Security recipients an estimated $99.7 million per year, roughly what Gallagher claimed, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Nelson voted against the budget. But does that mean he voted against the Social Security provision it contained? When voting on something as huge as a state budget, a lawmaker could vote no for any number of reasons having to do with spending, policies or other factors. In other words, a no vote on the overall budget doesn’t mean a lawmaker opposed every single provision, or even any particular provision. Nelson has said he voted no because the budget reduced funding for education. The budget didn’t actually reduce funding for public schools. It added $458 million over the two-year period. But the amount was less than half of the $938 million increase advocated by Doyle, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported at the time. There’s one more point -- a significant one. Nelson voted for an amendment that added the repeal of the tax on Social Security benefits to the budget. So, he was for the repeal, even though he voted against the overall state budget that ultimately accomplished the repeal. Gallagher’s campaign called it a "show" vote. But unlike the budget, it was an up-or-down vote on a single provision and, as such, gives a clearer idea of his position. Our rating Gallagher says Nelson "backed higher taxes on Social Security, costing Wisconsin seniors $95 million." Nelson voted against the 2005-’07 state budget, which ended the state income tax on Social Security benefits, saving seniors more than $95 million per year. But that’s not the same as backing higher taxes on Social Security, something that was not even on the table. And a vote against the overall state budget doesn’t mean Nelson opposed eliminating the tax on Social Security benefits. Indeed, he voted for the amendment that added that provision to the budget.

pomt-14402	Says Hillary Clinton told the Des Moines Register on Aug. 8, 2015: "I will get the NRA shut down for good if I become president. If we can ban handguns, we will do it."	pants on fire!	/iowa/statements/2016/mar/14/viral-image/viral-photo-fabricates-hillary-clinton-quote-guns/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton explicitly stated her plans to "shut down" the National Rifle Association and expressed hope at banning handguns in an interview with The Des Moines Register last summer. At least, that’s according to a viral image that first cropped up on an anti-Clinton Tumblr blog and has been shared widely on Facebook. "I will get the NRA shut down for good if I become president. If we can ban handguns, we will do it," the post quotes Clinton as telling the Register on Aug. 8, 2015. But here’s the thing: The quote is wholly fabricated. Clinton was never quoted in the Register making that statement, and it appears she has not made such a statement anywhere else. Clinton campaigned heavily in Iowa throughout the summer and fall of 2015, and Register reporters and the paper’s editorial board interviewed her several times. But she was not in Iowa on Aug. 8, when she allegedly made the statement. Clinton’s first visit to Iowa in the month of August occurred on Aug. 14, followed by public events on Aug. 15 and Aug. 26. A review of the Register’s archives show Clinton was neither interviewed nor quoted directly on Aug. 8 or in the days immediately following. Clinton did make several statements regarding gun control on the Iowa campaign trail that were covered by the Register. In all of them, she laid out an agenda that calls for broader background-check requirements, including sales at gun shows, as well as stronger measures to prevent gun purchases by domestic abusers and people with serious mental health problems. "I'm going to speak out against the uncontrollable use of guns in our country because I believe we can do better than that," Clinton said in Iowa in July. "A majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners agree with universal background checks to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and people who are mentally unstable and even terrorists." On Aug. 26 in Ankeny, she responded to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia: "We've got to do something. It's a very difficult political issue. But we are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths," she said. She went on, "If guns weren't so readily available, if we had universal background checks, if we could put some time out between the person who got fired, or domestic abuse, or whatever other motivation ... maybe we could prevent this kind of carnage." On Oct. 6, she described her views again, in response to a mass shooting in Oregon: "I feel like this is unfinished business in our country, and I am very determined that we are going to try to bring some sanity back, so that people's Second Amendment rights are protected — but they are not absolute, the way the NRA wants them to be," Clinton said at an event in Davenport. "There are common-sense ways to make sure people are not using guns to commit mass murders." Gun control came up again at an event in Sioux City on Dec. 4, after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. At that time, she expressed support for banning gun sales to people on federal "no-fly" lists. "I think we've got to be more willing to start imposing these kinds of gun-safety measures," Clinton said. "I'm certainly going to continue advocating for them." Internet searches for the quote found on the image refer only to the image itself — not to any original reporting from the Des Moines Register, another news outlet or to raw audio or video. Evidence of the quote does not appear to exist beyond what was originally posted on Tumblr. Our ruling A post spread via social media quotes Clinton as telling The Des Moines Register, "I will get the NRA shut down for good if I become president. If we can ban handguns, we will do it." Clinton was quoted in The Des Moines Register several times about gun control in the months leading up to the Iowa caucuses, but she did not say what the post accuses her of saying. Clinton has not advocated for shutting down the NRA or banning handguns outright. The claim is entirely fabricated. We rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-05741	Mitt Romney "left Massachusetts $1 billion in debt."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/02/red-white-and-blue-fund/ad-accuses-mitt-romney-leaving-massachusetts-1-bil/	An ad sponsored by the Red White and Blue Fund -- a pro-Rick Santorum super PAC -- attacks former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney over his record of fiscal stewardship while in office. The ad says that Romney "left Massachusetts $1 billion in debt." We decided to see if that was accurate. In the ad, the Red White and Blue Fund cites three articles that were included in an opposition-research document attributed to the campaign of Arizona Sen. John McCain, who faced Romney in the Republican presidential primary four years earlier. One of the articles ran in the Boston Globe on Dec. 30, 2006, during the transition period between the governorships of Romney, who didn’t seek reelection, and his successor, Democrat Deval Patrick. The Globe reported that aides to Patrick said the state "is facing a deficit that could reach $1 billion next year, a looming budget gap that observers say could force Patrick to scale back his ambitious agenda, slash spending, or raise taxes." The Globe reported that in a Nov. 27, 2006, briefing to Patrick, Romney aides projected a budget deficit of between $400 million and $1.1 billion for fiscal 2008, which was to begin in July 2007, six months into Patrick’s term. The total state budget at the time was $26 billion. So the ad has some justification for using the $1 billion figure. But based on our discussions with budget experts in the state, we find the ad ignores important details: • The number in question was a projection of a possible future budget deficit. It was an estimate, based on a snapshot of economic data, of what might happen, and it was offered to allow Patrick to figure out how to balance the budget for a fiscal year beginning more than six months later. It was not a final scorecard on Romney’s time as governor. In fact, about a month after the private briefing, Romney issued an updated projection that was more optimistic, based on healthier revenue projections. In the Globe article, aides to Patrick accused Romney of offering the public sunnier projections in public than they gave in private. But it eventually became clear that the revenue picture was indeed improving -- enough to allow Patrick to restore $383.6 million in emergency budget cuts Romney had made a month earlier. "The revenue did come in a bit better than planned, and ultimately Patrick presented a balanced budget," said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent budget think tank. Widmer informally advised Patrick’s transition team. "There was a tight budget, and it couldn’t fund some of the increases Patrick had proposed in the campaign, but it didn’t result in major cuts, either." • The ad’s use of the term "debt" is inaccurate. The figure cited in the 2006 briefing referred to a projected shortfall for one fiscal year. "Debt" in the budgetary context refers to the cumulative total of all past deficits, less surpluses. And this wasn't even a deficit -- it was a projected shortfall that state officials had to address in order to balance the budget. • Using the $1 billion figure means taking the high end of a range that begins at $400 million. • Massachusetts, like most states, has a requirement that the governor must submit, and the Legislature must pass, a balanced budget. So contrary to the ad’s suggestion, there was never an official deficit, much less one 10 digits in scope. And even if there had been a deficit that big, Romney wouldn’t get full blame. "The final budget document is the creation of the Massachusetts Legislature, which now has and did have a veto-proof Democratic majority during Romney’s reign," said Fred Bayles, director of the Boston University Statehouse Program. "Governors submit the first budget draft, which then goes through major changes in the Legislature. It is disingenuous for any governor to take the credit or blame for the final budget." Our ruling The ad says Romney "left Massachusetts $1 billion in debt." That is inaccurate or misleading in several ways. The Red, White and Blue fund cherry-picks the highest number from a range of estimates. Also, it was not a "debt." It was just one projected shortfall for the upcoming year -- and one that ultimately didn't materialize. Like most states, Massachusetts must have a balanced budget every year. And in keeping with that requirement, Patrick, the incoming governor, submitted a balanced budget within a few months. We rate the claim False.

pomt-01794	"Ninety percent" of people living in Gaza "don’t have access even to water."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/24/rula-jebreal/rula-jebreal-90-people-gaza-dont-have-access-even-/	Palestinian journalist Rula Jebreal slammed the U.S. media for "biased" coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict on July 21’s Ronan Farrow Daily. MSNBC had her back the next night on All In With Chris Hayes to talk about the balance between Israeli and Palestinian guests on major American news networks. We checked a claim from that back-and-forth here. Jebreal also took it upon herself to trumpet the news she says goes unreported in the United States. "Most Americans think, okay, Israelis are minding their own business and Palestine woke up one day in Gaza and said okay, let me fire missiles," Jebreal said. "That’s not what’s happening." "They don’t know anything about the siege, 1.8 million Palestinians living under siege in extreme poverty, with 90 percent that don’t have access even to water." By all accounts, the situation in Gaza is bad, but we were surprised to hear that so few people have access to water. Since bombings started We weren’t able to reach Jebreal, but we did get in touch with Juan Cole, a history professor at the University of Michigan who frequently sounds off on Middle Eastern politics and who Jebreal cited during her interview. In a blog post concurring with Jebreal’s assessment of the U.S. media, Cole wrote, "Israeli occupation has left 90% of people in Gaza without potable water." That’s already a step removed from Jebreal -- who didn’t distinguish between access to water, and access to drinking water. (The difference would be in having running water available for cooking and showering). Cole pointed us to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which pointed us to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs’ (OCHA) office in Palestine. Since July 7, when Israel began its military actions against Hamas, OCHA has published daily reports about the circumstances in the Gaza Strip. OCHA’s latest report, covering the period from July 21 to July 22, estimates that "1.2 million people have no or very limited access to water or sanitation services due to damage to the electricity system or lack of fuel to run generators" that provide water, sanitation, and hygiene. According to OCHA, Israel’s bombings are causing definite harm to Gaza’s water systems. The UN has been unable to reach several municipalities because of the threat of bombings, leaving them unable to repair 15 broken wells and six inoperative sewage pumping stages. The Municipality of Gaza reports that they’re pumping less than half the "required" water. With a population of 1.8 million, that means that roughly 67 percent of people living in the Gaza Strip could be classified as having "no or very limited access to water." That’s less than the 90 percent Jabreal claimed and does not account for people who may have limited access to water. Water potability So in the most literal reading, Jabreal is overstating the statistic. But another way to look at Jebreal’s claim is the way Cole said it, that 90 percent of people in Gaza lack access to potable water. That’s close to being accurate. The only natural source of fresh water in Gaza is an aquifer on the southern part of its coast, and according to a 2009 Amnesty International report, 90 to 95 percent of that water isn’t safe for drinking because of seawater, sewage, and runoff from agriculture. That statistic has since been corroborated by the UN. Before the current crisis, roughly 97 percent of households in Gaza had access to water coming from the aquifer, but that the aquifer alone cannot sustain the Gaza Strip. In April 2013, the head of the Palestinian Water Authority estimated that Palestinians purchase 56 million cubic meters of water a year for drinking to make up for what he calls a "severe shortage." And according to the UN, four-fifths of privately sold water isn’t sanitary. What does that all mean? People living in Gaza have access to potable water, but they have to buy it from an outside source. The natural aquifer that people living in Gaza have access to largely is unsafe for drinking. We should note that this problem began well before Israel began bombing. The UN sent Princeton professor Richard Falk to the Gaza Strip in 2013 to report on humanitarian concerns, and Falk wrote that "the Israeli blockade of Gaza has exacerbated water scarcity." Among other things, Falk said, Israel takes a "disproportionate share of water from the coastal aquifer," the Israeli-Palestine Joint Water Committee disproportionately rejects Palestinian proposals for water wells, and Israeli military operations often destroy existing Palestinian wells. Our ruling Jebreal claimed that "90 percent" of people living in Gaza "don’t have access even to water," in the course of arguing that a significant part of the Israel-Palestine situation goes unreported in the United States. Recent estimates suggest that about 67 percent of people living in Gaza currently have little or no access to running water, a figure lower than Jebreal claimed. But what's true is that 90 to 95 percent of the water from Gaza’s coastal aquifer (their only natural source of fresh water) isn’t suitable for drinking. Jebreal’s claim needs that caveat. As such, we rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Rula Jebreal	None	None	None	2014-07-24T15:04:45	2014-07-22	['None']

pomt-07268	The Paul Ryan budget proposal would leave the country "without Medicare."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/25/agenda-project/throw-granny-cliff-asks-what-country-would-be-with/	Amid discussion of the Medicare overhaul proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., an ad created by the Agenda Project, a liberal group, cut through the clutter quite dramatically -- though with critics saying it was literally over the top. The ad, set to "America the Beautiful," shows a man pushing an elderly woman in a wheelchair toward a scenic overlook. At first, the woman is happy, enjoying the sights. But then the man picks up the pace, veers past warning signs and rushes toward a cliff. When he reaches the edge, he tips over the wheelchair, and the woman falls dramatically over the ledge. The man walks calmly away. The ad contains no dialogue, so its point is made through a series of superimposed statements: "In 1965, Americans made Medicare into Law. Today, Medicare provides the health insurance for 46 million Americans. More than half of Americans on Medicare live on less than $28,000 a year. Now, Republicans want to privatize Medicare. Is America beautiful without Medicare?" We decided to check two claims in this ad. One, which we’ll look at in a different item, is whether the Ryan plan would "privatize Medicare." The other, which we’ll investigate here, is whether the Ryan budget proposal would leave the country "without Medicare." First, we’ll provide a summary of the Ryan plan, which was passed by the House in a near-party-line vote and which has more recently prompted some Republicans to oppose it, amid fears that voters will not be comfortable with its approach. Ryan’s plan would dramatically cut federal spending in the name of fiscal discipline. One of its major features is dramatically restructuring Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for those 65 and older. Right now, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries pay premiums for some types of coverage, and younger workers contribute payroll taxes. Ryan’s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would be insured by private insurance companies rather than the federal government, although they would receive "premium support" -- financial assistance from the government for buying insurance. People who need more health care would get a little more money. The proposal requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people the same age. The plans would comply with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67 and provides smaller premium support to high earners. We looked at this question before, in relation to an ad run by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats’ campaign arm. In part, the ad claimed that by passing the proposal in the House, Republicans had "voted to end Medicare." In conjunction with other misrepresentations, that formulation earned the ad a rating of Pants on Fire. We concluded that, while the Ryan plan represents a dramatic change in Medicare, it was not a proposal to "end" Medicare. Seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year although at a rate not expected to match the rise in medical costs. The government would still play a critical role in directing the program and setting standards. Many Democrats criticized our ruling, arguing that the Ryan proposal would change the program so fundamentally -- revoking its status as a government-run, single-payer system -- that the plan ends Medicare. As Erica Payne, the founder and president of the Agenda Project, put it, "While it is true that a rose by any other name will smell as sweet, a rose with no petals is just a thorny stick." But we disagree, because dramatically changing a program is not the same as ending it. When we contacted Payne for her view, she said that PolitiFact drew the wrong conclusion from the ad’s use of the phrase "without Medicare." To Payne, the question asks a broader philosophical question rather than making a statement about the Ryan plan. The ad "seeks to broaden the discussion around this specific issue by posing a question of national philosophy," Payne said. "‘Is America beautiful without Medicare?’ is a question all Americans should be discussing. In these budget-challenging times, it is critical to examine what we value most, and which of those things that we value are actually critical to our national pride, indeed to our identity. ... A lawmaker who believes our country is as ‘beautiful’ without Medicare would probably be more likely to support gutting the program to a shadow of its former self." We understand her argument, but we think a reasonable viewer -- especially having just "seen" an old lady being dumped over a cliff -- would take away a more concrete meaning to the question, namely that the Ryan plan ends Medicare. Because we found other problems in the DCCC ad that we did not find in the Agenda Project ad, we’re not giving this particular claim a Pants on Fire rating. But the notion that the Paul Ryan budget proposal would leave the country "without Medicare" merits a rating of False.

pomt-07392	"55 percent of the people who cast a provisional ballot (in Florida) in the last presidential election -- their vote did not count."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/may/02/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-criticizes-state-election-bill-cites-n/	U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson came to Tallahassee during the final week of the legislative session to oppose major changes to election law being considered by the House and Senate. We've written about the bills before. The House version, HB 1355, passed 79-37 on April 21, 2011, while the Senate bill, SB 2086, is awaiting a floor vote. Among many different provisions, the bills would no longer allow voters who have moved or changed their last name to update their information at the polls on Election Day. Instead, those voters would have to file provisional ballots that are reviewed after the election. Republicans say it's a way to eliminate possible voter fraud. But Democrats like Nelson say it's an way to suppress the votes of people most likely to change their names (women) and people most likely to move frequently (young people and college students). At a press conference with Democratic state legislators on May 2, Bay News 9 and Central Florida 13 reporter Troy Kinsey asked Nelson what was so wrong with people having to cast a provisional ballot. "Look at history," Nelson answered. "Look at the provisional ballots in 2008. Fifty-five percent of them were discounted. Fifty-five percent of the people who cast a provisional ballot in the last presidential election -- their vote did not count." We turned to the stats to see in Nelson was right. The Pew Center on the States, widely considered a nonpartisan source, studied the result of provisional ballots cast during the 2008 fall presidential election across all 50 states. They found that, in Florida, wide variation existed between counties on the percentage of provisional ballots that were allowed by local canvassing boards, as well as why ballots that were not counted were ultimately disallowed. More than 80 percent of provisional ballots cast in Duval County were counted, while less than 60 percent were counted in Hillsborough County. In South Florida, 34 percent of the provisional ballots were counted in Miami-Dade. In Broward County, just about 6 percent of the provisional ballots cast ultimately were counted in the results, Pew found. "The precise causes of these variations within Florida are unclear, but the reasons why these ballots were rejected provide a slightly more detailed picture," Pew wrote. "In Broward County, 100 percent of rejected provisional ballots were not counted because they were cast by voters not registered in the state. In Hillsborough County, more than 40 percent of rejected provisional ballots were rejected for being cast in the wrong precinct. Both Duval and Miami-Dade counties saw substantial numbers of rejected provisional ballots because voters’ eligibility could not be established." In total, Pew reported that 35,635 Florida voters submitted provisional ballots in the 2008 fall election (.42 percent of the total 8.4 million who cast ballots for president). Of the 35,635 ballots submitted, 17,314 were counted and 18,321 were not counted. To line that up with Nelson's claim, that means 51.4 percent of the provisional ballots submitted were not counted for one reason or another. We checked the Pew numbers with the Department of State and found just a slight discrepancy. The Department of State says 17,312 votes were counted -- two fewer votes than Pew reported -- but not enough to change the percentage of those who submitted provisional ballots but did not have them counted. State Department spokesman Chris Cate also provided us with provisional ballot statistics from the 2010 general election. They are worth noting because the percentage of provisional ballots ultimately discounted was cut in half when compared to 2008. In the 2010 fall election, local canvassing boards considered 13,181 provisional ballots. Canvassing boards wound up counting 9,790 of the votes and tossing out 3,391 provisional ballots -- or 25.7 percent of the total number of provisional ballots. Nelson said that "55 percent of the people who cast a provisional ballot (in Florida) in the last presidential election -- their vote did not count." Two slight clarifications: Nelson is slightly high on the percentage claim, and he fails to note that the percentage of provisional ballots counted improved greatly in 2010. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Bill Nelson	None	None	None	2011-05-02T14:48:31	2011-05-02	['None']
pomt-05521	Says New Jersey Devils managing partner Jeff Vanderbeek "froze all those monies during the toughest years in ‘08-’09" and "refused to give the charitable dollars that he was required to give by the contract."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/12/cory-booker/cory-booker-claims-devils-managing-partner-jeff-va/	Newark Mayor Cory Booker doesn’t know whether Jeff Vanderbeek was acting out of callous disregard or indifference, but the mayor claims the managing partner of the New Jersey Devils broke his legal obligation to provide funds to the city for charities and job training. A long-running feud between city and team officials over unpaid rent, parking revenues and other issues at the Prudential Center culminated last week in a decision from a panel of arbitrators. That decision leaves Newark owing about $600,000 to the Devils. A few days after denouncing Vanderbeek as a "high-class, high-falutin’ huckster and hustler," Booker continued his battle against the hockey team owner during an April 9 interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe program. "Not only did he make those promises, but he was required to do so by the contract," Booker said. "He froze all those monies during the toughest years in ‘08-’09, when our economy was falling out. He refused to give the charitable dollars that he was required to give by the contract." For the most part, the mayor’s claim is on solid ground, PolitiFact New Jersey found. As the legal dispute rolled on, the Devils did not make $1.5 million in combined payments over three years of the lease agreement for youth and community sports programs and job training programs, according to the arbitrators’ decision. But the hockey team did pay $346,576 toward those programs for the first year of the lease agreement, according to the decision. In a statement, Booker spokeswoman Anne Torres argued that "the $346,576 paid only represents a fraction of what is owed." "We’re disappointed that Politifact is choosing (to)...ignore the facts surrounding Jeff Vanderbeek’s decision to neglect his public commitments to the city," Torres wrote. "Year after year, the Devils have denied resources to charities and job training programs." Let’s explain how those programs factor into the lease agreement for the arena. Under a February 2005 lease agreement with the Newark Housing Authority, which owns the arena, the Devils agreed to pay rent consisting of four components. At the outset, two of those components were $250,000 annual payments for youth and community sports programs, as well as $250,000 annual payments for job training programs. The Devils paid $173,288 for each of the two sets of programs for the first year of the contract, which ran from October 2007 to June 2008, according to the arbitrators’ decision. The payments were smaller because the first payments applied to less than a full year. But as a result of the legal dispute, the Devils paid no rent in years two through four of the lease agreement, according to the arbitrators’ decision. The team was asserting its right to withhold rent under a clause in the lease agreement, the decision states. Arena spokesman Robert Sommer argued that both the city and the team were withholding payments to each other. "They withheld money as well," Sommer told us. "No payments were being made in either direction." Among other rent payments, the arbitrators determined that the Devils owe $1.5 million for the sports and job training programs for those three years. The hockey team also owes an additional $2,738 for the first year, according to the decision. But instead of getting money back, city officials end up owing money to the Devils, because of parking revenues and other issues addressed in the arbitrators’ decision. Our ruling In an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Booker claimed Vanderbeek "froze all those monies during the toughest years in ‘08-’09" and "refused to give the charitable dollars that he was required to give by the contract." According to the arbitrators’ decision, the Devils paid $346,576 toward youth and community sports programs and job training programs for the first year of the contract. But the hockey team did not pay $1.5 million in combined payments over the next three years of the contract. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-02740	"By using a little-known loophole ... Obama minions are allowing Nestle Company to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/dec/17/blog-posting/viral-blog-posts-say-obama-minions-are-allowing-co/	These days, President Barack Obama gets blamed for a lot of things -- the glitchy rollout of the healthcare.gov website, an unusually slow economic recovery, an out-of-control electronic surveillance network. But is he also at fault for selling off Lake Michigan’s water to the highest bidder? Several readers recently asked us to check a claim they had seen circulating on social media. The most commonly shared versions seems to have originated on the conservative blog Coach is Right and the website of the Western Center for Journalism, whose president is longtime conservative activist Floyd Brown. The post on the Western Center for Journalism’s site is headlined, "Barack Obama’s war on America’s fresh water supply." It reads: "By using a little-known loophole in the 2006 Great Lakes Compact, Obama minions are allowing Nestle Company to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan to the tune of an estimated $500,000 to $1.8 million per day profit. By draining the precious jewel of the Great Lakes in the middle of America, our federal water managers are allowing the export of our water out of our country across thousands of miles of oceans into the Asian basin plagued by huge population centers that are suffering from their constant lack of fresh water." We did not hear back from the Coach is Right site, but PolitiFact Ohio has previously looked at the question of water being removed from the Great Lakes and found that it was a genuine issue. It stems from an agreement known as the Great Lakes Compact. It was negotiated by and has the force of law in eight states -- Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (Two Canadian provinces are also involved in Great Lakes water policy decisions, but technically aren’t part of the compact.) The most important provision for this fact-check is its prohibition on diverting water from the Great Lakes basin -- with a key exception. That exception -- the "loophole" referred to in the blog post -- is that the compact permits the removal of water in containers of 5.7 gallons or less. The existence of this provision has enabled the bottled-water industry to construct major facilities in the Great Lakes basin, including one by Nestle Waters North America in Mecosta County, Mich. Because the compact was designed to regulate and preserve the Great Lakes -- one of the world’s great natural repositories of fresh water -- such commercial sales have been controversial. Peter Annin, author of The Great Lakes Water Wars, told PolitiFact Ohio that the provision was one of the most emotional issues during the compact’s negotiation. "Many people opposed the loophole during the negotiations, but each state included it anyway when they passed the legislation," said Melissa K. Scanlan, a professor at Vermont Law School who specializes in water law. Legislative fixes have been periodically floated in Congress, but none has yet advanced. So there’s no doubt that the question of whether Great Lakes water should be bottled for sale elsewhere is hotly contested. But does Obama have a role in it? No, experts tell us. Here’s why: • The compact was in force before Obama was even inaugurated. The agreement was negotiated during the mid 2000s, then approved individually in 2007 and 2008 by the legislatures and governors of all eight member states. Then, it was passed by both chambers of Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in 2008. Obama became president in 2009. We should note that Obama was in the U.S. Senate when it passed that chamber. The compact passed the Senate by unanimous consent -- that is, approval without any objections from senators and without a recorded vote of yeas and nays. Still, the heavy legislative lifting was long done by that point, and with so many other state and federal entities weighing in during the lengthy negotiation and approval process, it seems a stretch to attribute primary blame for the "loophole" to then-Sen. Obama. • It is a compact among states, not something imposed by the federal government. According to Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution, the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate and the president must give their approval to an interstate compact. However, once approved, compacts are fundamentally agreements between states, not between the states and the federal government. Several experts told PolitiFact that there is no significant oversight or enforcement role for the federal government in regards to the compact -- in other words, no opportunity for Obama’s "minions" to cause havoc. • Elected officials from both parties had a role in approving the compact, and continue to carry out its provisions. State legislatures and governors of both parties approved the compact initially, and today, a majority of the states and legislative chambers that are party to the agreement are actually controlled by Republicans, not Democrats. In Michigan, the state where the Nestle plant is located, the governor’s office and both chambers of the Legislature are in Republican hands. In general, the Great Lakes Compact has been "very nonpartisan for an environmental policy," said Noah Hall, a professor at Wayne State University Law School in Detriot and author of the Great Lakes Law blog. Our ruling Bloggers have said that "by using a little-known loophole ... Obama minions are allowing Nestle Co. to export precious fresh water out of Lake Michigan." There is an ongoing debate over whether Great Lakes water should be sold commercially out of the region, but Obama’s role in creating, approving and enforcing the Great Lakes Compact on an ongoing basis -- which is likely the driving reason the claim has attracted attention on social media -- is actually minimal, experts say. In other words, his "minions" have not meddled in this dispute. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09178	"Two-thirds of the top-rated hospitals in Florida were our hospitals."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jun/04/rick-scott/rick-scott-former-healthcare-ceo-defends-columbiah/	Even when condensed to two paragraphs, you can see the potential land mines Rick Scott, a Republican running for governor, might face over his former hospital chain, Columbia/HCA. Paragraph 1. Scott grew Columbia/HCA into the nation's biggest hospital system. It then became the center of a multi-state federal investigation in 1997 that centered around whether Columbia/HCA defrauded Medicare and Medicaid. Scott resigned under pressure in 1997 as the scope of the investigation grew. Paragraph 2. Columbia/HCA eventually settled the fraud cases, paying a record-setting $1.7 billion in fines. The company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies. Four people also were indicted; two were convicted, but those convictions were overturned on appeal. Scott himself was not indicted or questioned in the case. Largest fine ever. $1.7 billion. Resigned under pressure. A third-party group, the Alliance for America’s Future, has crafted a 30-second ad attacking Scott's record at Columbia/HCA. And there's a baiting Twitter account, ScottFraudFiles, being pushed by supporters of Bill McCollum, Scott's Republican primary rival. The attacks are being countered by Scott, who has deep pockets and already has spent millions of dollars on television advertisements. Scott launched a website, www.truthaboutrickscott.com, to refute claims about his time leading Columbia/HCA. He also is up with a new television ad called "Truth," where Scott challenges McCollum on the Columbia/HCA story. Looking directly into the camera, here's what Scott says: Bill McCollum’s been in politics for 30 years. You’d think he’d want to talk about his record. Instead he’s just attacking me. That’s what career politicians do. I’m going to do something the politicians never will, give you the unvarnished truth. The McCollum crowd says the hospital company I started was fined by the government for Medicare fraud. Unfortunately, that’s true. I wasn’t ever charged or even questioned by the authorities, but that’s not what matters. What matters is that the company made mistakes. And as CEO I take responsibility and I learned from it. Now here’s the part McCollum leaves out: Two-thirds of the top-rated hospitals in Florida were our hospitals. Our hospitals earned the highest quality rating, 4 times the national average. We had the best care at the lowest prices for our patients. If you want a career politician, go with McCollum… But if you want someone who learns, leads, and demands accountability … I’m Rick Scott, let’s get to work. Since this is a Florida campaign, we decided to check Scott's claim that two-thirds of the top-rated hospitals in Florida were owned by Columbia/HCA. (First, a note. We love seeing fact-check journalism and noticed that Michael Putney of WPLG in Miami dissected the Alliance for America’s Future ad and, to a lesser extent, Scott's rebuttal that we're analyzing here. We think you should check out his report. It starts about 35 seconds in.) Scott's campaign said the claim about Columbia/HCA's Florida hospitals comes from a December 1995 article in a health care trade publication, Modern Healthcare. The article references a 1994 study of America's hospital system. The study, performed by Health Care Investment Analysts and William Mercer, rates hospitals in terms of cost efficiency and patient outcomes -- measuring mortality rates, length of stays for patients, the number of employees needed to treat a patient, occupancy rates and financial performance. HCIA and and William Mercer then create a list of the nation's Top 100 hospitals. The list is subdivided by the type of hospital -- rural, urban, teaching hospital, etc. "Of the 17 hospitals from Florida in the top 100, 12 are in one category: nonteaching hospitals of more than 250 beds. All are Columbia hospitals," the Modern Healthcare article says. The article mentions that one of the 12 was purchased by Columbia/HCA after the study was performed, so really it's 11 out of 17. That's 65 percent, or right around what Scott mentioned in his ad. We checked subsequent years of the study and found similar results. In 1995, the same study rated 13 Florida hospitals among the Top 100. Nine of those hospitals were Columbia/HCA properties, or 69 percent. Twelve of 17 Top 100 Florida hospitals (70.5 percent) were run by Columbia/HCA in 1996, according to the same study. That's all right in line with what Scott said, but it fails to account for those big land mines we mentioned earlier. If the study measures financial performance, for instance, did Columbia/HCA hospitals rank artificially because it defrauded Medicare and Medicaid? We turned to one of the authors of the study, Jean Chenoweth, to find out. Chenoweth now works for Thomson Reuters, which continues to publish the annual hospital survey. We asked: Had you and the study group known about Columbia/HCA's Medicare fraud investigation -- would that have affected the rankings? She said: "We can’t give a definitive answer to a hypothetical question. Our policy calls for us to rescind any 100 Top Hospital Award found to have been given on the basis of inaccurate data. Columbia/HCA settled its case, so we have no proof or admission that specific data that led to a specific hospital receiving a 100 Top Hospital Award was inaccurate. That makes this difficult to answer definitively." Chenoweth's answer muddies things a bit in our minds. Because the corporate fraud charges were settled, there never was a public airing of the specific allegations. And because there was never a public airing of the specific allegations -- and a finding of guilt -- the study authors were unable to see if the figures they measured were deemed fraudulent. It's also important to note that the study was focused on the outcomes of individual hospitals while the federal investigation centered around dozens of Columbia/HCA properties. Where does this leave us? In his ad "Truth," Scott certainly cites the Top 100 hospital report correctly when he says that two-thirds of the Florida hospitals to make the list were owned by Columbia/HCA. But he glosses over the fact that those rankings could at least be questioned because fraud-laden data may have been used in the analysis to make the rating. The author of the study doesn't know if the data was accurate or cooked, because the fraud case never went to trial. We found no evidence to say the rankings are bogus, but we think the claim could use a little additional information. To us, that correlates to a rating of Mostly True.

pomt-11712	Says Sen. Mitch McConnell's delay in seating Alabama Sen.-elect Doug Jones "is a flagrant violation of Senate policy, which requires Jones assume office the instant one of them wins the election."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/18/verified-politics/seating-doug-jones-does-delay-break-senate-rules/	Alabama Democrat Doug Jones might have won a Senate seat, but according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Jones won’t officially take that seat until early January. With Republicans pushing hard to pass their $1.5 trillion tax bill before Christmas, their opponents cast McConnell’s move as a pure political play. "This is a flagrant violation of Senate policy, which requires Jones assume office the instant one of them wins the election," said an article on the website Verified Politics. "But the craven majority leader doesn’t want a moral Democrat sabotaging his precious tax scam that steals from the poor to give to the rich." We looked at the Senate rules, the Senate schedule and the history of special elections. The argument that any delay represents a violation of Senate policy doesn’t hold up. In fact, when we reached out to Verified Politics, they apologized for the error and changed their article. It now reads, "This is a flagrant violation of the spirit of Senate rules." That’s quite a shift. While we welcome the correction, our policy is to rate claims as originally stated and to share our research with readers. McConnell teed up this controversy early on the day of the Dec. 12 special election when he told reporters that no winner would be sworn in before January. "Sen. (Luther) Strange is going to be here through the end of this session," McConnell said. Typically, the session ends in December, although it has come as late as Jan. 3. Right now, the plan is to end in December. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com A timing problem Under the Standing Rules of the Senate, a new senator takes the oath of office after the governor and secretary of state from the state certifies the election. That oath takes place during "open Senate." Both the timeline in Alabama and the holidays work against seating Jones immediately. Alabama law says each county has until the second Friday after a special election to certify the outcome. In this case, that falls on Dec. 22. After that, the law gives the governor and secretary of state another 10 days to certify the statewide outcome. With Christmas and New Year’s Day as official holidays, that would push the deadline to Jan. 3, 2018. That said, the spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State told us certification would likely take place around Dec. 28, although the exact timing is uncertain. So for starters, the delay is on the Alabama end, not in the U.S. Senate. After that, Jones runs into the problem of the holidays. In theory, the Senate could remain in session between Christmas and New Year’s. Typically, it’s in recess. While some last-minute turmoil could change that -- involving the tax bill or keeping the government running -- at the moment, it looks like lawmakers will be home for the holidays. That means lawmakers come back in the first week of January. If Jones weren’t seated at that point, then Democrats would have plenty of reason to object, but that isn’t what McConnell laid out. The average wait There have been 11 special elections since World War II that match Jones’ situation. A speedy placement happened twice. It took one day to seat William Proxmire, D-Wis., in 1957, and two days for John Durkin, D-N.H., in 1975. The longest delay was 41 days for Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., in 1960. On average, the wait was 15 days. Even if Alabama certified Jones that fast, it would still fall on Dec. 27. Recent special elections have not run into the holiday recess issue. In February 2010, Scott Brown, R-Mass., was seated 16 days after his election. It took 21 days for Ed Markey, D-Mass., to take the oath of office in July 2013. Cory Booker, D-N.J., waited 15 days in October 2013. Our ruling An article in Verified Politics said that anything other than instantly seating Jones would be a flagrant violation of Senate policy. That is incorrect, and when we brought this to the website’s attention, they dialed back their claim to say seating Jones in January violated the spirit of Senate rules. Senate rules rely on states to certify election results. Alabama’s process puts certification into the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day. If the Senate is in recess, as it nearly always is, then Jones would have to wait until the first week of January. On average, the delay in seating senators who win special elections is 15 days. The statement is not accurate. We rate it False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Verified Politics	None	None	None	2017-12-18T11:31:12	2017-12-13	['Alabama', 'Mitch_McConnell']

pomt-12671	Small businesses "create two out of every three American jobs."	true	/missouri/statements/2017/mar/17/claire-mccaskill/sen-mccaskill-right-about-small-business-job-creat/	There has been controversy surrounding several of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks. Notable selections, such as Betsy DeVos, Rex Tillerson and Jeff Sessions, have drawn the ire of Democrats and even a few Republicans. One choice that didn’t receive much criticism was the appointment of Linda McMahon as administrator of the Small Business Administration. McMahon was approved by an 81-19 vote by the Senate, one of the more lopsided approvals of Trump’s Cabinet positions. She was so well-respected that even Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill gave her a ringing endorsement, saying in a press release that "I’m looking forward to working with Ms. McMahon on ideas to bolster small businesses and entrepreneurship in Missouri." In that same press release, though, McCaskill said something that caught our eye. She said: "Small businesses — which create two out of every three American jobs — are an engine for job growth that we’ve got to support and sustain." The first part of that statement stuck out to us. What’s defined as a small business? Do small businesses really produce that many jobs? We decided to do some digging into McCaskill’s claim. What’s a small business? When you think of small businesses, you usually think of "mom and pop" shops that are locally owned and have a few employees. However, the government’s definition of small business is any business that employs fewer than 500 people. According to a 2016 newsletter published by the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy, as of 2013, there were 28.8 million small businesses in the United States. That 28.8 million made up 99.7 percent of the businesses in the U.S. and provided 56.8 million jobs for U.S. workers. Having nearly 29 million small businesses in the country provides a very strong economic impact. In the United States, 54 percent of all sales come from small businesses. 97.7 percent of all U.S. trade exporters are also small business owners, making small business a key fixture of the United States economy. How many jobs do small businesses create? While all of the numbers listed above are important in understanding the impact of small businesses, it doesn’t answer our question about the accuracy of McCaskill’s claim. When we asked McCaskill press secretary Sarah Feldman where the senator got her numbers, she directed us to a 2011 report on the state of small businesses. In it, the report says that small businesses have "created 64 percent of new American private sector jobs generated in the past 15 years — that’s 40 million net new jobs according to the Council of Economic Advisers." That report was from six years ago. We wanted to see if there were any current reports on small businesses in the United States. Luckily, the Small Business Administration posted an article breaking down recent small business trends. It states that "small businesses provide 55 percent of all jobs and 66 percent of all net new jobs since the 1970s." This backs McCaskill’s claim that two out of every three American jobs are created by small businesses. An important thing to point out Something to note, though, is that just because two out of every three new jobs is created by a small business, that doesn’t mean 66 percent of the U.S. workforce is employed by small business. As stated above, 55 percent of U.S. workers are employed by small businesses. While this is an increase from 48 percent in 2013, small business employment still does not represent two-thirds of the workforce in America. This is important to differentiate because McCaskill’s statement could be misinterpreted to say that. She is strictly talking about the creation of jobs, not the overall amount of small business jobs in the country. Our ruling Upon the approval of McMahon as administrator to the Small Business Administration, senator McCaskill release a press release that said, in part, "Small businesses — which create two out of every three American jobs—are an engine for job growth that we’ve got to support and sustain." While two-thirds of the workforce is not employed by small businesses, 66 percent of net new jobs since the 1970s have been created by small businesses. And though McCaskill’s statement could be interpreted differently, her statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. We rate this statement True.

pomt-01761	Mary Burke "wasted 12.5 million dollars on a vacant lot" in a move that "could cost taxpayers nearly $25 million."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/31/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-mary-burkes-deal-help-abbott-lab/	In July 2014, Gov. Scott Walker’s re-election campaign targeted a so-far failed effort begun by challenger Mary Burke to lure a major Illinois-based drug company to expand in the Kenosha area. Now Walker’s back on the air with another TV ad related to that economic development deal. In mid-July we rated Mostly True a Walker claim that Burke, as state commerce chief in 2006, spent more than $12 million for land to help Abbott Laboratories even though the firm had presented "no plans to create jobs in Wisconsin." Federal Housing and Urban Development officials who provided the $12 million to Wisconsin concluded that the Commerce Department never got a written commitment from Abbott. Now they want the money back. In the new ad, Walker contends that Burke’s economic development strategy in the Abbott case "could cost taxpayers nearly $25 million" in "wasted" funds. But how can a $12.3 million deal become $25 million lost? The deal itself The Walker ads focus on a March 2006 announcement by Burke and then-Gov. Jim Doyle of a $12.5 million forgivable loan funded with federal money, specifically community development block grant funds. The money was to buy a 40-acre parcel in order to block a truck-stop development that local officials thought would discourage Abbott’s development of 500 acres the firm had acquired in Kenosha County for a potential corporate campus. Under a complex agreement with the state Commerce Department, the funds were passed through the Village of Pleasant Prairie to an arm of the Kenosha Area Business Alliance. The business alliance then used the funds to buy and hold two parcels for Abbott, with a proviso that the land could not go to Abbott unless the company showed -- by 2016 -- that it would create at least 2,400 jobs. Ultimately, $12.3 million, not $12.5 million, went for the deal. Eight years later, with two years left on that deadline, Abbott hasn’t made its contemplated Wisconsin move a reality. And HUD has declared that the project -- which it called a "speculative land banking venture" -- was ineligible for block grant funding in the first place. The state will pay half the $12.3 million back in cash, and the other half will come in a reduction of future block grant money to the state. The campaign’s math We spoke to Tom Evenson, a Walker campaign spokesman, about the ad’s claim that "taxpayers" could be out $25 million through the $12.3 million deal. He said that Walker views it as the state "paying twice" -- $12.3 million it has to repay, and the lost economic development the money could have generated if it had been used differently at the time. That "opportunity cost" argument is problematic for several reasons. The ad presents the math in concrete terms -- "taxpayer" dollars. And no matter how you cut it, the $12.3 million is being counted twice. So what are taxpayers out so far, and what are the possible outcomes when the smoke finally clears on this deal? The federal government put up the $12.3 million, but is getting the money back. State taxpayers didn’t provide the $12.3 million in the first place, but they will fork over $6.15 million in cash to repay HUD. The $6.15 million in lost future block grants from the feds means Wisconsin loses whatever benefit they might have provided. But state taxpayers don’t necessarily have to replace the lost federal funds with state funds. So depending on how you score that last item, the tab so far is either $6.15 million or $12.3 million. In the end, the total could be smaller. Under the Burke-signed deal, if no Abbott development occurs, the 40 acres could be sold and thereby generate some cash to offset the $12.3 million cost. The land is now assessed at about $6.7 million, according to local officials. The final proceeds to the state, though could be reduced to less than $3 million, however, because the agreement called for local officials to be reimbursed for paying taxes and utilities and other costs associated with the land. They say they have spent $3.9 million on those items. If the land can’t be sold, of course, there’s no offset to the state’s $12.3 million bill, or the locals’ $3.9 million. Either way, though, the hard numbers don’t approach $25 million. Finally, what about "wasted?" Walker’s math rests in part on the assumption that Burke’s deal never had a chance, in 2006 or now, to succeed. It looks like a faint hope now, though the land has been and is ready for development. And HUD’s criticisms fuel the notion that the deal, done in an election year for Doyle, was a pie-in-the-sky notion from the start. On the other hand, Commerce Department records show that Abbott’s interest developed over several years as it bought up 500 acres and dealt quietly with officials in a project they code-named "Project Doo Dah." Local officials came to the state to ask for help in buying up what it saw as a crucial final puzzle piece to attract Abbott and up to 12,000 jobs. At one point in late 2004, local officials were told that Abbott was choosing between Wisconsin and one other place for its expansion, according to a November 2004 email between Pleasant Prairie and business alliance officials. And Walker’s own administrators argued to HUD in 2013 that buying the vacant land "has allowed the (Village of Pleasant Prairie) to remove slum and blight from the area and has created an environment in which Abbott Laboratories will want to move forward and construct their campus." It also opened the door to major spin-off development, including Uline's new corporate headquarters and distribution facility that already employ more than 850, Lisa Marks, Walker’s housing administrator, wrote to HUD. Our rating Walker’s ad says that Mary Burke "wasted 12.5 million dollars on a vacant lot," a move that "could cost taxpayers nearly $25 million." The spot greatly exaggerates the real taxpayer costs and ignores the Walker administration’s own praise to HUD for the project. We rate the claim False.

pomt-05756	Says Rick Santorum "opposes right-to-work"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/01/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-rick-santorum-opposes-right-work/	In a video ad released Feb. 28, 2012, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, took aim at all three of his remaining rivals in the Republican presidential primary race -- Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. In this item, we’ll check the ad’s claim that Santorum "opposes right-to-work" -- a policy that "guarantees that no person can be compelled, as a condition of employment, to join or not to join, nor to pay dues to a labor union," as the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation defines it. Under the Taft-Hartley Act, passed in 1947, states are authorized to pass such laws, and 23 have done so. (They are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming.) Generally speaking, expanding right-to-work laws is popular among Republican primary and caucus voters, so it has become an issue in this year’s primary season. It’s also on the agenda for lawmakers in states such as Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maine, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. During the primary season, Paul has tried to distinguish himself from Santorum over the issue, charging that Santorum has been soft in his support for right-to-work. We should note that the Paul ad uses the present tense when it says Santorum "opposes right-to-work," so Santorum’s current position will be significant in our analysis. We began by visiting Santorum’s website. On the site, we found the following under the heading, "The Truth About Right to Work." "In the Senate, Rick voted to allow states to determine their own right-to-work laws. These laws protect employees from having to join unions in order to work for a company. Today, Rick believes that a National Right-to-Work law is important to curb union abuses and further strengthen the manufacturing sectors of our economy." In addition to what Santorum said on his website, he has also said the following: • "I've already signed a pledge and said I would sign a national right to work bill," Santorum said in the CNN debate in South Carolina. After being pressed by moderator John King, Santorum added, "Well, maybe you didn't hear what I said. I said I would support a national right to work law and sign it into law and would support and advocate for one. " • Speaking on WJR-AM 760 in Detroit, Santorum said he would sign national right-to-work legislation. "A national right-to-work bill is something that I would be supportive of," he said. So "today," Santorum says he supports a national right-to-work law. Viewed in isolation, that would seem to make the Paul ad’s claim flat wrong. However, the fact that Santorum felt the need to add a line on his website about his past views suggests that there’s been some fluidity in his position -- and there has been. On July 10, 1996, the Senate took a "cloture" vote to move toward consideration of the National Right to Work Act of 1995, which, among other things, would have amended the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act to repeal federal provisions that require employees to pay union dues or fees as a condition of employment. According to Senate rules, individual senators or groups of senators have the power to stall bills indefinitely through a filibuster. Such blockages can only be broken by a 60-vote supermajority. If 60 senators vote for cloture, the blocked bill may proceed to a vote on its merits. If fewer than 60 senators vote for cloture, the bill remains stalled. The cloture vote for the National Right to Work Act of 1995 garnered only 31 yes votes, compared to 68 no votes, meaning that the bill remained blocked. One of those no votes was Santorum’s. So it’s fair to say that Santorum in 1996 helped stop a national right-to-work bill in its tracks. (Santorum was actually one of 20 Republicans who voted no, compared to 31 Republicans who voted yes.) Santorum has explained this vote on federalism grounds -- that he didn’t like the idea of Pennsylvania’s long-established laws being overturned by federal decree. "When I was a senator from Pennsylvania, which is a state that is not a right-to-work state, the state made a decision not to be right-to-work," Santorum said when pressed on the issue during a CNN debate in South Carolina on Jan. 19, 2012. "And I wasn't going to go to Washington and overturn that from the federal government and do that to the state." The fact that Santorum had to win election in a swing state may also have been a factor: He comes from western Pennsylvania, where it’s common to find socially conservative but pro-labor Democrats willing to cross lines and vote for a Republican. Meanwhile, on one occasion -- a Fox News debate in Orlando, Fla., on Sept. 22, 2011 -- Santorum sidestepped a direct question about a national right-to-work law. Santorum focused his answer on assailing public-employee unions, saying he would "support a bill that says that we should not have public employee unions for the purposes of wages and benefits to be negotiated." But he did not specifically address the question about his stance on a national right-to-work law. Santorum’s explanation of his change in position didn’t cut it with Paul’s campaign. "Fact: Rick Santorum voted against it in the United States Senate. End of story," Jesse Benton, Paul's national campaign chairman, told PolitiFact. Paul’s position also meshes with the "National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation." Patrick Semmens, the group’s director of legal information, last month emailed the website BuzzFeed that Santorum's "position on right-to-work should be deeply troubling to the 80 percent of Americans who believe workers should not be forced to pay dues or fees to a union just to get or keep a job. Not only has he refused to answer the National Right to Work Committee's Presidential Survey, but while in the Senate he joined with Democrats to filibuster the National Right to Work Act." Even so, as we noted before, the Paul ad uses the present tense -- and that clashes with Santorum’s statement, reiterated on several occasions, that he supports a national right-to-work law today. Our ruling Santorum clearly has a zig-zagging history with his positions on a national right-to-work law. If we’d rated this on the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter, it would likely qualify as a Full Flop. However, the Paul ad states that Santorum "opposes right-to-work" -- which means today. Despite his past history, Santorum has stated on several occasions that he would work on behalf of (and if he became president, sign) a national right-to-work law.

pomt-02988	The "president has given 1,100 special waivers to his friends" for Obamacare.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/18/mick-mulvaney/rep-mulvaney-says-obama-gave-1100-special-waivers-/	On the last morning of the government shutdown and debt ceiling standoff, the conservative lawmakers who took the hardest line in the showdown stood firm even as they faced defeat. One of them, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., said it was all worthwhile given the principle at stake. Asked on CBS News what that principle was, Mulvaney said it was about fairness under Obamacare. "Our question, for the last three weeks, has been, ‘Why is it not evenly applied across all the citizens?’ " Mulvaney said. The president, he said, "has given 1,100 special waivers to his friends. Now he gave it most recently to large corporations. All we have been asking for the last two and a half weeks is that those same exemptions apply to our families." Here, we’ll examine whether President Barack Obama "has given 1,100 special waivers to his friends." This is a claim that Mulvaney’s political allies have made several times. Groups such as the Christian Coalition have circulated it, although the exact number sometimes varies. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, said "almost 1,100 waivers." Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said it was over 1,200. We reached out to Mulvaney’s office to get the details but didn’t hear back. Our research took us (as well as our fact checking colleagues at the Washington Post) to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The waivers in question have to do with private insurance plans that cost very little but cap the total amount they will pay at less than $1.25 million in a single year. The limits can be considerably less. There are plans that don’t pay more than $2,000 and even one that stops at $300. That threshold matters because one big thing the Affordable Care Act does is set minimum standards for health insurance -- including the elimination of annual caps by 2014. The law says there can be no limits, but it left it to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to set rules for how to transition to that goal. Those rules said that as of 2011, every plan had to pay at least $1.25 million, and as of 2014, with very few exceptions, there could be no annual limits at all. But even putting the transition on a glide path created a potential dilemma, especially for large firms that hire many low-wage workers. Faced with having to improve their coverage quickly, there was a chance that many employers would instead drop the insurance altogether. To avoid leaving those workers with no insurance at all, HHS set up a way for companies and insurance plans to apply for waivers. Who got a waiver? The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services tallies who has been granted a waiver, and who applied but was denied. At last count, the total number of waivers was 1,231. So Mulvaney’s has actually undercounted somewhat. However, his use of the term "friends" is more questionable. Here is a sample of some of the recipients: Baptist Retirement Homes of North Carolina. Pepsi. The Wyoming Lodging and Restaurant Association. Goodwill Industries of Kentucky. Wendy’s. McDonald’s. The common denominator seems to be who these firms hire -- low-wage workers. If "friendship" played a role, it’s hard to discern. And it’s not clear that these are major political allies of the president, either. On the other hand, some unions -- which usually lean Democratic -- were on the list as well. We found about 450 plans that serve union workers -- roughly a third of the total. That said, 144 groups were denied a waiver, and union plans were included on that list as well. Plans could reapply and some did. In general, if a plan reapplied, it then got a waiver. Unions show up a lot in this group, but some ultimately were turned down. We should also note that Mulvaney called these "special waivers." But by and large, whoever applied tended to get approved. That doesn’t seem particularly special to us. All of these waivers expire as of Jan. 1, 2014. Our ruling Mulvaney said that under Obamacare, the president "has given 1,100 special waivers to his friends." He’s close on the number, but it’s wrong to say that all (or even most) went to his "friends" or political allies. It’s also doubtful that any of these were "special," since the option was widely publicized and mostly granted when applied for. We rate the claim Mostly False.

Al Franken is leaving his Senate seat to avoid some unspecified scandal is so fake, it’s stolen from another fake news story about a different senator. "Libtard hero Al Franken forced to resign in disgrace," read the headline on a June 15, 2017, post on Breakingtop.world, which has hidden its registration information. Facebook users flagged the post as possible being fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to fight fake news. "Libtard Democrat Al Franken will resign his seat as U.S. Senator and Minority Leader this morning after learning that the White House has enough on him to ruin his marriage and send him to jail," the post read. "Rather than face the backlash and vindictive response from the Trump administration to his requests to play ball, Franken will resign, deny all of the allegations and spend the next 7 1/2 years under investigation by Trey Gowdy." The post is definitely fake. There has been no announcement that the former comedian Franken, D-Minn., is quitting after winning re-election in 2014. Otherwise he probably would have mentioned it during his recent NPR interview. Breakingtop.world doesn’t have any contact information, but it does have a Facebook page titled "Fake News Report." That’s quite a clue that this is made up. The site referred to the source of its post as a June 14 version of the article on OurLandOfTheFree.com, another parody website with hidden registration information. OurLandOfTheFree.com says in its footer note that the site makes "no guarantee that what you read here is true. In fact, it's probably not." It echoes the warning on its About Us page. But if you noticed, the post referred to Franken as the Senate minority leader, which he isn’t. That role belongs to Democrat Chuck Schumer. The Breakingtop.world post even mentions ousting Schumer later in the text. That detail is wrong because the entire article has essentially copied a May 23 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org that really was about Schumer. TheLastLineOfDefense.org is a parody website run by liberal troll Christopher Blair. Blair’s goal is to publish fake stories with absurd narratives in an attempt to fool conservatives. How this story ended up getting copied and passed on as a dig at Franken is anyone’s guess, but it’s not true. We rate this statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-04794	"In Florida, they're already talking about how the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/aug/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-ryan-romney-plan-will-end-medica/	The buzz among Floridians these days isn’t the start of college football. It’s Medicare, says President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign. "In Florida, they're already talking about how the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher," begins a new radio ad from Obama’s campaign. The ad moves at a slow pace, featuring a back-and-forth between soothing male and female voices that say things such as the "Ryan Medicare Plan" would affect future retirees, and the "Romney-Ryan plan" would raise health care costs. They decry Romney’s VP pick because Ryan wanted to "change the whole game when it comes to Medicare and Social Security." "What does that really say about Mitt Romney and whether he really understands Florida, the folks who live here, or what matters to our future?" PolitiFact Florida wanted to analyze the statement that "the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher." What is the Ryan-Romney plan? The "Ryan-Romney" or "Romney-Ryan" Medicare plan isn’t a written-out plan, but Romney’s statements of support for previous Medicare proposals. Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman from Wisconsin, has released several ideas since 2011 to overhaul the government-run health insurance program mainly for seniors. After Romney selected Ryan as his running mate, he said he and Ryan were on the same page for changes to Medicare. "Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical -- it's probably close to identical," he said in an Aug. 15, 2012, interview with a Wisconsin TV station. Romney was referring to Ryan’s most recent plan, released earlier this year, which would rewrite how Medicare works for people who are under age 55. Instead of paying for seniors’ health care bills, the government would offer future beneficiaries fixed payments -- voucher-like credits -- that could go toward private plans. Beneficiaries could use those credits to select a traditional Medicare plan or a private plan from a competitive marketplace, or exchange, that complies with standards set by the government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available. We don’t know whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office hasn’t released a detailed analysis, as it did for an earlier version of Ryan’s proposal when he provided the office with more substantial details. Does this approach "end Medicare"? No. Even when discussing Ryan’s earliest Medicare overhaul, which would have moved the program entirely to private insurers, PolitiFact has said repeatedly the proposal would not "end," "destroy" or "abolish" Medicare. While Medicare under the original Ryan plan would have been essentially privatized, and many seniors would have had to pay more than they do now as health care costs increase, government-supported health insurance coverage for seniors would not have gone away away. Now, under Ryan and Romney’s proposals, a traditional Medicare plan would remain an option. Would Medicare be replaced with a voucher? Pretty much. PolitiFact visited the semantics of the "voucher" issue in an Aug. 16, 2012, story, dissecting the linguistic differences between calling the Republicans’ Medicare vision a "voucher" system versus their preferred terminology, "premium support." After consulting experts in health care and language, PolitiFact rated Obama’s characterization of Romney and Ryan wanting "to turn Medicare into a voucher system" Mostly True. We should note, though, the government would continue to regulate Medicare plans. Also, the plan does not literally provide people with a paper voucher, but it does give them a credit to buy their own insurance. We think that’s voucher-like. Our ruling A radio ad from the Obama campaign says, "In Florida, they're already talking about how the Ryan-Romney plan will end Medicare and replace it with a voucher." None of the plans presented by these candidates will "end" Medicare. Instead, Romney and Ryan support substantial changes to Medicare for people under 55. Depending on their income, future beneficiaries will receive a "premium support payment" to help offset the cost of a plan purchased through a competitive marketplace or for a traditional Medicare plan.

pomt-10702	Supported in-state tuition in Arkansas for illegal immigrants "if you'd sat in our schools from the time you're 5 or 6 years old and you had become an A-plus student," among other things.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/29/mike-huckabee/tuition-bill-wasnt-that-strict/	During a Republican presidential debate Nov. 28, 2007, a questioner asked Mike Huckabee about his support for a 2005 measure in Arkansas that would have granted in-state tuition to the children of illegal immigrants. Though the bill never made it out of the legislature, critics still question his support of it. Huckabee described the law's requirements as stringent, applying only to students "if you'd sat in our schools from the time you're 5 or 6 years old and you had become an A-plus student, you'd completed the core curriculum, you were an exceptional student, and you also had to be drug- and alcohol-free — and the other provision, you had to be applying for citizenship." That's quite a number of restrictions. Did the bill outline all that? No. The bill, proposed by Rep. Joyce Elliott, D-Little Rock, said that students had to have spent three years in Arkansas high schools and graduated, and they had to sign an affidavit saying they intended to pursue citizenship. Then they would be eligible for in-state tuition and a popular state scholarship program, the Academic Challenge Scholarship, just like their fellow classmates. Huckabee conflates the proposed law with rules for the scholarship, which does have requirements for a core curriculum and drug-testing. Maybe Huckabee was confused on which programs he was talking about; he had mentioned the Academic Challenge Scholarship by name a few moments earlier. But even granting a mix-up, Huckabee is plain wrong about the A-plus average — the scholarship requires a 3.0 out of 4.0. And there's no requirement for attending state schools since age 5 or 6. We award Huckabee a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03314	"We have no idea what is contained in [electronic cigarette] vapor."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jul/27/teresa-tanzi/rhode-island-rep-teresa-tanzi-says-contents-electr/	A lot of things are said in the heat of debate on the floor at the General Assembly. As PolitiFact Rhode Island listened during a July 1, 2013 discussion of legislation on electronic cigarettes, a categorical remark by a state representative caught our attention. Rep. Teresa Tanzi, D-South Kingstown, declared, "We have no idea what is contained in that vapor" when an e-cigarette is used. Is there really no information available to the public, as she seemed to suggest? Our exploration of her statement took us into the world of "vaping" -- the act of using an e-cigarette. An e-cigarette is a battery-powered nicotine delivery system that resembles a cigarette; it heats a liquid and turns it into a colorless, odorless vapor without combustion. Unlike puffing on a tobacco cigarette, the user inhales vapor, not smoke. The Assembly in June enacted a measure that would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, but Governor Chafee vetoed it. He said the proposal would circumvent existing Rhode Island law on tobacco control and taxation. The Assembly has not scheduled any veto override session. It didn’t take us long to discover that, despite Tanzi’s assertion, there have been numerous scientific studies about the content of e-cigarette vapors. One of the leading voices in the national tug-of-war over e-cigarettes is Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor in the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Health, and a Brown University graduate. He co-authored a definitive academic paper in 2010 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Public Health Policy that reviewed the available science on e-cigarettes. He cited 16 studies, most of them sponsored by the industry, but all conducted by independent laboratories. The studies concluded that the primary components of the vapor are propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin and nicotine. Trace amounts of cancer-causing ingredients also have been detected. Of course, actual cigarettes are a known cause of cancer. Siegel pointed out that most e-cigarette users are former smokers or smokers who are trying to quit. "The issue is not finding out what’s in there. We know what’s in them," he said in an interview with The Journal. "The question is what are the long-term ramifications. And how do you weigh that against the risks of continuing to smoke." We telephoned Tanzi, who said that, in her comment during the House debate, she was referring to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulating tobacco but not e-cigarettes. As a result, she said, there are no government standards regarding the content of e-cigarettes and their possible secondhand effects. In the absence of such standards, Tanzi contended, e-cigarettes should not be sold to anyone. But that’s not what she said on the House floor. Nor is she quite right in her characterization of the FDA position. We contacted the FDA, whose web sites and spokeswoman told us that e-cigarettes are subject to regulation in two ways as the result of a federal court ruling -- as tobacco products and as therapeutic devices. Subject to regulation, in the case of tobacco products, does not mean they are actually regulated today. The FDA’s Jennifer Haliski said the agency has announced its intent to issue a proposed rule deeming products defined as e-cigarettes to be subject to regulation under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. After the rule is adopted, she explained, the FDA will be able to exercise its authority over e-cigarettes as tobacco products. But Haliski said e-cigarettes are regulated by the FDA if a seller makes a therapeutic claim -- in other words, the seller boasts, as spelled out in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, that "it treats or prevents disease or otherwise affects the structure or any function of the body . . ." So Tanzi is half-right when she says that the FDA does not regulate e-cigarettes. They are not regulated as a tobacco product but they are regulated as a drug device. No e-cigarette maker has yet applied to the FDA for approval of a therapeutic claim. When a maker does, Haliski said, the FDA will review the scientific evidence submitted and then rule. The agency has warned a handful of e-cigarette distributors about alleged unsubstantiated claims and alleged poor manufacturing practices. Haliski said that as an official matter, because manufacturers have not applied for approvals, backed with science, the FDA does not yet know what is in the vapor. In limited lab studies of certain samples, though, the FDA said it found mismatches between labeling and contents indicative of manufacturing quality problems. "We need more research," Haliski said. Our ruling State Rep. Teresa Tanzi said, "We have no idea what is contained in [electronic cigarette] vapor." But we found that numerous studies have identified the primary components of the vapor. Tanzi said she was referring to a lack of federal regulation of the products and the setting of safety standards. But that’s not what she said in the House debate. The judges rule her claim False.

pomt-09353	"If every house in Florida had a solar-heated water tank, that would eliminate consumption by 17 percent."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/06/jeff-kottkamp/kottkamp-says-solar-water-heater/	In a race for the state attorney general, we'd usually expect to hear about consumer protection, fraud, and corruption. So we were surprised when Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, a Republican candidate for attorney general, brought up the question of energy efficiency in a recent interview with Newsmax TV, a conservative Web site. "If every house in Florida had a solar-heated water tank, that would eliminate consumption by 17 percent," said Kottkamp. He's right they would help. But would they help that much? According to the U.S. Department of Energy, solar water heaters are indeed a cost-effective way to generate hot water. Although they are generally more expensive to install than conventional systems, the cost is offset through long-term savings: On average, water heating bills drop by 50 to 80 percent. That also reduces carbon dioxide emissions. First, we contacted Kottkamp's campaign to ask about the source of their claim. A press representative told us that because water heating makes up anywhere from 17 to 20 percent of the utility bill, a solar water system would reduce our consumption by up to 20 percent. We checked a variety of sources to see how much water heating makes up of the average utility bill. We found a few different numbers, but for the most part, Kottkamp was in the ballpark. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, it's about 12 percent. An MSN Money article puts the figure between 14 and 20. The Western Area Power Administration says that it's 18 percent. But there's a flaw in Kottkamp's conclusion because he's assuming a solar heater would eliminate energy consumption. Kottkamp didn't note that most solar water heaters also require a back-up system, usually in the form of an electric or gas heater. And it takes energy to power them. Dan Olney, vice president of operations for Suntrek Industries, a California company that installs solar systems, said he tells customers that solar heating "can only supplement conventional water heating." That's why the Department of Energy says the reduction for water heating energy costs is more along the lines of 50 to 80 percent of the current cost. That means rather than the 17 percent savings Kottkamp cites, it could be as low as 8.5 percent. So Kottkamp's underlying point is correct, but he's overreaching with his conclusion that it would reduce energy costs 17 percent. According to the federal estimate, the actual savings could be only half of that -- as low as 8.5 percent of total energy costs. So we find his claim Half True.

pomt-06138	Says Mitt Romney raised business taxes 20 percent in Massachusetts.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/dec/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-governor-mitt-romney-raised-busine/	In a TV ad airing in Iowa, Rick Perry said Mitt Romney, "raised business taxes 20 percent" when he was governor of Massachusetts. That so? To back the claim, Perry’s presidential campaign noted an Oct. 1, 2011, New York Times article describing then-Gov. Romney, faced with a $3 billion state deficit, signing off on an aide’s 2003 proposal to ban a practice then enabling banks to reduce their state taxes. The banks were transferring billions of dollars in assets, such as mortgages, into real estate investment trusts that were, by design, subject to virtually no taxes, the Times recapped. And, according to the article, the state’s subsequent ban on that practice and other steps on Romney’s watch ultimately resulted in companies paying about $370 million a year in additional taxes, "a nearly 20 percent increase from the period before (Romney) took office." The story attributes that calculation to an analysis by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a research group that the newspaper said receives financing from corporations. Andrew Bagley, a foundation spokesman, told us in an interview that Massachusetts businesses paid $377 million more in taxes in fiscal 2007, which included several months of Romney’s last year as governor, than the $1.6 billion they were averaging annually before the recession that socked the state as Romney was sworn in during fiscal 2003. The state’s fiscal year runs from July through June. The $377 million increase shows up on a spreadsheet breaking down additional revenue generated for the state from 22 changes that took effect while Romney was governor. According to the spreadsheet, the closing of the real-estate investment loophole accounted for $50 million of the increased revenue, ranking second to a change related to interest and royalties that had yielded $58 million in added revenue as of 2007. Massachusetts "had an enormous hole to fill" due to the recession, Bagley said, adding that while there were complaints about the actions taken with Romney’s approval, "none of us could come up with a better way" of filling the hole "than having to raise some of that from revenues." Bagley said the spreadsheet originated with a state agency, the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. A bureau spokesman, Robert Bliss, confirmed as much and told us that foundation researchers are viewed as honest brokers. "I wouldn’t quarrel with their work," Bliss said. The cited figures -- the $377 million increase in business-paid taxes compared to the pre-recession business-paid tax base of $1.6 billion -- divides out to a nearly 24 percent increase. We noticed, though, that two changes listed on the spreadsheet weren’t borne, or at least entirely borne, by businesses. Those changes, including the interception of lottery winnings to pay a winner’s past-due taxes, accounted for $9 million of the increased revenues, reducing the increased load on businesses as of 2007 to $368 million -- a slight downgrade. Separately, we noticed a 2006 Cato Institute "report card" on the fiscal records of governors indicating that under Romney, Massachusetts tax rates did not increase. Is it fair to say Romney drove up business taxes, as Perry said? John Regan, spokesman for Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a pro-business group that represents employers, suggested in an interview that weighing changes in tax rates alone would be misleading. As governor, he said, Romney "adjusted the tax code under the guise of closing loopholes, the net effect of which was hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue, the bulk of that from business." Romney’s campaign did not reply to our inquiry about Perry’s statement. A Nexis search led us to an Oct. 15, 2007, letter to the editor of The Boston Globe from Eric Fehrnstrom, a Boston consultant then identified as a senior adviser to Romney’s 2008 presidential campaign. Fehrnstrom’s letter, reacting to a writer’s critique of Romney’s tax record, said corporate "loophole closings are not tax increases. They are an attempt to keep in check aggressive tax accounting." His letter also said that Romney balanced the state’s budget for four years "without raising taxes" and signed into law a commuter tax deduction, an investment tax credit, sales tax holidays, an expanded property tax break for seniors, a more generous research and development credit, a manufacturing tax rebate, a $250 million capital gains tax refund and a tax break for movie companies doing business in the Bay State. Our ruling By the time Romney’s term as governor was ending, Massachusetts businesses were ponying up about 20 percent more in tax revenue due to actions he approved. To be sure, those increases were not due to hikes in corporate or other tax rates. Still, Perry’s claim has a reasonable basis. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-07078	"The state’s tax burden has, according to census figures released today, cost our state another 190,000 residents in 2009."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/27/tom-kean-jr/state-sen-tom-kean-jr-says-new-jerseys-taxes-cause/	State Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr. has taken aim at the New Jersey Supreme Court after its latest ruling in the state’s school funding saga. Kean (R-Union) criticized the justices for deciding that the state must dole out an additional $500 million to 31 low-income school districts and said the GOP won’t let taxpayers foot the bill. "Republicans have been clear: we will not raise taxes on the most highly taxed people in America to pay for another wrongheaded decision by the Supreme Court," Kean said in a news release on May 24. "The state’s tax burden has, according to census figures released today, cost our state another 190,000 residents in 2009." Is it true the state's famously high taxes are driving people away? PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check. Adam Bauer, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, said Kean’s statement was partly based on a May 23 article in the Asbury Park Press. The story, citing new data from the U.S. Census Bureau, stated that nearly 190,000 New Jersey residents left the state in 2009. The story further explained that about 136,000 residents moved into New Jersey during the same period, creating an "estimated net loss of 53,744 residents out of 8.7 million." The statistics come from the Census Bureau’s 2009 American Community Survey on state-to-state migration. According to the data, 189,956 people moved from New Jersey to another state or Puerto Rico in 2009. During that time frame, 136,212 people moved into the state, for an estimated net loss of 53,744 residents. Because the numbers are from a survey, they are estimates. However, a survey statistician with the Census Bureau told us that the margins of error on the data aren’t large enough to significantly impact what the numbers show: New Jersey lost tens of thousands of residents in 2009. So, Kean got the number of New Jersey residents who left the state largely correct, but he did not account for the 136,212 people who moved here. Now, we need to determine how many New Jersey residents left because of high taxes. Bauer pointed us to a study by Boston College that found $70 billion in wealth left New Jersey from 2004 to 2008. The report attributed that loss of wealth more to the decline of wealthy households moving into New Jersey than the increase of wealthy households leaving the state. The report also found, through an analysis of federal data, that the two major reasons behind the moves were changes in employment and family matters. The report also covers a different time period than what Kean referenced. Bauer said Kean’s assertion about the tax burden "certainly wasn’t intended as a monolithic statement," and that any attempt to construe it as such "is just splitting hairs." He provided no other evidence to prove taxes drove tens of thousands of New Jerseyans out of the state. "The senator has known people" that left the state because of taxes, Bauer said. "Everyone has anecdotal evidence." "If you take issue with the [statement’s] wording," he said, "I apologize." Surveys by the pro-business Tax Foundation show that New Jersey’s tax burden is, well, burdensome. New Jersey takes seven spots on the Washington, D.C.-based group’s top 10 list of counties paying the highest median property taxes from 2005 to 2009. The group also ranks the state and local tax burden in New Jersey as the highest in the nation for 2009, the most recent year the group reviewed. But what impact did taxes have on the state’s population? American Community Survey data doesn’t include information on what motivated New Jersey residents to leave the state or what attracted out-of-state residents to move here. Nationwide, the Census Bureau found that more than 40 percent of people moved between 2009 and 2010 because of housing-related reasons, such as moving to a new home, about 30 percent cited family concerns and 16.4 percent said employment needs prompted their move. The agency doesn’t break down those numbers to the state level. So we asked some experts for their opinions. James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said that while a "whole range of factors" go into a decision to move, "certainly New Jersey is an extraordinarily expensive place to live and taxes are part of that burden." "Whether it’s residential property taxes, sales taxes and the like, it does constitute a push factor," he said. Joseph J. Seneca, a professor at the Bloustein School who co-authored a 2007 study with Hughes that analyzed New Jersey migration patterns, said the number of residents moving out of state from New Jersey has dropped in recent years, an assertion supported by American Community Survey data from 2006 to 2009. He attributed the slowdown to the lack of job opportunities elsewhere and the collapse of the housing market. Still, he said, "certainly taxes in general affect people’s decision" to move, but the "causes are many and complex." "Taxes are definitely not the only factor. But they are one of the factors," said Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation. "Some people want to live in a high-tax, high-service state." Douglas Massey, director of the Office of Population Research at Princeton University, co-authored a 2008 report on migration into and out of New Jersey. It found that low-income individuals impacted by New Jersey’s high cost of living were driving up the number of residents moving out of state. "It was more jobs and real estate than tax burden," Massey said. "New Jersey is a high-value, high-wealth state that attracts professionals," Massey said. "They are willing to pay the high taxes because of the amenities in the state of New Jersey." Now, let’s get back to Kean’s statement. Kean said that New Jersey’s tax burden pushed 190,000 residents out of the state in 2009. The figure matches estimates from the American Community Survey, but Kean ignores the tens of thousands of people who moved into the state during the same period. And even Kean's spokesman acknowledges that high taxes are not the sole reason residents left New Jersey. Bauer produced no solid evidence that even a substantial share of the approximately 190,000 people left because of taxes. It's a powerful line to claim that people are fleeing the state because of high taxes. But we find insufficient evidence it is true. We rate the claim False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-08213	"Rhode Island is one of only six states" to use E-Verify.	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/nov/19/lincoln-chafee/chafee-says-only-six-states-use-e-verify/	Governor-elect Lincoln Chafee wasted no time telling constituents that he will make good on a campaign pledge to repeal Governor Carcieri's 2008 executive order on immigration. When it came to talking about one of the key components of that order, the use of the federal E-Verify system, he seemed a little vague on the details, however. "Don't forget, Rhode Island is one of only six states to have -- I believe it's only six -- to have E-Verify. So there's 44 other states that don't have it," Chafee told reporters after an unrelated news conference Monday. The point he was trying to make is that E-Verify is not a widely used program and one he believes may not be effective. We wondered how many states actually require use of E-Verify. But first, a little background. E-Verify is a free, federal database that compares information from a person's employment paperwork to Homeland Security and Social Security records. Employers who use the program can weed out immigrants not eligible to work in this country. Once employers hire workers, they run their names through the E-Verify database. If the records match, the new employees are eligible to work. If they don't match, the database notifies the employers, who must then give the worker eight days to provide sufficient proof of eligibility. What sounds like a foolproof system quickly came under fire. Critics complained that the database was inaccurate and demanded that it be improved before E-Verify was widely implemented. Despite that criticism, companies increasing began using the program on a voluntary basis. One by one, some states too started mandating E-Verify checks. In 2008, Rhode Island became one of them when Governor Donald Carcieri announced a multi-part executive order intended to curb illegal immigration. One of the key elements of the order required the state's executive branch and companies doing business with the state to use E-Verify for new employees. (The federal government began requiring use of E-Verify for government contractors in September 2009). Just how many states require the use of E-Verify? Contrary to what Chafee told reporters, the number is 13 -- 26 percent -- according to data from the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services. There are variations in how states employ E-Verify. Idaho, North Carolina and Virginia require E-Verify checks on state employees, while Colorado mandates that only state contractors use the system. Like Rhode Island, Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma require both. Finally, Arizona, Mississippi and Utah mandate that all employers statewide use the program. (South Carolina requires employers to verify the legal status of their workers, either through E-Verify or by checking their drivers' licenses.) While those statistics make clear that Chafee has his facts wrong, we were inclined to give him a little leeway on this one, for a couple of reasons. First, he said he believed only six states used E-Verify, implying he didn't know for sure. And when Carcieri issued his well-publicized executive order, the number of states using E-Verify was closer to six. It has since increased. When asked about the discrepancy, Chafee's transition office explained the governor elect's statement this way: there are six other states besides Rhode Island that have E-Verify laws that are similar to ours, spokesman Christian Vareika said. So a state that actually has a more sweeping E-Verify policy than Rhode Island should not be included in the total because its program is more extensive? That logic escapes us. Vareika stressed what he called Chafee's larger point. "The vast majority of states do not use E-Verify, so I think the heart of the matter remains true," he said. But there is something else. This is not the first time Chafee has used the six-state figure. Back in June in a gubernatorial candidate forum, Chafee told the crowd: "I would not participate in E-Verify. Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Mississippi, Rhode Island and South Carolina - only six states participate. If it's so great, is that the kind of company we want? I don't think so." Why he arbitrarily cited those six states, we're not sure. We tend to give politicians a pass when they make one slip of the tongue. But not when they repeat incorrect information. In this case, after The Providence Journal quoted him on the "six states" in June, the candidate posted the story on his campaign website where it remained as of Nov. 18. Chafee has repeatedly condemned Carcieri's executive order and promised to repeal it once he takes office. In challenging such a controversial policy, he owed it to constituents on both sides of the debate to do his homework on the current laws before speaking out. We rate this False.

pomt-02600	"Obamacare passed by just one vote in the Senate. It wouldn’t have passed without Mark Warner’s vote."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/jan/27/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-obamacare-wouldnt-have-passed-witho/	Republican Ed Gillespie opened his bid for the U.S. Senate this month by dropping responsibility for Obamacare on the toes of incumbent Democrat Mark Warner. Gillespie -- a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and former advisor to President George W. Bush -- announced his candidacy on Jan. 16. Five days later, he launched a web ad featuring 2009 video snippets of Gillespie criticizing Obamacare and Warner defending it. The screen turns black and these words appear: "Obamacare passed by just one vote in the Senate. It wouldn’t have passed without Mark Warner’s vote." We explored whether Warner’s vote was essential to passage of the health care package. Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said the claim is based on a vote Warner cast in 2009 to prevent a Senate filibuster on Obamacare. Under the Senate’s cloture rules, it takes 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to end debate on most types of legislation and allow an up or down vote on the bill. On Dec. 23, 2009, the Senate voted 60-39 to halt debate on Obamacare. Warner joined all of his fellow Democrats and two independents in voting to stop a threatened Republican filibuster. The next day, the Senate passed Obamacare with an identical 60-39 vote. But Warner’s vote wasn’t as important this time because only a simple majority was required to approve the legislation. We should note that Warner is hardly the first Democratic senator to be attacked for his or her vote to end the filibuster. Republicans have charged each of at least four other Democrats with casting "the deciding vote." In Virginia last November, then-Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli claimed Warner cast "the tie-breaking vote" to pass Obamacare. PolitiFact’s standard ruling on those claims has been Mostly False. We, and our colleagues in other states, have said it’s misleading to accuse one senator of casting the pivotal ballot when the same could be said of 59 others who voted to end the filibuster. Our ruling Gillespie says "Obamacare passed by one vote in the Senate. It wouldn’t have passed without Mark Warner’s vote." This is an improvement on past Republican efforts to blame Warner for casting the deciding vote to block a filibuster against Obamacare when, in fact, he was joined by 59 colleagues. It casts Warner as part of a collective weight that tipped the scales -- not the final grain of sand. Warner was one of 60 who voted to block the filibuster -- the bare number required under Senate rules. That allowed the Senate the following day to vote on the Obamacare bill and here’s where Gillespie’s statement comes up a little bit short. The bill, with Warner’s support, passed by a 60-39 vote. But since it only required a simple majority in the 100-member Senate to approve the legislation, Warner’s vote was not essential this time around. The actual Obamacare bill would have passed with or without him. So Gillespie’s statement is largely accurate but needs a technical clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-05248	"We’ve seen property taxes go down for the first time in 12 years on a median valued home."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/01/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-first-time-12-years-property/	Defending his fiscal policies and collective bargaining limits during the final debate before the June 5, 2012 recall vote, Gov. Scott Walker put property tax relief near the top of his bragging list. "We’ve seen property taxes go down for the first time in 12 years on a median valued home," Walker said during the WISN-TV debate at the Marquette University Law School. Is his claim on the money? Walker’s office pointed to the annual estimates from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Those reports show an upward trend in the property tax bill for a median-valued home, from 2000 to 2010. Some years it was close to flat; the year-to-year increases ranged from a tiny 0.1 percent to 4.6 percent. This leads us to 2011, the first year under Walker and his budget’s tight limits on local property tax increases. Those caps included a virtual freeze on the ability of local governments to increase the tax levy. In preliminary estimates during the budget process, the Fiscal Bureau projected the median residential bill would go up. But Walker’s administration -- using actual figures reported by schools and municipal governments -- announced in April 2012 that the bill for a median-priced home in 2011 saw a 0.4 percent drop. To be sure, that doesn’t mean every homeowner’s bill went down, just that a median-valued home would see a small drop. The approach is simply a way of roughly measuring year-to-year changes. While Walker’s claim appears on target, the overall amount of property taxes collected in the state will likely go up a bit, not down. The reason: Walker is using a typical residential home, not looking at the total of all residential collections, and his figures does not include commercial and agricultural property. The Fiscal Bureau is still checking the administration’s math and fine-tuning the numbers, but so far the data clearly supports a decrease, said Fred Ammerman, the Fiscal Bureau’s property tax program supervisor. So, the fact the numbers are not final adds a note of caution to the mix. But the figure Walker cited is a commonly used benchmark that last dropped from 1999 to 2000. And he made it clear he was talking about just residential property. We rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2012-06-01T14:17:31	2012-05-31	['None']

pomt-12683	On whether or not the Philadelphia DA's office will recommend the possibility of parole for all juvenile lifers.	full flop	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/mar/16/seth-williams/tracking-district-attorney-seth-williams-shifting-/	Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams took to the opinion pages of The Philadelphia Inquirer last week to defend himself from criticism that he reversed his stance on the individuals who have been deemed "juvenile lifers" in the criminal justice system. Williams, a Democrat who is finishing out his second term as district attorney and will not seek re-election, apparently took issue with an early March Inquirer piece that indicated the DA had changed his previous stance on offering the chance of parole to those convicted of homicide when they were juveniles. In the piece, the Inquirer reported Williams and his staff intend to seek sentences of life without parole for at least three of the 300 Philadelphia juvenile lifers whose sentences are under review. The district attorney wrote in that letter to the editor published last week that "the article is contradicted by the paper's prior reporting" and that his "approach to these cases is fair, reasonable, and consistent with the judgments of the Pennsylvania legislature and the U.S. Supreme Court." So did Williams reverse his stance or not? We decided to put it to the test on our Flip-O-Meter, which specifically tracks whether politicians have gone back on their promises. Let’s look first at what Williams’ stance on juvenile lifers was, and why it’s been of interest over the last several years. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miller v. Alabama that it’s a violation of the Eighth Amendment for states to require a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for individuals convicted of committing homicide before they turned 18. The court ruled those sentences should be "uncommon" and reserved for "the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption." By the end of 2012, the Pennsylvania legislature passed new sentencing requirements for juveniles convicted of first- or second-degree murder, ranging from a 20-years-to-life sentence to a 35-years-to-life sentence, depending on degree and how old the person was when the crime was committed. That new legislation applied only to new sentences handed down after the Miller decision. But things got complicated last year when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Miller v. Alabama decision to prohibit mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole for juveniles would apply retroactively. That set off a chaotic process in the criminal justice system that’s being resolved by district attorneys, judges and criminal defense attorneys across the state resentencing individuals according to new requirements, but largely leaving it up to judge’s discretion to make a final determination on each individual. There were about 480 juvenile lifers across the state system; 300 of those are from Philadelphia. Last summer, Williams said in an Inquirer interview that it was his goal "to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel." "As long as I'm the D.A.," he said, "we will not be asking for cases going forward for life without the possibility of parole for people under the age of 18 because of the same exact reasons articulated by the Supreme Court in Miller." The promise earned Williams praise from progressive groups, and he was even lauded in a New York Times editorial that ended with: "Now that Mr. Williams has put that principle into practice, district attorneys in other counties with large numbers of juvenile lifers have a clearer path to follow." In the same Inquirer interview from last year, Williams said "I've got a lot of people who are tweeting every day about juvenile lifers without parole." Some of them he even responded to. On June 3, 2016, the district attorney tweeted to someone asking questions about his policy: "we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole." He even doubled down when the person responded, asking: "does that mean the Philly DAs office will not seek LWOP (life without parole) in any of those 300 cases?" Williams tweeted back: "just keep reading my last tweet." So at the beginning of this month, the Inquirer wrote that it appeared Williams’ stance had shifted. Journalist Samantha Melamed reported Williams’ office, in a letter to a federal court, indicated it intends to seek life without parole in at least three of the cases it had reviewed so far. Officials from Williams’ office confirmed that this week, saying it’s so far made 96 offers, three of which were for life without parole. They refused to provide any information about those three cases, saying the offers are still under consideration by defense attorneys and the final determination will be made by a judge. The Inquirer reported one of the individuals who the DA’s office is recommending life without parole for is Andre Martin, who was 15 when he shot and killed police officer John Trettin in 1976. From the story: "According to Inquirer coverage from 1976, Martin had an IQ of 80 and was high on Valium and marijuana when he shot a police officer through the window of an apartment in a public-housing project." Following that March Inquirer story about Williams’ apparent shifting stance, Williams wrote in a letter to the editor that there was no change in his stance and quoted the Inquirer’s original June 2016 piece that read: "[Williams] said he won't rule out life without parole in the most heinous cases, but he has taken heed of the Supreme Court's opinion, in Miller, that neuroscience shows teens' brains are not fully formed, reducing their culpability." Melamed said the Inquirer stands by its reporting, which is "why the district attorney’s claim appeared in the form of a letter to the editor rather than a correction." Williams’ chief of staff Kathleen Martin said in an interview this week that "he hopes or expects not to have a lot of murderers who were juveniles remain, but in certain circumstances, including heinous crimes, that might in fact happen." She described the office’s process for reviewing each of the juvenile lifer cases, saying it’s assigned a team of assistant district attorneys and other stakeholders to review every case, starting with the oldest ones. They’re seeking out surviving family members of victims, combing through old case files and reviewing information from the Department of Corrections about how the inmates have operated in prison. After that process, the team determined that they’ll request life in prison without the chance of parole for at least three juvenile lifers from Philadelphia. When PolitiFact asked Martin, Williams’ chief of staff, about whether or not this move conflicts with Williams’ past statements saying "all" 300 individuals would have a chance at parole, she said the three inmates in question still do have that chance because "the judge is always going to have a final determination." But that would go against what the DA’s office is requesting. Martin also said Williams’ original quote to the Inquirer that he wanted "to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel" was referring to his goals "moving forward" in sentencing new juveniles. "It’s clear that the DA had a goal, but in the most heinous occasions, that goal cannot always be met," Martin said. "There are just unfortunately some cases in which the best interest of the community at large is that certain people remain in custody." Our ruling District Attorney Seth Williams told The Philadelphia Inquirer last year that it was his goal "to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel" when it comes to re-sentencing juvenile lifers still in the Pennsylvania prison system. His office says he made clear there could be exceptions in the most heinous cases. That’s why Williams’ team contends his stance didn’t shift when it didn’t offer the chance of parole to three individuals so far as it continues the process of reviewing 300 cases of juvenile lifers in Pennsylvania. But we keep going back to when he tweeted that "we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically" and that "they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole." He then doubled down on that stance when asked directly about it on Twitter. The district attorney also indicated he agreed with the Miller decision, and wouldn’t seek life without parole for juveniles convicted of homicide moving forward. That’s since changed for at least three people who could remain in prison for life without the possibility of parole. We rate this a Full Flop.

pomt-09635	A Medicaid provision added to the Senate health care reform bill "is not a special deal for Nebraska."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/23/ben-nelson/sen-ben-nelson-says-medicaid-provision-added-healt/	It has been called the "Omaha Stakes" and the "Cornhusker Kickback," but was a Medicaid provision added to the Senate health care bill a simple payoff to Nebraska to secure Sen. Ben Nelson's pivotal vote? That was the charge from several Republicans who blasted Nelson, D-Neb., for essentially selling his vote on health care reform in exchange for a special, backroom deal that could save the Nebraska state government millions of dollars in Medicaid subsidies. Nelson came to the floor on Dec. 22, 2009, to defend himself, and accused his attackers of distorting the facts to score political points. "It is not a special deal for Nebraska," Nelson said. We decided to weigh in. At issue here is a tiny clause tucked into a 383-page Manager's Amendment to the Senate health care reform bill. The wording of the paragraph is steeped in legalese (you can read the part that pertains to Nebraska on page 98 if you're into that kind of thing), but it relates to money that states will have to pick up with regard to Medicaid. The Senate bill would expand Medicaid to people below 133 percent of the poverty level. And up until 2017, the federal government will pick up the tab for the added cost that will place on state governments. After that, states will have to start sharing the cost. The provision added in the amendment will exempt Nebraska from that sunset, however, meaning that the federal government would forevermore pick up all of the expense of expanded eligibility to Medicaid in that state. How much money is at stake? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office didn't specifically break out Nebraska, but said the cost of expanding Medicaid eligibility would be about $1.2 billion for Nebraska, Massachusetts and Vermont over the next 10 years. "You’ve got to compliment Ben Nelson for playing 'The Price is Right,'" said Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. "He negotiated a Medicaid agreement for Nebraska that puts the federal government on the hook forever. Not for six years, not for 10 years. This isn’t the Louisiana Purchase; this is the Nebraska windfall." Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went on the Today show and called the deal "sleazy." And Attorney General Henry McMaster of South Carolina said he and his counterparts in Michigan and Washington state were investigating whether the special provisions for Nebraska are unconstitutional. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid defended the deal, saying, "You’ll find a number of states that are treated differently than other states. That’s what legislating is all about. It’s about compromise." On the Senate floor, Sen. Mike Johanns, R-Neb., said Nebraskans have been embarrassed by all the attention from the controversy and want no part of a special deal. Shortly after Johanns spoke, Nelson came to the floor to defend himself. The provision, he said, was not a "carve-out" for Nebraska. To the contrary, he said, he pushed for the language because he opposes unfunded mandates placed on states by the federal government -- such as this Medicaid expansion -- and saw the exemption for Nebraska as a way to open the door for other states to do the same. "You can twist and you can turn and you can try to distort what happens, but it does not change the underlying facts," Nelson said. "The underlying facts are, this was pursued initially as an opt-in or opt-out for all states. It was impossible to do that at the present time, and so as a matter of fix, there was, in fact, the extension of the federal dollars from the year 2017 on, well into the future, as a marker to lay down so that every state could object to this manner of unfunded mandates." "Each state between now and 2017 — two-thirds-plus of a decade — will have an opportunity to come back in and get this bill changed," Nelson said. "It is not a special deal for Nebraska," Nelson insisted. "It is, in fact, an opportunity to get rid of an unfunded federal mandate for all the states. Let me repeat that: for all the states. There is nothing special about it, and it is fair." Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, agreed that while the provision only mentions Nebraska, it may set a precedent for other states to get the same deal. '"Other governors will be on their congressmen and senators to make sure their states are held harmless," Harkin said. '"Sen. Nelson may have done all the states a big favor." So to summarize, Nelson says the provision was meant as a "marker" to allow all states to fight what he believes is an unfair, unfunded mandate from the federal government. And maybe that's the effect the provision will have. Maybe it will open the door so that in the next seven years, other states will be able to change the law so that they can get the same deal as Nelson got for Nebraska. But for now, Nebraska is the only state in the bill that would get the deal. Other states may fight in the future, but Nelson has already won that battle for Nebraska. And unless or until all states get the same treatment, it is a special deal for Nebraska. We rule Nelson's statement False.	None	Ben Nelson	None	None	None	2009-12-23T17:55:50	2009-12-22	['Nebraska']

pomt-04112	Members of Congress can "retire with the same pay after only one term" in office	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/11/chain-email/can-members-congress-retire-full-pay-after-just-on/	Political trends come and go, but the classics endure. Such is the case with a chain email PolitiFact Ohio received to start the new year. When we received a nearly identical version a couple of years ago, we said it could be "a new classic of the genre." The email claims that Congress gets special perks nobody else does; complains that a complacent media ignores the news, and requests that recipients of the email forward it on to 20 more people. We examined one of the special perks mentioned in the email, that "the staffers of Congress family members are exempt from having to pay back student loans." The claim is confusingly worded, but we assumed that it referred to relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers. We gave the statement a rating of Pants on Fire because it was (and is) ridiculously false. Relatives of members of Congress and Congressional staffers have to pay back their loans like everyone else. But the still-circulating email contains another claim that several readers have asked about in recent days: that members of Congress can "retire with the same pay after only one term." This claim is a classic in its own right. Our friends at the urban legend checker Snopes.com say it has been circulating in various chain emails since at least 2000. The claim means that rank-and-file members of the House of Representatives would receive full pay of $174,000 per year, for the rest of their lives, after serving as little as two years. Nice work if you can get it. But members of Congress can't. A report on "Retirement Benefits for Members of Congress," prepared in November by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, outlines how pension benefits are calculated. The key provision: no member of Congress is eligible for any pension unless he or she has served in Congress for at least five years. (Senators serve six-year terms; House members must seek reelection every two years.) To collect, a congressman or senator must be age 62, or be at least age 50 with 20 years of service, or be any age with 25 years of service. Under the most recent pension program, adopted in 1984, the size of a pension is based on the highest three years of a member's salary, the number of years of service and a multiplier, which is 1.7 percent for the first 20 years of service and 1.0 percent for subsequent years. Here’s an example, using a typical 25-year rank-and-file member who retired this year. The pension would be the sum of two calculations. First, multiply $172,443 [the average salary over the last three years] times 20 years times 0.017. Then, multiply $172,443 times 5 years times 0.01 and add that number to the first calculation. The total: about $67,250 per year. A three-term congressman (or one-term senator) who has now reached retirement age would be eligible for an annual pension of $17,588 for six years of work. That's generous, but not close to full pay. Federal law prevents members of Congress from getting full-pay retirement when they leave office. The report says, "By law, the starting amount of a member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80 percent of his or her final salary." Under the formula, it would take 67 years of service to hit that limit. So the email saying that members of Congress can "receive full pay retirement after serving one term" is blatantly bogus. It's never full pay and the only one-term members who would be eligible for any pension would be senators. Snopes.com rated the pension claim as False. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org have also debunked the claim -- which, over the years, has been accompanied by assertions that members of Congress don't pay into their Social Security (they have since 1984) or that they don't contribute anything toward their retirement (they do). For a bogus claim that’s been circulating at least 13 years, and for anyone who still spreads it, we’ll break out the matches. Pants on Fire!

pomt-04805	"Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/20/mitt-romney/romney-says-obama-cuts-716-medicare-pay-obamacare/	Florida has become the battleground where Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are dueling over Medicare. Romney’s favorite attack line: Obama took $716 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare. Romney made the claim in an Aug. 15, 2012, one-on-one interview with Tampa Bay’s WTSP 10 News. "Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare," Romney said. "I think this is something that people are just now focused on and find it very, very difficult to understand why he would cut Medicare for our current seniors." Romney’s been repeating that number a lot lately. Is it accurate? And was the money moved to pay for the national health care law? Neither Obama nor his health care law literally cut funding from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. What kind of spending reductions are we talking about? They were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. Romney has said he will repeal the health care law and institute a new overhaul of Medicare that brings more private insurers into a competitive marketplace. Beneficiaries would receive "premium support," a voucher-like credit, to buy their own plan. We should point out that the overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future, even with the health care law’s cost-saving measures. The law tries to limit the program’s growth, though, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would "cut" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context. If you’ve been following the Medicare debate for awhile, you may have heard previous claims that Obama cut Medicare by $500 billion. How did that become $700 billion? Because Medicare spending gets bigger every year, the cost-saving mechanisms in the health care law also get bigger. And, it takes a few years for the health care law’s savings mechanisms to kick in. In fact, the effects of time are the main reason the $500 billion number has turned into $700 billion. The CBO determined in 2011 that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. Ina more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion. So it’s timing that’s making the cuts bigger, not changes to Medicare. Romney also send that the spending reduction " takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare." Romney has a point here, but it’s not about money being moved from one account to another. Let us explain. At the time the health care law was being finalized and passed, Democrats said it was important to them that the new law not add to the deficit. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending. Some new spending is within the Medicare program, such as increasing coverage for prescription drugs and offering preventive care with no out-of-pocket costs. More significantly, though, the law moves to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. It also expands Medicaid, the state insurance program for the poor. The savings from Medicare offset that spending. We should note that the health law also imposes new taxes, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry. That too offsets the new spending. Our ruling Romney said, "Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for Obamacare." This wording isn't as troublesome as other statements we've seen on this topic, including from Romney himself. Still, Romney's most-recent attempt at this claim needs significantly more explanation. In this instance, Romney’s claim gives the impression that the law takes money that was already allocated to Medicare and funds the new health care law with it. In fact, the law uses a number of measures to try to reduce the rapid growth of future Medicare spending. Those savings are then used to offset costs created by the law -- especially coverage for the uninsured -- so that the overall law doesn't add to the deficit. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-01472	On support for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).	full flop	/florida/statements/2014/sep/30/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-has-changed-positions-several-times-/	Charlie Crist’s gubernatorial campaign has been peppered by Republicans claiming he’s changed positions on a number of issues, but perhaps the most cited is his position on the Affordable Care Act. A campaign commercial from the Republican Party of Florida says his change of heart on Obamacare is "flippin’ amazing," showing that he first wanted to repeal the law, but now is for it. We decided to put Crist’s position on the health care law to our Flip-O-Meter to see whether he’s had a true change of heart. The charge has dogged him since he ran for Senate in 2010 -- at one time, opponent Marco Rubio accused him of having "six different positions" on the health care law. We rated that Half True, because we really counted three. Crist said in the 2010 race he wanted to repeal the law, but he has also said he wanted to modify the law, and he currently supports the Affordable Care Act as a Democrat. The commercial cites a March 28, 2010, debate on Fox News with Rubio in which Crist says, "I think what we need to do is go ahead and repeal this thing," referring to the health care law. It then changes to a March 9, 2014, interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley, saying "I think it’s been great" when asked about the law. We found that Crist called for repeal in a March 21, 2010, Associated Press article while the U.S. House was voting on the bill. At that time, he was trying to win the Republican primary against Rubio. By July 20, when he had given up on the Republican nomination and was running as an independent, Crist was backing off of that position. The Wall Street Journal wrote that "Despite pledging as a Republican to help repeal President Obama's health-care overhaul, Mr. Crist now says he does not support such a move." Then on July 29, Crist issued a press release that seemed to take two positions at once. It read, in part: "Had I been in the United States Senate at the time, I would have voted against the bill because of unacceptable provisions like the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. But being an independent, I have the freedom to be an honest broker for the people of Florida without regard for political party, and the reality is this: despite its serious flaws, the Obama health care bill does have some positive aspects. Repeal must be accompanied by a responsible substitute -- repeal without passage of a substitute law protecting those with pre-existing conditions, closing the prescription drug donut hole for seniors, and allowing parents to keep their children on their insurance coverage until age 26 would be wrong. While I would not have supported the legislation, we have to recognize the positive components and work together across party lines to make our health care system more affordable for both consumers and the government." So, he would have voted against it, but was now part of the repeal and replace crowd. But we’re not done yet. On Aug. 27, he told Central Florida News 13, "I would have voted for it but I think it can be done better." So he was saying he would have helped pass the law, but focused the rest of the conversation on how he didn’t like provisions for Medicare. Two hours later, he issued a press release that basically repeated the July 29 release, saying he wanted to "be abundantly clear." Crist ended up losing that Senate race as an independent, but once Crist became a Democrat, his position did a complete 180-degree turn for good. In the March 2014 interview with Crowley, Crist said the law was "great" and that Democratic candidates should be more vocal in supporting the law. "They ought to strengthen up," he said. "The president's a smart guy and he's doing the right thing, and God bless him for it." Our ruling As a Republican, Crist was clear in his adherence to the party line by saying the Affordable Care Act should be repealed. When running for Senate, he seemed to contradict himself at times by saying he would have voted against the law, but also that it should be repealed or modified. Then he said he would have voted for Obamacare, but wanted parts of it changed, specifically portions dealing with cuts to Medicare. In this campaign, he clearly supports the Affordable Care Act. That’s about as big a flip as you can get from saying he wouldn’t have voted for it in the first place. We rate this one a Full Flop.

pomt-04144	Among Milwaukee Public Schools students, "86 percent are behind in reading and 80 percent are behind in math."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/02/don-pridemore/4-5-milwaukee-public-schools-students-behind-readi/	Tagging himself a common-sense conservative reformer, Wisconsin state Rep. Don Pridemore, R-Erin, aims to unseat first-term state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers in the April 2013 election. In announcing his run Dec. 3, 2012, Pridemore criticized school performance, taking particular aim at the district in Wisconsin’s largest city, Milwaukee Public Schools. The eight-year suburban lawmaker said "86 percent of MPS students are behind in reading and 80 percent are behind in math." Milwaukee Public Schools is a popular target. But are the vast majority of its students lagging in reading and math? Pridemore’s evidence When we asked Pridemore to back up his claim, he cited an Oct. 24, 2012, article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The article reported on recalculations done by the Department of Public Instruction, the agency Evers heads, on a statewide student tests. The recalculations were done on 2011 scores for the Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts Examination, which is given each fall. As the Journal Sentinel explained, DPI raised expectations for performance to match those of a respected national exam. The recalibration meant that essentially overnight, there was a large increase in the number of students who were rated as non-proficient -- even though their performance on the test didn’t change. Statewide, under the old standard for scoring the 2011 WKCE tests, 18 percent of students failed to score as proficient or advanced in reading. But the figure rose to 64 percent under the new standard. In math, the non-proficiency figure rose from 22 percent under the old standard to 52 percent under the new. Milwaukee Public Schools students fared worse. Under the old standard, nearly 42 percent of MPS students were scored as not proficient in reading. But under the new standard, the figure climbed to 86 percent. In math, nearly 41 percent of MPS students were rated as not proficient under the old standard. That rose to just over 80 percent under the new standard. Milwaukee Public Schools spokesman Tony Tagliavia acknowledged the accuracy of the figures, but pointed out that the percentages of students in Milwaukee voucher, or choice, schools rated as not proficient were even higher in reading (90 percent) and math (88 percent). He said it was important to cite the performance of private schools that get public funding since they are "pitched as the solution to issues with MPS." But we’re not testing a claim about voucher schools -- we’re testing Pridemore’s claim about MPS students’ proficiency in reading and math. Our rating Pridemore said that among Milwaukee Public Schools students, "86 percent are behind in reading and 80 percent are behind in math." We would note that the figures are as high as they not because of a change in student performance, but a change in the way the state scores a test. Nevertheless, Pridemore states the figures accurately and we rate his statement True.	None	Don Pridemore	None	None	None	2013-01-02T09:00:00	2012-12-03	['None']
pomt-08316	"Rigell's car dealership made over $400,000 off the ‘Cash for Clunkers’ bailout."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/29/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-scott-rigells-car-dealership-made-over-4/	An arm of the national Democratic Party labeled Virginia Beach businessman and Congressional hopeful Scott Rigell a hypocrite for criticizing federal stimulus spending after cashing in on its benefits. Rigell, a Republican, owns Freedom Automotive, which operates three dealerships in Hampton Roads. He’s challenging Democratic incumbent Glenn Nye for Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District seat. A TV ad sponsored by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee paints Rigell’s participation in the Cash for Clunkers program as a direct contradiction of his campaign criticism of the stimulus bill, which helped pay for the program. "Hypocrisy. That’s politics these days. And now politician Scott Rigell is campaigning on his opposition to bailouts," the ad says. "But Rigell's car dealership made over $400,000 off the 'Cash for Clunkers' bailout. Rigell rails against the bailout, but his business raked in the cash." Asked to source the claim, the DCCC pointed to U.S. Department of Transportation statistics as well as stories in The Daily Press and The Virginian-Pilot, daily newspapers in Hampton Roads. But first, what is Cash for Clunkers? The 33-day program during the summer of 2009 provided federal subsidies for people trading in older cars to buy new vehicles. The hope was to jump start the auto industry in the midst of the recession. Did Rigell’s dealerships participate in Cash for Clunkers? Yep. Rigell acknowledges it, and according to the U.S. Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Rigell’s three dealerships received a total of $441,000 in rebates for 106 sales. But that doesn’t mean the rebates translated into $441,000 in profits for Rigell’s dealerships, as the ad implies. Under the program, dealers gave consumers instant instant rebates of up $4,500 for their clunkers to be used as down payments on new cars. The dealers would then file paperwork with the federal government and get reimbursed. Rigell’s profit would have come from the mark ups of the 106 new cars he sold under the program. Rigell’s campaign declined to reveal its mark-up figures. In 2009, U.S. auto dealers grossed an average $1,183 on on each new car sold, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. Under that math, Rigell would have had a gross profit $125,398 attributable to Cash for Clunkers. Why woulda Republican who has vocally opposed the stimulus bill opt to participate in one of its programs? Rigell says it was just business. "Some of our customers asked to participate in that program and I couldn’t imagine saying no, you’ve got to go somewhere else," Rigell said at a recent Hampton RoadsChamber of Commerce meeting. Through a spokesman, Rigell told PolitiFact that he was protecting his 240 employees by participating. Although he made money from the program, Rigell says he is not happy about it. "I resentthe government for putting our family business in that position," he said. In The Virginian-Pilot, Rigell described the clunkers program as "an ill-advised program forced upon me as a businessman in this environment." So let’s look back at the facts. Rigell has indeed campaigned against the federal stimulus, as the ad claims. There’s no doubt that Cash for Clunkers was part of the stimulus and that the program boosted the bottom lines of Riggell’s dealerships. But we can’t place a dollar amount on the benefit to Rigell. The ad wrongly suggests that his dealerships’ $441,000 in rebates were straight profits and there’s reason to believe Rigell’s actual gain from Clunkers was considerably smaller. So we find the claim to be Half True.	None	Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2010-10-29T22:45:18	2010-10-01	['None']

pomt-10046	"Putting three Republicans in my Cabinet...is unprecedented."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/10/barack-obama/Three-Republicans-Cabinet-Most/	UPDATE: This claim was accurate when President Obama said it. As you can see below in the original item, it is indeed unprecedented to have three Cabinet members from the opposite party. The circumstances changed on Feb. 12, 2009, three days after Obama's statement, when Sen. Gregg withdrew . But because we rule on statements based on the wording and timing of statements, we're keeping this one as a True. Obama was correct when he said it on Feb. 9, for the way he said it. So far, the votes on the massive economic stimulus package have fallen starkly along partisan lines. The bill that passed the House didn't get a single Republican vote, and the version that passed the Senate got a grand total of three. During a news conference on Feb. 9, 2009, in which President Obama made his case for the stimulus plan, he was asked if pressing forward despite Republican objections meant the White House is moving away from its emphasis on bipartisanship. "You know, when I made a series of overtures to the Republicans — going over to meet with both Republican caucuses; you know, putting three Republicans in my Cabinet, something that is unprecedented; making sure that they were invited here to the White House to talk about the economic recovery plan — all those were not designed simply to get some short-term votes," Obama said. "They were designed to try to build up some trust over time. And I think that as I continue to make these overtures, over time hopefully that will be reciprocated." We decided to check out whether Obama can accurately claim that his three Republican Cabinet appointments represent a bipartisan high-water mark in presidential history. For starters, we're going to give Obama three Republicans, though a stickler could point out that Defense Secretary Robert Gates isn't actually registered as a Republican. But he's Republican enough in our book. Gates has served under several Republican administrations, and though he dropped his party registration to present an apolitical appearance while with the CIA, Gates himself said in December, "I consider myself a Republican." The other two Obama appointees are card-carrying Republicans: Ray LaHood, a former congressman from Illinois, as secretary of transportation; and Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire as commerce secretary (though he has not yet been confirmed). And Obama is right. No other president has had this many. For a little perspective, here's a rundown of the crossovers from a century's worth of presidential Cabinets: • George W. Bush: Democrat Norman Mineta, transportation secretary. • Bill Clinton: Republican William Cohen, defense secretary. • George H. W. Bush: nada. • Ronald Reagan: William Bennett was a Democrat when appointed as education secretary in 1985, but the following year, he became a Republican and has remained a conservative Republican voice ever since. • Jimmy Carter: Republican James Schlesinger, who served as defense secretary under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, was tapped by Carter as America's first energy secretary. • Richard Nixon: Daniel Patrick Moynihan served as ambassador to the United Nations, which at the time was not a Cabinet-level position. • John F. Kennedy: Republicans C. Douglas Dillon as treasury secretary and Robert McNamara as defense secretary. McNamara wasn't such a stretch though, as Time m agazine pointed out at the time, "In politics, McNamara is a lukewarm, liberal Republican who often contributes to Democratic candidates. This year he voted for Kennedy." • Dwight D. Eisenhower: Democrat and Labor Secretary Martin Patrick Durkin, the "plumber" among Eisenhower's so called "Nine Millionaires and a Plumber" Cabinet. Durkin was replaced in 1953 by fellow Democrat James P. Mitchell, a so-called "Democrat-for-Eisenhower." • Franklin D. Roosevelt: Republicans Frank Knox as secretary of the Navy and Henry Stimson, secretary of war. "Nobody's got three," said presidential historian Richard Shenkman. "This is unprecedented." Shenkman doesn't think you'll be hearing much from the secretaries of transportation or commerce any time soon — those Cabinet secretaries typically take a lower profile — but the appointment of Gates, he said, is "highly significant." "I wouldn't call it tokenism," Shenkman said. "I think it's real. He (Obama) is making some kind of an effort there. And it comes at very little cost. It's a shrewd political move." But Terry Sullivan, associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, called the Obama appointments little more than political symbolism. "The real question is not whether it's true or false (that Obama has appointed an unprecedented number of Republicans), but what it means," Sullivan said. "I don't know what having a bipartisan Cabinet gets you. I don't see that it gets you anything." Yes, he said, it may mean a few Cabinet members can occasionally give a presidential policy some bipartisan cred. "I'm suggesting this is a very sophisticated political community," Sullivan said. It'd be one thing if Obama had appointed the Republican leader of the Senate to a high-level Cabinet position. That might move things toward some sort of reconciliation government, he said. "But governing is way more sophisticated than these symbolic gestures." Whatever you make of the appointments, Obama is on solid ground when he said his three Republican Cabinet appointments were unprecedented. We rate his statement True.

pomt-04577	"Fast and Furious" began under the Bush administration.	false	/florida/statements/2012/sep/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-fast-and-furious-began-under-bus/	President Barack Obama is far ahead with Hispanic voters, but he faced tough questions during a Univision interview at the University of Miami on Sept. 20, 2012. Interviewer Jorge Ramos asked Obama about the controversial "Fast and Furious" program, in which federal agents allowed guns to be sold and brought into Mexico so they could trace the weapons. But the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) ended up losing track of some of the guns. Two were found at the crime scene where U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was killed on Dec. 14, 2010. "I think it’s important for us to understand that the Fast and Furious program was a field-initiated program begun under the previous administration," Obama responded. "When (Attorney General) Eric Holder found out about it, he discontinued it. We assigned an inspector general to do a thorough report that was just issued, confirming that in fact Eric Holder did not know about this, that he took prompt action and the people who did initiate this were held accountable." Several readers wrote to us that Fast and Furious did not start under President George W. Bush, so we decided to check it out. A day before Obama’s Univision interview, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Inspector General released a 512-page report about Fast and Furious. "Our review of Operation Fast and Furious and related matters revealed a series of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment and management failures," the report noted. The report also clearly shows that Fast and Furious began under the Obama administration, dating its inception to October 2009. (Obama took office in January 2009.) This directly contradicts Obama’s claim. There is one mitigating factor, however: A program similar to Fast and Furious did go forward under the Bush administration in 2006 and 2007. That program, called Operation Wide Receiver, also attempted to track suspicious weapons. Allowing gun sales to go forward even when the ATF had probable cause to believe the sales were unlawful has come to be known as "gun walking." The two operations -- Fast and Furious and Wide Receiver -- had some similarities, and both were run out of the ATF’s Phoenix Field Division. The inspector general explored both programs in depth and found similar problems. "The risk to public safety was immediately evident in both investigations," the inspector general’s report states. The White House told us that Obama was referring to the general practice of gun walking, which happened in both administrations. "The President was referring to the flawed tactic of gun-walking, which despite Republicans efforts to politicize this issue, began under the previous administration and it was our attorney general who ended it," said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee, and Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued their own 211-page investigative report this summer. The investigations led House Republicans to hold Attorney General Holder in contempt for failing to satisfy their requests for documents. House Democrats walked out on the criminal contempt vote, which passed 255-67. Our ruling Obama said that the Fast and Furious program began "under the previous administration." That is not the case; Fast and Furious did begin during the time Obama held office. Another similar program, called Operation Wide Receiver, did happen during the Bush administration, and a recent inspector general’s report criticized both operations as ineffective and seriously flawed. But Operation Wide Receiver is not the same thing as the Fast and Furious program. We rate Obama’s statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-09-24T17:37:09	2012-09-20	['None']

pomt-06897	"The U.S. won't default, because default means that you don't pay your creditors. And it takes about 10 percent of the money that's coming in right now" to pay interest to bondholders.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/26/tom-price/georgia-republican-tom-price-says-paying-debtholde/	While some predict dire consequences if the federal government doesn’t end its stalemate over the debt ceiling, U.S. Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., argues that the risk to the nation isn’t that great. The nation won’t default on its debts, the Roswell Republican told Candy Crowley on CNN’s State of the Union on July 24, 2011 -- not even if Capitol Hill lawmakers fail to reach a deal to raise the limit before the Aug. 2 deadline. The federal government still has plenty of money to pay bondholders, Price told Crowley. "Well, the U.S. won't default, because default means that you don't pay your creditors," Price replied. "And it takes about 10 percent of the money that's coming in right now..." If that's right, we wondered, then why all the hand-wringing? First, some background. President Barack Obama and Congress have been engaged for months in intense negotiations discussions about raising the debt ceiling, which is the legal limit on how much money the government may borrow. After hitting the debt ceiling earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department juggled accounts to buy time for further negotiations. Officials now expect the debt limit to be reached on Aug. 2, 2011. The negotiators have so far failed to come to agreement, with each party offering its own plan to end the crisis. If the debt ceiling isn't raised by Aug. 2, the nation won’t have the money to cover all of its debts, the Obama administration has warned. But Price argues that a failure to pay the government’s bills does not in itself mean the government is in default. What really matters, he argues, is that the U.S. pays the interest it owes on bonds. (There’s some disagreement about whether the government can prioritize its payments, but many experts think that if push came to shove, the U.S. government could choose which of its bills to pay first.) And the nation has more than enough money -- even without a debt limit increase -- to pay this portion of its debt, Price says. We’ve heard this argument before. U.S. Rep. Michelle Bachmann of Minnesota, a leading Republican presidential contender, said during a July 13, 2011 press conference that "it is simply not true" that "if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion, that somehow the United States will go into default, and we will lose the full faith and credit of the United States." Price appears to be correct that cash inflows could cover bondholder obligations, at least for a while. The Bipartisan Policy Center -- a Washington, D.C.-based think tank with a board that includes former politicians from both parties -- conducted an analysis of what the government's fiscal situation would be if a deal on the debt ceiling is not reached. When the center analyzed the government's inflows and outflows for the rest of August 2011, it found $172.4 billion in cash coming in, to offset required payments of $306.7 billion. That works out to a deficit of $134.3 billion. With that amount of income to work with, the government -- if it could prioritize payments -- could pay the monthly costs of Medicare and Medicaid ($50 billion), Social Security ($49.2 billion), Pentagon vendors ($31.7 billion), interest on the debt ($29 billion) and unemployment benefits ($12.8 billion). Those categories total $172.7 billion. But doing so would mean delaying other payments -- for instance, Pell grants and other educational programs ($20.2 billion), salaries and benefits for federal employees ($14.2 billion), welfare and food programs ($9.3 billion), health and human services grants ($8.1 billion), housing assistance ($6.7 billion) and many other programs, including military active duty pay ($2.9 billion), veterans affairs program ($2.9 billion), Department of Justice funding that includes the FBI and federal courts ($1.4 billion) and IRS refunds ($3.9 billion). The assumption by Price and Bachmann is that the financial markets would be satisfied as long as the interest on bonds was paid, even if doing so meant delaying payments to any number of other creditors to the federal government, from Social Security beneficiaries to federal workers to Pentagon contractors. However, as we noted in a previous article, independent experts don’t agree with his definition of "default," and they’re skeptical that investors or ratings agencies will just ignore a federal decision to pay certain creditors and not others and that U.S. creditworthiness would remain as sterling as it was before. Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, said that "if the federal government delays payment to anyone, then certainly in a common-sense sense, the government has defaulted on its obligations." Neil H. Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor who specializes in economics, agreed. "If the government fails to pay any obligation on schedule, that is a default in both the common-sense meaning and in the legal sense," Buchanan said. "The person to whom money is owed has not been repaid. That's a default." The same experts were also skeptical that simply paying bondholders would convince investors and ratings agencies to overlook late payments or non-payments to other federal creditors. "I believe that the financial markets would not be copacetic" if bondholders were repaid but other creditors weren’t, White said. "They would realize that the government was stiffing one set of claimants who are creditors, and the markets would worry that they might be next." Buchanan of GWU agreed with White’s point and added another. "Foreign holders of (Treasury notes) will understand that it is politically untenable to pay foreigners but not Americans," he said. "Can you imagine the firestorm if Americans were told that we cannot afford to pay Social Security recipients, because we have to pay foreign banks and governments first? The argument that we must do so to protect our credit rating will sound an awful lot like ‘too big to fail’ -- the same argument that said that banks in 2008-09 had to be bailed out, while homeowners and unemployed workers were thrown to the wolves. No matter how strong the argument that doing so is necessary to protect our credit rating, the bottom line is that the government would be favoring foreigners over Americans. Any foreign investor would know that this is not politically sustainable. They would have every reason to dump our bonds, or at least to require much higher rates of return." In a June 3, 2011, report, the Congressional Research Service -- a nonpartisan research arm of Congress -- agreed with many of these points. "The full faith and credit of the U.S. government would be threatened," the CRS wrote. "Domestic money markets, in which government securities play a major role, could be affected substantially. ... If the government fails to make timely payments to individuals, service providers, and other organizations, these persons and entities would … be affected. Even if the government continued paying interest, it is not clear whether creditors would retain or lose faith in the government’s willingness to pay its obligations. If creditors lost this confidence, the federal government’s interest costs would likely increase substantially and there would likely be broader disruptions to financial markets." And on July 13 and 14, two major ratings agencies -- Moody’s and Standard & Poors -- publicly announced that they were watching carefully. The agencies said they were reassessing whether U.S. Treasury Bonds merited the top credit rating. These ratings, issued by agencies that are independent of the government, provide guidance to investors about how secure bond investments are. "It is very difficult to make lots of individual decisions about whom to pay," said Barry Bosworth, an economist with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. "I think (Price's) statement is false in the sense of implying it is not a significant problem," though he added that the Obama administration "is also creating a false sense of disaster when it implies that everything will stop on Aug 2. Financial markets are still having trouble believing that America has sunk to such a point of government dysfunction, and there is yet to be much of a reaction. Thus, the effects are likely to build more gradually." So where does this leave us? We’ll concede that we’re in relatively uncharted territory. However, independent experts suggest that simply paying debt holders while letting other federal creditors go unpaid won’t keep the U.S. from "default" -- either the technical or the common-sense variety. In addition, both academic experts and the Congressional Research Service agree that only paying debt holders won’t be enough to keep U.S. creditworthiness unblemished. Price downplays the real risks of default and creditworthiness in a prioritization strategy that pays debt holders at the expense of other federal credit holders. So we rate his statement False.

pomt-02495	Richmond is "the most vegan-friendly city."	false	/virginia/statements/2014/feb/14/dwight-jones/mayor-jones-says-richmond-rated-most-vegan-friendl/	Editor’s note: This is a rewrite of a Truth-O-Meter that was posted on Feb. 12, 2014. The new version provides greater context for Mayor Dwight Jones’ statement, but does not change our original ruling of False. Mayor Dwight Jones opened his annual State of the City Address quoting from the popular travel guide Frommer’s, which touted Richmond’s outdoor offerings and craft beer scene as reasons it recommends the capital as a top travel destination this year. "What they’re saying is something that we already know: That Richmond is a cool place to live, work and play," Jones said. Later in the speech, Jones cited additional Richmond accolades, and one particularly caught our attention. "We are the most vegan-friendly city," he said, drawing chuckles from the audience. Has the old confederate capital become become the Mecca for people who abstain from all animal products? Lettuce take a look. Tammy Hawley, the mayor’s spokeswoman, pointed us to 2013 ratings by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a group that promotes meat-free diets and opposes animal testing. PETA ranked U.S. cities based on "availability of vegan options" as well as the "influence of vegan culture," said Lindsay Rahat, the group’s associate director of campaigns. Richmond won kudos for being "packed with meat-free restaurants" and hosting an annual vegetarian festival. But those accolades did not result in Richmond winning the vegan-friendly crown. In fact, Richmond was ranked 10th. The top spot went to Austin, Texas, in the heart of cattle country. Also ranked ahead of Richmond were Portland, Ore.; Los Angeles; New York; Chicago; Seattle; Salt Lake City, Las Vegas and Boulder, Colo. In trumpeting Richmond’s other accolades, Jones accurately noted that various groups have included Virginia’s capital in Top 10 lists of cities that are the best place to work and live, the most creative, the best place for jobs and have the best outdoors. But in addition to botching Richmond’s vegan standing, the mayor erred on two other ratings: *He touted Richmond as the "happiest city for young professionals" based on a 2011 posting by Careerbliss, an online jobs site. Richmond was 15th on the list. *He said Richmond is the "healthiest city for women," although it actually ranked 51st in a 2011 survey by Self Magazine. Our ruling Jones said Richmond is the "most vegan friendly city." The source he cited, however, rated Richmond 10th in providing animal-free food. We don’t doubt Jones’ contention that Richmond is "cool." When it comes to vegans, Richmond may be hospitable, but it has not been rated the friendliest city for them. So we rate the mayor’s claim False.	None	Dwight Jones	None	None	None	2014-02-14T18:18:05	2014-01-30	['None']

pomt-14514	Blocking a U.S. Supreme Court nomination during the remaining months of President Obama’s term "would leave the nation’s highest court with an unprecedented year-long vacancy."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/feb/19/new-hampshire-democratic-party/new-hampshire-democratic-party-says-one-year-vacan/	The unexpected death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has thrown Washington, D.C., into tumult, with Democrats and Republicans clashing loudly about the timing of a replacement. The clash is especially notable in high-profile U.S. Senate races, including the one in New Hampshire that pits Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte against her challenger, Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan. Ayotte almost immediately backed Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s pledge not to take action on a Supreme Court nominee until after the election of the next president. And the state’s Democratic Party was quick to criticize. In a Feb. 16, news release, the party put it this way: "Fearing discontent from her far-right base and pressure to appease her party bosses, Senator Kelly Ayotte has rejected her constitutional duty and decided to back Mitch McConnell’s controversial decision to block the Senate from giving fair and timely consideration to President Obama’s next Supreme Court nominee -- a move that would leave the nation’s highest court with an unprecedented year-long vacancy." While much of that statement is political boilerplate, we were interested in the last clause -- that refusing to bring up any Obama nominee would lead to an "unprecedented year-long vacancy" on the court. We decided to check it out. Asked for comment, the state Democratic Party directed us to two news stories. The first was an article from NPR that noted the longest time a Supreme Court nominee waited to receive a vote. That was in 1916, when Louis Brandeis waited 125 days. And a quick look at the calendar reminds us that Obama has more than 300 days remaining in office. Those are interesting numbers, and certainly suggest that if the Senate refuses to act on Obama’s nomination, there would be an unprecedented wait for a vote. But that’s not what the party’s press release said. It referred to a "vacancy" on the court itself, which is different. Later in the same NPR article, which cites the Congressional Research Service as a source, it’s said that: "The longest vacancy on the Supreme Court was 27 months between the Tyler and Polk administrations before the Civil War. Tyler, derided as ‘His Accidency,’ because he was the first vice president elevated to the White House, also holds the distinction of a record eight nominees rejected or withdrawn." Tyler actually had another Supreme Court seat open up, and that one took more than 400 days to fill on its own. Taking those two openings from 1843 and 1844 into account, it certainly looks like a yearlong wait for a justice to be seated has precedence. The party also pointed to an article on the Time magazine website. This article, however, says that since the Supreme Court has had nine members -- going back to 1869 -- the court went 391 days without a ninth justice in 1969 and 1970. Over that time, the Senate rejected two nominations from President Richard Nixon. So while this article indicates that a yearlong vacancy on the court would be unusual, it wouldn’t be unprecedented. Even restricting our view of the court to its existence as a nine-member panel, it has spent one lengthy span -- less than 50 years ago -- without a ninth justice. There is one way in which McConnell’s threat would be unusual. As PolitiFact noted this week, it would be unheard of for the Senate to spend more than a year without acting on a Supreme Court nomination after such an appointment is made. In the past, extended vacancies on the court resulted from nominees being rejected sequentially, rather than not acted upon at all. Our ruling The New Hampshire Democratic Party said that not confirming a Supreme Court nominee from President Obama "would leave the nation’s highest court with an unprecedented year-long vacancy." While the lack of Senate vote on an actual nominee would indeed be unprecedented, there are at least three examples of a seat in the Supreme Court going unfilled for more than a year, one of them within the last half century. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-01912	"Obama regime planned the influx of illegal alien children at the border."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/30/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-says-obama-administration-planned-influx-/	So far this year, over 47,000 children without their parents have shown up at the southern border and the government is scrambling to deal with them. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson published an open letter in Spanish-language newspapers earlier this week, urging parents in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to stop sending their children north. House Speaker John Boehner formed a group of representatives to focus on the surge of children migrants. In a news conference, Boehner faulted President Barack Obama. "We’re seeing a humanitarian disaster, one of the administration’s own making," Boehner said. Some of the president’s critics go much further. In a June 24 broadcast, conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh said the administration planned the surge at the border. "You tell me this is not purposeful," Limbaugh said. "Listen. Six months ago, the regime began planning how to transport tens of thousands of undocumented children from the border." For Limbaugh, the smoking gun is a Jan. 29, 2014, posting for contract work by the Homeland Security Department. The agency said it wanted a private company to take as many as 65,000 children in the course of the year and hand them over to the department of Health and Human Services. "On Jan. 29, they knew," Limbaugh said. "Somebody had advance knowledge that these thousands of undocumented children would be flooding the border ... All these kids were planned in advance to show up." That contract work posting has generated a lot of speculation in conservative circles. It appeared a week and a half ago on the website Infowars.com with the interpretation that the government sought to escort illegal immigrants into the United States. Soon after, that allegation morphed into the suspicion that the surge reflected some hidden plan by the administration to advance a political agenda. "This advertisement raises a lot of questions," said the website Weasle Zippers on June 20. "There is a lot of specificity reflected in this document that seeks to deal with an influx that hadn’t as yet happened." In this fact-check, we examine the evidence that the Obama administration planned the influx. The story behind the estimate In November 2013, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops sent a delegation to Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to get a better understanding of why unaccompanied children were flooding America’s southern border. Jeanne Atkinson, director of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, went on that trip and met with two Homeland Security officials stationed in the region. The report from that trip said that in November the Homeland Security Department estimated "that more than 60,000 unaccompanied minors could enter the United States during 2014." "The numbers are not pulled out of a hat," Atkinson told PunditFact. "Based on looking at past years and the daily numbers, we knew it was an estimate but it seemed like a reasonable estimate." A rising trend line Here’s a graph of the numbers Atkinson and her team saw. The figures from the Homeland Security Department (see the raw data here) show a rapid increase in the number of children stopped as they tried to enter the country. The shift began in 2011 and it was driven by children leaving El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Between 2011 and 2012, the number of children leaving those three countries increased by 158 percent. The next year, the increase was 105 percent. We ran the numbers several different ways. Allowing for the modest increase from Mexico, by the end of fiscal year 2013, officials would have been looking at an average annual increase of 55 percent from the four countries combined. Multiply that by the total in 2013, about 38,000, and you get just under 60,000. The data in the graph are for fiscal years which end in September. The 2014 data does not include the entire year. The point is, in the fall of 2013, anyone looking at the situation would be seeing steep increases. W. Ralph Basham was commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection from 2006 to 2009. Basham told PunditFact that the government estimates in 2013 follow established practice. He said people should remember they are based on more than just the numbers. "The Border Patrol interview these people on the border," Basham said. "When they hear what's going on the ground in these countries and why these people are leaving, they start to put the numbers together. They are always looking at trends to prepare themselves to deal with these surges. Unfortunately, this time it got ahead of them." Basham said he finds it "hard to buy the notion that the administration planned this." He said the situation on the border stems from a "perfect storm" of rampant violence, sometimes by gangs, in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, limited capacity in this country to quickly send these children home and a belief in Central America that if you get over the border, you can stay in America. The Migration Policy Institute, a research group that promotes better management of immigration flows, pointed to the impact of a 2008 law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. Under this legislation, signed before Obama took office, the government follows what the institute called a "more child-friendly" policy that could encourage more families to take the risk of trying to get their children into the country. Atkinson with the conference of Catholic bishops said she has heard first-hand accounts of the threats to children, including gang members seizing teenage girls from their homes. "These mothers and grandmothers told me, ‘Do you think we would send them away if we had any other option?’ " Atkinson said. Basham said the governments in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras need to contain this violence but so far, they’ve been unable to. Our ruling Limbaugh said the Obama administration planned the rapid influx of children attempting to get into the country. Not that the administration planned for the influx, but actually planned it. Limbaugh did not return our requests for comment, but his evidence was a request for contract services from early 2014 that projected that about 65,000 children would need to be moved to temporary shelters. Limbaugh viewed that estimate with suspicion. In reality, the rising number of unaccompanied children arriving at the border was well established by the end of 2013. Catholic relief workers and a past Homeland Security commissioner said all the data pointed to a continued increase into 2014. Many of the factors behind the surge of children lie outside the control of the administration. No expert we reached gave any credence to the idea that the administration planned this crisis on the border. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-00093	Says he "raised graduation rates to nearly 90 percent."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/oct/31/tony-evers/gubernatorial-candidate-tony-evers-ad-inflates-his/	Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Tony Evers have sparred over a wide-range of issues in the run-up to the Nov. 6 election. Among the most notable: Education. In June 2018, Walker proclaimed himself the "education governor" -- a not-so-subtle dig at Evers, who is state schools superintendent. "We need to make sure that every student graduates here in the state of Wisconsin. That every student, no matter where they come from, what ZIP code they live in, graduates," Walker told reporters Sept. 4, 2018, at an event welcoming students back to classes at a school in Waukesha. Evers responded with a Sept. 25, 2018, TV ad that began with ominous music and the question: "Do you trust Scott Walker on education?" The ad went on to tout several claims about Evers’ achievements, including this one that we want to check: "Tony raised graduation rates to nearly 90 percent." Is he right? Digging into the numbers We started at the state Department of Public Instruction, which Evers has led since 2009, since it is the official keeper of such numbers. Department spokesman Thomas McCarthy pointed us toward WISEdash -- the Wisconsin Information System for Education Data Dashboard. There we found these graduation rates for the relevant years: 2009-’10 – 85.7 percent 2010-’11 – 87 percent 2011-’12 – 87.5 percent 2012-’13 – 88 percent 2013-’14 – 88.6 percent 2014-’15 – 88.4 percent 2015-’16 – 88.2 percent 2016-’17 – 88.6 percent So, that indicates a steady -- if slow -- increase. But what about for the real starting point -- the year before Evers took office? McCarthy said the numbers are not comparable, because with the 2009-’10 year, the state moved toward what is known as the "adjusted cohort graduation rate." It was created by the National Center for Education Statistics in an effort to address students who enter and leave a "class" before graduation. Previously, the graduation rate was calculated by using a freshman class as the baseline, compared to the number of graduates four years later. The rest of the country moved to this approach a year later than Wisconsin, in 2010-’11. Either way, the number did rise to nearly 90 percent -- but that is only part of the claim. The larger point made by Evers is that he and his policies are responsible -- even solely responsible -- for the gains. We have seen this sort of claim many times before, when politicians take credit -- or assign blame -- for things that beyond one person’s control. For instance, there was this Walker claim from earlier in the campaign: "Our bold reforms have Wisconsin’s unemployment rate down to an all-time LOW of 2.9 percent, and the number of people working at an all-time HIGH!" Walker’s numbers were largely on target, but experts said there were many other factors at work. We rated it Half True. What about the graduation rates? Alan J. Borsuk, senior fellow in law and public policy at Marquette Law School, said Evers can take some credit. "Of course, it is the product of many factors, many people, and, ultimately, many students, parents and teachers doing well in their roles," said Borsuk, a former longtime education reporter at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "It's something to applaud. But it's a feather in the cap of whoever is at the top of the pyramid. And if the rates had gone down, critics and opponents would blame Evers." Borsuk noted that at times Walker has taken credit for improvements in student performance, and cautioned: "In my book, both Evers and Walker are taking credit for things that have factual basis, but the role played by them individually or by actions they led is easy to overstate." Meanwhile, McCarthy -- the department spokesman -- said Evers has focused on improving graduation rates since the beginning of his tenure. McCarthy cited the convening of a "graduation summit," and Evers committing to the goal of "Every child a graduate, college and career ready." But he acknowledged that a central part of that plan, state grants for districts with the highest dropout rates, were not approved by Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature. Thus, the example undermines Evers’ claim that his actions alone increased the graduation rates. It shows support from other parts of support from other parts of state government are needed for funding and policy changes. Other initiatives cited by McCarthy included a "continuous review" of academic standards, a modernized data system that can "help identify students likely to drop out" and "modernized assessments, including the ACT (college entrance test), that complement the data system in providing feedback to teachers and parents alike." Our rating In a recent campaign ad, Evers says he has "raised graduation rates to nearly 90 percent." Evers took office in 2009. In the 2009-’10 year, the graduation rate was 85.7 percent. In 2016-’17, the most recent year available, it was 88.6 percent. But, like other politicians before him, Evers gets off track by giving himself too much credit for changes that have many factors, including -- perhaps especially -- efforts at the local school district level. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Tony Evers	None	None	None	2018-10-31T06:00:00	2018-09-25	['None']
pomt-12378	In 2008, "candidate Obama, he's not even president-elect, sends William Miller over to Iran to establish a back channel and let the Iranians know that should he win the election, they will have friendlier terms."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/02/kimberley-strassel/did-obama-seek-back-channel-talks-iran-during-his-/	Amid media reports that President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner sought secret "back-channel" communications with Russia before Trump’s inauguration, some conservative commentators say outraged liberals have a short memory. They say Barack Obama did pretty much the same thing during the 2008 presidential campaign, secretly sending former Ambassador to Ukraine William Miller to Iran. Like Kushner, they say, Obama went around the existing administration to forge his own diplomatic path with a foreign adversary. "Let me set the scene for you. It's 2008, we are having an election, and candidate Obama, he's not even president-elect, sends William Miller over to Iran to establish a back channel and let the Iranians know that should he win the election, they will have friendlier terms," Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel said on NBC’s Meet the Press on May 28. Candidate Obama faced criticism for saying he would talk to Iranian leaders as president. And after he took office, his administration pursued back-channel communications — meaning secret dialogue outside normal diplomatic processes — with Iran as part of achieving the nuclear deal. Journalists reported on those processes extensively. We were intrigued by the claim that Obama sought secret communication channels with Iran before he even won the 2008 election. When we started to dig into it, we were surprised to find that the evidence supporting that narrative is slim and ultimately insufficient. As far as we can tell, this allegation stems solely from the commentary of Michael Ledeen, a conservative Iran and Iraq expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a critic of Obama’s foreign policy. Ledeen was also a national security consultant to President Ronald Reagan’s administration. He recently co-authored a book with Trump’s ousted National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies. Strassel hasn’t replied to our requests for comment, but she defended her comment on Twitter by citing Ledeen’s work. By Ledeen’s account, Miller told him that Obama sent him to Tehran in 2008. Ledeen has made this claim a number of times since at least 2013, in blog posts, on conservative talk radio, on Twitter in prepared remarks, and in a phone interview with PolitiFact June 1. "During his first presidential campaign in 2008, Mr. Obama used a secret back channel to Tehran to assure the mullahs that he was a friend of the Islamic Republic, and that they would be very happy with his policies," Ledeen wrote in 2014 for conservative website PJ Media. "The secret channel was Ambassador William G. Miller, who served in Iran during the shah's rule, as chief of staff for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as ambassador to Ukraine. Ambassador Miller has confirmed to me his conversations with Iranian leaders during the 2008 campaign." We called up Miller. He said Ledeen’s claims are "totally untrue." Miller told us that he supported Obama’s 2008 candidacy and knew some of the campaign’s foreign policy staff from his decades-long public service career, but he had no role in the campaign or the subsequent administration. Miller does have extensive experience with Iran, starting out as a diplomat there in the 1950s and 1960s. President Jimmy Carter chose Miller to be a lead negotiator during the 1979 hostage crisis, while Miller was serving as staff director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. And as a private citizen, he played a role in the release of American hikers who were imprisoned in Iran from 2009-11. But "the assertion that Obama sent me as an envoy is totally false," he said, adding that he’s met Ledeen a few times but doesn’t really know him. Miller said he travels frequently to Iran but didn’t in 2008. When we told Ledeen that Miller was telling a different story, Ledeen stood by his account. "(Miller has) changed his mind," Ledeen said. "He’s decided he didn’t go to Tehran." So either Ledeen or Miller isn’t telling the truth. We’re sensitive to the idea that someone who was involved in secret communications might not be forthcoming with us about those communications. But it’s also telling that there have been no independent news reports to corroborate Ledeen’s claims, given the extensive reporting on the Obama administration’s relations with Iran and negotiations over the nuclear deal. Marie Harf, who headed the State Department’s Iran nuclear negotiations communications strategy during Obama’s second term, said she hadn’t heard of these allegations until we called her. "Never in my time at the State Department or working on Iran negotiations did any back channel prior to when we were in office come up," she said. Wall Street Journal foreign affairs reporter Jay Solomon, author of The Iran Wars, said he "could never prove" that Obama sought a back channel to Iran as a presidential candidate, but he can’t definitively say it didn’t happen. Like Solomon, National Iranian American Council President Trita Parsi never came across any evidence for the alleged back channel while researching either of his two books about the Obama administration’s relationship with Iran, including the upcoming Losing an Enemy: Obama, Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy. Parsi questioned Ledeen’s credibility and said, "At this point, I'm completely convinced this is all B.S." Our ruling Strassel said that in 2008, Obama’s presidential campaign secretly sent former Ambassador William Miller to Iran to talk with Iranian leaders. This is a case of he-said-she-said. A single conservative scholar says Miller told him about his secret ‘08 campaign mission to Iran. Independent journalists who have covered U.S.-Iran relations extensively haven’t been able to confirm the account. There is no corroborating evidence, and Miller says it’s not true; he says he never worked on behalf of the Obama campaign, and he didn’t travel to Iran in 2008. At PolitiFact, we believe the burden is on the speaker to back up their claim with evidence. The evidence here is insufficient, so we rate this claim False.

pomt-11452	"The Obama administration had cut $300 million from school safety."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/09/ted-cruz/did-obama-cut-300-million-school-safety-not-really/	Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says to prevent school shootings in the future, the country should look to the past. In 2013, Cruz and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, proposed legislation that Cruz said could have prevented the Feb. 14 Parkland, Fla., shooting. "One of the things Grassley-Cruz did was increase funding for school safety by $300 million," Cruz said on CNN March 7. "The Obama administration had cut $300 million from school safety. You know, if that had been in place, that might well have meant that another armed police officer could have been in Parkland and could have stopped that killer before he murdered those teenagers." Cruz’s comment about Obama cutting $300 million from school safety caught our attention. We wondered if Cruz was right. 2010 Obama budget proposal Cruz’s office pointed to Obama's 2010 budget. That year President Barack Obama called for the elimination of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities State Grants program as part of his budget request. The savings by cutting the program: $294 million. "President Obama’s 2010 budget zeroed out $294 million in school safety funds," Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said. "That is a fact." Congress went along and defunded the program. So that’s about $300 million. But there’s more to this story than just the dollar figure. The particular state grant program Obama and Congress cut was formula-driven, essentially providing guaranteed money to states and school districts. However, in the same budget that eliminated the formula program, Obama requested an additional $100 million for a companion program that handed out grants on a case-by-case basis. Congress ultimately only added $51 million to that, but in any event, the cut Obama sought was closer to $200 million, not $300 million. Money spent on a variety of programs It is also important to note how that money was spent. The Safe and Drug-Free Schools program had a focus on preventing both drug use and violence. It covered "health education, early intervention, pupil services, mentoring, rehabilitation referral, and related activities." William Modzeleski, who headed the program through 2011, told us the program funded a variety of things that went far beyond armed guards or security. "We were involved in a wide range of activities, ranging from working with the Secret Service on how to identify students on the pathway to violence to one where we spent millions to ensure schools had emergency management plans," Modzeleski told us. The program also funded mental health and responses to the H1N1 flu. Obama wasn’t the first president who wanted to end the program. President George W. Bush tried the same thing in his FY 2007 budget proposal. A 2001 study by RAND had said the program’s structure was "profoundly flawed." University of New Hampshire researcher Todd DeMitchell told us that Obama’s budget reflected a different strategy. "The emphasis appears to have shifted to a broader perspective of improving the culture and climate of the school with an increased focus on bullying, health, character and possibly less emphasis on hardening the school site," DeMitchell said. Spending and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings Cruz’s statement focuses on one budget decision by the Obama White House in 2010, but doing so ignores what happens in the years that followed. In 2013, after the killings of elementary schoolers and their teachers in Newtown, Conn., Obama rolled out a plan to prevent such slayings from happening again. The package was expansive, including an assault weapon ban and changes to the background check system. But specific to schools, it included $385 million in new spending. It offered "$150 million to school districts and law enforcement agencies to hire school resource officers, school psychologists, social workers, and counselors." There were $30 million for schools to design emergency management plans, and $40 million "to help districts work with law enforcement and other local agencies to coordinate services for students who demonstrate need." There were at least $75 million aimed at boosting mental health interventions at schools. Like the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program, the proposal covered a lot of ground, but it had more big-ticket line items aimed at violence alone. It is worth comparing Cruz’s plan to put $300 million into school safety. He sought $30 million a year for a decade to pay for more police to protect schools. Obama’s plan called for $4 billion to pay for 15,000 more police officers. Of course, neither plan -- Obama’s nor Cruz’s -- became law. Cruz and Grassley have re-introduced their bill. As a final budget note, Obama ultimately ended the Safe and Drug-Free School program entirely, and folded it into a new program called Successful, Safe, and Healthy Students. Our ruling Cruz said the Obama administration cut $300 million in school safety money. That fits with the elimination in 2010 of the formula-driven Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities State Grant program. A fuller look at Obama’s proposed 2010 budget puts the cut around $200 million. In addition, Cruz ignores that in 2013, Obama called for $385 million to respond directly to mass shootings in schools, and $4 billion to hire an additional 15,000 police officers. Cruz’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. Update: After we published, we heard from Cruz's office. The fact-check reflects their comments. The rating remained unchanged. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2018-03-09T11:45:35	2018-03-07	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-02645	During the lead-up to the American Revolutionary War, "some guy in Boston got his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/16/andrea-tantaros/tantaros-says-americans-dont-know-their-history-th/	Fox News co-host Andrea Tantaros scolded Americans for not knowing their history on The Five on Wednesday. She inadvertently provided proof moments later, in the form of … Andrea Tantaros. Tantaros and other The Five panelists were talking about a new report from the conservative Heritage Foundation, which ranked America only 12th in terms of economic freedom. Tantaros said countries ahead of the United States, like Estonia, are more economically free because they "actually know their history, and they study their history, and they study ours and what we’re doing here." Americans, on the other hand, have gotten lazy and complacent, she suggested. "If you ask most people, they don’t even know why we left England," she said. "They don’t even know why some guy in Boston got his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea. Most people don’t know that." We can’t fact-check what Americans do or do not know. But what’s clear is there appears to be no story of "some guy in Boston" getting "his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea." Early American history experts were generally puzzled over what Tantaros was talking about and thought she might have mashed a few Revolutionary War-era stories together. Neither Tantaros nor Fox News responded to our request for clarification. But our experts were certain on a couple of things: 1. No one secretly tried to raise the tax on tea. In 1767, The British parliament imposed a series of duties on goods being imported to the colonies -- including on tea. The laws implementing the tariffs are called the Townshend Acts, after Charles Townshend, who came up with the idea. Many prominent colonists objected, arguing that under British law colonists could not be taxed without having representation in parliament. All of the tariffs were repealed in 1770, except the tariff on tea. The 1773 Tea Act, which spawned the Boston Tea Party (and more than 200 years later was part of the inspiration for the tea party political movement), did not increase taxes on tea, said University of North Texas associate professor Guy Chet. What it did, essentially, was create a tax break for the British-held East India Company that would allow it to sell tea cheaper in America than anyone else (even cheaper than tea smuggled into the colonies). Colonists refused the ploy to prop up the East India Company and legitimize British colonial rule, and boarded the first tea ships in Boston and dumped the tea overboard. "The Tea Act is routinely and understandably (but incorrectly) lumped in with these other other laws that did raise taxes," said Chet, author of Conquering the American Wilderness: The Triumph of European Warfare in Colonial New England. Point being: No secret, and no direct effort to increase the tax. 2. The man who tried to tax tea on colonists wasn’t in Boston when he died. If you had to identify one person as the tax on tea guy, it’d be Townshend, who was chancellor of the Exchequer. But he didn’t die in the colonies and certainly didn’t have his head blown off. Townshend barely lived past the passing of the Townshend Acts. He died Sept. 4, 1767, of a "putrid fever." "I don't know what Tantaros is talking about. Sounds like bunk to me," said Benjamin L. Carp, an associate professor of early American history at Tufts University and author of Defiance of the Patriots: The Boston Tea Party and the Making of America. "No one in British North America tried secretly to raise the tax on tea, much less get his head blown off for the attempt," said Samuel A. Forman, who blogs about revolutionary history and wrote Dr. Joseph Warren: The Boston Tea Party, Bunker Hill, and the Birth of American Liberty. 3. It’s hard to say who "got his head blown off," if anyone. Forman speculated that Tantaros may have been talking about Joseph Warren, who was president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. Warren was killed at the early Revolutionary War battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775. He was shot in the head, "dying heroically at the climax of the battle," Forman said. (History buffs can watch a video of Forman describing Warren’s injuries.) Chet said Tantaro may have been referencing violence against British customs officers attempting to enforce existing taxes on tea. "Just as a matter of ballistics, it'd be pretty difficult to blow someone's head off with 18th century weaponry unless you were using artillery," Carp said. "Although maybe you could do the trick with small arms; you'd have to ask a weapons expert." Our ruling Tantaros, in lamenting Americans’ knowledge of U.S. history, said, "Some guy in Boston got his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea." No one got their head blown off for that reason, and no one secretly tried to raise the tax on tea. The British government imposed duties on a number of goods in 1767, including tea. The 1773 Tea Act actually would have made tea cheaper for colonists, though it would have done so by propping up the British-held East India Company. The man responsible for the original tax died of a fever in Britain. Tantaros appeared to be trying to make the point that Americans -- who live in a country that is less economically free, according to one report -- forget what the lack of freedom feels like. That position may or may not be supported by their lack of knowledge of the lead-up to the Revolutionary War. But it’s not supported by her version of history because it did not happen.

pomt-04816	Paul Ryan would "outlaw in vitro fertilization."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/17/ultraviolet/womens-group-says-paul-ryan-would-outlaw-vitro-fer/	While Paul Ryan’s views on fiscal policy and Medicare have dominated news coverage of his being picked as Mitt Romney’s running mate, liberal critics of the GOP ticket are also trying to portray Ryan as an extreme conservative. One example is a five-point graphic released by UltraViolet, a group that seeks to "expand women's rights and combat sexism." The group was co-founded by Nita Chaudhary, the former national campaigns and organizing director at MoveOn.org Political Action, and Shaunna Thomas, the former executive director of the P Street Project, the lobbying arm of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. The graphic’s final claim is that Ryan would "outlaw in vitro fertilization -- seriously. That same bill that outlaws some forms of birth control could also make in vitro fertilization illegal. Can't have kids naturally? Too bad." We wondered whether it was accurate to say that Paul Ryan would "outlaw in vitro fertilization." The Sanctity of Human Life Act In footnotes, the group cites the Sanctity of Human Life Act, which Ryan co-sponsored but which remains stalled in the House. (UltraViolet did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The bill, which is only three pages long, says that "the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being, and is the paramount and most fundamental right of a person; and the life of each human being begins with fertilization, cloning, or its functional equivalent, irrespective of sex, health, function or disability, defect, stage of biological development, or condition of dependency, at which time every human being shall have all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood." It goes on to say that "Congress, each State, the District of Columbia, and all United States territories have the authority to protect the lives of all human beings residing in its respective jurisdictions." And it defines "human" and ‘"human being" to include "each and every member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, beginning with the earliest stage of development, created by the process of fertilization, cloning, or its functional equivalent." We see two issues with the group’s claim that the bill Ryan co-sponsored would "outlaw in vitro fertilization." First, the bill doesn’t specifically outlaw vitro fertilization -- in fact, it doesn’t even mention the procedure by name. Rather, any impact the law could have would be an indirect consequence of provisions that are primarily aimed at stopping abortion. Second, the bill wouldn’t necessarily affect in vitro fertilization by itself. The bill empowers states to enact legislation that protects human life from conception, but it doesn’t appear to force them to do so. We’ll look at these two issues in order. Medical questions Even though the Sanctity of Human Life Act doesn’t specifically address in vitro fertilization, experts we interviewed said the law, if passed, could lead to severe restrictions on its practice. In vitro fertilization was pioneered in the 1970s and is commonly used by some of the estimated 10 percent to 15 percent of couples who want to have a child but are having trouble getting pregnant. Typically, a number of eggs are fertilized to increase the likelihood of pregnancy, and only some may be transferred to the woman’s uterus. If unused fertilized eggs remain after the procedure is complete, doctors usually freeze the remaining embryos. According to RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, the law would call into question the legality of these practices: "If microscopic fertilized eggs/embryos are full humans, anything that puts an embryo at risk could be a criminal violation, even if its goal is the undeniable social good of helping someone have a baby." For instance, the group asks, if a frozen embryo in a clinic doesn’t thaw successfully, would that put the practitioner at risk of prosecution? "At a minimum, (the bill) would force changes in the practice of reproductive medicine (e.g., limitations on the number of eggs that may be fertilized) that are not in patients’ best interests and constitute inferior medical practice," RESOLVE said. That’s why such groups as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, the American Academy of Assisted Reproductive Technology Attorneys and all oppose "personhood" measures. So does the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which says personhood laws "would have wide-reaching harmful implications for the practice of medicine and on women's access to contraception, fertility treatments, pregnancy termination, and other essential medical procedures." Even if the bill doesn’t outlaw in vitro fertilization procedures directly, opponents say it could have a chilling effect on the profession. The mere introduction of criminal penalties into common and, according to the industry, essential practices could be enough to push some practitioners to quit rather than risk prosecution. Bioethicists agreed that the bill, if it became law, would pose serious challenges for the procedure. "If this law passed, it would not outlaw IVF, but it would make it next to impossible to do," said Arthur Caplan, who heads the division of medical ethics in the department of population health at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. "It would not allow any destruction of embryos, and since nearly all IVF depends on the overproduction of embryos the law would drastically alter how IVF is done, raising the cost of doing it and hugely decreasing the success rate." I. Glenn Cohen, co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School, agreed. By his reading, a reproductive technology process that involved "the destruction of a human species member after fertilization can be criminalized and treated equivalent to killing an already-born human being," Cohen said. Legal questions But while it’s clear that the traditional practice of in vitro fertilization could be severely affected if the bill became law, it’s too strong to say, as UltraViolet did, that the bill would "outlaw in vitro fertilization." Outlawing the creation of embryos, the necessary first step, "isn’t part of the bill," said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional law specialist at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, agreed. "I could see this leading to prohibitions on destroying unwanted embryos created for the purpose of IVF, but I’m not sure why that would ban the practice entirely," Roosevelt said. Another crucial point that UltraViolet’s graphic glosses over is that the bill would allow states to criminalize certain practices used with embryos, but it doesn’t appear to force them to do so. Gualberto Garcia Jones, a lawyer and director of Personhood USA, which promotes "personhood" legislation, said that "as a proponent of zero tolerance of abortion, I know that if this bill passed, we would have our work cut out in state legislatures to pass implementing legislation to deal with cases such as the destruction of embryonic human beings etc. Personhood USA fully supports reforming and regulating the in vitro industry. Unfortunately this bill doesn’t do that -- it’s a declaration, not a regulation." The most far-reaching possibility suggested by any of our legal experts was that the federal law might tie the hands of states in passing laws on embryo destruction, or put existing laws at risk. "This looks to me as though Congress is defining personhood to begin at conception, regardless of what the states want to say, so it's forcing that characterization on them, and then their laws will have to be consistent with that definition," Roosevelt said. Still, that interpretation is speculative and would probably have to be litigated in the courts. Meanwhile, it’s not even clear that the bill would pass judicial muster if it can be passed -- something it hasn’t come close to doing so far. Roosevelt said he thinks the law is "probably not" constitutional. Our ruling UltraViolet has a point that the bill Ryan backed could significantly alter the way in vitro fertilization is practiced. However, the group exaggerates when it says the bill in question would "outlaw in vitro fertilization." The bill doesn’t outlaw the procedure directly -- whatever impact it has would likely require action by states, which many states may be unwilling to undertake. And while the bill likely outlaws specific practices that have historically been considered important for practicing in vitro fertilization, it would not ban the procedure itself. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Ultraviolet	None	None	None	2012-08-17T17:54:07	2012-08-16	['None']

pomt-13358	"No fracking waste is being dumped in New York State"	false	/new-york/statements/2016/sep/30/basil-seggos/fracking-waste-being-dumped-new-york/	When New York State officials banned fracking in late 2014, environmentalists celebrated a victory against the controversial natural gas extraction method. Then last year, a report said waste from the process was still coming into the state. Lawmakers grilled Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos at a water quality hearing in Albany. He contradicted the report. "No fracking waste is being dumped in New York State, and those who perpetrated that are wrong," Seggos said at the hearing. "There's no high volume hydraulic fracturing going on in New York. It's going on in other states. No waste from those other states is coming into New York." Environmental advocates, however, point to information from Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection that indicates trucks carry fracking waste from the Keystone State to landfills in upstate New York. So do upstate landfills accept fracking waste? The Department of Environmental Protection in Pennsylvania confirmed that landfills in New York State took in fracking waste. We looked into what kinds of waste comes into the state, and which ones do not. Waste brought into New York Fracking is different from traditional gas drilling. Instead of drilling a well straight into the ground, a company first drills vertically, then directs the well horizontally. The drillers then blast porous rock with fluid to extract natural gas. Regulations by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation block any waste more than 80 percent liquid from being dumped into landfills. That prevents liquid fracking waste, like flowback water, from being brought into the state for disposal. But any solid waste that may have come in contact with fracking liquids is permitted under current regulations. Data from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection shows three New York State landfills this year accepted waste from high volume hydraulic-fractured drilling. According to a database from the Pennsylvania agency, the Chemung County Landfill took more than 15,000 tons of waste, including what’s listed as drill cuttings, synthetic liner materials, servicing fluid, soil contaminated by oil- and gas-related spills, and "other oil and gas wastes." Hakes C&D Landfill in Steuben County took in about 1,900 tons of drill cuttings. Hyland Facility Association in Allegany County took 550 tons of soil contaminated by oil- and gas- related spills. The definitions of this waste from the state of Pennsylvania are vague. We spoke with Scott Perry from the Pennsylvania environmental agency for a better understanding. Perry said any soil contaminated by an oil- or gas-related spill more often than not comes in contact with flowback water - a mixture of fluids and chemicals used during the fracking process. "The most commonly spilled material is flowback water," Perry said. "Drilling fluids and diesel are probably the next most common." Companies are not required to detail what they include in the "other oil and gas wastes" category. Perry said it’s considered a catch-all for waste that does not fit any other description. He said it could mean anything from the packaging used to store chemicals before they are used for fracking to broken equipment. Synthetic liner materials are thick mats or liners used to prevent chemicals and other waste from leaking into the ground. Perry said any residue is washed from the liners before they’re transported for disposal. Servicing fluid is used to maintain the wells and can include a water/oil-based mud and foam. All three New York State facilities that received waste this year are owned by Casella, a landfill operator. When we contacted one of the landfills, they said they do perform analytics on the waste as it’s brought to the facility, but a message to Casella for details was not returned. We also reached out to both companies that operate the wells where the waste came from, but neither responded to our request for more information. As recently as last year, one facility in Syracuse was still accepting fluid that the Pennsylvania agency says includes brine from fracking. But no records indicate any New York State facility has accepted the fluids this year. Landfills accepted flowback waste from fracking as recently as 2013. The state's response We contacted the Department of Environmental Conservation about the contradiction between Seggos's statement and the Pennsylvania database. In a statement, the department said any drilling waste brought into the state was strictly regulated. In the same statement, the department said waste from fracking was not allowed in the state. "Given recent public statements from advocates, it is important to set the record straight regarding the disposal and use of high volume hydraulic fracturing waste," said Kevin Frazier from the Department of Environmental Conservation. "Under Gov. Cuomo’s leadership, New York State banned high volume hydraulic fracturing and prohibits the use and disposal of any high volume hydraulic fracturing waste or fluids, including brines, anywhere in the state." "DEC also strictly regulates the State’s four landfills that currently accept drill cuttings from drilling operations. These landfills employ radiation detectors to ensure that no regulated radioactive materials are received by the facility. In addition, DEC staff provide on-site oversight and inspection to ensure operations are in compliance with state regulations." The DEC said it is "in the process of strengthening these already robust regulations." A public review and comment period about the proposed revisions ended Sept. 13, Frazier said. When asked to clarify the confusion over banning some waste while accepting others, the DEC did not offer a clear response. Our ruling During a hearing on water quality, Basil Seggos, the New York State commissioner for environmental conservation, said "no fracking waste is being dumped in New York State." Data from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection indicates waste from fracking is transported from Pennsylvania’s wells to three landfills in New York. The waste was transported as recently as earlier this year. Well operators did not report sending any flowback or fluid waste from fracking to New York State this year, but they have in years past. We rate this claim as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2570100e-68fb-4c7a-91ea-4f6cb7426032	None	Basil Seggos	None	None	None	2016-09-30T21:13:45	2016-09-07	['None']
pomt-01192	"Too many" tattoos "on visible body parts" keep some applicants out of the military.	true	/florida/statements/2014/dec/03/jeb-bush/too-many-visible-tattoos-keep-out-military-jeb-bus/	Failing test scores aren't the only problem that has caused the military to reject applicants, says former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Another problem is, well, more colorful: tattoos. While talking about his push to improve public education at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council event Dec. 1, Bush pointed to problems the military has finding qualified applicants. Bush mentioned a video in which a military official talked about the challenge: "In the video beforehand, Gen. Dempsey talked about a 25 percent pass rate. Now that’s not just because of the test, that’s also because of obesity, and too many tattoos, to be honest with you, on visible body parts for people that are trying to get into the military. But the pass rate for a high-school-level test to join the military is about 35 percent, I think, or 40 percent at best. These are abysmal numbers." PolitiFact has previously fact-checked claims about whether obesity and physical fitness have kept applicants out of the military (both true). But we hadn’t explored the role of tattoos in filling the military ranks. We couldn’t resist taking a look. Tattoo policies Each branch of the service sets their own rules about tattoos, but it was the Army’s policy that has drawn the most ink recently from the media. In March 2014, the Army overhauled its appearance policy, which includes more than two pages of detailed rules about "tattoo, branding and body mutilation." This led to a rush to get tatted so soldiers could be grandfathered in under the new rules. The Army has a detailed procedure for grandfathering that directs unit commanders to document each tattoo in an official memorandum. The Army’s policy states that tattoos, regardless of subject matter, are prohibited on certain areas of the body, including the wrists, hands and fingers, as well as the head, face, and neck, defined as "anything above the t-shirt neck line to include on/inside the eyelids, mouth, and ears." "Soldiers may have no more than four visible tattoos below the elbow (to the wrist bone) or below the knee," the policy says. So far under the new policy, 2,919 applicants could not process due to tattoos, said Brian Lepley, an Army recruiting spokesman. "Those 2,919 are the ones whose tattoos were so egregious it was highly unlikely a waiver could get through, or the applicant chose not to try a waiver," he said. In the Army, 193 tattoo waivers for applicants have been granted, while one was rejected and four are pending. Lepley told us that tattoos are not the No. 1 disqualifier. Medical conditions, drug use, misconduct or some combination of those issues disqualify more applicants. News reports around the country indicate the tattoo policy is limiting applicants, though. "Right now, with the new tattoo policy in effect, we currently turn away one in every five applicants that come through our door," U.S. Army Captain Joshua Jacquez told CNN in a report from El Paso. Maj. Gen. Allen W. Batschelet, head of Army recruiting at Fort Knox, told the Kansas City Star in August that the policy is, "rather arbitrary, in some sense." However he said that "you have to draw the line somewhere" for the Army to present a professional image. As for waivers, Batschelet said, "To be blunt, the higher quality of applicant you are, the more tolerance we'd probably have for seeking a waiver. If you came in to sign up today and were a neurosurgeon, I got to tell you I'd go a long way toward trying to get an exception if all you had was a disqualifying tattoo." The Air Force, Marines and Navy also have their own tattoo policies. All of them generally ban tattoos that are obscene, advocate discrimination or express offensive views. The Air Force policy has a seven-step measurement guide that contains math formulas in an attempt to prevent tattoos from covering more than 25 percent of an exposed body part. (Partial inches should be rounded up to the nearest inch, it says.) The Marines policy states that applicants with more than four tattoos must be administratively reviewed. The Navy’s policy is the least detailed -- only 277 words -- though like the other services, it bans head tattoos. Our ruling Bush said that among the reasons applicants are rejected by the military -- in addition to being obese or not passing the test -- is that some have "too many tattoos" on visible body parts. Since the Army updated its tattoo policy earlier this year, 2,919 applicants could not proceed due to tattoos. Other branches of the service also have restrictions on types and locations of tattoos that keep some applicants out of the military. We rate this claim True.

pomt-14360	Ted Cruz is in negotiations to be Donald Trump’s running mate.	false	/texas/statements/2016/mar/22/facebook-posts/false-donald-trump-ted-cruz-negotiating-joint-repu/	We spotted this headline below a post on the Dallas Morning News’ Trailblazers political news blog: "Breaking: Cruz Negotiating With Trump for VP Spot." Of course, that would be Texas Sen. Ted Cruz negotiating with Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump to serve as Trump’s November 2016 running mate. Huge! But wait--where’s the breathless CNN report, the insiders analysis on Fox News or even the basic newspaper scoop? We found nothing of the sort in online searches or in the Nexis news database and when we asked Cruz’s campaign about the Feb. 25, 2016, Elect Leaders post, spokesman Brian Phillips replied by email: "Is this a serious request?" Well, the Cruz-negotiating-with-Trump item, also posted on ElectLeaders.com, which describes itself as keeping "watch on our leaders and wannabe leaders," has a little traction. When we saw the headline March 21, 2016, the post had been shared on Facebook more than 34,000 times. Historical precedent And history shows a joint ticket could play out. In 2008, Barack Obama chose to run with a failed presidential hopeful, Joe Biden. In 1980, Ronald Reagan reached out to the defeated George H.W. Bush. Twenty years before, Democrat John F. Kennedy picked Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. So Trump-Cruz, pairing the frontrunner with the fellow running second, is possible. On the other hand, Phillips followed up with an email calling the post "categorically false." Anonymous sourcing For our part, we noticed a red flag in that the Elect Leaders item doesn’t quote named sources, not even a campaign spokeswoman offering a "no comment." Here’s what the post says: "A high ranking Cruz campaign official has told Elect Leaders that Sen. Cruz is in negotiations with Mr. Trump to become his Vice Presidential Nominee after Rubio dropped out Tuesday." That’s confusing timewise in that Sen. Marco Rubio dropped his presidential bid Tuesday March 15, 2016, after falling short of victory in his home state of Florida. The item goes on to say Cruz "has been the most consistent performer in primaries behind Trump. They are seeing the writing on the wall and want to negotiate from a point of strength which will evaporate over time." "The official," again unnamed, "stated Mr. Trump is interested in using Sen. Cruz’s ground game in the general election, likes his appeal to the conservative base and his stance on immigration. Of the other options for VP none hold as strong of an opinion on immigration outside of Gov. Jan Brewer from Arizona who is also being considered." Brewer, by the way, is no longer governor. Finally, the post says, Cruz, the former solicitor general of Texas, has an eye on shifting from vice president to the Supreme Court. Cruz, the item says, "in exchange for his support is wanting to be named to the Supreme Court if an opening occurs while Mr. Trump is president. Mr. Trump does not see this as an issue and a small price to pay to bring Sen. Cruz his fundraisers, donors and staff on board," the post says. We tried to reach out to Elect Leaders about the post and didn’t hear back. Otherwise, we found no indication Trump-Cruz negotiations were (or are) afoot. A Trump maybe, Cruz's ‘zero interest’ In November 2015 -- eons ago in politicking time maybe especially given Trump’s references to Cruz as "Lyin’ Ted"-- Trump told conservative talk-show host Laura Ingraham that Cruz might be his choice for the No. 2 slot. To be fair, Trump declined to name a potential running mate from among his GOP opponents before noting his affection for Cruz. "Well, I like like him," Trump said at the time. "He’s backed everything I’ve said … Ted Cruz is now agreeing with me 100 percent." But Trump also didn’t go further down the veep path, saying: "I like to think of victory, I’ve had a lot of victories, and I like to do victories first, then start thinking about other things." Cruz, meantime, said March 15, 2016 that he wasn’t inclined to join Trump on a single ticket, if offered the vice presidency. Conservative talk-show host Hugh Hewitt asked if Cruz "would ever agree to serve as" Trump’s "vice president?" "I have absolutely zero interest in doing that," Cruz replied, going on to say he expected to overtake Trump and win the delegates needed to secure the presidential nomination. And on March 21, 2016, just before we completed this fact check, Cruz told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer: "I have zero interest whatsoever" in being Trump’s running mate. Blitzer had asked Cruz about the possibility by noting Trump earlier responded to Blitzer’s question about choosing Cruz as his running mate by saying: "Crazier things happen in politics." Our ruling On Facebook, Elect Leaders said Cruz and Trump are negotiating a Trump-Cruz Republican ticket. Anything is possible. But we don't see evidence the two camps are lately plotting a shared ticket. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-07958	"We’ve saved over $100 million of (health care) costs" in Milwaukee County. "I did that."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/24/lee-holloway/acting-milwaukee-co-executive-lee-holloway-say/	A special election for Milwaukee County executive will be held in April 2011, which means that before long, boasts from politicians will be as common as tattoos on basketball players. The five candidates include Lee Holloway, the County Board chairman who became acting county executive in December after Scott Walker resigned to become governor. Holloway, in a Jan. 12, 2011 meeting with Journal Sentinel editors and reporters, tried for a three-point basket with a boast about the county’s health care expenditures. "We’ve saved over $100 million of costs," he declared, then added for emphasis: "I did that." Has the county really saved more than $100 million on its health care bills? And does Holloway deserve all the credit? In making his claim, Holloway traced the health care savings to 2006, when the County Board moved to undo changes made by the Walker administration. Let’s take a look at the sequence of events. January 2006: Contract implemented. A four-year contract negotiated by the Walker administration with Madison-based WPS Health Insurance, the county’s third-party administrator for health care, takes effect. It moved the county from being self-insured to fully insured. Early 2006: Problems surface. County staff inform the County Board’s Finance and Audit Committee, which requested monthly reports on health care costs, that the county’s 2006 health care costs were projected to exceed the budget by $7.3 million. Based on a recommendation by the committee, a work group of county employees is formed. Its job is to reduce health care expenses by pursuing changes in, or even termination of, the 4-month-old WPS contract. October 2006: Staff, contract changes. The County Board approves a Holloway proposal to create a Division of Employee Benefits to manage health care and pension benefits. The aim is to build expertise in those areas in order to lower costs. The county also reverts back to the self-insured model for health care through negotiations with WPS. The change is retroactive to January 2006. November-December 2006: More changes. The County Board approves a resolution by Holloway and other supervisors to create an advisory committee to help find health care cost savings. Stuart Piltch -- a consultant hired by the county to help with a pension lawsuit -- is enlisted to help find savings. That recommendation came from county staff attorneys. Beginning in 2006, the County Board led labor negotiations that resulted in increased co-pays, deductibles and co-insurance for employees. January 2009: Contract canceled. The county persuades WPS to release it from the four-year contract one year early. The county then signs a new agreement with UnitedHealthcare, which saved $30 million in one year alone, according to Dave Arena, the first director of the new county employee benefits unit. (Holloway credited Arena with helping achieve health care cost savings, but fired him without explanation in January 2011 after becoming acting county executive.) Those were the major health care changes. So, how much money did the county save? From 2006 through 2010, an estimated $130 million, according to calculations by the county auditor’s office and the employee benefits division. That doesn’t mean the county health care bill is dropping. The $123.7 million the county spent in 2006 dropped by 1 percent in 2007, county figures show. But since then it has risen each year to the $139.6 million that was budgeted for 2010. What Holloway meant is that the county spent an estimated $130 million less on health care than it would have if the county remained in the fully insured plan that was put in place by Walker. Now, how much credit for the savings does Holloway deserve? The consensus among seven key figures we interviewed was that many people were involved in achieving the savings. But the view also was that Holloway took most of the leadership role, while the Walker administration played more of a supportive role. A spokesman for Walker declined comment. Holloway’s major public initiative was the new employee benefits division. That gave the county expertise to negotiate the early release from the WPS contract and to bargain a less expensive deal with UnitedHealthcare. The county estimates the change saved nearly $49 million. Holloway’s other contributions were behind the scenes. According to county auditor Jerome Heer, Holloway’s leadership was crucial in boosting employee contributions for health benefits, which saved an estimated $44 million. Heer also said that if Holloway had not made reducing health care expenses a priority, the county would have stayed with the costlier fully insured plan put in place by Walker. Changing from fully insured to self insured saved an estimated $37 million. Offering a different view were County Supervisor Paul Cesarz and former supervisor Richard Nyklewicz. They said the savings were achieved through collaborative efforts of Holloway, the County Board, county staff and others. So, how do we size all of this up? County figures support Holloway’s claim that the county saved more than $100 million on health care bills -- in terms of what it would have spent had changes not been made. As for credit, no one argues that Holloway dug into the nuts and bolts of the changes the county made. As the County Board chairman, Holloway’s role was leadership, and he played a key -- though far from solo -- role. To put it another way: Holloway didn’t dribble the basketball the full length of the court before taking his shot -- he got an assist from his teammates. But his shot did go in. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Lee Holloway	None	None	None	2011-01-24T09:00:00	2011-01-12	['None']
pomt-01567	"There were fewer civilian casualties in Cambodia than there have been from American drone attacks."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/11/henry-kissinger/kissinger-drones-have-killed-more-civilians-bombin/	Henry Kissinger, secretary of state under President Richard Nixon and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has been making the media rounds to talk about his latest book. He’s mainly been asked for his take on the present: the war zones of Iraq and eastern Ukraine. But on NPR, the past came up. Kissinger was asked to defend his support for the U.S. bombing campaign in Cambodia between 1969 and 1973. For those who might not remember, while most of the fighting took place in Vietnam, as the tide shifted against the South Vietnamese and American forces, Nixon unleashed massive airstrikes in neighboring Cambodia to hit North Vietnamese soldiers and supply lines in that country. It was kept secret from the American public, and when news leaked out, Congress ultimately moved to shut it down. Kissinger deflected criticism of the campaign, saying President Barack Obama has "hit more targets on a broader scale than the Nixon administration ever did." "I think the principle is essentially the same," Kissinger said. "You attack locations where you believe people operate who are killing you. You do it in the most limited way possible. And I bet if one did an honest account, there were fewer civilian casualties in Cambodia than there have been from American drone attacks." A reader suggested we run Kissinger’s comparative death tally through the Truth-o-Meter. We examined whether the Cambodian bombings killed fewer civilians than drones. The civilian death toll from both lacks precision, but by any estimates we could find, Kissinger is wrong. The only question is, by how much. Drone deaths Since 2004, it is tacitly accepted if not always officially acknowledged that missiles from American drones have targeted Taliban and al-Qaida forces in Pakistan and Yemen. The Defense Department does not report civilian casualties and so most of what we know comes through eyewitness and press reports. A handful of projects pull together the data to keep a running record, but we focused on the only two that cover every year since drones were deployed in 2004, and count civilian deaths in every country where America has used drones to lethal effect. The New America Foundation, a group backed by a wide range of supporters, from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to Netflix, keeps tallies on Pakistan and Yemen. It reports a maximum total number of civilian deaths of 394. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a private effort based in London, has Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia in its database. Its maximum estimate is 1,089. This includes civilian deaths in which researchers were unsure that drones were responsible. Most organizations report a range of casualties. For the purposes of this fact-check, we used only the largest estimates, so the highest number we could find was 1,089. Cambodian bombing deaths A single B-52 bomber could carry up to 108 bombs, each with 500 pounds of explosives. Hundreds of bombers flew thousands of missions over Cambodia. Based on data from the U.S. Air Force, history professor Ben Kiernan at Yale University reported that from 1969 to 1973, the United States dropped more than 470,000 tons of explosives on Cambodia. Other official estimates put the figure at over 500,000 tons. There is no firm accounting of the civilian deaths that brought. Kiernan told PunditFact, based on where the bombs fell, the tonnage, and anecdotal reports, he thinks the truth lies somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000. "I believe the actual toll is closer to the upper limit of that range," Kiernan said. Getting an accurate count is difficult for reasons that go beyond the lack of any records. During the American bombing, a civil war raged in the country. Many people died in that fighting, quite apart from the American attacks. Worse, the deprivation and slaughter that followed under the Pol Pot regime killed in the neighborhood of a million people or more. Their deaths buried any hope of any census in the wake of the American air campaign. A 1980 CIA report calculated that 600,000 to 700,000 Cambodians lost their lives between 1970 and 1975. But that would include the deaths of soldiers as well as civilians, from all causes, and the time period extended beyond the American bombing. Bruce Sharp, an independent researcher in Chicago, runs Mekong.net, a website focused on Cambodia before and after the war. Sharp said he thinks 50,000 is a safe minimum estimate. A University of Hawaii political scientist compiled a number of demographic studies and arrived at a minimum estimate of 30,000. Craig Etcheson has spent 35 years studying Cambodia. From 2006 to 2012, he served as the chief of investigations building charges of war crimes against former leaders in the Pol Pot regime. Etcheson is reluctant to quantify the civilian casualties but he thinks it is much less than many believe. "I have conducted thousands of interviews with Cambodians who lived through that period of Cambodian history," Etcheson said. "I can count on one hand the number of people who described first-hand knowledge of civilian deaths from U.S. bombing. This result does not seem consistent with estimates that hundreds of thousands of people were killed." On the other hand, Etcheson said he was not specifically seeking an answer to the question of how many people died from American bombs. "We know of two incidents in 1973 that were widely reported at the time, because they occurred in or near Republican territory, and not far from Phnom Penh – one at Neak Luong and one at Sa’ang – in which 300 to 400 civilians were killed in each of two unfortunate B-52 strikes," Etcheson said. Saying it was "highly probable" that this happened again in areas that westerners could not reach, Etcheson said his hunch is that "it was probably more than 5,000 civilians killed by U.S. bombing." The lowest figure we found came from retired Air Force intelligence officer Earl Tilford. Tilford served in the Strategic Air Command from 1971 to 1975 and had first-hand knowledge of the bombing campaigns. His latest book, Crosswinds, argues that much of the bombing during the Vietnam War was ineffective, and in the case of Cambodia, the military goal was distorted by bureaucratic in-fighting between the Air Force and the Navy. Tilford told PunditFact that the Air Force ran many missions simply to keep a higher profile in the military budgeting process. More sorties were taken as proof of military importance. Tilford recalled repeated bombing runs of a lake in central Cambodia. The B-52s literally dropped their payloads in the lake. The sole purpose was to keep the mission count high. The upshot? The total tonnage might have little relation to the damage inflicted. In addition, Tilford said most bombs were dropped in remote, thinly populated regions. "I would say 4,000 to 5,000 civilians at most might have died," Tilford said. "That’s a guess based on a knowledge of targets, of the topography and that there were just not that many civilians in those areas." We should note that at the end of the bombing campaign in 1973, U.S. forces targeted more heavily populated centers and the sortie rate rose to 240 per day. Intelligence and press reports at the time told of entire villages being leveled. An April dispatch from United Press International quoted international relief workers who estimated that bombing raids had killed no fewer than 3,000 civilians in a few weeks. Cambodian government officials said tens of thousands had died. But reporters in Cambodia at the time bemoaned their inability to independently verify the impact of the American bombing. Still, in comparing the bombing deaths in Cambodia to the drone deaths today, Etcheson said his gut feeling is that "Kissinger is, at best, engaging in wishful thinking on this." Our ruling Kissinger said that he thought that an honest accounting would show that there were fewer civilian casualties from America’s bombing campaign in Cambodia than from drone attacks today. While the data lack precision in both cases, we see barely over 1,000 civilian deaths due to drones, and at least 4,000 civilian deaths due to American bombs in Cambodia (and the potential for many, many more). These figures represent a high estimate for drone deaths and the lowest guess for the Cambodian bombing in which half a million tons of bombs fell on the country over a span of four years. Kissinger couched his claim with a bit of a caveat, but a man of his experience and knowledge could reasonably be expected to understand the difference between the impact of highly targeted drone strikes and the blunt instrument of bombs dropped by B-52s. His statement departs from the most generous and common sense reading of the estimates. We rate his claim False.

pomt-05567	Says Ronald Reagan "understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get out of control, that for him to make a deal he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/04/barack-obama/ronald-reagan-understood-make-deal-he-would-have-p/	It used to be only Republicans who enjoyed repeating over and over again, "Ronald Reagan! Ronald Reagan! Ronald Reagan!" Now Democrats are getting in on the Reagan name game, too. In answering questions before a meeting of the Newspaper Association of America, President Barack Obama invoked Reagan’s name as a model of fiscal prudence. He started off bashing Republicans, both those in Congress and those running for president, for refusing to consider increased tax revenues as a way to reduce debt and deficits. "The challenge we have right now is that we have on one side, a party that will brook no compromise. And this is not just my assertion," Obama said. Specifically, he noted a moment during the Republican presidential debates when every candidate raised a hand to indicate an unwillingness to accept budget deals with tax increases. Then Obama invoked the Gipper. "Ronald Reagan, who, as I recall, is not accused of being a tax-and-spend socialist, understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get out of control, that for him to make a deal, he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases. Did it multiple times. He could not get through a Republican primary today," Obama said. So did Reagan propose tax increases as part of his budget deals? We decided to dive into history to fact-check the statement. (We asked the White House for evidence, but we didn’t hear back.) We should start by noting that if you remember Reagan as a tax cutter, your memory is good. Reagan supported cutting taxes and talked about it frequently. Under his watch, marginal tax rates decreased from top rates of 70 percent in 1981 to 28 percent in 1988. But Reagan also signed off on numerous tax increases, especially when it looked as if the previous tax cuts were driving overall tax revenues below expectations. The largest increase was the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, or TEFRA. It didn’t increase the top income tax rate, but it did increase tax revenues by tightening various rules. In 1983, he signed off on legislation to keep the Social Security program funded by raising payroll taxes and taxing Social Security benefits for some higher earners. Reagan also signed laws that modestly increased taxes or tax revenues in 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987. To measure the overall impact of tax changes, economists prefer to look at tax revenues as a percentage of the overall economy, which is Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. Under Reagan, overall tax revenues were 19.6 percent of GDP in 1981. That number dropped during Reagan’s first term but increased slightly during his second. In 1988, his last year in office, tax revenues were 18.2 percent of GDP, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Economist Bruce Bartlett reviewed Reagan’s tax record, both as president and as governor of California, for a 2011 article in Tax Notes, a respected tax publication. Bartlett noted that Reagan wasn’t exactly enthusiastic about tax increases. "As with his California tax increases, Reagan had little to say about them afterwards. In his diary, he wrote only that the TEFRA bill was ‘the price we ha(d) to pay to get the budget cuts.’ He later tried to repudiate his consistent support for tax increases after 1981. But it’s clear that getting control of the deficit in the 1980s required both spending cuts and higher revenues." Bartlett concluded, "Although he cut taxes when he could, he raised them when he had to. That’s something today’s self-styled Reaganites should remember." One thing troubled us about the wording of Obama’s statement. He said Reagan "repeatedly" would "propose both spending cuts and tax increases." Most of the analysis we reviewed indicated that while Reagan signed off on tax increases proposed by Congress, he did not often propose those tax increases himself. Still, Reagan definitely advocated in public for closing tax "loopholes" as part of pending deals, and he could wax eloquent on tax fairness. One example: Back in 1985, Reagan delivered extended remarks on tax policy to an audience of high school students in Atlanta. "Now, someone might say it's odd to talk about tax policy with young people in their teens. But I don't think so," Reagan said. "You not only understand what taxes are, what effect they have in the average person's life, but if you don't understand, you will pretty soon, when you get your first job." Reagan then described the tax breaks he was proposing for families before moving on to tax "loopholes." "We're going to close the unproductive tax loopholes that have allowed some of the truly wealthy to avoid paying their fair share," he said. "In theory, some of those loopholes were understandable, but in practice they sometimes made it possible for millionaires to pay nothing, while a bus driver was paying 10 percent of his salary, and that's crazy. It's time we stopped it. "And the way I see it, if our current tax structure were a TV show, it would either be Foul-ups, Bleeps and Blunders, or Gimme a Break. If it were a record album, it would be Gimme Shelter. If it were a movie, it would be Revenge of the Nerds or maybe Take the Money and Run. And if the IRS, Internal Revenue Service, ever wants a theme song, maybe they'll get Sting to do, ‘Every breath you take, every move you make, I'll be watching you.’" And with that 1980s pop culture flashback over, we’ll now move on to our ruling. Our ruling Obama said Reagan "understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get out of control, that for him to make a deal he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases." Reagan typically did not make tax increases part of his own proposals. But he did approve and even advocate for budget deals that included increases to tax revenues, and he spoke of tax fairness in ways that contrast sharply with today’s Republicans in Congress.

pomt-08711	Jennifer Carroll's an "outsider."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/sep/03/rick-scott/meet-outsiders-rick-scott-and-jennifer-carroll/	Trying to keep the outsider label that propelled him to victory in the Republican primary for governor, millionaire businessman Rick Scott said on Sept. 2, 2010, that he's picked a fellow outsider for lieutenant governor in Jennifer Carroll. "We have similar backgrounds," Scott said in a press conference in Brandon to announce Carroll's selection. "She's smart, she wants to work hard. She's got experience in the Legislature. She's an outsider like I am." Carroll, who was considered as a potential running mate for Charlie Crist in 2006, has an interesting story. Let's see if it adds up to being an outsider. Carroll, 51, was born in Port of Spain, in Trinidad, but was brought to the United States by her family at a young age. She joined the U.S. Navy and rose from jet mechanic to become the top aide to an admiral. In 1999, she retired from the Navy as a lieutenant commander and started a public relations firm, 3N. & J.C. Corp. She moved to northeast Florida in 1986. We've already ruled that Carroll would be the second woman and first African-American woman elected lieutenant governor. That certainly puts her outside the norms of politics, as does her being born in Trinidad. But Carroll's life after the Navy seems pretty political insider to us. Consider: Carroll ran for Congress in 2000 as a political newcomer. She lost to Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown despite outspending Brown 2-to-1. In 2001, Carroll said she talked with Vice President Dick Cheney about a job on his staff as a "domestic policy adviser." That job never materialized. Later that year, Carroll was nominated by Gov. Jeb Bush to run Florida's Department of Veterans Affairs. Her nomination was confirmed by the Florida Senate. She resigned about a year later to run again for Congress. She lost a second time to Brown. In 2003, she was elected to the state House in Florida District 13, where she has served ever since. She was appointed deputy majority leader by Speaker Johnnie Byrd in 2003 and served as a majority whip from 2004-2006. Carroll's official state House biography also includes the following highlights -- Republican Club of Clay County, "Top 10" Republican Award 1999, 2002; appointed by President George W. Bush to the White House Presidential Scholars Commission, 2001-2004; appointed by President George W. Bush to the Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission, 2004-2007; Black Political Action Committee's 2005 Vikki Buckley Political Leadership Award. Carroll's life story certainly has some of the hallmarks of being a political outsider. She was born outside the United States and spent 20 years working in the Navy. But after retiring from the Navy in 1999, Carroll has very much made politics a key part of her life. She twice ran for Congress, said she was in talks for a job with Vice President Cheney, ran the state's Department of Veterans Affairs, was elected to the Florida House and was considered for Crist's lieutenant governor choice in 2006. So Carroll has some outsider, and some insider. We rate Scott's statement Half True.

pomt-12773	John Hagee calls for "prosecuting women who say God’s name during intercourse."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/22/blog-posting/mega-pastor-john-hagee-wants-jail-women-who-use-go/	A fake story about a televangelist who wants to criminalize enthusiastic pillow talk shows that sometimes humor and the news can make strange bedfellows. A story posted around Feb. 10, 2017, on USPOLN.com (short for U.S. Political News) cites a supposed screed by John Hagee, senior pastor of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas. He also is CEO of Global Evangelical Television. "John Hagee calls for ‘prosecuting women who say God’s name during intercourse’," reads the headline on the story, in which Hagee denounces blasphemy. The text quotes Hagee as saying that "there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God’s name than women who use it during sex." Women who do so should be jailed, the story quotes Hagee. As part of its efforts to fight fake news, Facebook flagged the story as potentially being false. And the story is very false, even though it’s not immediately apparent on many the websites that have shared it. Hagee is a controversial figure for his past remarks, which include criticizing the U.S. Supreme Court striking down same-sex marriage bans as "judicial tyranny" and saying the Holocaust was part of God’s plan to drive Jews from Europe. But he never said women should be jailed for invoking the almighty while having sex. Not that we can prove, anyway.

pomt-06335	Under President Barack Obama, "more Americans are in poverty ... than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/09/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-more-americans-are-poverty-today-any/	In a statement submitted in advance of the Nov. 9, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Michigan, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., decried the reach of poverty today. "More Americans are in poverty today than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago," he said. Although CNBC asked candidates to submit opening statements and posted them on its website, when the debate opened they ditched them. But we thought Gingrich's statement was worth checking. Gingrich has focused on poverty before, accusing President Barack Obama of being "the most successful food stamp president in American history" because "47 million Americans are on food stamps." (We rated this statement Half True.) We decided to check whether Gingrich is right in this new statement, so we turned to the U.S. Census Bureau, which is the official federal source of poverty statistics. Gingrich is right that the numbers go back more than half a century, to 1959, and that the absolute numbers of people in poverty in 2010 -- 46.1 million -- is at its highest since the statistic has been recorded. However, Gingrich ignores population growth since 1959. Over that period, the U.S. population has increased by 73 percent. So today’s poverty rate -- that is, the percentage of people in poverty -- is 15.1 percent, compared to a high of 22.4 percent in 1959. Between 1959 and 1965, the poverty rate was higher every year than it is today. That paints a somewhat different picture than what Gingrich suggested. Still, the poverty rate in 2010 was higher than it’s been in every year for more than four decades save one -- 1983, when the rate was 15.2 percent -- and that’s largely in tune with Gingrich’s larger point. A final note: Unlike his claim about food stamps, Gingrich was more oblique about the blame Obama bears for this statistic. But he does seem to blame the president. After saying that "more Americans are in poverty today than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping records on it over 50 years ago," Gingrich added, "President Obama and his administration have tried to blame the persistent unemployment and economic stagnation on the severity of the recession they inherited. However, the historical record shows us that the deeper the recession the stronger the recovery. America should at worst be finishing the second year of a booming recovery by now." It’s impossible to parcel out blame for the nation’s economic troubles in a scientific fashion, but we think that it’s unfair to place that much of the blame for high poverty on Obama. Our ruling Gingrich is right about the absolute number of Americans in poverty. A better understanding of the extent of poverty in the United States requires looking at the number of people in poverty as a percentage of the population. Measuring it that way, the current poverty rate is not the highest ever. Still, this rate is the second highest in more than four decades, which fits with Gingrich’s general point. However, we think Gingrich overstates the amount of blame Obama personally deserves for this statistic. On balance, we rate his statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/435851f0-ed97-4aab-bb33-a751e6f8c8b4	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-11-09T22:22:22	2011-11-09	['United_States', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-08799	Bill McCollum "backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities."	false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/18/rick-scott/rick-scott-tries-tie-bill-mccollum-arrested-former/	The Rick Scott TV ads just keep coming. Scott, who has poured $38 million into the Republican primary for governor, began airing a controversial new ad on Aug. 17, 2010, that links primary opponent Bill McCollum to ousted and arrested former Republican Party of Florida chairman Jim Greer. The ad is called "Secrecy." Within 24 hours, two prominent Republicans asked that it be removed from the airwaves. It opens with a jail mugshot of Greer, and says (correctly) that Greer has been arrested on charges of fraud and money laundering in connection with his time as state GOP chairman. "And who backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities?" a narrator asks. "Bill McCollum." "As investigators closed in, McCollum said Greer's financial records should be kept secret, not open to the public." The narrator's statement comes with a typed-out McCollum quote from the Associated Press on Feb. 9, 2010. "I don't think it's good for any party to have everything that's done inside the party open to the public and the press," the ad quotes McCollum as saying. The ad then continues with Greer introducing McCollum on the day McCollum announced he was running for governor, and references a statement McCollum made in June 2010 that he didn't think the state should amend its public records laws so that all communications between state legislators would be public. The ad concludes with Greer's mugshot next to a picture of McCollum framed to look like a jail mugshot. "Bill McCollum: He wants to keep it all a secret." The 30-second spot, which is part of Scott's closing argument in a tight primary for governor, was quickly excoriated by current RPOF chairman John Thrasher and Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who serves as chairman of the Republican Governors Association. Both called the ad misleading and false, and asked that it be removed. "The truth is that Bill McCollum's leadership is part of what led to the removal of Jim Greer," Barbour said in a statement. "This ad distorts the facts and was clearly created without any knowledge of what actually took place. It has no place in this primary. We ask Mr. Scott to pull this ad and move forward in the primary in a constructive manner." More specifically, Barbour and Thrasher say that the Scott ad wrongly suggests McCollum was complicit in a cover-up when in fact he helped lead the charge to have Greer removed and investigated. The Scott campaign defends the ad as true, and says it won't be pulled. PolitiFact Florida decided to sort out the difference of opinion by focusing on a pivotal line in the ad, that Bill McCollum "backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities." Sorting through the RPOF finances A little background is in order. The first allegations about improper spending at the state GOP came in late 2008, when newspapers reported that Greer charged personal expenses to the state party during a fundraiser. The $5,100 bill from the Breakers Hotel included using party money on spa treatments, seafood dinners and limousines. Greer said he would repay any personal expenses. Questions escalated in August 2009, after court records were released showing that indicted former House Speaker Ray Sansom charged $173,000 on his Republican Party-issued credit card. Charged expenses included taking his family on a trip to Europe, making visits to Best Buy and spending thousands on flowers, clothing, meals and hotels. The release of the records prompted some Republicans to criticize Greer, who as party chairman was responsible for party finances. Greer famously cut up a party American Express to help mollify critics. But soon thereafter, more party credit card statements were leaked to the press -- statements from Greer, former House Speaker and U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio and RPOF executive director Delmar Johnson. The new statements led to even more questions about how the state GOP was spending its money and led some party leaders to call for Greer's ouster. In January 2010, Greer succumbed to the pressure and resigned. When Thrasher took over as party chairman in February, he ordered an audit of RPOF finances to identify any potential wrongdoing. The audit didn't focus on credit card spending as much as a contract with a consulting company, formed by Greer and Johnson, to do work for the RPOF. The company, Victory Strategies, was paid a 10 percent commission on money raised for the party. The audit revealed that the company received $133,005 in fundraising commissions and another $66,250 for consulting services in 2009. On March 15, Thrasher forwarded results of the audit to McCollum, who asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate. On June 2, the FDLE announced Greer's arrest on one count of organized fraud, one count of money laundering and four counts of grand theft. According to the FDLE, Greer directed Johnson to open a bank account for Victory Strategies with Johnson as the only signatory on the account. This was done to conceal the flow of money to Greer. Between February and October 2009, the RPOF paid Victory Strategies a total of $199,254. Of that, Greer was paid $125,161 while keeping his ownership interest hidden. The FDLE said the payments were for many services that were never performed. PolitiFact Florida previously has ruled on claims related to the scandal. On May 3, we decided that McCollum had committed a Full-Flop on saying he supported transparency in dealing with the RPOF financial scandal. Then on July 13, we rated a claim by Thrasher that McCollum helped to work remove Greer as the head of the state party as True. McCollum's statements In this case, the Scott claim is that McCollum backed Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities. To us, that suggests McCollum was somehow complicit in Greer's scheme. There is no evidence of that, however. Rather, the Scott campaign says it's alleging that McCollum attempted to keep the scheme quiet. According to party leaders and McCollum, the attorney general first learned about the Victory Strategies contract in January, weeks before it was revealed in the media. McCollum said that when he learned about the contract, he asked another party activist attorney if it was legal. He was told yes. (McCollum said he didn't initially know Greer was a beneficiary of the contract). "It was on the face of it a perfectly legitimate contract," McCollum said in a interview on Feb. 9. "Was it outrageous? Absolutely. Was it something that should have never been entered into? Yes." That same day, Feb. 9, reporters paraphrased McCollum as saying that internal party business didn't need to be made public and that releasing credit card statements for past card holders was a decision that should be left to the next chairman. McCollum then provided the quote captured in Scott's ad. "Right now the party matters are totally internal … I don't think it's good for any political party to be having everything that's done inside the party open to the public and the press. On the other hand I think it's very important for the party regulars … (to) all have a clear and confident understanding of what's been going on in terms of everything, credit cards and bank accounts, everything else. I think that's what's been missing, and I think that's what the next chairman will correct." Unfortunately, it's difficult to tell from the quote if McCollum was talking specifically about credit card statements, or about the Victory Strategies contract, or both. Two days later in a campaign statement McCollum clarified his position. He said the Republican Party should conduct a private audit of its finances before he would ask for a public state investigation. "I share the outrage over recent revelations of extravagant contracts and lavish spending," McCollum said. "If audit findings suggest potential criminal activity, I will assist the State Executive Committee in directing these findings to the appropriate law enforcement investigatory agency. The old way of doing business at the Republican Party of Florida enabled an egregious and unforgivable violation of trust between Party leadership and our membership. Now it is time to clean up the mess. I support taking every measure possible to ensure we never again face the challenges before us today." And on Feb. 20, after Thrasher was elected chairman, McCollum called for a full internal forensic audit (as he said he would on Feb. 11), and urged that the results be released publicly (which he didn't say in the statement on the 11th). If any potential illegal activity surfaced during the audit, he said, it should be turned over to law enforcement. "Credit cards should be a part of that. Everything should be," McCollum said. McCollum's statements strike us as a man attempting to shield the Republican Party from bad PR, not someone attempting cover-up potential fraud. In the end, it appears he got bad legal advice from a former party lawyer. Yet, his comments starting on Feb. 11 were clear -- if wrongdoing is found by the party, it will be turned over to the authorities. A month later, McCollum did just that when he presented the RPOF audit findings to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. That also counters Scott's suggestion that McCollum and Greer were somehow holed up at their Tallahassee version of the Alamo surrounded by state investigators. It was McCollum who referred the matter to investigators. And as we've previously ruled, McCollum helped pressure Greer to resign. Our ruling You can argue that McCollum should have pressed for more transparency in handling the matter, and some have. And you can argue that McCollum was too slow to react to concerns over party spending, and some have. You can also argue that McCollum was too easily satisfied by the legal opinion of one person. But that is not what is being alleged in the Scott ad. It says that McCollum "backed Jim Greer's effort to hide financial irregularities." There's no evidence that we find or that the Scott campaign provided that McCollum had any knowledge of Greer's Victory Strategies contract, or any evidence that McCollum attempted to stop a criminal investigation once an RPOF audit revealed potential fraud. We rate Scott's claim False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2010-08-18T19:35:35	2010-08-17	['Jim_Greer', 'Bill_McCollum']
pomt-05098	"Oregon schools receive millions of dollars per year in federal school lunch assistance and yet they are required to spend that money almost anywhere but Oregon."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/29/ron-wyden/ron-wyden-says-food-served-oregon-schools-comes-al/	When the Senate was debating the farm bill recently, Sen. Ron Wyden highlighted the haphazard nature of the way food is purchased and provided to the school lunch program under a program known as USDA Foods. His point was simple: A lot of the food from one program in particular that ends up in school kitchens comes from points far away from the schools serving it. Using local sources of food might be cheaper, he argued, and it certainly would be more nutritious. Wyden offered an amendment that would establish pilot programs at five locations nationwide to see if using local food could be both cheaper and better. Wyden’s amendment, which passed the Senate, would give school officials in five "pilot" areas far more flexibility in deciding where they purchase food. Right now, schools that agree to take part in the program, USDA Foods, are locked into a system that almost always forces them to purchase food from outside Oregon. That program is small, supplying only 20 percent of the food used in school nutrition programs but Wyden said the $11 million a year spent on it for Oregon schools should be used for food produced in Oregon. So he offered an amendment for give states and local districts more flexibility in navigating the USDA Foods system. The program offers a list of mostly bulk items that states purchase and then supply to local districts. According to a USDA description, "Schools are ordering more bulk products that can be processed into kid-friendly items. … Decisions about what products schools order are not based just on the item’s popularity but on its overall usefulness in meeting nutritional standards." Wyden’s amendment would allow local officials, working in collaboration with state purchasing agents, more flexibility in where they can buy the food to overcome a system that brings most of the food to Oregon from other states. While small and limited, Wyden said it’s important nonetheless and changing the program would bring extra dollars to the local economy while also providing more nutritious food. After it passed, the Oregon Democrat drove home the point in a news release: "Oregon schools receive millions of dollars per year in federal school lunch assistance and yet they are required to spend that money almost anywhere but Oregon." That is the kind of statement PolitiFact Oregon can really chew on. There’s no doubt that the federal government spends "millions of dollars" to pay for school meals in Oregon. That part of Wyden’s statement isn’t in doubt. But the second part made us wonder. Is it really true that most of the food purchased for Oregon schools under USDA Foods ended up with food from "almost anywhere but Oregon?" To answer, you have to dive into federal rules governing USDA Foods and some of the department’s school food programs. It is a dense and complicated business that is as close as government gets to an extreme sport. Even the experts admit they don’t always understand all the rules and requirements. Here's just one section: "At the beginning of each school year, State agencies shall establish the per meal rates of reimbursement for school food authorities participating in the Program. These rates of reimbursement may be assigned at levels based on financial need; except that, the rates are not to exceed the maximum rates of reimbursement established by the Secretary under §210.4(b) and are to permit reimbursement for the total number of lunches in the State from funds available under §210.4. Within each school food authority, the State agency shall assign the same rate of reimbursement from general cash assistance funds for all lunches served to children under the Program." Had enough? There’s plenty more, but we’ll spare you. The regulations run 65 pages. Wyden’s spokeswoman Jennifer Hoelzer admitted her boss’s statement was based on piles of "anecdotal evidence" derived from talks with school officials as well as those at the Agriculture Department because detailed records are hard to find. But we found some. The best is a spreadsheet compiled by David Jones at the Oregon Department of Education that was also shared with Wyden. It reveals that only seven food purchases out of 166 during the 2011-12 school year came from Oregon from the USDA Foods program. That’s 4 percent for those of you who need help with the math. Cheese came from Missouri and Minnesota as well as other states. Oregon schools used meatless spaghetti sauce bought in Indiana, applesauce from Michigan and peanut butter from New Mexico. And then there was California, a true category killer that supplied Oregon schools with everything from peaches to salsa to something called "Burrito, Beef & Bean Bulk" and frozen strawberries. Forget Oregon cheese and strawberries, foodies. The only products bought from Oregon vendors were green beans, chicken fajita strips and frozen potato rounds. Are the schools "required" to buy out-of-state food if they choose to take part in USDA Foods? No. USDA Foods is voluntary. But most schools take part which means, as a practical matter, the answer is yes. Schools that take federal money for the nutrition must purchase their food through the USDA’s program. And the rules governing the program almost guarantee the sale will be made out of state. So we conclude with records that all point in the same direction. Following federal procurement rules, which schools have to do to get federal money, leaves them little choice about what to buy and where to buy it, at least for USDA Foods. It’s unknown whether the portion of out-of-state food is similarly lopsided for the entire school nutrition effort in Oregon. But for USDA Foods, the one definitive document we found shows unambiguous results -- 96 percent of food served in Oregon schools and purchased with federal dollars came from another state. That fits within any definition of "almost anywhere but Oregon," which is why we rate this claim: True.	None	Ron Wyden	None	None	None	2012-06-29T17:50:39	2012-06-20	['Oregon']

pomt-05790	Without U.S. Senate action, Texas will have more federal judicial vacancies this year than any other state.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/feb/24/progress-texas/progress-texas-says-texas-will-have-most-federal-j/	Texas will be No. 1 this year -- in federal judicial vacancies, an Austin-based group recently warned. Progress Texas, which describes itself as a "progressive multi-issue organization," said in an online post we spotted Feb. 8, 2012: "Texas has 5 (federal) judicial vacancies today and two more opening this year – more than any other state in the union." The post urged supporters to contact the state’s U.S. senators and urge them to ask Senate leaders to allow confirmation votes by the body on two "consensus nominees," David Campos Guaderrama and Gregg Jeffrey Costa, both nominated by President Barack Obama to fill Texas federal district judgeships. Is Texas truly poised to lead the nation in federal judicial vacancies? According to a Feb. 10, 2012, San Antonio Express-News news article mentioning Progress Texas, the group’s cited nominees have the backing of Texas Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn, both Republicans. And another 16 Obama judicial nominations await Senate approval, the story says, but floor votes have not been scheduled. The article quotes Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond School of Law professor, saying the confirmation votes have not been set because Senate Republicans object to Obama’s January 2012 recess appointment of nominees to the National Labor Relations Board and Richard Cordray to head the Consumer National Protection Bureau. Tobias, who has urged the Senate to act quickly on consensus choices for judgeships, told us in a telephone interview that before Obama’s presidency, the Senate routinely confirmed such nominees in batches. But Republican Senate leaders slowed confirmations of Obama consensus choices to one or two appointees every couple weeks. "It’s just foot dragging," Tobias said. We came across other takes on the Senate's confirmation pace. In a Feb. 14, 2012, statement, U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the Senate was then running 45 judicial nominees behind the body’s pace for confirming judicial nominees when George W. Bush was president. To our inquiry, Beth Levine, a spokeswoman for Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told us by email that the Senate confirmed 124 of Obama’s 174 judicial nominees, or 71 percent, in his first three years as president. In the comparable part of Bush’s term, she said, the Senate confirmed 169 of 215 nominees, or 79 percent. For the like period of President Bill Clinton’s tenure, the Senate signed off on 183 of 219 nominees, 84 percent, Levine said. Levine added that both Obama and Clinton saw two Supreme Court nominees confirmed in the first three years of their presidencies -- a process that has become "more involved and contentious," Levine said, since Democratic filibuster attempts during Bush’s presidency. We asked Progress Texas to elaborate on Texas’ incipient No. 1 ranking. Phillip Martin, the group’s research & policy director, said by email the group’s Feb. 8, 2012, press release making the vacancy claim should have said Texas stands to have the most "emergency" vacancies of any state. The "accidental oversight" on that release, he said, was not repeated in a subsequent release or on other Progress Texas web pages and communications. Not quite: The Progress Texas web page where we'd spotted the claim -- headlined: "CALL NOW: Make a Vote Possible" -- still had the claim posted as of Feb. 20, 2012. After we shared that link with Martin, the language there was amended to refer to emergency vacancies. Separately, Levine told us that Obama has not nominated anyone to fill nearly half of the nation's so-called emergency judicial vacancies. And why are some vacancies labeled emergencies? We learned that the administrative office of the federal court system designates vacated district judgeships as emergencies if the associated district court has a hefty workload and/or if the vacancy has lasted a while. Each district’s "weighted caseload" is devised by statisticians who assign values to different types of cases. A July 1999 footnote posted on the federal courts’ website says the weights account for differences in the time required for judges to resolve various types of civil and criminal actions. "Rather than counting each case as a single case, weights are applied based on the nature of cases. For example, cases involving a defaulted student loan are counted as 0.031 for each case and patent cases are counted as 1.9 cases. The criminal weights are applied on a per-defendant basis." According to the "Judicial Emergencies" web page, a vacant district judgeship is an emergency if that district’s weighted caseload exceeds 600 per judgeship or if the post has been open more than 18 months and the district’s weighted caseload is between 430 to 600 per judgeship. Alternatively, a vacancy is an emergency in a court with more than one authorized judgeship and only one active judge. Nationally in the year that ended Sept. 30, 2011, 509 was the average weighted caseload per federal district judgeship, up from 490 in 2010, 480 in 2008 and 472 in 2007. The federal courts’ website showed that the five emergency Texas vacancies had weighted caseloads ranging from 725 to 806. Those vacancies were created by one judge retiring and four judges shifting to "senior status," a type of semi-retirement where judges usually assume a reduced caseload. The court system’s web pages confirmed that as of mid-February 2012, Texas had more "emergency" federal judicial district court vacancies than any other state. Illinois was next with three emergency vacancies. Yet New York, which had one emergency vacancy, had the most judicial vacancies overall, eight, according to the court system’s breakdown of current openings. Pennsylvania ranked second, with six, followed by Texas and California, at five each. The administrative office maintains another web page titled "Future Judicial Vacancies," which showed 18 expected vacancies in 2012 including two in Texas. U.S. District Judge David Folsom of Texarkana is shown as retiring as of March 17, 2012, and District Judge Hilda G. Tagle of Brownsville is set to reach senior status at the end of 2012. According to the information, New York stands to land two more vacancies this year and California is expected to end up with four additional vacancies. So, New York could have 10 vacant federal judgeships by the end of the year, California could have nine and Texas is shaping up to have seven, leaving it third among states with current or expected vacancies. All these forecasts presume the Senate does not confirm any nominees from those states and that fresh vacancies do not change the states’ vacancy standings. Our ruling Progress Texas said Texas would be No. 1 in federal judicial vacancies this year. That’s not correct. Texas is now tied for third and could rank third by the end of the year, behind New York and California. Still, Texas is and stands to continue to be No. 1 in emergency vacancies. That’s what Progress Texas says it intended to say; unfortunately, it didn’t. We rate the actual claim Mostly False.

pomt-12938	Says Donald Trump warned outgoing Ghana President against last-minute job appointments.	pants on fire!	/global-news/statements/2017/jan/10/blog-posting/no-trump-never-called-departing-ghanaian-president/	Globetrotting fake news aimed to parlay Donald Trump’s name into advertising clicks recently. A website called USA Radio crafted some imaginary thoughts from the incoming American president about the departing president of Ghana. Under the headline "Donald Trump warns outgoing Ghana President," the faux article said, "Talking to the New York Times, Trump acknowledged the efforts of John Mahama in defending Africa’s democracy by peacefully conceding defeat in the country’s elections." It then continued with this purported quote: "As an outgoing president, you don’t have to implement last-minute policies that will make governance tough for the incoming president. You just have to spend the rest of the days on packing. Reverse those appointments and salary increments immediately." Facebook users flagged this for vetting as part of the social media platform’s efforts to stymie fake news. Needless to say, there is no New York Times article quoting Trump as saying this, nor did a search of the Nexis news database uncover any time when Trump spoke about Ghana. A search of the ICANN Whois registry failed to identify the website's operator. Since the December elections in Ghana drew modest press coverage in the United States, a bit of background is in order. Ghana emerged from a military-controlled government in 1992 and since that time has established itself as a stable democracy. Residents of the West African nation went to the polls in early December 2016. Challenger Nana Akufo-Addo defeated the incumbent President Mahama by a million votes. Akufo-Addo took office Jan. 7, 2017, making this the third peaceful handoff from one ruling party to another. Mahama’s administration was marred by charges of corruption, and frequent breakdowns of the electric grid that left homes and businesses in darkness. On top of that, Afrobarometer, an internationally backed public opinion project, found that more Ghanaians trusted Akufo-Addo's party to control inflation and boost jobs. The invented quote from Trump referred to Mahama’s post-election appointments for several key anti-corruption jobs in the government. The slots had been vacant for over a year and the move sparked pushback from some newly elected lawmakers. We reached out to the Trump transition team and did not hear back. Our ruling A fake news website said that Trump had warned the departing president of Ghana to avoid making last-minute job appointments. The article cited a New York Times interview that does not exist. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2017-01-10T10:37:44	2017-01-04	['Ghana']
pomt-00440	Says Beto O’Rourke "has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests."	true	/texas/statements/2018/aug/22/silvestre-reyes/beto-orourke-arrested-1990s-burglary-and-dwi/	Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke of Texas has said that in younger days he was twice arrested in his hometown of El Paso--once, he says, for leaping a campus fence and the other time for driving while intoxicated. Readers have asked us whether the third-term congressman challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz has a criminal history. We decided to fact-check mention of the arrests in a 2012 TV ad that also was screenshot for an April 2017 Texas Tribune news story. In the ad, sponsored by then-U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, text next to what looks like O’Rourke’s mugshot states that the "facts" are that O’Rourke has a "criminal record" including burglary and DWI. The ad’s narrator says O’Rourke "has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests." That he does, we confirmed, which he’s acknowledged since his first run for office. We tried to phone and email Reyes about his claim and failed to connect. Next, we attempted to get our own fix on the facts by seeking documentation of the DWI arrest through a public information request to the El Paso Police Department. Martin Rodriguez, a department records specialist, said by email the agency had no responsive records. We similarly queried the University of Texas at El Paso about the earlier arrest and didn’t immediately hear back. A background check Separately, we ran a background check of O’Rourke using the LexisNexis service. According to the results, O’Rourke’s May 1995 misdemeanor arrest on the UTEP campus was later declined and his September 1998 misdemeanor DWI arrest in El Paso was dismissed. The check gave us case numbers for the arrests enabling us to fetch an El Paso County record stating that O’Rourke was initially arrested in May 1995 and that case was disposed of in February 1996. We saw too that after the DWI arrest, according to another county record, O’Rourke was referred to a misdemeanor diversion program in March 1999 and completed "DWI school" in May 1999. That document’s last entry, dated Oct. 20, 1999, says: "Misdemeanor diversion completed successfully." Campaign: O’Rourke often confirms arrests When we sought detail from O’Rourke’s spokesman, Chris Evans, he said by email that O’Rourke had consistently addressed his arrests, notably during campaign stops in Paris, Sunnyside, San Antonio and Houston, where O’Rourke told a group in August 2018 that he spent a night in the El Paso County jail after what he referred to as his 1995 arrest for criminal trespass. In San Antonio, a resident told O’Rourke she’d seen what someone described as his mugshot. O’Rourke replied: "More than 20 years ago, I was arrested--not once, but twice. So you should know that and we should all own that, if asked." O’Rourke specified that he’d been arrested for attempting to hop a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso and later, he said, for a "far more serious mistake: I drove under the influence of alcohol. There’s no justifying that." April 2005 news story The oldest published account of the arrests appears to be an April 2005 El Paso Times news story about O’Rourke’s successful run for a seat on the El Paso City Council. The story, which we found by searching the Nexis news database, quoted the incumbent, Anthony Cobos, stressing O’Rourke’s DWI arrest. Cobos, who later served as county judge before being convicted on embezzlement charges, said at the time: "I think you lead by example and his example speaks for itself." According to the story, O'Rourke was arrested on a DWI charge in September 1998 that was dismissed in 1999 after he completed a court-recommended DWI program. "I've been open about that since the very beginning. I have owned up to it and I have taken responsibility for it," O’Rourke told the paper. The Times further reported that court records showed that O’Rourke earlier was arrested in 1995 at UTEP on a burglary of building charge, which was later dropped. O’Rourke told the paper: "That happened while I was in college. I along with some friends were horsing around, and we snuck under the fence at the UTEP physical plant and set off an alarm. We were arrested by UTEP police. ... UTEP decided not to press charges. We weren't intending to do any harm," he was quoted saying. O’Rourke’s campaign later provided a photo of a document Evans described by email as the original UTEP police report on O’Rourke’s arrest there. It says O’Rourke and two other students were arrested at the university’s Physical Plant under the "burglary" portion of the state penal code, section 30.02, for "attempted forcible entry." Congressman Reyes’ TV ad Seven years later, then-Rep. Reyes unveiled his ad, which was still viewable online as of Aug. 22, 2018. A May 2012 Times news story on the ad quoted O’Rourke saying that he was driving an intoxicated friend home when he was arrested for DWI. The story said that according to police records, O’Rourke completed a diversion program and the charge was dismissed. In August 2017, more recently, O’Rourke described the arrests to an East Texas newspaper. The Palestine Herald-Press quoted him saying: "Some 20 years ago, I was charged with driving under the influence and, during my college years, I jumped a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso which resulted in a burglary charge," O'Rourke said. "I was not convicted of either. "Both incidents were due to poor judgement and I have no excuse for my behavior then. However, since then, I have used my opportunities to serve my community and my state. I'm grateful for the second chance and believe that we all deserve second chances." Our ruling A 2012 Reyes TV ad still viewable online six years later said O’Rourke "has a criminal record that includes DWI and burglary arrests." O'Rourke's comments and records indicate that UTEP police arrested O'Rourke in 1995 for burglary, a misdemeanor charge disposed of the next year. In 1998, El Paso police arrested O'Rourke for DWI, a misdemeanor charge that was dismissed after he completed "DWI school" the next year. We rate the claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com UPDATE, 6:40 p.m., Aug. 22, 2018: After this fact-check initially posted, O'Rourke's campaign provided a photo of a document described as the UTEP police report on the 1995 arrest. We've added that information, also noting that O'Rourke and fellow students were arrested for "attempted forcible entry" under the section of the Texas penal code titled "Burglary." We also added O'Rourke's reference, in Palestine, to the burglary arrest. These additions didn't affect our rating of Reyes' claim.

pomt-08858	"Obama admits he is not a citizen."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/05/chain-email/e-mail-sends-readers-youtube-video-where-obama-adm/	Forget a birth certificate from Hawaii. Forget the fact that two Hawaiian newspapers published notices of his birth from 1961. A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll released Aug. 4, on Obama's 49th birthday, found that 27 percent of Americans still think Barack Obama was probably or definitely not born in the United States. So what should we make of an e-mail that sends readers to a YouTube video in which Obama blandly states that he was born in Kenya? "Obama admits he is not a citizen -- read before this is pulled," the e-mail says. "Unbelievable!!!!!" "Why has he not been impeached?" "The amazing part of this travesty is Americans continue allowing themselves to be ruled by an illegal alien." The 11-minute video, which has been online since May 2, is titled "Not Natural Born -- TRUTH MATTERS." It starts with a 30-second clip of Obama speaking before a group of adults. It begins in mid-sentence: " . . . that maybe I'm not an American citizen. Some people said he has a forged birth certificate. Well, first of all, it's true I'm not an American. I was not born in Hawaii. I wasn't born in the United States of America. I come from Kenya." If you listen closely, you can hear bad editing. The volume and sound quality of his voice change at key points, such as between "it's true I'm not" and "an American." The video never shows his lips where he makes his key admissions, so you can't see if his lips are in sync with what he's saying. And his audience offers no reaction to what should be a stunning admission. So where did that portion of the video come from? The logo at the bottom of the video reads obamasnippets.com, which takes you to a YouTube humor channel that features seven videos in which Obama's words have been edited for laughs. One example is the "Obama DRUNK!" video, where his comments have been slowed to make it sound as if he's intoxicated and hitting on an audience member. The YouTube channel makes the intent clear: "This is not 'political.' This is just for fun. This is not an 'Anti-Obama' site. This is not a 'Pro-Obama' site. This is an 'Obama Humor' site. . . . All Snippets made with 100% Obama's voice. No imitations! (That would be too easy.)" The video in which Obama is heard saying "I'm not an American," called "Birthers' Delight - Part 1," includes a disclaimer indicating that it's a spoof. The "Truth Matters" video has stripped away the disclaimer and added background music, perhaps in an attempt to disguise the telltale signs of editing. There's one other indication that the Obama "confession" is a hoax. Some anti-Obama sites that have posted the video have included a description beginning, "This video starts out with some content from obamasnippets.com, which, of course is contrived." But on the YouTube page, the word "contrived" is not visible, unless a viewer opens the full description box. However, nothing in the video itself warns viewers that the Obama clip is fabricated and the video includes a photo -- proven fake more than a year ago by our friends at Snopes.com -- of Obama holding a landline telephone receiver upside down. By Aug. 4, 2010, the Truth Matters video had been viewed over a million times on YouTube, 176 times more often than the original ObamaSnippets.com video, where its humorous nature is clear. Truth does matter, but not to the makers of the Truth Matters video or to the creators of the "Obama admits" e-mail.

pomt-02671	"The Obama administration has used the Espionage Act to go after whistleblowers who leaked to journalists ... more than all previous administrations combined."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/10/jake-tapper/cnns-tapper-obama-has-used-espionage-act-more-all-/	The federal criminal charges filed against National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden make it seven times that the Obama administration has used the Espionage Act against government workers who shared information with the press. In at least two instances, the government’s investigations have delved into the practices of reporters and news organizations and put reporters in legal jeopardy. This has raised red flags among defenders of the media. In a vigorous exchange on CNN’s The Lead, host Jake Tapper asserted to Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post that "the Obama administration has used the Espionage Act to go after whistleblowers who leaked to journalists ... more than all previous administrations combined." On one level, a simple tally would address Tapper’s claim and -- spoiler alert -- the raw numbers back him up. But a scrupulous vetting of the record uncovers important ambiguities in the entire business of talking about leaks in Washington. The basic numbers Most tallies, like the one by the investigative service ProPublica, begin with Daniel Ellsberg and the release of the Vietnam War era documents known as the Pentagon Papers. Including Ellsberg, the government has used the Espionage Act 10 times to prosecute government workers who shared classified information with journalists. If we push back to 1945, there is one more case. So of those 11, seven have taken place while Barack Obama has been president. Law professor David Pozen at Columbia University, has researched the culture of unauthorized disclosures in the nation’s capital and said generally, there has been an uptick in these prosecutions on Obama’s watch.. "There’s not really any doubt," Pozen said."The spirit of the assertion is correct." The whistleblower label debate The Justice Department does not quibble about number of prosecutions but in a statement to PunditFact, the department said: "It is definitely not the case that anyone who leaks classified information is a whistleblower. Very few of those prosecuted in recent years for unauthorized disclosures even sought to be considered that way." To take a couple of examples, in 2010, State Department contractor Stephen Kim was indicted for providing information about North Korea to Fox News. Later that year, Jeffrey Sterling, a Central Intelligence Agency officer, was indicted for sharing information with a journalist James Risen about America’s work to counter Iran’s nuclear program. Both defendants have pled not guilty. There is little suggestion that whatever they might have revealed had to do with any government abuse or that the leakers wanted to raise broad policy concerns. The Legal Information Institute at Cornell School of Law defines a whistleblower as "an employee who alleges wrongdoing by his or her employer of the sort that violates public law or tends to injure a considerable number of people." No matter how broadly interpreted, Kim and Stirling don’t seem to fit that definition. In a statement given to ProPublica, the Justice Department said it does not target whistleblowers who follow the rules, but "we cannot sanction or condone federal employees who knowingly and willfully disclose classified information to the media or others not entitled to receive such information." We raised this issue of who is and isn’t a whistleblower with Tapper and he said in the fast pace of a live interview, he might have wanted to use slightly different words to make his point. "It would be better to say ‘leakers, many of whom are seen as whistleblowers,’ instead of just ‘whistleblowers’," Tapper said. "If for no other reason that the focus would be on the administration’s aggressive use of the Espionage Act to clamp down on whistleblowing and journalism that holds the U.S. government accountable." As for the claim, though, it does not matter much. If you pull out the Kim and Stirling cases, by the same standard, you’d likely drop one of the pre-Obama cases too and that would still leave the Obama administration using the Espionage Act five times compared to three times before he took office. The mechanics of prosecutions Other factors could muddy the tally. The Obama administration inherited two of the cases from President George W. Bush’s Department of Justice. The indictments took place under Obama but "the wheels started turning before him," Pozen said. So potentially, someone could argue that these cases are not really his prosecutions. On the other hand, that doesn’t affect the technical accuracy of Tapper’s claim. In addition, administrations have a variety of ways to crack down on unauthorized disclosures. Tapper’s focus on the Espionage Act might be accurate, but it overlooks other tactics used by previous White House regimes, said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center at New York University School of Law. "Instead of criminally prosecuting media leaks, the government has relied on administrative sanctions and penalties," Goitein said. These are extremely difficult to track because just about all of the details are protected by personal privacy laws. Goitein pointed to other laws that can and have been brought to bear, including Section 641 of Title 18 in the U.S. Code. It prohibits theft of government property. It was used in 2002 against a Drug Enforcement Agency official who gave sensitive, not classified, information to a London newspaper. While capital punishment isn’t an option, in other respects, a conviction under Section 641 can be just as harsh as a violation under the Espionage Act. But neither a charge of theft nor an administrative sanction change the accuracy of the specific details in Tapper’s claim. A look at the reasons behind the uptick under Obama lies outside the scope of this fact-check. For a complete discussion, we recommend Pozen’s recent article, "The leaky leviathan:Why the government condemns and condones unauthorized disclosures of information." Among other factors, digital technology both makes leakers easier to find and opens the door to disclosures on a grand scale as in the Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden cases. Our ruling Tapper said more than all previous administrations combined, the Obama administration has used the Espionage Act to go after whistleblowers who leak to journalists. The number of cases involving that law support Tapper’s statement. There is reasonable debate over whether the whistleblower label applies to all cases and Tapper said he could have been more precise. However, the Justice Department does not challenge the basic figures and the experts we contacted affirmed the general accuracy of the claim. We rate the statement True.

In Honduras, it’s 1 in 14."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/16/cokie-roberts/cokie-roberts-chances-getting-murdered-new-york-ar/	After a bloody Fourth of July weekend in Chicago and a humanitarian crisis ensuing at the borders, the country’s politicos remain divided over how to address violence at home and those escaping violence abroad. There’s no doubt that the 52,000 unaccompanied minors arriving at the U.S border this year are fleeing high crime and high poverty. What to do about them is a different question. For ABC pundit Cokie Roberts, the staggering murder rates of Central America make immigration reform a moral no-brainer. "I heard a report this week that in New York, your chances of getting murdered are 1 in 25,000," said Roberts on This Week on July 13, 2014. "In Honduras, it’s 1 in 14. You can’t send children back home to that." A reader asked us about Roberts’ statistic, which we were curious about as well. What we found is an interesting case study of how wrong information gets spread, and how corrections don’t always work. He said, she said Roberts said she heard the statistic on the July 10, 2014, episode of MSNBC’s Morning Joe. On that show, economic analyst Steve Rattner used United Nations data in a discussion about immigration reform with host Joe Scarborough. "Let me put this in perspective for you," Rattner said. "In Honduras, you had a 1 in 14 chance of being murdered. In the city of New York, you have a 1 in 25,000 chance of being murdered. I can’t even imagine what it’s like to be in a place like that." When we reached out to Rattner’s researcher, Sundas Hashmi, she said that these rates "were unfortunately incorrect" and resulted from a transcription error. Rattner corrected the mistake on his Twitter the same day. But the false fact flew past Roberts, who doesn’t tweet. "Those of us who refuse to use social media sometimes miss things. But not enough to use social media," Roberts wrote us in an email. "And now I will return to writing about the 1850s, where tweeting only came from birds." Nonetheless, let’s look at the numbers. The odds are not in Honduras’ favor So to figure out your chances of getting murdered in Honduras or New York City, we first need the murder rates of both places. According to data from the United Nations, Honduras has the world’s highest murder rate: 90.4 murders per 100,000 people. Honduran sources report lower rates of about 75 to 80 homicides per 100,000 people, though criminal justice professor Frank Zimring says the margin of error "that far into the stratosphere" makes the difference trivial. Honduras’ deadliest city, San Pedro Sula, is also the world’s deadliest, with 187 murders per 100,000 people, reports Mexican think tank Seguridad Justicia Y Paz. In New York City, the FBI reported 419 homicides in a population of around 8.3 million in 2012. This comes out to a rate of about 5.1 homicides per 100,000 people. The U.S. averaged a rate of 4.7 in the same year. Here’s two charts that underscore the disparity between Honduras and New York: We then need to put that data into the same context as Roberts’ numbers-- your chances of getting murdered. That requires average lifespan data, which is reported by World Bank (73 years in Honduras and 79 years in the U.S.). With that information, we can calculate your chances of getting murdered in Honduras and New York in one year and in a lifetime. The discrepancy is big, but not as big as Roberts stated: Chances of being murdered Per year Per lifetime What Roberts said Honduras 1 in 1100 1 in 15 1 in 14 U.S. 1 in 21,000 1 in 270 San Pedro Sula 1 in 530 1 in 7 New York 1 in 20,000 1 in 250 1 in 25,000 As you can see from the chart above, the chances of getting murdered in Honduras are 1 in 1100 per year compared to 1 in 20,000 per year in New York. Over a lifetime, the chances of being murdered in Honduras are 1 in 15, compared to 1 in 250 in New York. That makes Honduras more dangerous but not nearly to the levels Roberts described. What Rattner may have done, and what Roberts repeated, was compare figures approaching the chances of being murdered in Honduras in a lifetime (1 in 15) to the chances of being murdered in New York in one year (1 in 20,000). Behind the numbers Even if Roberts (and Rattner) used the statistic correctly, criminologists warned us about using the figures to make comparisons. Crime rates are usually given as the number of crimes committed per 100,000 to account for different population sizes. This makes it easier to compare violence, according to Harold Pollack, co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab. "In Chicago, for example, we have the most amount of homicides, but we’re also a large city," he said. Averaged out over population size, Detroit, New Orleans and 18 other American cities have higher rates than Chicago’s." Since the general rates don’t capture the demographic of the victims, the chances of getting murdered will vary greatly. For example, men are more likely to be murdered than women, because homicide victims tend to match the profiles of homicide offenders across the world, Zimring said. According to The Economist, men in Honduras have a 1 in 599 chance of getting murdered every year, or 1 in 9 over a lifetime (assuming a life expectancy of 71 years). Geography, race, and age are also factors. "The risks are extremely uneven, depending on where you are and who you are," Zimring said. "In Honduras, if you’re a male, (the chances) are pretty good. If you’re a child, that doesn’t tell your chances in the next five years but when you turn 16, life gets pretty tough. So these numbers are simultaneously misleading and accurate." Zimring also cautions against comparing apples to oranges, particularly since one hot spot for typically drug-related murders in Honduras can skyrocket the entire country’s rate. New York’s rate actually gives a sense of what a safe large American city looks like, said Pollack. According to FBI data, Flint, Mich., has the country’s highest murder rate, 62 murders per 100,000 people, which is closer to Honduras’s murder rate but still pales in comparison to San Pedro Sula’s. So even if you’re comparing the deadliest cities in America to their Honduran equivalents, the Central American ones are much worse. The bottom line, experts and pundits agree, is that Honduras is a much more dangerous place. "Their murder rates put ours in perspective," Pollack said. "Even with all of those magnifications, you still don’t want to move to Honduras to feel safe," Zimring said. The ruling Roberts said, "In New York, your chances of getting murdered are 1 in 25,000. In Honduras, it’s 1 in 14." Roberts said she got the statistic from Rattner, who first reported the number on Morning Joe. But Rattner acknowledged that his figures were inaccurate and posted a correction on Twitter after the show. Roberts doesn’t have a Twitter account, and so she repeated Rattner’s wrong figures a few days later on ABC’s This Week. That’s how the bad statistic got spread, but Roberts and Rattner do have a point. The chances of getting murdered in Honduras are greater than they are in New York or the United States -- just not to the degree that they said. We rate the claim Half True.
