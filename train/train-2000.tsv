pomt-08906	Over the last 10 years, incomes for the top 1 percent "have grown." Meanwhile, the bottom half of the country, "they've seen their wages stagnate."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/29/donna-brazile/brazile-claims-income-has-grown-top-1-percent-stag/	During the July 25, 2010 roundtable of ABC's This Week, Democratic strategist Donna Brazile made the case for extending tax cuts for low and middle-income families, rather than for the wealthy. "Everyone is concerned about the deficit, and that's why we have to be careful how we frame this. I mean, you and I both know that -- Stephen, that over the last 10 years we've seen the top 1 percent, their incomes have grown. Meanwhile, the bottom half of the country, the bottom half of all income earners, they've seen their wages stagnate," she said. Income inequality has become a fairly common Democratic talking point, so we decided to weigh in on the claim that while income for the top 1 percent has been increasing, it's been largely stagnant for the bottom half of the country. Brazile's office told us to check out a June 2010 report by Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher for the left-learning Center on Budget and and Policy Priorities. Sherman uses data from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number cruncher for Congress, to graph income for different groups over time. The data starts in 1979 and goes through 2007. "After-tax incomes nearly quadrupled for the top 1 percent of Americans in the last three decades, while barely rising among middle- and lower-income households," Sherman writes. We tracked down the raw CBO figures to see if our own calculations would match Sherman's. The numbers, which come from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Current Population Survey (CPS), show average, inflation-adjusted to 2007, after-tax income. The chart shows how income has changed over time for five different income categories set by the IRS. There is additional data on the top 1 percent. No matter how you slice it, Brazile is on firm ground. Those with incomes in the bottom 20 percent had mean income of $16,100 in 1997. In 2007, it climbed to $17,700 -- or up 9.9 percent. For the group on the next rung up the ladder, income grew by 15.9 percent. For those ranked between 41 and 60 percent of income --only some of whom are in the bottom 50 percent -- income grew from $48,000 in 1997 to $55,300, or about 15.2 percent. That’s not stagnant, but it’s small potatoes compared to a 74.6 percent jump in income for the top 1 percent of earners. Mean income for that group climbed from $755,700 to slightly more than $1.3 million between 1997 and 2007. We then moved to income data from the U.S. Census. Those inflation-adjusted figures start in 1967 and go through 2008. Looking at the 10 years, 1998 to 2008, mean reported income for those at the bottom fell by 4.2 percent; for the next lowest income group it dropped by 3.9 percent, and for the group that includes some in the lowest half of incomes and some who are not, income decreased by 2.5 percent. During the same period, income for the top 5 percent (the figures do not include information on the top 1 percent), increased by about 0.5 percent. We should note, however, that if we look at income for the top 5 percent between 1998 and 2007 (as opposed to 2008 when the economy began spiraling downward), that's a 1.7 percent increase. Finally, we contacted numerous independent economic experts, who, for the most part, said that Brazile's argument is accurate. "The big picture statement is exactly right. No gains for bottom half, big gains for top 1 percent," wrote Irwin Garfinkel, professor of contemporary urban problems from Columbia University. Edward Wolff, economics professor at New York University, told us that, based on his calculations from the the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances, "income of the bottom half fell by 9 percent over the last 10 years [from 1998-2008] while the income of the top one percent rose by 40 percent." A few experts did take issue with Brazile's use of the phrase "the last 10 years." As we pointed out, the most recent data for the CBO ends in 2007. Census figures only go through 2008. If Brazile was truly talking about the last 10 years, i.e. from 2000 to 2010, as opposed to the last 10 years for which the data is available, one may argue that she engaged in a little bit of extrapolation. Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, told us that "more and more of the compensation of the top 1 percent depends on the stock market," which took a plunge during the ongoing recession. Still, Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California-Berkeley, argues in a July 2010 paper that the "Great Recession is unlikely to have a very large impact on top income shares and will certainly not undo much of the dramatic increase in top income shares that has taken place since the 1970s". Sherman also pointed out that by "convention, it is often accepted to talk about the last 10 years as meaning the last 10 years for which the data exist." We also note that Brazile mentioned "wages" in the last part of her statement, which is a narrower term than income. Still, based on our review of the context of the conversation, our discussion with experts, and the statement itself --which mentions income twice, it seems clear that she was talking about income in both cases. Donna Brazile said that while the incomes for the top 1 percent have climbed, they've been largely stagnant for the bottom half of the country. We consulted data from the Congressional Budget Office, the U.S. Census, and just to be sure, we double checked with independent economics experts. The CBO numbers showed relatively small increases in income for those in the bottom half, compared with the 74.6 percent gain for the top 1 percent. Mean income for the top 1 percent rose from $755,700 in 1997 to slightly more than $1.3 million 10 years later. The most recent 10-year data -- from Census -- shows income falling for those in the bottom 50 percent and increasing for the top 5 percent. Most of the experts we talked to said Brazile’s underlying argument is on solid ground. As a result, we rate this True.	None	Donna Brazile	None	None	None	2010-07-29T11:48:49	2010-07-25	['None']

pomt-11519	"3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend."	mostly true	/california/statements/2018/feb/19/jackie-speier/fact-checking-sad-statistic-number-women-murdered-/	The resignation of two White House aides accused of physically abusing their wives has shone a brighter spotlight on the scourge of domestic violence. President Trump, who initially praised the work of one of the aides and wished him well, said one week after that he is "totally opposed to domestic violence." Meanwhile, California Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat who represents the San Francisco area, weighed in through Twitter with an alarming statement: "3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend." Domestic violence plagues all corners of the United States, no matter a community’s political leanings, economic status or demographic make-up. Still, we wanted to know whether the congresswoman’s provocative claim was accurate and what source of information she relied on. We set out to fact check Speier’s sad statistic. Our research Rep. Speier, a survivor of gun violence, has been a strong voice for gun control and for stopping sexual assaults. Her spokeswoman pointed us to an NBC news article which says "nearly three women are murdered every day in the U.S. by current or former romantic partners." That’s slightly different from the congresswoman’s tweet, which did not specify former partners. But it’s fairly close. The NBC article cited data from a 2017 Violence Policy Center report called When Men Murder Women. Representatives at the policy center could not be reached for comment. After examining the report, we found it somewhat supports Speier’s statement, with a few caveats. It analyzed 2015 homicide data collected by the FBI. It found 928 female homicide victims were "wives or intimate acquaintances of their killers." That works out to 2.54 female victims killed by an intimate partner on average per day in the United States. While Speier stated "women," ages were not specified in the report. The report, which is the most complete and current we could find, indicates the assailants were not just husbands or boyfriends, but also ex-spouses and former boyfriends. Common claim Several domestic violence prevention groups have cited the same "three women murdered" figure on their websites. At least two of these, the National Organization for Women and the American Psychological Association, cited data that’s a decade or more older from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an office at the U.S. Department of Justice. The National Organization for Women, for example, cited federal statistics from 2005 that show, on average, about 3.2 women were killed per day by an intimate partner in the United States. Shari Miles-Cohen, senior director of the Women’s Programs Office at the American Psychological Association, said the statistic dates to a 2003 Bureau of Justice Statistics report, but also matches with more recent homicide findings, including from 2013. Missing data We found a note of caution in a 2013 Bureau of Justice Statistics report on female homicides by intimate partners. It warned that the relationship between the killer and homicide victim was unknown for anywhere from a quarter to a third of the homicides in any given year. That’s because an offender was not identified or apprehended, according to the report, which examined the years 1993 through 2010. Given that missing data, one could speculate the actual number of women and girls killed through the years by intimate partners would be marginally higher. No matter which report is examined, Gretchen Shaw, associate director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said domestic abuse is all too prevalent and deadly in the United States. "It’s much more common than people ever realize," Shaw said. Our ruling Speier said in a tweet that "3 American women are murdered every day by their husband or boyfriend." Several domestic violence prevention groups make the same claim on their websites, though they cite data that in some cases is a decade old. We examined an analysis of 2015 homicide data by the Violence Prevention Center, and found that about 2.5 females were killed, on average, by an intimate partner each day in the United States. Speier’s statement could have clarified that assailants include former intimate partners, as well as current ones. Also, her tweet references women, though the victims likely include some teenages. Finally, we found a 2013 Bureau of Justice Statistics report that cautions the relationship between female homicide victims and their killers is unknown in as many as one third of the cases. This makes the actual number of women killed by intimate partners difficult to determine. One could argue the tally is higher than the studies show. We found Speier’s claim is on the right track, but could have used a few clarifications. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-06242	For "the average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/01/barack-obama/obama-says-taxes-lower-middle-class/	During a Nov. 30, 2011, speech in Scranton, Pa., President Barack Obama urged Congress to extend a payroll tax cut. He used the platform to try to change perceptions about his stance on taxes. "Now, I know you hear a lot of folks on cable TV claiming that I’m this big tax-and-spend liberal," Obama said. "Next time you hear that, you just remind the people who are saying it that since I’ve taken office, I’ve cut your taxes. … The average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office, just remember that. We have cut taxes for small businesses not once, not twice, but 17 times. The average family’s tax burden is among the lowest it’s been in the last 60 years. So the problem is not that we’ve been raising taxes. We’ve actually been trying to give families a break during these tough times." A couple readers asked us to check this item. One wrote us, "I've seen conservative reactions ranging from, ‘I laughed out loud’ to ‘What a comedian!’" So we decided to take a look. We’ve addressed two of these claims in previous items -- the one about small business tax cuts (rating it Mostly True) and the one about the tax burden being the lowest in 60 years (rating it Mostly True). So in this item, we’re only analyzing Obama’s claim that for "the average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office." First, let’s recap some background about the tax, and the tax cut, that Obama was touting in Scranton. The payroll tax refers to federal taxes taken directly from the paychecks of employed Americans. It is primarily used to fund Social Security and Medicare. For two decades, the payroll tax meant a 6.2 percent deduction on annual earnings for most workers. There were limits to the total amount individuals could be required to pay. In 2009 and 2010, the levy applied to the first $106,800 of salary, meaning no one would pay more than $6,621. Employers paid a matching share. In December 2010, the levy was cut to 4.2 percent for workers as part of an agreement Obama worked out with Congress to extend income tax reductions passed during President George W. Bush’s administration. The payroll tax reduction is in effect for the duration of 2011. But in his American Jobs Act, Obama proposed slicing the payroll to 3.1 percent for workers next year. (To help employers, the president also proposed a 50 percent tax cut in the first $5 million of payroll costs for most small businesses.) Obama has also enacted some other tax cuts while in office, including the American Opportunity Tax Credit for tuition and other educational fees and expansions of the existing Earned Income Tax Credit and child tax credit. He’s also raised some taxes (or didn’t stop them from going up), but these hikes aren’t as relevant for judging his statement in Scranton. Some of the tax hikes haven’t taken effect yet, like a few in the health care bill, so these wouldn’t be a factor in judging the statement that for "the average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office." Other tax increases affect only very wealthy taxpayers. Two taxes would be relevant for this calculation. Obama signed legislation raising taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products soon after taking office; that money goes to pay for children's health insurance programs. The law went into effect in 2009. He also signed the health care law, which includes taxes on indoor tanning that went into effect last year. It’s hard to tell exactly who’s footing the burden for these taxes. However, cigarette and tanning taxes account for a relatively small share of all federal taxes (and zero for people who don’t use either of them). The broadest analyses we’ve seen are the tax analyses produced by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent research organization. We looked at the group’s estimate of what tax burden is borne by Americans of different income levels. The group calculates the average federal tax burden and the average federal tax rate for five quintiles of U.S. households -- or 20-percent groupings, from the top of the income scale to the bottom. These figures include the federal income tax, payroll taxes, and estate taxes, though not federal excise taxes or corporate taxes. (The tax rate figure is the "effective" tax rate -- how much the average taxpayer ultimately pays as a percentage of their cash income. It’s not a "tax bracket," which refers to the income tax rate paid on a taxpayer’s final dollar of income.) To come up with a definition of "middle class," we ignored the top 20 percent and the bottom 20 percent and focused on the three segments of 20 percent each in the middle of the income distribution. We used the tax data for 2008 and for 2011. So how do the numbers look? Here’s the summary. Second-lowest 20 percent 2008 tax burden: $1,715 2011 tax burden: $1,396 Decline of $319 2008 tax rate: 6.7 percent 2011 tax rate: 5.7 percent Decline of 1 percentage point Middle 20 percent 2008 tax burden: $6,290 2011 tax burden: $5,535 Decline of $775 2008 tax rate: 13.6 percent 2011 tax rate: 12.4 percent Decline of 1.2 percentage points Second-highest 20 percent 2008 tax burden: $13,749 2011 tax burden: $13,078 Decline of $671 2008 tax rate: 17.4 percent 2011 tax rate: 16.5 percent Decline of 0.9 percentage points So for each of the three middle quintiles, both the amount of tax paid and the effective tax rate paid declined. Our ruling Every taxpayer is different, and some "middle-class" Americans may have seen their tax rate or their tax burden go up for one reason or another. But Obama was talking about "the average middle-class family." The changes to the tax code made under Obama and the analyses by the Tax Policy Center show that for the middle 60 percent of the income distribution, both the average tax paid and the average tax rate fell between 2008 and 2011. We rate Obama’s statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-12-01T15:38:11	2011-11-30	['None']
pomt-10738	Obama "refused to not only put his hand on his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance, but refused to say the pledge."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/08/chain-email/photo-was-taken-during-anthem-not-pledge/	A chain e-mail says a photograph shows Barack Obama is unpatriotic because he "refused" to say the Pledge of Allegiance and did not put his hand over his heart. In the photograph, Barack Obama is standing in front of an American flag with his hands clasped just below his waist. Beside him are Bill Richardson and Hillary Clinton, with their hands on their hearts. The e-mail notes that Obama's middle name is "Hussein" and says he "REFUSED TO NOT ONLY PUT HIS HAND ON HIS HEART DURING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, BUT REFUSED TO SAY THE PLEDGE.....how in the hell can a man like this expect to be our next Commander-in-Chief????" But the Time magazine photograph wasn't taken during the Pledge of Allegiance; it was taken during the singing of the Star-Spangled Banner. The Obama photo was taken Sept. 16 in Indianola, Iowa, at the Harkin Steak Fry, an annual political event hosted by U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin. The caption on the Time photo says Obama and the others "stand during the national anthem." Matt Paul, an organizer of the event, and a video from ABC News confirm that the photo was taken as someone sang the Star-Spangled Banner . Oddly, the accurate caption from Time is included in the chain e-mail. But someone has added that "the article said" Obama refused to say the pledge and would not put his hand on his heart. There is no such article on the Time Web site, and searches of the Web and newspaper/magazine databases could only find blog postings that repeat the claim from the e-mail. So it's unclear where the allegation originated. Obama said the e-mail was false and that the picture was taken during the anthem. "My grandfather taught me how to say the Pledge of Allegiance when I was 2," Obama said at campaign stop in Burlington, Iowa. "During the Pledge of Allegiance you put your hand over your heart. During the national anthem you sing." He called the e-mail "irritating" and likened it to others that have falsely said he is a Muslim. The photo has stirred up such a fuss that on Wednesday night the Obama campaign released a letter of support from retired military leaders. "Senator Obama's attackers are peddling lies and smears because they disagree with his strong opposition to the war in Iraq and the rush to war in Iran," wrote Richard Danzig, secretary of the Navy under President Clinton, and retired Gens. Merrill "Tony" McPeak and J. Scott Gration. "We have served this nation for decades, and we know a true patriot when we see one. Barack Obama is a patriot." The photo has also spawned a debate about whether Obama's conduct was proper for the national anthem. Conservative bloggers have pointed out that the federal law for "patriotic and national observances" says that during the Star-Spangled Banner , "all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart; men not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold the headdress at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart." Experts on the national anthem say the law seems a bit out of date, given its reference to a man's "headdress." Yet it's still cited in several military manuals found on the Web. Modern custom does not require a hand over the heart, said Anne Garside, director of communication for the Maryland Historical Society, home of the original manuscript of the Star-Spangled Banner . "I think the bottom line is that you show respect with your demeanor," she said. "Whether you put your hand over your heart, hold your hat at shoulder level or waist level, is really in this day and age irrelevant." She pointed out that "the tune of the Star-Spangled Banner was originally a drinking song. If they can put the words to the tune of a rousing drinking song, to quibble over whether you put your hand over your heart is really ridiculous."

pomt-13004	"Before Leaving, Obama Enacts Rules to Take $3,000 From EVERY American."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/14/conservative-tribune/conservative-website-exaggerates-misleads-post-reg/	President Barack Obama is nearly out the door, but that hasn’t stopped the Internet from raising alarm bells about his policies. A recent post in a website called Conservative Tribune is headlined, "OUTRAGE: Before Leaving, Obama Enacts Rules to Take $3,000 From EVERY American." Other sites repeated this line, including Maine Republic Email Alert, Allen West, Young Conservatives, and Angry Patriot (which amped up the allegation by calling it "CORRUPT"). A reader asked us to delve deeper, so we did. (Conservative Tribune did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) It’s highly misleading. The article cites a Dec. 1, 2016, blog post titled, "Passing $1 Trillion," by the American Action Forum, a group that describes itself as "center-right" and "free-market." (Here’s some background on the group from our friends at FactCheck.org.) As a free-market group, reducing the regulatory burden is a core principle. So for years, the group has been tallying the costs of federal regulations, basing its work on the federal government’s own estimates of a regulation’s impact on both direct and indirect costs, including higher consumer prices, lower wages, and costs related to paperwork and other overhead. Late this year, the tally passed $1 trillion, which prompted the blog post in question. The $3,000 figure stems from the group’s calculation of $1 trillion in costs being spread out among the entire population. "On a per capita basis, there are 324 million people in the U.S., equating to a regulatory burden of $3,080 per person," wrote Sam Batkins, the group’s director of regulatory policy. So the $3,000 figure is based on a nugget of truth. But the Conservative Tribune, and other websites that shared similar headlines, framed the finding in a way that is significantly misleading. Here are five problems in the description. The $3,000-a-person figure For starters, some of the $1 trillion figure that this is based on stems from regulations imposed before Obama took office. The $1 trillion figure "tracked all net present value regulatory costs since 2005, so it includes the entire second half of the Bush administration," Batkins told PolitiFact. By our calculation, final rules under Obama alone accounted for $865 billion. That would produce a figure of $2,670 rather than $3,000. Not a dramatic difference, but one worth pointing out. And the annual cost of Obama’s regulations -- rather than the cumulative cost -- is a bit over $500 a person, according to the group’s calculations. That’s still substantial, but it’s not the wallop that $3,000 would be. The assertion that Obama did this "right before leaving" That’s not the case. This regulatory cost burden has been accumulating in fits and starts since more than a decade ago in 2005. In fact, the figure also includes regulatory costs that either "have been or will be imposed during the next few years," the blog post said. That means that "some of the costs might not be borne until the next decade," Batkins told PolitiFact. This would not hit "every" American, or all at once The headline phrase "take $3,000 from every U.S. citizen" makes it sound like people's taxes are going up $3,000 in one fell swoop. They are not. Rather, this amount would be drained over a long period of time and in myriad ways, with some people getting a bigger hit (by losing a job) and some a smaller hit (by having to pay a little more for products they buy). "It’s correct to say that regulations don’t act like taxes," Batkins said. "Many of the cost estimates take the form of higher prices for some consumer products, cars, air conditioners, and furnaces." This is an estimate, and it was calculated by a group with a perspective The headline does not make clear that these figures are estimates. The American Action Forum’s own post notes, "There is probably no one ‘correct answer’ on the cumulative costs of regulation. These figures are just estimates (unadjusted for inflation) from federal regulators, some more than a decade old, which might have dubious value." And as we’ve noted, the American Action Fund has a free-market orientation. Other groups with different perspectives may frame the statistics accordingly. This calculation leaves out all benefits from these regulations The American Action Forum mentions in its blog post that the government also calculates benefits that spring from these regulatory costs. "There are also benefits associated with many, but not all, of the largest regulations," Batkins told PolitiFact. All told, the group’s blog post says, "AAF recorded $745 billion in annual benefits during the same period." Benefits from regulations implemented under Obama include prevention of foodborne illnesses through inspection, consumer protection in the financial sector, flammability standards for consumer products, reduced energy use from conservation standards, cleaner air from emissions standards, air cargo security standards, oil-well blowout preventer systems and nuclear reactor safety standards, among many others. So, using both the cost and benefit figures, the net cost of regulations would work out to less than $800 a person -- still a net cost, but much smaller than the $3,000 figure cited in the headline. Ultimately, for the headline to cite just the costs but not the benefits amounts to cherry picking. Our ruling The Conservative Tribune published a post titled, "Before Leaving, Obama Enacts Rules to Take $3,000 From EVERY American," and other websites offered posts with similar headlines. The figure is based on a calculation from an anti-regulatory group, though we do give the conclusion some credence because the number is drawn from the federal government’s own estimates. However, the headline glosses over several important caveats. The costs were not solely imposed under Obama, and the ones that were on his watch occurred over an eight-year period, rather than just "before leaving" the White House. Finally, contrary to the headline’s implication, Americans will not be charged a $3,000 fee because of action taken in Obama’s final weeks. Rather, they would experience higher consumer costs or lower wages over many years, with a lot of variation from person to person, and going many years into the future. The calculation completely ignores the estimated benefits of these regulations, with a value that balances out about three-quarters of the cost figure cited. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/85a69956-7bb7-4464-b30d-6d4e640eeab6	None	Conservative Tribune	None	None	None	2016-12-14T14:53:30	2016-12-02	['None']
pomt-10184	"Last week Senator Obama's running mate said, get this, 'Raising taxes is patriotic.' "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/23/john-mccain/he-said-it-was-patriotic-to-pay-higher-taxes/	Joe Biden may never live down his Sept. 18, 2008, comment on ABC's Good Morning America that wealthy Americans should act patriotically by paying more taxes. The Delaware senator and Democratic vice presidential nominee's remarks have proved a useful rallying cry for Republican nominee John McCain in painting Barack Obama as a tax-and-spend liberal. But that doesn't mean it's okay to distort the record, which is what McCain did during a Sept. 22 campaign rally in Reading, Pa., when he told an audience of supporters that "last week Senator Obama's running mate said, get this, 'Raising taxes is patriotic.' " Let's go to the transcript. Kate Snow, the ABC reporter conducting the interview with Biden, starts out discussing Obama's plan to roll back the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, effectively raising taxes on families making more than $250,000. Snow begins: "Anyone making over $250,000…" Biden finishes her thought: "… is going to pay more. It's time to be patriotic, time to jump in, time to be part of the deal, time to help get America out of the rut." Biden made the same point at a Sept. 3 town hall in Sarasota, Fla. One woman wondered what to tell friends who worry that an Obama-Biden victory will mean higher taxes. "It's time to be patriotic. That's what you say to them," Biden answered. It's a debatable argument Biden makes, but clearly he is not praising Obama's patriotism for planning to raise taxes. Rather he's invoking the patriotism of those wealthy taxpayers footing the bill.

pomt-05309	Gov. Scott Walker is helping pay for the criminal defense of a man accused of "boy rape."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/18/graeme-zielinski/wisconsin-democratic-party-spokesman-zielinski-say/	On May 15, Wisconsin Democratic Party spokesman Graeme Zielinski sent out dozens of tweets to his 1,423 followers. The tweets had a recurring theme: Republican Gov. Scott Walker is using his criminal defense fund to help defend a man accused of child sexual enticement. Among the nearly 20 tweets on the subject that day, many were framed as rhetorical questions, such as "DEAR WISCONSIN: Your Governor, @GovWalker, may be bankrolling the criminal defense of a top @WisGOP who tried to rape underage boys." The most jarring message was this one: "@MarkBellingShow, @JerryBaderShow, liar@SykesCharlie, @VickiMcKenna-you guys shud hold fundraiser 4 @GovWalker defense of boy rape." The tweet, in which Zielinski attempts to draw several conservative radio talk show hosts into the fray, flatly states Walker is defending someone accused of a sex assault involving a child. Indeed, the way it was stated it could be read as if Walker has taken a broader position in defense of "boy rape." Wow. We’ll need more than 140 characters to put this one in context: What has happened so far Walker established a criminal defense fund in early 2012 in response to a John Doe criminal investigation by Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm into the actions of former Walker aides when he was Milwaukee county executive. In April 2012, Walker transferred $60,000 from his campaign account into the defense fund. As of May 2012, five people have been charged in the probe, which is ongoing. Walker’s June 5, 2012, recall opponent, Democrat Tom Barrett, and the state Democratic Party have demanded that Walker explain more about his role in the investigation, which is done in a cloak of secrecy -- hence the name, John Doe. They want to know why he established the fund, and what and who the money is being used for. It is unclear if Walker has testified, but if he had he’d be precluded from saying so under the rules. Among those facing charges is Brian Pierick of Sun Prairie, who was charged with two felonies -- child enticement and exposing his genitals -- in connection with text messages he allegedly exchanged with a 17-year-old Waukesha boy in 2010. Pierick has pleaded not guilty. Pierick was not a paid Walker aide, but at one point was listed as the official registrant for the Walker campaign’s website. Pierick was an office assistant at the state Department of Public Instruction dealing with education for homeless children and youth. He was fired from the civil service position shortly after he was arrested. Pierick is the domestic partner and business partner of Timothy Russell, who was a top aide to Walker when he was county executive. Russell has pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of embezzling $23,000 from a veterans group and a political candidate. A criminal complaint says Pierick was acting with a co-conspirator in attempting to lure a 17-year-old into Russell's van for a sexual encounter. The complaint says Russell and Pierick used the screen name "Walker04" to procure online porn involving young boys. In his tweets, Zielinski again and again links Walker to Pierick and the sex crimes charges. But they were not what prompted the investigation. Prosecutors came across them as they were looking into the embezzlement allegations. We asked Zielinski to explain the claim that Walker was helping with Pierick’s defense on the sex crimes charges. He responded via email: "The criminal complaint against Brian Pierick, who is a known associate of Scott Walker and a campaign functionary as well, alleges serious crimes. It is a serious and legitimate question for Scott Walker to answer -- is he paying for the criminal defense of a man accused of these serious crimes." But that’s not what Zielinski said. His tweet claimed Walker is raising money to defend Pierick. And Zielinski provided no evidence of that. Walker has not responded to questions about how or for whom he is using the defense fund. Walker spokesman Ciara Matthews had no comment about Zielinski’s tweets. What the law says State law says candidates can establish a criminal defense fund and that the money can be used for "expenditures supporting or defending the candidate or agent, or any dependent of the candidate or agent, while that person is being investigated for, or while the person is charged with or convicted of a criminal violation" of campaign laws. Kevin Kennedy, director and general counsel for the state Government Accountability Board, said state law was vague about who would be considered an "agent." "An agent is a very broad term," he said. "It becomes a question of fact which people can debate endlessly." Kennedy said he was not able to discuss specifics about the establishment of the Walker defense fund. Walker is not required to publicly disclose how or on whom the fund is spent, he said. The broad definition of an "agent, or a dependent, could be argued to Pierick. But that doesn’t mean Walker has spent anything to help him. And the same same could apply to literally hundreds of people. At no point has the governor defended Pierick or given any indication that he is coming to Pierick’s defense. Pierick is charged with two felony sex crimes involving underage males -- not campaign law or government work violations. And he’s hardly a "top Republican," as described by Zielinski in one tweet Pierick’s lawyer, Maura McMahon, is with the state public defender’s office -- paid for by taxpayers because the court has determined that Pierick can’t afford to pay a private lawyer. No obvious Walker defense help there. The Zielinski tweets are loaded with innuendo that’s not supported in any way. He’s using social media shorthand in a brazen effort to link Walker to defending Pierick amid the allegations of sex crimes. He suggests or imply that the governor supports or defends "boy rape." Repeated postings with variations on the same theme are meant to stir attention, with the hope that others will repeat and retweet the claim, and that it will show up in searches. In this case, what’s being recycled is a hot, ridiculous mess … which we call Pants on Fire. (You can comment on this item on the Journal Sentinel's website.)

pomt-00709	"Eighty-five percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/29/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-clinton-foundation-spends-just-/	Much of the discussion about the Clinton family foundation has focused on who donated to it and what they may have expected in return from then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But critics of the Clintons have opened up another line of attack on what is formally known as the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, charging that it doesn’t actually spend very much on charitable works. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh aired this line of argument on April 23, 2015, citing a report in the Federalist, a conservative publication. Here’s a portion of what Limbaugh said: "The Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation -- 99 percent pass-through. The Clinton Family Foundation pass-through is 15 percent. The Federalist reports only 15 percent of the money donated to the Clinton Family Foundation went to actual charitable causes. The bulk of the money donated to the Clinton Family Foundation went to travel, salaries, and benefits. Sixty percent of all the money raised went to other expenses. In other words, folks, 85 percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary." As this claim was circulating, the Clinton Foundation pushed back. The foundation tweeted, "More than 88% of our expenditures go directly to our life-changing work." The difference between 15 percent and 88 percent is wide, so we decided to check Limbaugh’s claim. A representative with Limbaugh’s radio network didn’t answer an email inquiry. An unusual approach for a foundation When most people in the charitable world think of foundations, they think of organizations that give away a lot of money in the form of grants to others who go out and do good works. The Clinton foundation works differently -- it keeps its money in house and hires staff to carry out its own humanitarian programs. This set-up means the Clinton foundation’s finances get complicated in ways other foundations do not. Partly because of that, one of the leading independent groups that track charities -- Charity Navigator -- has been flummoxed about how to analyze that foundation and has stopped rating it, at least for now. Charity Navigator says it has "determined that this charity's atypical business model cannot be accurately captured in our current rating methodology. Our removal of The Clinton Foundation from our site is neither a condemnation nor an endorsement of this charity. We reserve the right to reinstate a rating for The Clinton Foundation as soon as we identify a rating methodology that appropriately captures its business model." What is counted in the foundation’s financials? The Federalist article that Limbaugh cited dug into the Clinton foundation’s tax forms known as 990s, which nonprofits have to file annually with the Internal Revenue Service. Here’s an excerpt from the Federalist article: "When anyone contributes to the Clinton Foundation, it actually goes toward fat salaries, administrative bloat, and lavish travel. Between 2009 and 2012, the Clinton Foundation raised over $500 million dollars according to a review of IRS documents by The Federalist (2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008). A measly 15 percent of that, or $75 million, went towards programmatic grants. More than $25 million went to fund travel expenses. Nearly $110 million went toward employee salaries and benefits. And a whopping $290 million during that period — nearly 60 percent of all money raised — was classified merely as ‘other expenses.’ " The Clinton foundation, on the other hand, gets to its 88 percent going to "life-changing work" by combining the finances of the Clinton Foundation and an affiliated organization, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, that before 2010 had been part of the Clinton Foundation proper. The Clinton Health Access Initiative works with governments and private groups to lower the costs of treatment for HIV/AIDS in the developing world. The Clinton Health Access Initiative was split off from the foundation because "they got so big they needed their own organization to do it," said Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the foundation, in an interview with PolitiFact. But in putting together its annual report for 2013, the Clinton Foundation folded together both groups before calculating the numbers. Some question the logic for doing it this way. "Clinton allies are deliberately conflating the activities and finances of multiple independent nonprofit organizations and hoping you'll view everything together as ‘The Clinton Foundation,’ " Sean Davis, who wrote the Federalist story, told PunditFactc. "That's just not the case, though." The correct number for the Clinton Foundation alone -- which owned the account the tweet was sent from -- was just over 80 percent in 2013, not 88 percent. The Clinton Foundation’s unusual model As we noted earlier, many foundations carry out charitable works by giving money to other organizations that, in turn, do the ground-level charity work, whereas the Clinton foundation’s charitable works are mostly done by people on the foundation’s payroll. "We are an implementing organization rather than a grantmaking organization," said the foundation’s Minassian. That’s why the Clinton Foundation’s 990s show a relatively small amount of money categorized as "grants" -- only about 10 percent of all expenses in 2013. The foundation says its own employees are doing its charitable work. The annual report -- which, remember, includes both the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative -- says that 7 percent of expenditures were spent on "management and expenses" and 4.5 percent for "fundraising." (The numbers on the 990s for the two entities are in the same ballpark.) Add those two percentages together and you get almost 12 percent; subtract that from 100 percent and you get the magic 88 percent figure the foundation cited. An independent academic CPA who specializes in nonprofit foundation finances said Limbaugh’s error was in assuming that all spending beyond grants amounted to wasteful overhead. "When Mr. Limbaugh says most of the spending is on salaries, travel, and other, that is not particularly informative," said Linda Parsons, an associate professor of accounting at the University of Alabama's Culverhouse College of Commerce. "Travel and salaries for those who are directly carrying out the mission of the organization are much different than salaries and travel for executives who are networking in order to raise funds or for those who manage the organization. The response from the Clinton foundation that they carry out their missions directly, rather than outsource it to another organization or series of organizations, makes sense given that the Clinton Foundation reports travel, salaries, depreciation and conferences directly." Of course, Parsons’ interpretation depends on trusting the Clinton foundation’s characterization of its expenditures. As with any institution that files tax forms, the Clinton foundation has to characterize on its own what counts as "management" and what counts as spending on front-line charity work. The Federalist article says the foundation’s tweet exaggerates when it says money spent "directly" on "life-changing work," when in fact the group, by its own calculations, "spent nearly $8.5 million – 10 percent of all 2013 expenditures – on travel. Do plane tickets and hotel accommodations directly change lives? Nearly $4.8 million – 5.6 percent of all expenditures – was spent on office supplies. Are ink cartridges and staplers ‘life-changing’ commodities?" In response to a PolitiFact request, the Clinton Foundation said the expenditures for its programs are "inclusive of salaries for staff, large-scale conferences (which is how the foundation convenes partners to take action such as the Clinton Global Initiative and the Health Matters conference), training for farmers and other beneficiaries, as well as direct program expenses like purchasing seeds and fertilizer for our agricultural programs and medical equipment for our public health work." Reasonable people can disagree about how to categorize expenses, said Janet S. Greenlee, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Dayton business school. "There is no approved, required, or suggested method for allocating costs between program and nonprogram spending, so two charities that have the same financial events may have totally different financials," Greenlee said. "Limbaugh is saying everything that’s not direct service must be a waste of money, while the foundation is probably estimating that most of its other costs are actually direct service and so are accounted as such. The ‘truth,’ if there is such a thing, is somewhere in between." The foundation sent PolitiFact a rough geographic breakdown for program spending in 2012 and 2013. It cited expenditures split between 66.2 percent for the United States, 18.1 percent for South America, 5.6 percent for Southeast Asia, 4.9 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa, 3.6 percent for Central America and the Caribbean, 1.2 percent for West and Central Africa and 0.4 percent for Mexico. That’s more than we had expected to see in domestic spending -- we’re checking with the foundation on why that was so high, and will report their explanation if we receive one -- but even if the foundation devoted as little as one-third of its expenses to programs outside the U.S., then Limbaugh’s 15 percent estimate would be too low. To offer some context, spending 88 percent of expenses on charitable programs, as the Clinton foundation says it does, would actually be pretty good by industry standards. Parsons said the average reported across all organizations in the National Center for Charitable Statistics is 81 percent -- equal to the Clinton Foundation’s rate on its own -- and the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance suggests a minimum of 65 percent. "The foundation exceeds that," Parsons said. Our ruling Limbaugh said "85 percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary." There’s a grain of truth here -- roughly 85 percent of the foundation’s spending was for items other than charitable grants to other organizations, and a large chunk of this 85 percent did go to Clinton Foundation staff for travel, salaries and benefits. However, the foundation says it does most of its charitable work in-house, and it’s not credible to think that the foundation spent zero dollars beyond grants on any charitable work, which is what it would take for Limbaugh to be correct. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02523	John Cornyn "voted twice in 2013 to back Obama’s amnesty plan."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/feb/10/steve-stockman/john-cornyn-voted-against-leaderships-immigration-/	A Republican primary challenger to John Cornyn said in an email blast Jan. 31, 2014, that the senior senator for Texas is teaming with Barack Obama, the Democratic president, to "ram amnesty down your throat." U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman of Friendswood went on to say that no GOP leader is working harder for amnesty than Cornyn. More: "Last year Cornyn helped pass Obama’s amnesty bill in the Senate." We decided to check the to-the-point claim in the banner topping Stockman’s email: "John Cornyn voted twice in 2013 to back Obama’s amnesty plan." He did? We zeroed in on Cornyn’s votes, also exploring Obama’s connection to the plan. The legislation, which has yet to gain traction in the House, isn’t universally considered an amnesty scheme in part because it’s not as forgiving of immigrants lacking legal residency as the overhaul signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. In April 2013, our colleagues at PolitiFact in Washington, D.C., rated as Half True a claim that the legislation drafted by the Gang of 8 --four Senate Democrats and four Republicans intent on building a bipartisan coalition--was not an amnesty plan. The legislation did not offer blanket legal residency to unauthorized immigrants while it mandated fines, background checks and waiting periods, making it tougher than its 1986 predecessor. However, the proposal did afford a measure of clemency to those immigrants, who would not be required to return to their home countries. Our email to Stockman’s spokesman, Donny Ferguson, about Cornyn’s votes elicited no response. Cornyn’s campaign spokesman, Drew Brandewie, emailed us instances of Cornyn voting against the measure. Among substantive votes, Brandewie said, Cornyn voted against the measure when it cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee by 13-5 in May 2013, as noted in a news blog post by the Dallas Morning News on June 5, 2013, which also said that backers of the plan "had fended off many amendments" that Cornyn "authored or supported, including some to beef up enforcement or strip the path to citizenship for 11 million people" already estimated to be "in the country illegally." Cornyn’s "no" vote in committee, on May 21, 2013, wasn’t his last. On June 27, 2013, the Senate sent the House an immigration proposal "that would allow millions of illegal immigrants the chance to live legally in the United States and to eventually become U.S. citizens," the Washington Post said in a news story posted that day. The legislation, which did not draw widespread House support, also called for doubling the number of U.S. Border Patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border, the story said, and required the construction of 700 miles of fencing there. In addition, employers would newly be required to check the legal status of all job applicants using the government’s E-Verify system, the Post reported. Senators voted 68-32 for the plan with 14 Republicans joining Democrats on the "aye" side, the Post said. But Cornyn and fellow Texas Sen. Ted Cruz voted against final approval, the Dallas Morning News said in a news blog post the day of the vote, after voting earlier that day against bringing the proposal to a final vote. "The votes were no surprise," the News said. "Both openly opposed the bill." Stockman’s email blast condemning Cornyn singles out two other votes as indicative of Cornyn helping to advance Obama’s plan. Stockman wrote: "Cornyn voted with Democrats twice to kill our Republican filibuster of amnesty," adding that he was referring to two Senate votes that preceded days of floor debate. And what were those votes? On June 11, 2013, Cornyn was among 82 senators and more than 25 Republicans (though not Cruz), who voted for cloture, a hurdle that had to be cleared before the body could consider starting floor action on the legislation. That afternoon, Cornyn was among 84 senators to vote to proceed to debating the legislation. Brandewie guided us to a news blog post by the Houston Chronicle on that day, which said that although Republican leaders in the Senate "said they could not support the bill as written, they voted to move the legislation forward and allow lawmakers to change it through amendments." The blog post quoted Cornyn as saying that he voted to launch floor debate so he could offer a tighter border security amendment. "The bottom line is that if border and national security cannot be guaranteed in this bill, I cannot and will not support it," Cornyn said. Separately that day, Obama gave the measure his wholehearted endorsement, according to a New York Times news story posted online that afternoon, describing it as consistent with principles he had aired. "Nobody got everything they wanted," Obama said, according to the Post story. "Not Democrats. Not Republicans. Not me. But the Senate bill is consistent with the key principles for common-sense reform that I — and many others — have repeatedly laid out." We found no sign of Obama presenting an immigration proposal. That’s correct, Marc Rosenblum, an analyst for the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that studies worldwide immigration, told us by phone, though he also said the Senate plan largely aligned with a "blueprint" for reform issued by Obama in May 2011 that outlined his desired changes in law. The blueprint called for focused border security and holding employers accountable for hiring legal residents while also creating a way for farmers to hire foreigners to raise and harvest crops. In the document, Obama also said he favored giving law-abiding U.S. residents lacking legal residency, including children, ways to become eligible for citizenship. So, Cornyn voted against endorsing the immigration plan in committee, in favor of starting the Senate floor debate and against the legislation advancing to the House. Of course, there were other votes related to the legislation during floor action. Starting from Cornyn’s posted list of Senate floor votes, we peeked at the details of a dozen of his votes between the beginning of the floor action and final approval. Summing up, it looked to us like after agreeing to let debate proceed, Cornyn consistently voted on the side of Republicans opposed to the Senate plan. Ready to dig in? In a roll call vote on June 13, 2013, Cornyn was on the losing end of a 57-43 vote that set aside revisions offered by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, that were described in a CNN news story that evening as intended to delay the legalization process for millions of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. until the Department of Homeland Security could certify it had effective control over the Southern border for six months. On June 18, 2013, Cornyn was on the losing end of several Republican efforts to change the legislation. In an initial floor vote, he and 38 fellow senators voted in favor of a failed move by Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., to prevent the government from granting illegal immigrants legal status until at least 350 miles of double-tier fencing had been erected on the southern border, withholding full citizenship rights until 700 total miles had been built, according to a Washington Times news story posted online that day. Cornyn also voted for an unsuccessful attempt to stop any illegal immigrant from being granted legal status including citizenship until the government had put in place a biometric check-in and check-out system at every land, sea and airport entry point. Also that day, 94 senators unanimously voted to include tribal government officials on a border oversight task force. It seems reasonable to clump this vote with some others that were less contested as the immigration proposal edged forward: On June 19, 2013, Cornyn was among 72 senators who agreed to provide for limiting salaries for contractor executives and employees involved in border security and he also voted with most to include a Nevada resident on the Southern Border Security Commission. A day later, Cornyn was again on the losing end of Senate votes--including when he voted against setting aside a proposal by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., giving Congress, and not the Department of Homeland Security, ultimate authority to determine if the border is effectively secure, according to a National Review news blog post, which said Paul also sought enhanced security measures, such as requiring a double-layer fence to be completed within five years, plus other triggers to implemented before illegal immigrants could be awarded legal status, the magazine said. Similarly that day, Cornyn voted for a failed amendment described by authoring Sen Mike Lee, R-Utah, as giving the Senate a future say on whether the borders were secure before allowing immigrants to start the pathway to citizenship, according to a news story in The Hill, a Capitol Hill publication. Cornyn took a personal lump on June 20, 2013, as senators voted 54-43 to table his proposed revamp, which he pitched as reasonably beefing up border security, just before the Senate moved instead to a more ambitious border build-up approach. A news blog post by the Dallas Morning News in the wake of that action described Cornyn as steamed, going on to note that while Cornyn’s amendment called for 5,000 additional Border Patrol officers, the substitute proposal favored by Senate leaders called for 20,000 additional officers. "How much is it going to cost?" the News quoted Cornyn as saying of the successful amendment. From that moment through the Senate decision a week later to advance the immigration plan to the House, Cornyn was on the losing end of seven floor votes, including several related to considering and then accepting the alternative border security language. It looked to us like none of these votes could be interpreted as aligning Cornyn with the Senate’s Democratic majority or Obama. Summing up, Rosenblum of the Migration Policy Institute told us that he sees Stockman’s claim as a distortion. "On a fundamental level, it’s a misleading statement. It’s not Obama and it’s not amnesty," Rosenblum said, "but there were those two votes," he said, referring to Cornyn’s votes to let floor debate proceed. Our ruling Stockman said Cornyn voted twice in 2013 for Obama’s amnesty plan. That’s inaccurate to a ridiculous degree. For starters, Obama never offered an amnesty plan, though he endorsed the Senate-approved legislation, which envisioned ways that unauthorized immigrants could attain citizenship. This was also the plan that Cornyn consistently voted against; the two "aye" votes singled out by Stockman were procedural, relating to whether floor debate commenced and not to the legislation's merits. Given that Stockman’s claim misrepresented both the immigration measure and Cornyn’s votes, it merits flames. Pants on Fire!

pomt-15198	On unemployment rates: "We have counties in Southwest Virginia that are well into double digits and some that are pushing 20 percent."	false	/virginia/statements/2015/aug/17/israel-oquinn/israel-oquinn-says-some-sw-virginia-counties-are-n/	One speaker after another railed against the Environmental Protection Agency during a recent meeting of the Virginia chapter of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group founded by billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch. Among the critics was Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington County, who traveled about 320 miles from his district in the southwest corner of Virginia to the Aug. 10 event at the University of Richmond. He warned that new EPA regulations curbing carbon emissions will pound the already wounded coal-producing counties in his district. "Virginia’s unemployment rate is not spectacular right now, regardless of what the governor would have you believe," O’Quinn said. "Now in Southwest Virginia, we have counties that are much, much higher. "We have counties in Southwest Virginia that are well into double digits and some that are pushing 20 percent unemployment. Twenty percent, that’s not an insignificant number and you can track almost every single one of those to the coal industry because when coal takes a downswing, the entire economy of Southwest Virginia takes a big lick right along with it." No doubt, the coal industry has seen better days and plays a vital role in Southwest Virginia’s economy. But we wondered whether counties in the region really are experiencing unemployment rates "well into the double digits" with some "pushing 20 percent." We defined Southwest Virginia based on a map published by the Center for Economic Education at Radford University. The region stretches from Lee County in the corner of the state to Roanoke County. It includes 19 counties and six cities. According to the Virginia Employment Commission’s latest statistics, the state had a seasonally unadjusted unemployment rate of 5 percent in June. The rate was 6.1 percent in Southwest Virginia. None of the counties or cities in the region had unemployment rates that came anywhere close to "pushing 20 percent," as O’Quinn said. Two counties were in low double digits: Buchanan at 11.1 percent and Dickenson at 10.2 percent. In third place was Wise County, with 9.2 percent unemployment. It’s notable that Buchanan, Dickenson and Wise have the highest unemployment rates in the region because they are the three largest coal-producing counties in Virginia and, according to VEC data, are home to about 80 percent of the state’s coal miners. In 1990, the three counties had 9,773 coal mining jobs. That plummeted to an average of 2,812 jobs last year. Coal mining also has steadily declined in Kentucky and West Virginia during recent decades, and experts cite several key reasons: increased competition from cheap shale gas and and from less expensive, low-sulfur coal out west, particularly Wyoming’s Powder River Basin; increased automation in coal mining; increased regulations from the EPA. Getting back to O’Quinn, it’s clear that the unemployment rate is high in Virginia’s three largest coal counties, but not as bad as the delegate described. When we asked O’Quinn for the source of his numbers, he sent us a map from the VEC confirming the county unemployment rates we’ve detailed and he told us he misspoke. He said he meant to say that "underemployment" was pushing 20 percent in some coal counties. Underemployment occurs when a person holds a job that is below his training and doesn’t meet his financial needs. Neither the VEC nor the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics measures underemployment for Virginia counties. O’Quinn told us many local government officials in his district "anecdotally" believe "underemployment there "could absolutely be as high as 20 percent." O’Quinn also said that since the release of June unemployment figures, coal companies in his district have filed federal notices that they are planning to lay off more workers. U.S. law requires most companies with 100 or more employees to provide 60 days notification in advance of layoffs. Records show one such notification, called a WARN notice, has been filed by a coal company in Virginia this year. On July 8, Alpha Natural Resources said it will lay off 165 Virginia workers on Sept. 6. Our ruling O’Quinn said, "We have counties in Southwest Virginia that are well into double digits and some that are pushing 20 percent unemployment." He offered the statistics at a rally where speakers were trying to muster opposition to new EPA carbon restrictions by arguing, in part, the rules will accelerate the decline in coal mining jobs. There is no county in the region that comes close to a 20 percent unemployment rate and it’s debatable whether any are "well into double digits." The highest June unemployment rates were in Virginia’s three biggest coal counties: Buchanan, 11.1 percent; Dickenson, 10.2 percent; and Wise, 9.2 percent. Those are big numbers. But McQuinn, who acknowledges he misspoke, exaggerated them. We rate his statement False.	None	Israel O'Quinn	None	None	None	2015-08-17T00:00:00	2015-08-10	['Southwest_Virginia']

pomt-05419	Says "Amanda Fritz publicly claimed to be endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon, both on her website and in the voter’s guide."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/may/01/mary-nolan/did-amanda-fritz-inaccurately-claim-endorsement-na/	Earlier last week, state Rep. Mary Nolan, D-Portland, issued a press release brimming with accusations against Portland City Commissioner Amanda Fritz. Nolan, who is running to unseat Fritz, said the incumbent had inaccurately claimed an endorsement from NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon: "Fritz publicly claimed to be endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon, both on her website and in the voter’s guide. However, NARAL has given its sole endorsement to Mary Nolan. Fritz vowed to change the listing on her website and issue a statement correcting the error, but has failed to do so," the press release stated. The city of Portland doesn’t have much, if anything, to do with federal and state abortion policies. Still, an endorsement from a reproductive rights group probably matters in a left-leaning city where the two leading candidates for a council seat are both Democrats and women. Also, it just looks bad when a candidate makes up an endorsement. We set to find out the truth. First we checked the state Voters’ Pamphlet. Fritz lists among her supporters "NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon Choice Action Team." On her campaign website, she lists a "green light" designation from both "Basic Rights Oregon PAC (co-designation) and NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon Choice Action Team." Naturally you’re asking, what’s a choice action team and what’s a green light designation? The NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon PAC Board makes endorsements only at the statewide and legislative level, said executive director Michele Stranger Hunter. The Choice Action Team is a group of active volunteers within NARAL that studies local races and simply identifies whether the candidate is pro-choice or not. The Choice Action Team can only "green-light" a candidate; the team cannot make endorsements. NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon made an exception for Nolan, Stranger Hunter said, because of her exceptional advocacy. Nolan is able to get campaign help from NARAL. We asked Fritz if she had claimed an "endorsement" from NARAL. The commissioner emailed to say that she "mistakenly put NARAL ProChoice Oregon Choice Action Team" under the list of union and other group endorsements on her campaign website. Contacted by NARAL, Fritz reorganized her web site to make sure voters knew there was no endorsement, she said. Fritz also offered to PolitiFact Oregon statements of endorsements by NARAL’s Choice Action Team filed with county elections officials. They are signed by Caitlin Campbell, a field organizer, and allow the use of her name and the Choice Action Team. Fritz did not mention the group in The Oregonian’s Voter Guide at NARAL’s request. We went back to Nolan and told her Fritz had specified the Choice Action Team online and in print. Nolan, in response, told PolitiFact Oregon that Fritz should not cite any part of NARAL given that there is an endorsed candidate in the race. We called Todd Foster, chairman of NARAL’s political action committee. He said that a green-light does not mean the group supports the candidate, despite Campbell’s signed statement. So Fritz cannot claim support or an endorsement. (And neither can a lot of other candidates, apparently, including mayoral candidate Eileen Brady, who listed the Choice Action Team under "endorsements" in the Voters’ Pamphlet and another mayoral candidate, Jefferson Smith, who listed the Choice Action Team under "supporters.") We have one final bit of evidence to share. Nolan’s campaign sent along a clip from the Portland City Club debate March 30, during which Fritz claimed an endorsement from NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon. NARAL contacted her after the event and Fritz apologized and agreed to refrain from stating so in the future. So where are we with a ruling? We know Fritz inaccurately stated an endorsement at the City Club debate. But we don’t think we should factor that into the ruling because Nolan did not specify that in her statement, and Fritz amended her connection to NARAL after the March 30 debate. We also know that most voters likely wouldn’t know the difference between NARAL and its Choice Action Team. They would think the action team is the same as NARAL, when it’s not. So Nolan and NARAL are within their rights to complain about the confusion. Fritz did claim an endorsement on her website. (Then she fixed it.) But as Nolan argued herself to PolitiFact Oregon, words matter. And here, Fritz did not claim an endorsement from NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon in print. She listed the Choice Action Team under supporters and online as a green-light giver. She even received written permission from a Choice Action Team person to use the group’s name in the Voters’ Pamphlet. NARAL says Fritz shouldn’t claim support but other candidates are freely doing the same thing without complaint from the group’s leaders. The statement is accurate about the website, but inaccurate about the voters’ guide. We find Nolan’s statement Half True. Return to OregonLIve to comment on this ruling.

pomt-01444	"The last time there was a sustained surge of confidence in government's competence was under Ronald Reagan."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/05/george-will/george-will-america-hasnt-had-sustained-confidence/	As the midterm elections get closer, Republicans are questioning the competence and trustworthiness of President Barack Obama. This is a theme that came into sharp focus during the immigration debate when House Republicans said they wouldn’t move forward because they didn’t trust the president to enforce the law. The botched launch of the Obamacare website did the president no favors. Now, Republicans are pouring concerns over Ebola and the Secret Service into the same mold. The pundits lobbed their opposing views at each other on Fox News Sunday. Brit Hume said the level of people saying the government is incompetent is higher than ever. Juan Williams shot back that the public always thinks the government is incompetent. George Will entered the fray to note that the country has most to fear from "excessive faith in government." Will skewered Republicans for engaging in nation building overseas and Democrats for their efforts to cure social ills at home. Then Will made an interesting historical observation. "The last time there was a sustained surge of confidence in government's competence was under (President) Ronald Reagan," Will said. Will is correct that public trust in government rose and then held steady under Reagan. But he errs in ignoring Bill Clinton’s two terms in office, when the public’s trust in government also rose sharply. In the following chart, the Pew Research Center averaged the results of a number of surveys since 1958 that probed the public’s trust in government. (The political scientists we reached said the words "confidence" and "trust" are largely synonymous in this context.) Source: Pew Research Center, Public trust in government: 1958-2013 Trust in government fluctuated during both the Reagan and Clinton presidencies, but under Reagan, trust rose by 11 percentage points -- from 33 percent to 44 percent. In the Clinton years, trust rose over 20 percentage points -- from 21 percent to 44 percent, according to data from American National Election Studies. As for Will’s use of the word "surge," gains in trust were steeper during Clinton’s two terms, but he started from a much lower point than Reagan. What lies behind the numbers The consensus among the political scientists we contacted is that trust in government tracks closely with the economy. "The growth in trust we observe under Reagan and Clinton coincides with economic expansions," said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. In his forthcoming book, Why Washington Won’t Work: Polarization, Political Trust, and the Governing Crisis, Vanderbilt University political scientist Marc Hetherington analyzed how party affiliation changes the survey results for trust in government. "Republicans in the electorate only seem to trust the government when Republicans are in office," Hetherington said. "Democrats trust government about the same amount over time. Republicans fluctuate a lot." Hetherington sent us this chart that tracks party affiliation and trust in government by who was president. Theda Skocpol, a political scientist at Harvard University, is skeptical about how much these polls actually reveal about American attitudes. Skocpol said these general opinions mask considerable nuances. "Americans express opposition or doubt when asked about government overall," Skocpol said. "But they usually like all the specifics (of programs) by wide margins." Skocpol gave the example of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the current Ebola scare might have taken a toll on the agency’s ranking, last year it stood at the top of the public’s list. According to Gallup, 60 percent of the people said the CDC was doing an excellent or good job. Our ruling George Will said the last time there was a "sustained surge" in confidence in government was under Reagan. While trust did rise and generally hold level in the Reagan years, it also had a steady and larger increase under Clinton. However you slice the numbers, it is clear that the American public had a "sustained surge of confidence" during Clinton's presidency. And Clinton, obviously, was president more recently than Reagan.

pomt-00289	Every former North Carolina governor opposes "constitutional amendments Raleigh lawmakers put on the ballot this fall."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/sep/27/stop-deceptive-amendments/ad-misleads-about-nc-governors-opposing-constituti/	A new political ad suggests that each of North Carolina’s living former governors opposes proposed constitutional amendments on the November ballot. There are six proposed amendments that would change the state Constitution. One would require voters to show photo ID to participate in future elections. Another would enshrine the "right to hunt and fish" in the Constitution. Others would cap the state income tax rate at 7 percent and grant victims of crime the right to know specific legal information. Then there are the pair of proposed amendments that would reduce the governor’s power by limiting his or her authority to fill judicial vacancies and shifting the responsibility for appointing elections board members from the governor to the legislature. In the commercial, a narrator opens by asking viewers to "take a closer look at constitutional amendments Raleigh lawmakers put on the ballot this fall." "Every former chief justice and every former governor — Democrats and Republicans — all recommend voting no," the narrator continues. "They say these amendments are purposefully vague, a blank check for politicians who could block corruption investigations and strip all of our courts of independence, permanently. The closer you look at these misleading amendments, the worse they get. Vote no." Each of the amendments was put on the ballot by the legislature, which is controlled by Republicans. The commercial was paid for by the Stop Deceptive Amendments political committee, which is treasured by Michael Weisel. Weisel is an elections attorney who the Associated Press recently described as a prominent figure on the political left. The group bought airtime with WRAL-TV in Raleigh and Charlotte’s WSOC-TV, the Charlotte Observer reported Tuesday. Given that most North Carolinians are likely more familiar with governors than former chief justices, let’s turn our attention there. Is it true that every living former governor — including Republicans Pat McCrory and Jim Martin — opposes each of the six amendments? Put simply: no. Republican support While all former governors made news recently for opposing the amendments that affect the governor’s office, McCrory reaffirmed his support of the voter ID, victims’ rights, tax cap and hunting and fishing amendments during his radio show Monday morning. "It’s a false and misleading ad," McCrory said on WBT Radio in Charlotte. He also said he sent a letter to various media stations asking them to stop airing the ad, and threatened legal action if they don’t. "I demand that you immediately take down these advertisements, since they falsely impute to me a position which I have vocally opposed in the media, and further because such falsehoods inflict ongoing damage both to my reputation and to the campaign to pass Marsy’s Law, on which I am a prominent supporter and endorser," the letter says. Marsy’s Law is another name for the victims’ rights amendment. Chris Sinclair, an advocate for the proposed amendment, emailed PolitiFact a photo of McCrory speaking at a Marsy’s event at Latta Park in Charlotte on Sept. 10. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Martin, for his part, told us in an email that he holds the same view of the amendments that McCrory does. "Personally, I am opposed to the two previously identified amendments that remove appointive authority from the governor and transfer it to the legislature (for all practical purposes, to its leadership)," Martin’s email says. "They appear to be the last two of the referendum amendments on all ballots. I am not opposed to the other amendments." A denial Weisel, when contacted by PolitiFact, referred us to Stop Deceptive Ads spokesman Justin Guillory. Guillory said Tuesday the ad doesn’t, in fact, suggest that all former governors oppose all of the constitutional amendments. "The ad clearly references two amendments that would give additional appointment powers to the state legislature. Those are the same two amendments that McCrory opposes," Guillory wrote in an email. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "We appreciate Gov. McCrory’s bipartisan leadership in opposing these two amendments and that’s why we chose to feature the five former governors in our ads," he continued. "Part of what is confusing about these constitutional amendments is that the legislature didn’t allow titles or any other identifiers on the ballot. There are no titles for us to reference in an ad." Guillory has a point: The amendments on the ballot will lack numbers or titles. (Read them on the N.C. Secretary of State website.) What the ad says Let’s look again at what the narrator says. Guillory says the ad is talking only about the two amendments related to gubernatorial powers. He says the narrator alludes to those two when saying they would "block corruption investigations and strip all of our courts from independence." But the ad makes no clear distinction between the two amendments affecting the governor’s powers, and the four others. The narrator says, "Take a closer look at constitutional amendments Raleigh lawmakers put on the ballot this fall." There’s no reason viewers would think to look at only two of them, specifically. Immediately after that, the narrator says: "Every former chief justice and every former governor — Democrats and Republicans — all recommend voting no." Again, there’s no distinction. A change Wednesday evening, Guillory sent an email announcing that the group had changed the ad. In the new version, the narrator begins the ad specifying the amendments that affect the governor’s power. "Take a closer look at two constitutional amendments Raleigh lawmakers put on the ballot this fall," the narrator says. Guillory says Stop Deceptive Amendments stands by its original version, but that "defeating these two amendments is more important than a political spat. "We’ve sent a revised version of the ad to TV stations that clarifies which two amendments the five governors oppose," Guillory said. "We continue to appreciate Gov. McCrory’s bi-partisan leadership in opposing these two amendments and the courage it takes for him to confront the legislative leaders of his own party. We look forward to working with leaders of both parties to defeat these two dangerous and misleading amendments." Our ruling The original Stop Deceptive Amendments commercial suggests that every former North Carolina governor opposes all six constitutional amendments. That’s not true. McCrory and Martin (the only two former Republican governors who are still living) oppose the two amendments that affect the governor’s powers, but support the other four amendments. While PolitiFact appreciates the group’s effort to be more accurate, we must set the record straight for those who have already seen the original ad and rate this claim False. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact. The NC Local News Lab Fund and the International Center for Journalists provide support for the project, which shares fact-checks with newsrooms statewide.

pomt-05810	After Arizona banned smoking in "all public places" in 2007, "admissions for acute myocardial infarction … stroke, asthma, [and] angina decreased following the implementation of the ban."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/feb/22/richard-morrison/rhode-island-state-rep-richard-p-morrison-says-ari/	Rhode Island would extend the current ban on smoking in workplaces, restaurants and bars to a slew of public places, including beaches, parks and playgrounds, under legislation introduced by state Rep. Richard P. Morrison. The health benefits of a wider ban -- which would be one of the strictest in the country -- far outweigh any inconvenience to smokers, the Bristol Democrat said at a State House hearing on Feb. 15. To bolster his point, Morrison pointed to another state that passed a far-reaching ban on smoking five years ago. "If we pass this, we are not alone," he said at the hearing before the House Health, Education and Welfare Committee. "The State of Arizona in 2007 banned smoking in all public places, and an unintended consequence of that, in the first year alone, the admissions for acute myocardial infarction -- or heart attack, for a better term -- stroke, asthma, angina, decreased following the implementation of the ban." "The reductions in hospital charges are estimated to total $16 million in the first 13 months after the ban was put into place," he continued. "It’s an unintended consequence, but it’s a really good unintended consequence." Morrison’s statement caught our attention. Could Arizona really have seen nearly immediate benefits from its smoking ban? Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia currently have some type of statewide indoor smoking ban in place. Some bans are confined only to workplaces. Many include restaurants and bars. Hundreds of municipalities have also enacted bans, including New York City, which attracted widespread attention after prohibiting smoking in public parks and other outdoor places last year. Arizona’s statewide ban on smoking does not go as far as New York City’s ban or Morrison’s proposal for Rhode Island. The Smoke-Free Arizona Act prohibits smoking in workplaces, as well as restaurants, bars and other enclosed public places, but does not apply to parks or other outdoor spaces. The ban took effect May 1, 2007, after winning passage in a referendum the previous November. When we asked Morrison about the health effects of that ban, he sent us two references to a study in Arizona that was published in the American Journal of Public Health. Both references -- one from a science website and the other from a Rhode Island study on the Ocean State’s 2005 smoking ban -- only summarized the results, so we contacted the Journal, which sent us the full article. In the peer-reviewed study that was published in March 2011, Patricia M. Herman and Michele E. Walsh, researchers at the University of Arizona’s department of psychology, examined hospital admissions before and after Arizona banned indoor smoking. They compared data from the state’s 87 hospitals from January 2004 to April 2007 -- up until the ban went into effect -- to the 13-month period afterward, from May 1, 2007, to May 31, 2008. Herman and Walsh looked at admissions for acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), angina, stroke and asthma -- all diagnoses connected to smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. They only considered patients that were Arizona residents. Herman and Walsh found that admissions for all four diagnoses dropped, in some cases significantly, in the period after the ban took effect. Cases of acute myocardial infarction decreased by 13 percent, angina by 33 percent, stroke by 14 percent and asthma by 22 percent. The estimated savings in hospital costs from those reductions were $16.8 million. The study attempted to account for reductions in these rates that could have been caused by other factors by separating the hospitals into two groups -- those in areas where county-level or municipal smoking bans were already in effect and those in places that had never had bans. If the decreases were larger in places that hadn’t had bans, then they were attributed to the statewide ban. The authors concluded that the results of their study, combined with other research on smoking bans that had similar findings, showed "there is now little room to doubt their effectiveness." Herman and Walsh noted that there have been many studies that found a causal relationship between smoking bans and reductions in hospital visits for respiratory and heart conditions. But independent reviews concluded that some of those studies were not optimal. And critics have said that the results of those and other studies were overblown, countering that heart attack rates have been dropping anyway because of improved treatment. Although there is still some debate about the effectiveness of smoking bans, we couldn’t find any challenges to the results of the Arizona study. Our ruling To prove the effectiveness of broad smoking bans in improving public health, Representative Morrison pointed to Arizona’s experience. His statement about the nearly immediate benefits of that state’s ban was based on a reputable scientific study, which he characterized accurately. But he mischaracterized Arizona’s ban as applying to all public spaces, when it actually applies only to all public indoor spaces -- a big difference. Because of that inaccuracy, we rate Morrison’s claim Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-10907	Says HHS Secretary Alex Azar called family separations at the border and detention of children in cages "one of the great acts of American generosity and charity" and "is now in charge."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/02/equity-forward/ad-targets-hhs-secretary-alex-azar-generosity-and-/	An ad targeting Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar portrays him as callously describing the situation with immigrant children at the border as "one of the great acts of American generosity and charity." Why go after Azar? As HHS secretary, he oversees the department that cares for children who were separated from their families by other agencies under the administration’s "zero tolerance" prosecution policy for all immigrants who illegally enter the United States. The ad from Equity Forward, which describes itself as a watchdog of anti-reproductive health groups and individuals, opens with the sound of wailing children, a photo of a chain-link fence, and video of women in lines with children (The Washington Post Fact Checker found that the families in the video were at a way station for families paroled from detention centers). It moves on to a photo of children standing near a white tent behind tall fences, followed by a photo and video of Azar. It ends with pictures of bunk beds, of tents and of Azar with President Donald Trump. Here’s the text: Narrator: "They are terrified. Taken from their mothers and fathers and detained in cages. In Washington, Secretary Alex Azar is now in charge." Azar: "It is one of the great acts of American generosity and charity what we are doing for these unaccompanied kids." Narrator: "Generosity? No, Secretary Azar. This is a disgrace. Call Congress, tell them to reunite these children with their parents and hold Azar accountable." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We looked into it. Azar did offer a rosy assessment in an interview about children separated from their parents. But the ad neglects a striking amount of context, including what precipitated Azar’s remark and singling him out as "in charge" of the situation without offering specifics. ‘Generosity and charity’ The framing of the ad suggests Azar said the separation and detention of children was a generous and charitable thing." It says he is "in charge" right after showing video of children and saying they were "taken from their mothers and fathers and detained in cages." Azar’s remark came July 10 as CNN’s Wolf Blitzer questioned him about media access to facilities keeping children, which are overseen by Azar’s agency. Azar said children deserve privacy and respect and "we’ll be as transparent as possible, consistent with that." Blitzer: "They deserve that privacy. I’m just saying, we would guarantee that they would blur their faces. No one would see the kids’ faces. We just want to go in and do our job. If there is nothing to hide, I don’t see what the problem would be." Azar: "Wolf, we are happy to work, we want to be transparent. We have nothing to hide about how we operate these facilities, our grantees. It is one of the great acts of American generosity and charity what we are doing for these unaccompanied kids who are smuggled into our country or come across illegally. So, we don’t have anything to hide about it. We just have to protect privacy." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Azar lauded workers caring for the children and said the kids were "happy," "loved" and in a "compassionate environment." Azar wasn’t lauding the charity of family separations. "What they have done is conflate the secretary's statement with the policy," HHS spokesman Mark Weber said. "The secretary's statement was in the context of the care HHS provides to the children once they get to us." Equity Forward executive director Mary Alice Carter said the point of the ad was to show administrative failures with Azar as secretary. The group also said there were reports of children going hungry at some facilities and of children "subject to other harsh rules and conditions." "During his CNN interview, Azar claimed that all of these locations have kids that are ‘happy’ and ‘getting snacks,'" Carter said. "With this ad, Equity Forward is highlighting the fact that some of these facilities are tents on military bases behind massive fence enclosures. Azar and the administration never had a plan to reunite the children with their families." The ad's narrator also said children were "detained in cages," but the ad did not illustrate that. (See our coverage offering context on claims about caged children.) Claims about cages holding children have generally being in reference to detention centers operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of Homeland Security — not HHS, which Azar oversees. Instead of cages, the ad used photos of tents. Tents in Texas are being used as temporary shelters for teen minors who were separated at the border and who arrived alone, Weber said. For a small proportion of children in HHS care, Weber said, tents in Tornillo, Texas, are the last stop before reunification or release to a suitable sponsor. "To suggest (separated children) were all sent to a tent city is false," Weber said. Overall, HHS currently has more than 11,000 children in its custody across 100 facilities in 17 states. The number of children in its custody fluctuates as they are transferred in and out of HHS care, but the overwhelming majority came alone without their parents. Our ruling An Equity Forward ad says Azar called family separations at the border and detention of children in cages "one of the great acts of American generosity and charity" and "is now in charge." Azar made that comment in reference to the care provided at facilities. He wasn’t saying that specifically about the "zero-tolerance" immigration policy or family separations. Equity Forward told PolitiFact the point of its ad was to highlight shortcomings in the policy’s implementation and issues at some facilities, and the fact that some facilities are tents. Yet the ad said children were in cages and insinuated that Azar was in charge of the separations and the treatment of children. Azar does lead the department that has custody over the children, but the separations are a result of prosecution referrals from Homeland Security to the Justice Department. The ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-12390	California Gov. Jerry Brown was "Caught in the Middle of a $60 Billion Corruption Investigation."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2017/may/30/blog-posting/pants-fire-distorted-claim-about-jerry-browns-role/	A conservative news website with a penchant for phony claims recently alleged California Gov. Jerry Brown was "caught in the middle" of a huge corruption probe. The April 17, 2017 headline on consjournal.com read "CA Gov. Jerry Brown Caught in the Middle of a $60 Billion Corruption Investigation." Just below the headline is a giant, blaring graphic reading "BREAKING NEWS." If correct, this would be a seismic story across California and the nation. We set out to see if there’s even a hint of truth in this claim. Our research The article cites news reports in the Sacramento Bee and Los Angeles Times that detail a very real investigation Brown ordered into the Board of Equalization. The governor asked state prosecutors in April to examine claims that employees of the state tax agency misused state resources. The agency is headed by a five-person independent board elected by the public. The governor’s call for action followed an audit by his administration that uncovered mismanagement in the tax agency, which is responsible for collecting $60 billion in taxes annually. Nothing, however, in the consjournal.com article or the Bee or the Times suggest that Brown is a subject of that investigation as the headline strongly implies. We asked consjournal.com for evidence Brown was ‘caught in the middle’ of the probe. A representative emailed a link to an article by Breitbart.com, another conservative website, that summarizes the governor’s call for an investigation, but says nothing about Brown being a subject of it. The headline also caught the attention of the fact-checking website Snopes.com, which gave the claim its most severe rating, False. It added "the story didn’t stand up to the barest of scrutiny." Other wild claims The website’s claim about the governor is comparable to other ridiculous claims on consjournal.com. In October 2015, the website published an article with a reckless headline saying "BREAKING: Illegal Aliens In California Able To VOTE, New Bill Just Signed." It referred to Brown’s signing of the state’s New Motor Voter Law that registers eligible citizens to vote when they obtain or renew their driver’s license. There is a separate process that allows people in the country illegally to obtain a California driver’s license. Those individuals are not given the option to register to vote. "We’ve built the protocols and the firewalls to not register people that aren’t eligible," Alex Padilla, the state’s top elections official told the Los Angeles Times in 2015. "We’re going to keep those firewalls in place." In March 2016, the website also published a misleading headline saying "California Gov. Jerry Brown Says If Trump Is Elected He Will Build A Wall Around The State." Several lines into the article, it notes Brown added: "By the way that is a joke. We don’t like walls, we like bridges." Our rating The conservative website consjournal.com recently claimed in a headline that California Gov. Jerry Brown was "Caught in the Middle of a $60 Billion Corruption Investigation." In reality, Brown ordered the investigation in question. There’s no evidence in the corresponding story or in any articles by outlets that have covered the investigation in-depth to show the governor is in any way a subject of the probe. This isn’t the website’s first headline to mangle the truth about Brown and his administration. We rate its claim Pants On Fire.

pomt-12768	"Target to discontinue sale of Holy Bible."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/23/blog-posting/target-did-not-stop-selling-bible-stores-despite-f/	A fake news story that claimed discount store chain Target would no longer sell the Bible doesn’t stand up to a more careful reading. The website NewsLeak.co, which is registered to an address in the Eurasian capital of Tbilisi, Georgia, ran an undated story around Feb. 16, 2017, with the headline, "Target to discontinue sale of Holy Bible." The story was flagged by Facebook as part of its efforts to rid its news feeds of fake news. The story said the store had been under fire for its policy of allowing transgendered customers to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identified. That part is accurate. But the story veers into false territory by saying Target CEO Bryan Hornell claimed the chain "will no longer cater to religious extremists" by selling the Bible. Hornell allegedly said in a letter that Targets would start phasing out anything related to religion — including Christmas decorations — in its stores. There are many examples of this story all over the Internet, but none of them are true. They’re all based on a (currently deleted) May 16, 2016, story from NationalReport.net, a site that generates made-up articles. "All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news," its disclaimer reads. That disclaimer isn’t on the stories themselves, and don’t look to appear on earnest reposts of the article on other sites. Beyond that, there are clues that this isn’t a real story, starting with the fact that the chairman and CEO of Target is Brian Cornell, not Bryan Hornell. As for being able to buy the good book, a search of the Target.com website turns up 791 results in a search for "Holy Bible," so it’s readily available. But just to make sure, we contacted Target’s public relations department, which assured us that yes, you can still buy the Bible in stores. And no, there were no plans to change that. Target did eventually start offering private bathrooms to try to settle the boycott over transgendered bathrooms, but it never said it would stop selling the Bible.

pomt-02226	"Democrats very much are in the pocket of the NRA."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/17/nia-malika-henderson/msnbc-guest-says-democrats-are-pocket-nra/	When billionaire Michael Bloomberg stepped down as mayor of New York City, the big question was what would he do next? This week, Bloomberg gave part of the answer. He unveiled a $50 million fund to advance the cause of gun control, an issue that has long been close to his heart. Even in a political ecosystem flooded with cash, this was more than enough to get peoples’ attention. On MSNBC, Washington Post reporter Nia-Malika Henderson figured that the money might have some impact if Bloomberg spent strategically in certain states and cities. As for change at the federal level, Henderson that gave long odds. "I think the NRA (National Rifle Association) is a formidable force," Henderson said. "It’s a formidable force because Democrats very much are in the pocket of the NRA and they didn’t want to vote against the NRA." We are checking whether Democrats are "in the pocket of the NRA." We emailed and tweeted Henderson to learn what information led her to that conclusion. We did not hear back. In Henderson’s absence, we find two ways to assess her statement - quantitatively through the lens of campaign dollars, and qualitatively through the lens of Democrats’ actions. Jeffrey Berry is a political scientist at Tufts University who has studied the role of special interest groups in Washington. Berry called Henderson’s words "a gross mischaracterization." "Most leaders of the Democratic Party do not support the goals of the NRA and are not ‘in the pocket’ of the organization," Berry said. "Many Democratic leaders are avowed supporters of gun control, including the president of the United States. There's a reason why the NRA is so hostile toward the Democratic Party." Campaign contribution numbers show the NRA’s clear preference for Republicans over Democrats. According the Center for Responsive Politics, nearly 90 percent of the NRA’s donations went to Republican candidates or parties in the 2012 elections. The NRA gave more than $1.1 million. Even Henderson’s own paper, the Washington Post, reported on some of these numbers. Here’s what that looks like: In the current election cycle, the trend is even more lopsided. So far, the NRA has given about 96 percent of its contributions to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. But if we look at how the gun control issue has played out in Congress, especially in the Senate, we see some Democrats exercising great caution where the NRA is concerned. In last year’s vote on requiring background checks for all commercial gun sales, the proposal failed in part because four key Democrats opposed it. The list included Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Max Baucus of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. All represented rural states where gun rights are popular. Baucus decided not to run for re-election and both Begich and Pryor face tough races. The Democratic control of the Senate likely hinges on how Democrats fare in close elections, and their appetite for taking on the NRA is limited. Rutgers University political scientist Beth Leech said the relationship between Democrats and the NRA is not one of partnership, but dread. If some Democrats are afraid to take on the NRA, it’s not because of campaign cash supporting them. It’s because of the NRA money that might be used to try and defeat them. "The NRA spent $11 million in 2012 on outside expenditures," Leech said. "Many Democrats may be afraid of seeing that outside spending power used against them in an election." Our ruling Henderson said Democrats are in the pocket of the NRA. Henderson did not send us any information to support or clarify her statement. In terms of campaign contributions, the NRA sends its money almost entirely to Republicans. In the sense that "in the pocket" means a cozy comfortable relationship, the political scientists we reached said Henderson’s claim was wrong. On the other hand, the record shows that on key votes, some Democrats will avoid raising the ire of the NRA. The relationship is hardly cozy but the result is the same. Henderson’s words don’t capture this factor well, but due to it, enough Democrats end up doing what the NRA wants. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-09628	"We had no domestic attacks under Bush."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/08/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-says-there-were-no-domestic-attacks-durin/	Republican Rudy Giuliani is painting President Barack Obama as weak on terrorism and is longing for the days of former President George W. Bush. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and a candidate for president in 2008, appeared on Good Morning America on Jan. 8, 2010, to offer his assessment of the Obama administration's counterterrorist operations. He criticized plans to try suspected Christmas Day bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in a Michigan criminal court and questioned Obama's decision to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Giuliani said U.S. intelligence agencies stand to lose potentially critical information on other al-Qaida operatives and operations if the man at the center of the Northwest flight terror incident is tried in U.S. court. "What he (Obama) should be doing is following the right things that Bush did -- one of the right things he did was treat this as a war on terror. We had no domestic attacks under Bush. We've had one under Obama," Giuliani said. "Number two, he should correct the things that Bush didn't do right. Sending people to Yemen was wrong, not getting this whole intelligence thing corrected was both Bush's responsibility and Obama's." Giuliani, the mayor of New York City during the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, claims there were no domestic attacks under the Bush administration. That's obviously a preposterous statement that would warrant a Pants on Fire rating. We can't help but remember now-Vice President Joe Biden's line during his presidential campaign, "Rudy Giuliani -- there's only three things he mentions in a sentence. A noun and a verb and 9/11." Unfortunately, interviewer George Stephanopoulos never sought clarification on Giuliani's statement. After the interview, Stephanopoulos updated his blog to say Giuliani was wrong to say there were no domestic attacks under Bush, and then later apologized for not pressing him on the misstatement. But let's treat this as if Giuliani meant to say there were no domestic attacks under Bush post-Sept. 11, 2001, and run that past the Truth-O-Meter. The FBI offers a broad definition of terrorism, calling it "the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives." Even stricter definitions would have to include: The anthrax scare. Shortly after 9/11, letters laced with anthrax began appearing in the U.S. mail. Letters went to U.S. senators and news organizations. Before it was over, five Americans were killed and another 17 were injured. "The nation was terrorized in what became the worst biological attacks in U.S. history," according to the FBI. The shoe bomber. In December 2001, admitted al-Qaida member Richard Reid boarded a plane in Miami with plastic explosives packed in special hollowed-out shoes. The bomb failed to ignite properly and no passengers were hurt. The incident, however, led to Americans having to remove their shoes during airport security screening. The D.C. sniper case. John Allen Muhammad was convicted on capital terrorism charges for his part in the shooting of 16 people in and around the D.C. area in September and October 2002. Muhammad was executed last year. His 17-year-old accomplice, Lee Boyd Malvo, was sentenced to life in prison. All three events occurred after Sept. 11 and have been considered terror plots by the federal and state governments. Media Matters For America, a liberal group that analyzes the news media, documented other examples of U.S. terrorism: 2002 attack against El Al ticket counter at LAX. Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at an El Al Airlines ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two people and wounding four others before being shot dead. Media Matters found a 2004 Justice Department report that Hadayet's case had been "officially designated as an act of international terrorism." Campus attack at UNC. In March 2006, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill graduate drove an SUV onto campus, striking nine pedestrians. Reza Taheri-azar reportedly stated in a letter: "I was aiming to follow in the footsteps of one of my role models, Mohammad Atta, one of the 9/11/01 hijackers, who obtained a doctorate degree." A spokesman for Giuliani attempted to clarify the former mayor's remark several hours after the GMA interview, saying the statement "didn't come across as it was intended" and that Giuliani was "clearly talking post-9/11 with regards to Islamic terrorist attacks on our soil," according to ABC News. It wasn't clear to us, or most of the world. But okay. Taking the literal definition of "on our soil," that would exclude the failed December 2001 shoe bombing incident since it happened in the air. But not the others. If you add the second layer of "Islamic terrorist attacks," the sniper and anthrax attacks could come off the list as well, because it is unclear if extremist Muslim ideology motivated either attack. Hadayet, the shooter in the Los Angeles ticket counter shooting, was killed during the attack by security personnel. So we don't know his motivation. Taheri-azar's own words make his motivation pretty clear. But now we're getting to a lot of ifs. And more importantly, that's not what Giuliani said on national television. Here's how Giuliani tried to clarify the issue during an interview later that day with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. "This is so silly," Giuliani said. "What I usually say when I say that, I usually say we had no major domestic attacks under President Bush since Sept. 11. I did omit the words 'since Sept. 11.' I apologize for that." Giuliani went on to say it's not clear if the anthrax attacks were perpetuated by Islamic fundamentalists. We're not sure if Giuliani's claim that Obama has had only one domestic attack in his first year as president is right, either. Besides the Christmas Day bombing attempt, several U.S. lawmakers have already labeled the November Fort Hood shooting as an act of terrorism. The Giuliani spokesman, whom ABC News did not identify, said the "one" attack that Giuliani says took place during the Obama administration was a reference to the alleged Fort Hood shooter, Maj. Nidal Hasan. (Again, excluding the Christmas Day bombing plot by using the "on our soil" addendum.) Giuliani ran a presidential campaign based on the leadership he showed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. We would expect him to at least acknowledge that those attacks occurred while George W. Bush was president. But even considering that he was talking post-9/11, Giuliani is just plain wrong to suggest no terrorist attacks happened under Bush's watch. The clarifications added by a Giuliani spokesman are threaded so thin, it sounds like damage control more than anything. We say Pants on Fire!

pomt-12902	"We've made other countries rich while the wealth ... of our country has dissipated over the horizon."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/20/donald-trump/trump-wrongly-says-us-has-made-others-rich-while-o/	In his inaugural address, President Donald Trump painted a picture of a nation that has steadily marched down the wrong path. "We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon," he said. "One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world." Trump vowed to end this "American carnage." It’s tough to measure strength and confidence, but there are ways to measure wealth. We decided to look at whether America’s wealth has fallen while other countries became rich. Trump’s office told us he was thinking about America’s $800 billion trade deficit. However, trade deficits are not a measure of national or household wealth. There is no question that trade with China has cost America jobs to the benefit of Chinese workers. But again, Trump said we made other countries rich while our wealth faded and that’s a different point. Economists measure the wealth of nations in two ways. They look at the size of their economies, the GDP, and they look at how well the average citizen is doing, or GDP per capita. Through either lens, the wealth of the United States has not dissipated. This chart comes from International Monetary Fund data. With its $18 trillion economy, the United States is a good one-third wealthier than its closest economic rival, China. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com China’s economy avoided the dip that the United States faced in the Great Recession, and it has grown at a faster rate, but America remains the wealthiest nation. Seen through the lens of GDP per capita (and factoring in the purchasing power of each currency), the United States looks even better compared to China, a country Trump often points to as the source of America’s woes. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com China ranks 83rd in the world on a per capita basis because while its economy is huge, it has about 1.3 billion people, many of whom are very poor. There is one way to look at the shifting economic fortunes of the typical adult that does express a sense of what Trump described. The international bank Credit Suisse has calculated adult wealth since 2000. Using their 2016 data, we find that the median wealth rose in each of the largest economies, including the United States, but it rose nearly three times faster in China than it did in the United States. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump said that other countries became rich while the wealth of America "dissipated." Based on the most common measures of national wealth, that is inaccurate. The United States has the world’s largest economy and, when averaged across the population, the typical American does better than the people of any other country. There is some argument to be made that the typcial Chinese worker's wealth has gone up much faster than the typical American's, but the American is still much wealthier.

pomt-02925	"Even after Obamacare is fully implemented, there still will be tens of millions of people not covered."	true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/01/suzanne-somers/suzanne-somers-says-even-obamacare-tens-millions-w/	The actress Suzanne Somers, best known for her role on the 1970s sitcom Three’s Company, sparked controversy recently when she wrote a column for the Wall Street Journal that harshly criticized President Barack Obama’s health care law. In her column, topped by the provocative title, "The Affordable Care Act Is a Socialist Ponzi Scheme," Somers argued that "the word ‘affordable’ is a misnomer. So far, all you are hearing on the news is how everyone’s premiums are doubling and tripling and it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to recognize that the whole thing is a big mess. Plus, even after Obamacare is fully implemented, there still will be tens of millions of people not covered. So what’s the point? Medical care will be degraded, the costs will skyrocket, and most frightening of all, your most intimate and personal information is now up for grabs." The column prompted a backlash, as critics took issue with the substance of her arguments while also snickering at the Journal’s need to append multiple corrections to the column. (The correction called a quotation Somers had attributed to V.I. Lenin "widely disputed," a quotation attributed to Winston Churchill unconfirmed, said Somers had misstated the type of animal used on a cover of Maclean’s magazine in 2008 -- it was a dog, not a horse.) "In fewer than 600 words, Somers managed to purvey untruths, misinterpretations, made-up quotes and irrelevant anecdotes," said one particularly stinging response by the Los Angeles Times’ Robin Abcarian. But it turns out that not everything Somers said is wrong. Here we’ll take a look at her claim that "even after Obamacare is fully implemented, there still will be tens of millions of people not covered." We can’t predict the future, but we can turn to the best available independent analysis of the health care law’s impact -- projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO’s most recent projections, from February 2013, produced the following figures: Year Number of non-elderly people without insurance Percentage of the population without insurance 2013 55 million 20% 2014 44 million 16% 2015 37 million 14% 2016 31 million 11% 2017 29 million 10% 2018 29 million 10% 2019 29 million 10% 2020 29 million 10% 2021 29 million 10% 2022 29 million 10% 2023 30 million 10% So, Somers is right -- by 2023, there will still be 30 million Americans without insurance. Presumably these will be a combination of people who opt to pay a penalty rather than signing up for insurance, people or families who are exempted because they can’t find affordable coverage, and undocumented immigrants, who are exempt from the mandate to purchase insurance. Obamacare supporters will surely counter that the number of uninsured Americans will drop over this decade-long period by 25 million people, or almost half, despite overall population growth. In addition, the percentage of uninsured Americans will be cut in half, from 20 percent today to 10 percent a decade from now, according to CBO. Our ruling Somers wrote that, "even after Obamacare is fully implemented, there still will be tens of millions of people not covered." She’s right -- by 2023, CBO projects that 30 million Americans will lack health insurance. While this is lower than today’s figure both in absolute numbers and in the percentage of the population, that doesn’t take away from the basic accuracy of Somers’ claim. We rate her claim True.

pomt-13180	"It's four or five states where the number of insurance options have narrowed" under the Affordable Care Act.	false	/florida/statements/2016/oct/26/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-incorrectly-says-only-4-o/	Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., had to play defense over the Affordable Care Act -- sometimes called Obamacare -- during an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Oct. 25. The previous afternoon, the federal government had announced that premiums for plans under the act would rise an average of 22 percent in 2017. While most plan-holders would see their federal subsidies increase to ease the premium hike, the news was an unwelcome development for Democrats, especially in the final days of an election season. On CNN, Blitzer asked Wasserman Schultz about the hikes, saying, "that’s not the way it was supposed to be, was it?" She responded, "Well, we're in a transition year, and as I said, you have 91 percent of … previously uninsured Americans in Florida who are eligible for a tax credit, which brings those costs down. So those numbers are really an anomaly. It's four or five states where the number of insurance options have narrowed and so premiums have increased, but we're going to be able to make sure that if we just sit down together and iron out the kinks that have occurred with Obamacare." The part that caught our eye had to do with the decline in the number of insurers offering policies under the Affordable Care Act, which is considered one of the factors driving the rise in premiums. Is Wasserman Schultz correct that "it's four or five states where the number of insurance options have narrowed"? Actually, it’s more than that. Data released in the same Department of Health and Human Services report that unveiled the 22-percent projected premium increase showed that at least 29 states have fewer plan issuers in 2017 than they did in 2016 -- many more than Wasserman Schultz had said. (An issuer is defined as a company that offers insurance plans on a state's exchange.) Here’s a list of the states that are seeing a decrease in companies offering plans under the act between 2016 and 2017. State Issuers in 2016 Issuers in 2017 Decline, 2016 to 2017 Alabama 3 1 -2 Alaska 2 1 -1 Arizona 8 2 -6 Arkansas 5 4 -1 California 12 11 -1 Connecticut 4 2 -2 Florida 10 7 -3 Georgia 9 5 -4 Illinois 9 5 -4 Indiana 8 4 -4 Kansas 4 3 -1 Louisiana 5 4 -1 Massachusetts 11 10 -1 Michigan 14 10 -4 Minnesota 5 4 -1 Mississippi 3 2 -1 Missouri 7 4 -3 North Carolina 3 2 -1 Nebraska 4 2 -2 New Jersey 6 3 -3 Ohio 16 11 -5 Oklahoma 2 1 -1 Oregon 9 6 -3 Pennsylvania 13 8 -5 South Carolina 4 1 -3 Tennessee 4 3 -1 Texas 19 10 -9 Utah 4 3 -1 Wisconsin 16 15 -1 States not listed above either saw no change in insurers offering plans, saw an increase in insurers, or had complications that make comparisons tricky. Including all states for which data is available, the number of issuers dropped from 298 in 2016 to 228 in 2017, a decrease of about 23 percent. Nationally, the number of insurers exiting a state outpaced the number of insurers newly entering a state by a factor of more than 5-to-1. Geoff Burgan, press secretary for Wasserman Schultz, did not contest that the number is higher than what she said, instead arguing that "while some states are seeing decreases in insurers, nearly 80 percent of marketplace customers will be able to choose between competing insurers – which is a sharp contrast to the time before the Affordable Care Act became law." Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said, "It's four or five states where the number of insurance options have narrowed" under the Affordable Care Act. According to official federal data, she’s way off, because 29 states have seen the number of insurance options narrowed. We rate her statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4cc846e0-1d46-443d-806c-c70caaa2a785	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2016-10-26T11:42:41	2016-10-25	['None']
pomt-02941	"Soldiers Donating to Tea Party Now Face Punishment Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2013/oct/30/rhode-island-tea-party/rhode-island-tea-party-says-soldiers-who-donate-te/	Nothing gets the blood boiling like the discovery that the government is violating basic constitutional rights. So amid the avalanche of tweets we see each day, this one from the Rhode Island Tea Party immediately caught our attention: "Soldiers Donating to Tea Party Now Face Punishment Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice." If true, we thought, that's outrageous. The tweet refers to a story at RedFlagNews.com, which had a different word for it. Here's their headline: "TERRIFYING! Soldiers Donating to Tea Party Now Face Punishment Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice . . . " The story says that two anonymous soldiers said they were told during a pre-deployment briefing at Fort Hood in Texas that evangelical Christians and members of the tea party were threats to the nation, so any soldier donating to them would be subject to punishment. But the story also quotes a Fort Hood spokesman as saying that, based on a preliminary investigation, the claim reported by Red Flag News "is not substantiated by unit leadership and soldiers present at this training venue." The story, under a different headline, is repeated at FoxNews.com. We quickly found that, under military regulations, there are limitations to the political activities that soldiers can engage in, but none this extreme. Most are intended to avoid the impression that the Department of Defense is endorsing a political party or candidate. For example, while they can have a political bumper sticker on their private vehicles, they cannot post a large political sign, banner, or poster on their cars or trucks. Service members are allowed to donate to campaigns and political parties as private individuals, subject to the same laws that apply to all federal employees. When we asked the Department of Defense about the tea party tweet and the Red Flag headline, spokesman Lt. Col. J. Todd Breasseale, called it "an absurdity of such outlandish proportion, it's almost difficult to take seriously. "But it's also a kind of un-American, potentially dangerous fear-mongering," he said, "and so I'd like to be as clear as I can here: Service members may donate to any legal cause they choose, and, as long as they do so within the boundaries of the Hatch Act, may involve themselves (out of uniform, without using government equipment, off duty, in a way that implies no government endorsement) in the political process, regardless of party affiliation." (The Hatch Act is a federal anti-corruption law that restricts the political activities of federal employees. But even those who are not allowed to engage in partisan politics are still permitted to contribute money to political organizations.) When we contacted the Rhode Island Tea Party to ask about the Twitter message, President Susan Wynne said in a email, "I was merely sharing the story and is not an endorsement by RI Tea Party. If you find any other information, I'd be happy to see it." If the tweet was wrong, she said in a subsequent email, it would be deleted. We sent her a copy of Breasseale's statement. Four days later, the tweet was still there. At PolitiFact, we believe people and parties have an obligation to check things out before they blindly pass them along to others. It's true that Red Flag News (motto: "Aggregating the News that Mainstream Media Distort and Ignore") originated the over-the-top headline. But Wynne, on behalf of her organization, chose to repeat it, even when the story itself included facts that should have prompted some skepticism. For that reason, we rate the Rhode Island Tea Party's tweet a Pants on Fire! (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-09322	When the United States "first created the federal income tax, frankly, nobody below a million dollars a year paid anything."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/14/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-only-millionaires-paid-first-us-inco/	On April 8, 2010 -- one week before tax-filing day -- former House speaker (and possible 2012 presidential candidate) Newt Gingrich made a comment about the history of U.S. taxes that caught our eye. In a question-and-answer period following a speech to the Southern Republican Leadership Conference, the Georgia Republican said that when the United States "first created the federal income tax, frankly, nobody below a million dollars a year paid anything." The first federal income tax was imposed during the Civil War, but it was scrapped in 1872 and not revived until 1913, after ratification of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution. Gingrich's camp didn't respond to an inquiry, so we weren't able to ask which tax he meant. But we'll analyze his comment based on the 1913 tax. Several experts we spoke to agreed that income and tax data from the 1860s ranges from unreliable to nonexistent, and wouldn't be comparable to current statistics. In addition, the 1913 tax is the direct predecessor of the current tax system. (The first tax form in 1913 was even called the 1040.) The 1913 federal income tax had seven tax brackets, according to the Tax Foundation. Taxpayers (either individual or joint filers) who had taxable income from zero to $20,000 were taxed at a rate of 1 percent. Those between $20,000 and $50,000 were taxed at 2 percent; between $50,000 and $75,000, 3 percent; $75,000 and $100,000, 4 percent; $100,000 to $250,000, 5 percent; $250,000 to $500,000, 6 percent; and higher than $500,000, 7 percent. Right off the bat, this would seem to make Gingrich's statement incorrect, since anyone earning even one dollar in income would, by the book, be subject to the income tax. But it's actually a bit more complicated. For one thing, that line of thinking ignores exemptions. Individuals and joint filers in 1913, just like taxpayers today, could exempt a portion of their income from the federal tax. According to the 1913 tax form, individuals could exempt their first $3,000, while joint filers could exempt their first $4,000. So that set a floor for who was on the hook for taxes in 1913. As for what constitutes a "millionaire," Gingrich didn't specify, but we think he meant millionaires in 2010 dollars. (It makes for a more favorable calculation for him.) According to an online Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator, the 1913 equivalent of $1 million in today's money was $45,677. So, joint filers earning between $4,000 and $45,677 were liable for the federal income tax -- at either the 1 percent or 2 percent level -- but were less affluent than a "millionaire" in today's dollars, which was Gingrich's cutoff point. The fact that these Americans paid taxes make Gingrich's comment wrong on its face. Still, his general point might not be too misleading if an extremely small number of people fell into that income range. It's possible to estimate how many taxpayers would have fallen into that income category by looking at a well-known academic study of U.S. income distribution published in 2004 by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez. The authors provide tables that examine the top end of the income distribution. (For clarity's sake, we'll list the 1913 dollar figures that we reverse-engineered from the Piketty and Saez tables, which are denominated in 2000 dollars.) Looking at their tables, we see that an income of $45,677 (remember, that's enough to qualify as a 1913 "millionaire") would have placed a taxpayer in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of American incomes. Meanwhile, the tables indicate that the top 1 percent of incomes began at $10,466. Their tables don't provide a figure for the top 10 percent, but working backward from the levels they do list beginning in 1917, it seems reasonable to assume that an income of roughly $2,284 would have landed a taxpayer in the top 10 percent of income. Using a back-of-the-envelope estimate, then, a couple with $4,000 income in 1913 probably would have ranked in the best-compensated 4 to 6 percent of Americans. So that means that perhaps 5 percent of Americans weren't millionaires, and yet were subject to the federal income tax. That's equivalent to several million households among the 97 million people estimated by the Census to be living in the U.S. in 1913. That number could drop a bit once other deductions are factored in, such as interest paid on loans. But the number is probably pretty close to that. Where does this leave us? Gingrich has a point that lots of taxpayers were indeed fully exempt from federal taxation in 1913. The exemption levels were equal to nearly $66,000 and $88,000, respectively, in today's dollars -- incomes that today would place one comfortably into the middle class. But to us, it's not enough to make up for his ignoring several million Americans when he claimed that "nobody below a million dollars a year paid anything" in federal income taxes. Someone who earns $88,000 is far from a millionaire. So we rate his statement False.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2010-04-14T22:01:10	2010-04-08	['United_States']

pomt-06575	Says Texas wildfires are linked to climate change.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-slams-rick-perry-climate-change-citin/	During a Sept. 26, 2011, speech at a Democratic National Committee fundraising event in San Jose, Calif., President Barack Obama aimed some attack lines at the Republican Party. "Some of you here may be folks who actually used to be Republican but are puzzled by what’s happened to that party...." Obama said in comments that, according to the White House’s transcript, were punctuated by laughter. "I mean, has anybody been watching the debates lately? You’ve got a governor whose state is on fire denying climate change. No, no, it’s true. You’ve got audiences cheering at the prospect of somebody dying because they don’t have health care, and booing a service member in Iraq because they’re gay. That’s not reflective of who we are. We’ve had differences in the past, but at some level we’ve always believed, you know what, that we’re not defined by our differences. We’re bound together." After several readers brought it to our attention, we zeroed in on Obama’s comment that "you’ve got a governor whose state is on fire denying climate change." The governor in question is Rick Perry of Texas -- one of the leading candidates in the Republican presidential primary and therefore a potential challenger to Obama in his bid for a second term next year. As for the fires Obama mentioned, Texas has been experiencing one of its most severe wildfire seasons in history. According to the Texas Forest Service, 3.8 million acres burned and 2,742 homes were destroyed by wildfires between Nov. 15, 2010 and Sept. 26, 2011. A spokesman for Perry, Mark Miner, thought Obama’s comment was unfair, telling ABC News, "It’s outrageous President Obama would use … the worst fires in state history as a political attack." Asked about Obama’s comments during a Sept. 26 press availability, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters on Air Force One that the president’s "point was simply that you have severe weather in that state, and the leader of that state questioned whether something that's been well established as a scientific fact is in fact a fact. … (Obama’s) point is that the link between climate and the severe weather that we’ve been experiencing is something that's studied by scientists all the time, and to simply dismiss it is, he believes, not responsible leadership." Despite our readers’ urgings, we gave serious thought to not rating Obama’s comment on the Truth-O-Meter. Obama clearly intended it to be a lighthearted comment, and the audience took it that way, as evidenced by applause noted in the transcript. In addition, the line was a rhetorical aside, not part of a substantive policy address about climate change. But Obama’s comment fit our main qualification for choosing items to fact-check -- would people wonder whether the comment is true? Is it possible to draw a link between a specific weather event, such as the drought in Texas and the wildfires, and global climate change? As it turns out, this question has an interesting answer. First, some background on climate change. Perry is on record expressing skepticism that human actions are causing climate change. During a Republican debate on Sept. 7, 2011, he said that "the science is not settled (on climate change). The idea that we would put Americans’ economy at jeopardy based on scientific theory that’s not settled yet to me is just nonsense." We also fact-checked a separate comment by Perry "questioning the original idea that man-made global warming is what is causing the climate to change. … (It is) more and more being put into question." We ruled Perry’s statements False. As we noted, one of the most oft-cited reports on climate change comes from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is widely considered the leading international organization on climate science. It includes the scientific consensus of thousands of researchers from 194 countries. "Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in (human-created) greenhouse gas concentrations," the most recent report states. In the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCC's conclusions, and the report directly addressed the question of how climate change could affect weather. "Water is an issue in every region, but the nature of the potential impacts varies," it said in a summary. "Drought, related to reduced precipitation, increased evaporation and increased water loss from plants, is an important issue in many regions, especially in the West. Floods and water quality problems are likely to be amplified by climate change in most regions. Declines in mountain snowpack are important in the West and Alaska where snowpack provides vital natural water storage." However, climate-change experts have also long urged caution in assuming that particular weather events are caused or influenced by climate change. Consider a June 2011 paper published by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, an independent research organization. In the paper -- titled "Extreme Weather and Climate Change Understanding the Link, Managing the Risk" -- co-authors Daniel G. Huber and Jay Gulledge write that "when we ask whether climate change ‘caused’ a particular event, we pose a fundamentally unanswerable question." In fact, they say it is "nonsense" to debate a direct climatological link between a single event and the long-term rise in the global average surface temperature. The reason, Huber and Gulledge write, is the distinction between "climate" -- a long-term pattern that averages many weather events over the years -- and a particular weather event. By definition, Huber and Gulledge write, "an isolated event lacks useful information about climate trends. Consider a hypothetical example: Prior to any change in the climate, there was one category 5 hurricane per year, but after the climate warmed for some decades, there were two category 5 hurricanes per year. In a given year, which of the two hurricanes was caused by climate change? Since the two events are indistinguishable, this question is nonsense. It is not the occurrence of either of the two events that matters. The two events together – or more accurately, the average of two events per year – define the change in the climate." What makes the Texas situation an imperfect fit for this general rule is that what’s happening isn’t one wildfire, or even a spate of wildfires. It’s a months-long season of specific weather-related events -- wildfires -- whose roots stem from broader climatic conditions. "It is a combination of unprecedented heat this summer, completely obliterating the previous record; exceptional drought conditions; exceptional soil moisture decreases, which exacerbate the temperature extremes; and, on top of that, extensive wild fires," said Gavin Schmidt, a climate specialist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. "These elements cannot be separated. … Extreme heat becomes more common under climate change, and that has consequences, depending on location -- more drought, and more susceptibility to wildfires." Even Gulledge, the co-author of the Pew paper that cautioned against blaming weather events on climate change, said the Texas case may constitute an exception to the rule he laid out. "There is a well-documented link between the earlier start of spring, higher summer temperatures, and drier conditions during summer and fall -- that is, climate change -- and a dramatic increase in wildfire activity in the western U.S. since the late 1980s," he said. "These observations reveal an increase in fire risk due to climate change." Gulledge found it noteworthy that in a recent blog post, John Nielsen-Gammon -- the Texas state climatologist and a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University -- suggested a connection between the wildfires and climate change, even if it came with caveats and limitations. On the one hand, Nielsen-Gammon said the low rainfall levels since October 2010 do not appear to have been made "more likely" by global warming. In turn, this rainfall deficit, he estimated, explains most of the excess heat that set the stage for the wildfires. On the other hand, his modeling suggested that global warming did provide an additional contributing factor to the unusually high temperatures. "The impacts of the drought," he concluded, "were enhanced by global warming." What makes this topic so difficult to analyze is that the way the atmosphere works is extremely complicated. Gulledge compared the atmosphere to a car. "Both the atmosphere and a car are complex systems, but one is fundamentally predictable, while the other is fundamentally unpredictable," he said. "A given force applied to the atmosphere has many different potential outcomes, not a single calculable outcome. That’s different from an automobile, which can be predicted very precisely. If I step on the gas, it will speed up; if I turn the wheel, the car will turn. Consequently, weather forecasters give percentage chances of rain instead of performing a single calculation that predicts a single amount of rain in a given place on a given day." A related complication is that this boils down to a question of probabilities rather than certainties. "The right question to ask is, ‘Has global warming increased the likelihood of an event like the Texas drought occurring’ And the answer to that question is yes," said Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami. "While droughts occur in a climate unaffected by human activities, a warming climate increases the likelihood that they will occur." He offers an analogy that he credits to a colleague, Tony Broccoli of Rutgers University. "Consider a baseball player who goes through a rigorous off-season training program, which results in greater strength and faster bat speed," Soden said. "On his first at bat of the season, he hits a home run. Would you say that the home run was a result of his off season training? No one can answer that question. But would you say that the off-season training increased the likelihood of it occurring? Yes." Rob Jackson, the director of the Duke Center on Global Change, acknowledges this backdrop of uncertainty. "Can anyone say with certainty that this is climate-change related? Absolutely not," he said. But Jackson -- who went to college and taught in Texas and continues to visit frequently to see family -- suggested that the scale of the Texas wildfires is starting to change the minds of some scientists who have traditionally been hesitant to blame specific weather events on climate change. "The heat and drought I saw in August is almost enough to make me say that climate change is playing a role, amplifying other factors," Jackson said. "I've never said that before about any weather event." Our ruling Historically, scientists have drawn a clear distinction between specific weather events and longer-range changes in climate, and that sentiment persists. Normally, we would be extremely skeptical of claims linking specific weather events to climate change. However, the situation in Texas that Obama was referring to could be described as something broader than a specific weather event, and there is peer-reviewed evidence linking broader climate change in the American southwest with the incidence of wildfires in the region. The Texas state climatologist recently wrote that he believes climate change has had an effect in encouraging the current wildfires, but only as a modest contributing factor. This caution, combined with the difficulty of determining cause and effect in a system as complex as the earth’s atmosphere, leads us to rate Obama’s claim Half True.

pomt-04323	Says "the typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month" if library district passes.	true	/oregon/statements/2012/oct/26/libraries-yes-committee/will-multnomah-county-library-tax-district-cost-ty/	When it comes to voting for or against increased taxes, it’s helpful to know exactly what the bottom line is. Just how much will this mean out of my pocket? Supporters of a new Multnomah County Library District -- the Libraries Yes! Committee -- tried to put the tax measure in some context in a recent mailer. "The typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month than the amount we currently pay." We thought it was worth a quick check to see just what the measure’s impact would be for the average homeowner. We spoke with Liz Kaufman, who is handling media for the campaign, to see how it arrived at the $4 mark. She directed us to the measure’s explanatory statement written by Multnomah County Attorney Jenny Morf. In the statement, Morf wrote that "If approved, the Multnomah County Library District will be formed with a permanent rate up to $1.24 per $1000 of assessed value. The typical homeowner will pay $49 a year above the cost of the current levy or $.89 per $1000 assessed value." So that extra 35 cents per $1,000 of assessed value would mean an extra $49 a year. Divide that by 12 and you get $4.08. The math checks out. Next we examined what constitutes a "typical" homeowner. According to Multnomah County, the median assessed home value for the county is $149,920. Homeowners at that level are paying just over $11 a month, or $133 a year, at the current 89-cent rate. That would get bumped up by about $4 to $15.50 -- or $185 annually -- if the tax district passes. We ran the numbers again, just to be safe, with the average assessed value, which is higher, about $178,000. At that number, homeowners currently pay $13.20 a month and can expect to pay $18.40 a month if the measure passes -- $5.20 more. By the way, homeowners won’t see the full increase immediately. For the first five years, they would actually be charged $1.18 for each $1,000 of assessed value. After that, it starts to climb to the maximum $1.24. While the ultimate cost would be more for the average house, we think it’s fair to call the median number, where half the houses are assessed at more and half less, "typical." Those figures back up the Libraries Yes! Committee’s claim that the typical homeowner will pay $4 more per month" once the new district goes into full effect. We rate this claim True.

pomt-00414	North Carolina is one of "very few states" that give the governor sole discretion to pick judges.	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/aug/29/tim-moore/moore-says-constitutional-amendment-puts-nc-line-o/	There must be a shift in the universe if all of the living former North Carolina governors, both Democratic and Republican, come together to take a stand against the actions of the General Assembly. What exactly is that cosmic force? A constitutional amendment that would take away the governor’s sole power to appoint judges during vacancies, and hand it over to the General Assembly. Democrats have decried the proposal as a seismic power shift, and a three-panel judge three-judge panel recently told the legislature (which is controlled by Republicans) to rewrite the amendment language. How radical is this power shift, really? Not very, says House Speaker Tim Moore. Moore said on Aug. 24 that the proposed constitutional amendment "actually puts us in line with what most other states do. Very few states allow a governor unilateral and sole discretion to pick those judges who continue to serve." What the proposal would change Currently, in North Carolina, the governor has the full discretion to appoint someone to fill a vacant judicial seat to serve until the next general election. Judges in North Carolina are selected through partisan elections. The constitutional amendment, if it passes, would lead to the creation of a Nonpartisan Judicial Merit Commission of no more than nine members. The members of the commission would be picked by the governor, the General Assembly and the state’s chief justice. The commission would verify that all candidates who apply are legally qualified and assess their merit, without regard for party affiliation. The list of candidates then would go to the General Assembly, and lawmakers would pick at least two for the governor to choose from. Is this a revolutionary change? Not really. What other states do When PolitiFact reached out to Moore’s office, spokesperson Joseph Kyzer cited a Ballotpedia page that says "34 states and the District of Columbia use some variation of assisted appointment." The Ballotpedia information includes all states that use a merit commission in some form, including for first-term appointments, judicial vacancies or in combination with other methods. According to data from the New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, most states do actually have some type of merit commission in place to help select judges. When filling a state Supreme Court vacancy, 34 states do use some type of merit nominating commission during the process according to the data from the Brennan Center. Only seven states currently allow the governor to directly fill state Supreme Court vacancies: Alabama, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Arkansas and Washington. When filling vacancies in state appellate courts, the Brennan Center reports, 23 states use a nominating commission. Meanwhile, 34 states use nominating commissions to fill vacant judgeships in trial courts. Types of merit selection It sounds as if most states do have some type of merit nominating commission, although there are a few differences in how they operate. Missouri was the first state to have a merit commission in 1940. Its setup is often regarded as the "gold standard" merit commission plan. The Missouri State Bar, Governor and Supreme Court have an equal share in choosing commission members. Those members then elect who the head of the commission will be. The Missouri legislature has no say in the matter. Bill Raftery, a senior analyst at the National Center for State Courts, says some don’t have the Missouri plan in place because states interpret "merit commission" differently and with varying degrees of involvement from legislators. He said because of that the term "merit commission" can be misleading by suggesting that a third party is involved in selecting judges. In the proposed North Carolina commission, the General Assembly, Governor and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court would select the commission members. The state’s current Chief Justice is Mark Martin, a Republican. He was elected in 2014 for an eight year term. According to information from the nonpartisan American Judicature Society, seven states give their legislature some type of role in appointing commission members. An NC nominating commission That’s not the only major difference between the proposed North Carolina commission and other commissions. In the proposed amendment, the role of the commission would be to make sure the candidates are qualified to fill judicial vacancies, as prescribed by the law, without regard to their party affiliation. The commission’s evaluation would then be sent to the General Assembly, who will choose at least two candidates for the governor to choose from. "The nominating commission is only tasked with determining if the applicants meet the legal qualifications to be a judge, which is different than how nominating commissions are used in other states," said Douglas Keith, counsel in the Democracy program for the New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. Stephen Ware, a law professor at the University of Kansas, says that, based on the description in the ballot, the merit commission would play a less powerful role than in other states if its objective is to check "legal requirements as opposed to assessing the pros and cons of applicants and making the hard choices of who would be better." In fact, most merit commissions are tasked with "narrowing down a pool of applicants to a few finalists" for the governor or legislature to select from says Ware. Our ruling Despite differences among the states in how commissions operate, Moore’s statement is mostly true. Most states do in fact have some type of merit commission in place, and these commissions do play a role in appointing judges during vacancies. However, the proposed North Carolina merit commission would have a different role than in most other states. Its primary job would be to make sure candidates are legally qualified to serve as judges, rather than vet applicants.

pomt-04990	Says Jeff Brandes voted to allow state-run Citizens Property Insurance to dump policies onto "out-of-state, unregulated private companies."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/jul/20/committee-protect-florida/mailer-calls-out-jeff-brandes-supporting-measure-d/	A mailer circulating in Tampa Bay targets St. Petersburg Rep. Jeff Brandes over a vote he took on Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state-run company that covers more Floridians than any property insurer. Brandes is running in the Republican primary for Senate District 22 against Rep. Jim Frishe, a 12-year House member who is backed by the electioneering group that sponsored the mailer, the Committee to Protect Florida. The GOP in District 22 is one of the most closely watched in the state. The piece features an exasperated, white-haired man at his kitchen table, his palm to his forehead, distraught over a letter he received from Citizens. Text wrapped around the image reads: Jeff Brandes would let Citizens dump some policies...and sell out homeowners who trusted him. Hurricanes. Sinkholes. Higher costs, weaker coverage and rejected claims. Every Bay-area homeowner is facing big, expensive risks in today’s volatile insurance market. Jeff Brandes wants to add another risk we can’t afford. He voted to allow Citizens -- the state’s largest property insurer -- to dump policies onto out-of-state, unregulated private companies. Policy holders would be stuck with no control... and all the cost! For us? Brandes votes in Tallahassee for them. He fights for big insurance and sides with special Interests. The fact is, with a voting record like his, Jeff Brandes is the biggest risk of all. At hand is one of the diciest issues of the 2012 legislative session. The measure (HB 245) would have allowed "surplus lines" companies to take over Citizens policies in an effort to shrink the company. These companies, which Democrats likened to vultures, are not overseen by the state Office of Insurance Regulation and usually have higher premiums. Many Republicans, including Gov. Rick Scott, say Citizens would be overexposed should a calamitous storm hit the state. (Read this PolitiFact Florida story for more information about the company’s financial health.) Basically, many Republicans believe that Citizens does not have the ability to pay out claims in the event of the storm, which would leave the state in a disastrous position. So it’s better to move policyholders to other more stable companies, they say, even if it means higher premiums. They also note that Citizens was created as an insurer of last resort but has grown to be the state’s largest property insurer. Supporters of the bill pointed to a few consumer-minded safeguards, such as requiring companies to have at least $50 million in surplus and the financial strength to withstand two hurricanes. Opponents said homeowners would be out of luck should such a company became insolvent, though, because it would not be covered by the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association. The version that passed a full vote of the House on Feb. 3, 2012, would have automatically moved policyholders to a surplus lines company if they did not opt out within 30 days notice. (Dissatisfied customers could return to Citizens later.) The House approved the measure 66-48. Frishe voted No; Brandes voted Yes. That’s key to this fact-check, but there’s a little more to the story. When the Florida Senate considered the proposal, it altered the bill be more consumer-friendly. The Senate made the measure "opt-in," meaning a consumer had to proactively approve the switch with a signature. Supporters of the original proposal argued that the change would gut the intent of the bill: to reduce the number of policies held by Citizens. And when the amended bill bounced back to the House, Republican House members proposed to reject the opt-in provision and kick the bill back to the Senate. But that idea failed in the the closest House vote of the session. Both Brandes and Frishe voted against blocking the Senate’s opt-in amendment. With the opt-in provision now part of the bill, the House sponsor said the proposal "might as well be dead" and decided not to bring it for a full vote. Brandes, reached by phone, said he voted for the original version because "we have to take serious measures in order to reduce the exposure literally to the citizens of the state." However, he said he was "happier" with an opt-in requirement -- which explains his vote when the bill resurfaced. That point doesn’t matter to Roger "Rockie" Pennington, chairman of the Committee to Protect Florida, the group behind the mailer. "When he had a chance to stand up for consumers, he stood with citizens and out-of-state, unregulated insurers," Pennington said. Our ruling As the ad claims, Brandes voted for a measure that would have allowed out-of-state companies to pluck Citizens policyholders in an effort to lessen Citizens’ liability in the event of a big storm. A month later, after the Senate included a provision that would require policyholders to opt-in to the program, House members made a motion to reject that change, and Brandes voted not to reject the opt-in provision. With the opt-in provision part of the bill, the House decided to scuttle the proposal for 2012. The claim from the Committee to Protect Florida is accurate but needs additional information, which is our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-06103	Georgia’s unemployment rate has exceeded the national rate for 50 consecutive months.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/04/buddy-carter/georgia-unemployment-rate-higher-nation/	State lawmaker Buddy Carter wants to help more Georgians find jobs. In the process, he gave us some work to do. Carter, a Republican senator from Pooler, located near Savannah, wrote a column on his website in mid-December full of numbers and data highlighting Georgia’s high unemployment rate. There was one claim in it that we found particularly curious. "Currently, Georgia’s unemployment rate stands at 10.2 [percent] while the national rate is at 9 [percent]. Perhaps even more disturbing is that Georgia’s unemployment rate has exceeded the national rate for 50 consecutive months," he wrote. Has the state’s unemployment rate been higher than the national rate for 50 straight months? We chose the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to check out the senator’s claim. The federal agency keeps detailed data on unemployment for the nation and each state (the numbers include job growth or decline in various industries) and is used by most economists. When Carter wrote his column, October 2011 was the most recent month that the bureau had unemployment data for Georgia and the nation. That month, the unemployment rate in the state was 10.2 percent. The unemployment rate for the entire country was 9 percent. In each month of 2011, the unemployment rate in Georgia ranged between a high of 10.3 percent in January and September and a low of 9.8 percent, which was recorded in April and May. The highest national monthly unemployment rate was recorded in June, at 9.2 percent. So far, Carter is correct, which is 10 months. How about 2010? Carter was right. The highest monthly national rate was 9.8 percent, which was recorded in April and November. The unemployment rate for Georgia those months were 10.1 and 10.4 percent, respectively. Georgia’s unemployment rate for the other 10 months of 2010 was at least 0.5 percentage points higher than the nation. That adds up to 22 months of a higher unemployment rate for the Peach State. Let’s go to 2009. Georgia’s unemployment rate rose steadily from 8.5 percent in January to 10.4 percent in October, November and December. Again, Georgia had a higher unemployment rate than the nation in each month of that year. The closest Georgia came to having a lower rate than the nation was May, when the state’s rate was 9.6 percent and the national rate was 9.4 percent. OK, so when was the last time the nation’s unemployment rate was the same or eclipsed Georgia’s? Answer: July 2007. In that month, the national rate and Georgia’s were 4.7 percent, according to the BLS. Carter was correct. We rate the claim in his column as True.

pomt-03049	Forty-six states have a line-item veto for the governor.	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/oct/06/lincoln-chafee/ri-gov-lincoln-chafee-says-governors-46-states-hav/	In a Sept. 22 interview on WPRI-Channel 12’s "Newsmakers," the subject of the Rhode Island State Constitution and the relative powers of the governor and General Assembly came up. Governor Lincoln Chafee said on the show that "nothing could be more important" than to assign more power to the governor, who, in Rhode Island, is institutionally weak relative to the Assembly. "Line-item veto is a perfect example. Everything goes in the budget the last minute. If the governor vetoes the whole budget, it’s going to be overridden in a millisecond," he said. "But if you can line-item veto, like 46 other states have, then that becomes a public discussion about that narrow issue" and the governor might be able to prevail. Is Chafee correct that a large majority -- 46 of 50 states -- give their governors the line-item veto? We thought we’d test his knowledge of the states. First, let’s define the term "line-item veto." It allows a chief executive to prevent from becoming law a particular provision of a bill approved by a legislature, including a budget bill, while allowing the rest of the bill to take effect. In Rhode Island, it takes a three-fifths majority vote of both branches of the General Assembly to override a governor’s veto. The three-fifths requirement, rather than the simple majority necessary to pass a bill initially, is a higher threshold that gives a governor an improved chance to win in a disagreement. In order for the governor to gain the line-item veto, a Constitutional Convention would have to be called, the convention delegates would have to propose that change to voters, and they would have to approve the change. A convention typically is convened by a vote of the electorate every 10 years. Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis has said that he intends to put a convention call on the general election ballot in 2014. So, back to our test of Chafee’s claim that 46 states have a line-item veto. We went to "The Book of the States," 2013 edition, published by the Council of State Governments. It lists 44 states in which the governor has a line-item veto for all bills or at least for bills appropriating money. Besides Rhode Island, the only states lacking it are Nevada, Indiana, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Vermont. The "Book of the States" information is based on state-by-state surveys completed in December 2012. So we contacted the National Council of State Legislatures and the National Governors Association to make sure nothing has changed since. It hasn’t, they say. Our ruling Governor Lincoln Chafee said governors in 46 states have line-item veto power. But a definitive and up-to-date source, The Book of the States, says 44 have it. He is very close. The judges rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Lincoln Chafee	None	None	None	2013-10-06T00:01:00	2013-09-22	['None']

pomt-11447	The last private rocket launch "cost $80 million. If the government did it, the same thing would have cost probably 40 or 50 times that amount of money. I mean, literally."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/12/donald-trump/trump-takes-dig-nasa-extols-private-rocketeers/	President Donald Trump looked to the stars, or at least near-Earth orbit, to cite yet another example of the private sector getting things done better and cheaper than the government. With rocket models decorating the table where Trump and his Cabinet met March 8, Trump singled out the private operators. "Rich guys, they love rocket ships, and that's good," Trump said. "That's better than us paying for it. And I noticed the prices of the last one, that they said it cost $80 million. If the government did it, the same thing would have cost probably 40 or 50 times that amount of money. I mean, literally." We thought about Trump’s cost-multiplier estimate and wondered if it would cost NASA $3.2 billion to do what the private rockets do. The comparison is a stretch for several reasons, but as Jason Davis at the Planetary Society put it, the main one is "it’s sort of like comparing a Ford Focus to a Cadillac Escalade." The private rockets don’t need to go higher than low-Earth orbit. SpaceX, for example, carries supplies to the International Space Station, which is about 250 miles above the earth. With the shorter distance, the rockets can be smaller. The SpaceX Falcon 9 is about 230 feet high. NASA has left that closer-in zone to the private firms since 2006. Its field of play reaches further out, to the moon and beyond. NASA has been developing the Space Launch System, a veritable beast of a rocket where the shortest configuration is 322 feet tall. With that in mind, let’s look at the dollars. The private price tag The list price of the most basic SpaceX rocket, the Falcon 9, is $62 million. If you want more lift, the Falcon Heavy goes for $90 million. So $80 million is a reasonable midpoint. Davis noted, though, that prices can run higher. "The Air Force paid $97 million for the Falcon 9 that launched the DSCOVR climate satellite," he said. The key here is that this price tag covers the cost of producing and operating the rocket for each launch. Part of the money goes to recover the cost of designing and developing the rocket, and for that, it’s important to note that NASA and the companies shared the tab. In 2011, to ensure that two companies, SpaceX and Orbital ATK, had the capacity to supply the International Space Station, Congress provided $821 million, or about 44 percent of what it took to develop and test the commercial systems. That government investment made it easier for the firms to be commercially viable. Joshua Colwell, professor of planetary science and assistant director of the Florida Space Institute, told us having a guaranteed buyer also helped. "SpaceX got to where it is in part thanks to lots of government contracts to send supplies to the International Space Station," Colwell said. The NASA price tag NASA is building the Space Launch System to do much more than the private rockets. It will be safe enough to carry astronauts in a capsule called Orion — a separate huge expense in its own right — or pure cargo. As for distance, the minimum range is the moon, or about 239,000 miles from Earth, in contrast to the 250 miles distance to the International Space Station. An artist’s rendition of the Space Launch System carrying the Orion capsule in to space. (NASA) This big rocket and its Orion capsule are scheduled for their first voyage in 2020. So, as a practical matter, there is no ongoing series of launches to compare to the private operators. There are a few ways to tackle the question. Davis at the Planetary Society looked at the development cost. "The Space Launch System currently costs NASA more than $2 billion per year, and it's still under development," Davis said. "It will go on two test flights over the next five years, so I suppose you could calculate that you're paying about $5 billion per flight." On the other hand, this big rocket could be used more often over a longer stretch of time. The website Ars Technica is into rocket science and rocket budgets. In 2016, it estimated development and operation costs of $60 billion for the rocket, the Orion capsule and infrastructure on the ground at the Kennedy Space Center over the next two decades. Assuming one flight each year, the package cost of rocket, capsule and ground operations would come to $3 billion per flight. Ars Technica relayed a much slimmer price tag from NASA manager Bill Hill. In 2016, Hill said he was aiming for an annual cost of $2 billion a year with two flights annually by the end of the 2020s. That would drive the cost down to $1 billion per flight. Again, this is neither certain nor directly comparable to today’s private launches. Colwell puts no stock in Trump’s 40-50 times estimate. At the same time, he takes the larger point. "It is probably true that SpaceX is cheaper than an equivalent government-developed rocket, but there is no equivalent government-developed rocket." We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said that at $80 million per launch, private rockets are about 40 to 50 times cheaper than NASA would spend if it did "the same thing." The $80 million figure is roughly accurate, but the key flaw in the statement is that NASA is not doing the same thing. As part of a policy decision made a decade ago, NASA has left the shorter distance work to the private sector while it focuses on getting to the moon and beyond. We found a wide range of approaches and estimates of what it would cost to launch the Space Launch System on a year-in-year-out basis. The answers on the high end backed up Trump’s remark. The answers on the low end suggested he exaggerated. But fundamentally, this is a comparison between a Ford Fusion and a Cadillac Escalade. One will be much more expensive than the other, but they are used in very different ways. We rate this claim Half True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com What do you think?

pomt-06003	Says PolitiFact has said he "kept a campaign promise to toughen ethics rules."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/19/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-kept-campaign-promise-toughen-et/	In a 30-second ad released Jan. 18, 2012, President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign touts his record on several issues, including ethics. "President Obama kept his promise to toughen ethics rules," a narrator says, as the following text is displayed on the screen: "President Obama ‘kept a campaign promise to toughen ethics rules,’ PolitiFact 1/21/09." With our work cited in a campaign ad, we thought it would be worth checking whether it was cited accurately. We found the article referenced in the ad -- a check in our Obameter that looked at whether the president kept his promise to "issue an executive order banning registered lobbyists or lobbying firms from giving gifts in any amount or any form to executive branch employees." The ad is correct that we rated this a Promise Kept. "In one of his first acts as president," we wrote at the time, "Barack Obama kept a campaign promise to toughen ethics rules, signing an executive order on Jan. 21, 2009. ‘If you are a lobbyist entering my administration, you will not be able to work on matters you lobbied on, or in the agencies you lobbied during the previous two years,’ Obama said at the signing ceremony. ‘When you leave government, you will not be able to lobby my administration for as long as I am president. And there will be a ban on gifts by lobbyists to anyone serving in the administration as well.’" We should note that we rated this a Promise Kept one day after Obama took office, based on his signing of the executive order. We have not checked subsequently to see if the executive order has been adhered to. However, since this is all we’ve published on that promise, we think it’s fair for the Obama campaign to have pointed to it. But is this the whole story? Not necessarily. We looked over our promises again and found at least 10 additional promise ratings relevant to the ad’s claim. And on these promises, Obama’s record has been decidedly more mixed. (We determined that five additional promises we had categorized under "ethics" weren’t relevant to the ad’s claim, so we’re excluding them from our calculation. But the ratings for those five are also all over the map, so it doesn’t change our conclusion.) Here’s a rundown of the ethics promises we think are relevant: • Centralize ethics and lobbying information for voters: Promise Broken • Seek independent watchdog agency to investigate congressional ethics violations: Stalled • Create a public "Contracts and Influence" database: Promise Broken • Expose Special Interest Tax Breaks to Public Scrutiny: Stalled • Require more disclosure and a waiting period for earmarks: Compromise • Make White House communications public: Stalled • Conduct regulatory agency business in public: In the Works • Release presidential records: Promise Kept • Tougher rules against revolving door for lobbyists and former officials: Promise Broken • Require new hires to sign a form affirming their hiring was not due to political affiliation or contributions: Promise Kept Counting the Promise Kept already cited in the ad, the final breakdown for these 11 promises is three rated Promise Kept, one Compromise, one In the Works, three rated Stalled and three rated Promise Broken. So, more than half of those promise are rated either Stalled or Promise Broken. To be able to cite a Promise Kept on ethics, the ad makers cherry-picked just one of at least 11 relevant promise checks they could have chosen from. Our ruling The ad accurately quoted one of our promise checks in saying that Obama "kept a campaign promise to toughen ethics rules." However, it ignored at least 10 other ethics-related promise checks that showed a more mixed record, including three promises rated Stalled and three rated Broken. On balance, we rate the ad Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-01-19T15:59:46	2012-01-18	['None']
pomt-03576	A 0.05 standard for drunken driving means having a glass of wine at dinner could make a person drunk.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/may/17/tavern-league-wisconsin/005-glass-wine-could-make-person-legally-drunk-wis/	On May 14, 2013, a federal agency recommended reducing the threshold for evidence of drunken driving from a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08 to 0.05. That means having a glass of wine at dinner might make a person drunk, a spokesman for the Tavern League of Wisconsin told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel the same day. Under a BAC standard of 0.05, a person could get nailed for DUI after one drink? Tavern League’s evidence The statement was made by Scott Stenger, a Madison lobbyist whose clients include the tavern league. He told us he based his claim on news articles about the 0.05 recommendation, including a report from the Journal Sentinel and The Associated Press, and a chart on blood-alcohol concentration from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. The news covered the recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates transportation accidents and makes recommendations based on its findings. The board said states should cut the current blood-alcohol level for evidence of intoxication as part of a series of ideas aimed at reducing alcohol-related highway deaths. In its report, the Associated Press said 0.05 is "about one drink for a woman weighing less than 120 pounds," and that a drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine, or 1 ounce of 80-proof alcohol "in most studies." Meanwhile, the Texas agency chart that Stenger cited says its BAC data comes from another federal body, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which works to prevent highway crashes. That data says essentially what Stenger and AP did: A 100-pound woman could reach 0.05 after one drink. (Incidentally, both the AP and the chart used by the Texas agency said a 160-pound man could reach 0.05 after consuming two drinks in one hour.) So, there’s evidence that a limited group of drinkers -- women weighing under 120 pounds -- could be legally drunk after one drink, if the standard for drunken driving were reduced to a blood-alcohol level of 0.05. What other evidence is out there? BAC calculators We checked three online calculators that provide blood-alcohol concentration estimates based on various factors, including gender and weight. They generally found a BAC of less than 0.05 for a 100-pound woman consuming one drink. The calculator at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (which also has a smartphone app), says the BAC would be 0.03. A more detailed calculator from the University of Notre Dame’s Office of Alcohol and Drug Education says the BAC would be 0.04 for a 5-ounce glass of wine, if the wine is red and 12.5 percent alcohol. And the calculator at Central Connecticut State University’s Office of Alcohol and Drug Education says the BAC would be 0.05 after a 5-ounce glass of table wine. So, why do the blood-alcohol concentration figures vary? Well, as we noted, all of the figures are estimates. The Wisconsin DOT also points out that besides gender, weight and the amount of alcohol consumed, other factors are in play. Your BAC will be higher if you drink faster or drink on an empty stomach. Women reach higher BACs faster because they have less water in their bodies and more adipose tissue (fat), which is not easily penetrated by alcohol. Jan Grebel, a chemical test supervisor for the DOT, told us about another factor: If you drink frequently, your liver can break down alcohol more efficiently, but if you don’t, your BAC would be higher after even one drink. Grebel quoted to us from a chart she utilizes when testifying in court in drunken driving cases. She said the chart estimates the BAC at 0.047 -- nearly 0.05 -- for a 100-pound woman after one drink. But Grebel said that would be the maximum BAC in that instance. Most people would not reach 0.05 after one drink, she said. Our rating The Tavern League of Wisconsin said a proposal to make 0.05 the standard for drunken driving would mean that having a glass of wine at dinner could make a person drunk. The statement is accurate, in that it’s possible an individual could reach 0.05 after one drink. But it needs additional information, namely that the situation would apply only in a small number of instances and would depend on other factors, such as drinking on an empty stomach. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Tavern League of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2013-05-17T08:20:33	2013-05-14	['None']
pomt-12691	He’s only there for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to run a shadow government that is gonna totally upset the new agenda.	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/mar/14/mike-kelly/western-pa-congressman-backs-strange-obama-shadow-/	Republican Congressman Mike Kelly was talking to a crowd in his district of Northwestern Pennsylvania earlier this month when he dropped a serious accusation against Barack Obama. He noted the former president had decided to stay in Washington, and not for the reasons Obama has given. "He’s only there for one purpose and one purpose only," Kelly said, "and that is to run a shadow government that is gonna totally upset the new agenda." Is that really what Obama stayed in Washington, D.C. to do? Obama announced late in 2016 he’d be sticking around in Washington for at least two years so his daughter Sasha could finish high school. He has office space paid for by the General Services Administration, a perk granted to all former presidents. According to the Chicago Sun Times, Obama is the first president since Woodrow Wilson to stay at a primary residence in Washington, D.C. after his tenure ended. Obama will be assisting former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in a Congressional redistricting effort, work Holder has described as a "going into the states" strategy. Holder also said Obama would be fundraising and interacting with state legislators. No reports or intelligence has been released linking these post-presidency activities of Obama to a shadow government. And Kelly did not provide any evidence. A shadow government is commonly defined as a conflicting, secondary government led by members of the private sector that wields similar influence to the actual government. Kelly later withdrew his comments after they made national news. His spokesperson Tom Qualtere said, "Because of the extraordinary interest in Rep. Kelly’s remarks, it is worth clarifying that Rep. Kelly does not believe that President Obama is personally operating a shadow government." In another statement, Qualtere said, "he was sharing the frustration of everyone in the room over how they believe certain Obama administration holdovers within the federal bureaucracy are attempting to upset President Trump’s agenda." Kelly’s comments and his ensuing walkback landed in The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, The Hill and MSNBC.

pomt-11652	The White House staff risks violating federal ethics rules if they participate in Donald Trump’s "fake news awards."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/11/norm-eisen/donald-trumps-fake-news-awards-could-land-white-ho/	On the campaign trail, Donald Trump honed his craft of slamming media organizations that covered him critically, a practice he’s carried over to the White House. His efforts will culminate soon in the so-called "fake news awards," an idea Trump first floated last November on Twitter. "We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!" he tweeted Nov. 27, 2017. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s idea got poor reviews from government watchdogs, who warned White House staff that the event would breach federal ethics rules designed to keep government honest and impartial. "WARNING to White House staff: the president may be exempt from the rules at 5 CFR § 2635.701 et seq. on misuse of position BUT YOU ARE NOT. If you help @potus with the below, you risk violating §§ 702, 704 & 705 forbidding use of gov time & $$$ to harm some media & aid others," Norm Eisen, President Barack Obama's former ethics czar, tweeted on Jan. 7. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Experts who practiced government ethics at the highest levels told us the fake news awards could land White House staffers in hot water, for violating government rules and encroaching on the First Amendment. Ethics rules Eisen, now chair of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics, referred to a set of federal regulations that lay out the ethical conduct of executive branch employees. (As Eisen noted, Trump, as president, is exempt.) These rules are overseen by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, or OGE, an executive branch agency whose 4,500 ethics officials serve as watchdogs over the executive branch to prevent (or resolve) conflicts of interest, with the aim of safeguarding governmental integrity. Eisen specifically pointed to a section of the rules that deal with executive branch employees misusing their government jobs. The section states that an executive branch employee "shall not use his public office for the endorsement of any product or enterprise." Because of that rule, the ethics office also has long considered it improper for an executive branch employee to condemn a company, said Walter Shaub, who led the OGE until his resignation in July 2017. "You can't use your government position to endorse a company, and you can't trash a company to the advantage of a different company," said Shaub, who is now the senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center. It's unclear if Trump’s event is being held by the White House or the Trump/Pence campaign, and neither organization replied to our questions. (Eisen's tweet — and this analysis — deals with official government events. A separate set of laws, including the Hatch Act, would apply if White House staffers participated in a campaign event, sources said.) Would White House staffers’ participation breach ethics rules? Absolutely, according to Shaub, who retweeted Eisen’s warning to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. "Hey @PressSec & @RajShah45, Norm is right. If you or ANY WH staffers work on this or post it on the WH website, it will be a violation of the Standards of Conduct. Beware of laws on using federal appropriations too, if there are any visuals, certificates, handouts, or trophies," Shaub tweeted Jan. 7. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Shaub told PolitiFact that a staffers' participation in an official Trump administration event designed to publicly humiliate certain media outlets would clearly constitute a misuse of their government position. "It’s not even a close call," he said. "Sending out tweets talking about how great Fox News is, which is a business, and now he’s going to give awards trashing CNN and others, which are businesses, is preferential treatment." No compelling government interest Richard Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, said that while some ethics rules can be ambiguous, a Trump staffer's participation would be out of bounds. "The endorsement of some news outlets and the condemnation of others crosses the line under the OGE regulations," he said. "It’s hard to show where that line precisely is, but what I can tell you is it has been crossed in this instance." Absent some kind of serious government study showing systemic failures by certain media organizations, there’s no compelling government interest that justifies the staging of fake news awards, he said. ‘Treading really close to a First Amendment problem’ Painter said Trump’s tweets, as well as other administration actions affecting the media industry, raise First Amendment concerns. This makes it more likely an ethics official would find a staffer broke the rules by participating in Trump's fake news awards, he said. During his time in office, scores of Trump’s tweets have followed a familiar pattern: praise for Fox News and scorn for its competitors. On Twitter, Trump mentioned Fox News, its programs or its hosts in more than 70 tweets that describe the right-wing media outlet in positive, if not glowing, terms. Trump uses Twitter to promote Fox News reporting, highlight favorable coverage of him and his administration and lavish praise on the network while condemning their competitors. "The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!" Trump tweeted Feb. 15, 2017. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Over the same period, Trump has mentioned Fox News' rivals more than 50 times. Aside from two tweets promoting his own interview on ABC News, these tweets have ranged from negative to scathing. "The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!" Trump tweeted Feb. 17, 2017. In addition to Trump's tweets, Painter said there’s other evidence the administration has used its power to play favorites in the media industry, raising First Amendment concerns that bolster the case that the fake news awards are out of bounds. He pointed to the Justice Department's antitrust suit against Time Warner, which has raised questions about whether this was done as retribution against CNN; Trump’s threat against NBC's license over reporting he disputed; and Trump’s repeated — and false — attacks on Amazon and its chairman Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post. Painter also noted Trump congratulated Rupert Murdoch, who co-chairs 21st Century Fox, over a deal to sell significant Fox assets to Disney, after Trump reportedly sought reassurance that Fox News wouldn’t change hands. "There's some concrete evidence that they're playing favorites with the media organizations in official action, and penalizing those who do not give them the news coverage they like," Painter said. "Couple that with the president's tweets, including several that suggest he wishes he were in a country without the First Amendment, and this is viewed as a part of a pattern of conduct." Both Painter and Shaub noted the ethics rules also require loyalty to the rule of law and the constitution. "In effect the president is trying to establish official news media, establish that Fox is good and CNN is bad," Painter said. "That does loop back into what's a reasonable application of the OGE rule if what you're doing is treading really close to a First Amendment problem." Eisen and Painter are chair and vice chair, respectively, of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which unsuccessfully sued Trump for violating a constitutional bar on presidents and federal officials accepting gifts and payments from foreign governments. Our ruling Eisen said the White House staff risks violating federal ethics rules if they participate in Donald Trump’s "fake news awards." Two experts, who practiced government ethics at the highest levels, said participation by White House staffers would violate federal ethics rules. Trump, for the record, is exempt. They added that the president and his administration’s pattern of playing favorites among media outlets raises First Amendment issues that would subject this event to heightened scrutiny by ethics officials.

pomt-09249	Scott Maddox has run "losing campaigns for 3 of Florida's 4 available cabinet positions."	false	/florida/statements/2010/may/06/adam-putnam/adam-putnam-places-perennial-loser-tag-agriculture/	Democrat Scott Maddox is using the oil spill growing in the Gulf of Mexico as an opportunity to distinguish himself in a down-ballot race for agriculture commissioner. Maddox, the former mayor of Tallahassee, has prodded U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam, the Republican frontrunner, to rule out the possibility of increased oil drilling in the gulf. Putnam has been a proponent of drilling in the past, and even proposing Congress allow new oil wells within 50 miles of Florida. On May 4, 2010, came word that Maddox's Tallahassee law firm was suing British Petroleum for its role in the spill. News of the suit prompted a searing response from Putnam campaign manager Trey McCarley. "When in doubt, sue," McCarley said. "As a result of his multiple losing campaigns for 3 of Florida’s 4 available Cabinet positions, Scott Maddox has confused job descriptions for the one he’s running for this time. While oil continues to pour out of the earth at a rate of 210,000 gallons per day, Scott Maddox runs to the courthouse to sue someone, anyone, in a desperate attempt to make money from misery." Sifting out the rhetoric, we wondered if Maddox, 42, had already lost campaigns for three Florida Cabinet posts. First about the Florida Cabinet. Though Putnam's campaign said the Cabinet has four positions, it technically only has three -- chief financial officer, attorney general and agriculture commissioner. The three-person Cabinet meets with the governor and acts as the state clemency board, and oversees several other state functions. In his claim, Putnam is wrongly counting the governor as a member of the Cabinet (though it's an easy mistake). Until 2003, the Cabinet had six members plus the governor. Along with the attorney general and agriculture commissioner, Cabinet members included the secretary of state and the commissioner of education, positions that were once elected, but now appointed, and the positions of treasurer and comptroller, which merged to become CFO. Now about Maddox. He was still in law school at Florida State University in 1993, when at the age of 24, he was elected to the Tallahassee City Commission. In 1995, city commissioners elected him mayor (the commission made the decision in Tallahassee then). In 1997, Maddox was elected mayor by voters after a change of government structure. Ran for attorney general -- lost. Maddox flirted with running for governor in 2002, but instead decided to run for attorney general. He finished second in a four-way Democratic primary behind Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer. Dyer went on to lose to then-Republican Charlie Crist. That's one losing campaign. Maddox continued to serve as Tallahassee's mayor until 2003, when he was elected chairman of the Florida Democratic Party. He served as the state party chairman until March 2005. Ran for governor -- dropped out. He left that job and announced he was running for governor in 2006. "I know the potential of this great state," Maddox said in announcing his candidacy on May 16, 2005. "And as someone who served nearly 10 years as mayor of Tallahassee, I am the only candidate with the executive experience necessary to both offer a vision for Florida's future, and make that vision a reality for everyday Floridians." Maddox's announcement may have been the high-water mark of his campaign for the state's top elected office. Within days of announcing his candidacy, the St. Petersburg Times reported that Maddox -- while party chairman --- had quietly been paid to help win support for a controversial development proposal reviled by Leon County Democrats. A few weeks later, the Internal Revenue Service froze the party's bank account because it failed to pay about $200,000 in payroll and Social Security taxes while Maddox was chairman. Later came news that while he chaired the Leon County party in 2004, it paid a $10,500 fine for campaign finance violations but never reported it as required. Maddox blamed the problems on a bookkeeper and longtime friend who admitted she had made a series of major mistakes and kept them hidden from her bosses. An internal investigation questioned Maddox's hiring decisions at the party, and his campaign faced two pending complaints of alleged campaign finance violations with the Florida Elections Commission, the Times reported. He dropped out of the race on Oct. 7, 2005, about 11 months before the Democratic primary. Maddox endorsed U.S. Rep. Jim Davis of Tampa, who won the party's nomination but went on to lose that November to then-Republican Charlie Crist. That's two losing campaigns (if you give Putnam the benefit of the doubt that dropping out before a vote is cast is the same as losing and if you let slide the fact that the governor isn't technically in the Florida Cabinet). We checked the state Division of Elections to see if Maddox ran for a Cabinet position or governor and lost a third time, but came up empty. Running for agriculture commissioner? McCarley, Putnam's campaign manager, said the third race is Maddox's 2010 bid for agriculture commissioner. "The three out of four I was referring to (were) attorney general, governor and the current one, which is why we referred to it as 'losing' instead of lost," McCarley said. McCarley's right in that he did say losing. But we don't buy his argument. We found no independent, public polling data saying Putnam is beating Maddox in a hypothetical November match-up. Moreover, we wouldn't even consider that evidence Maddox is losing (See Charlie Crist Senate poll numbers circa June 2009 as evidence). Plus the context of the quote strongly suggests that Maddox's bid for agriculture commissioner is his fourth run at a Cabinet-level post. In trying to cast Maddox as a politician who will run for anything he think he might win, the Putnam campaign said Maddox has run "losing campaigns for 3 of Florida's 4 available Cabinet positions." The minor offense in this case is counting Maddox's run for governor as a run for Cabinet. The governor isn't a member of the Cabinet, according to the state Constitution. But that's not what has us worried. Putnam errs in counting Maddox's 2010 bid for agriculture commissioner as a losing campaign. Maddox lost a campaign for attorney general and pulled out of a run for governor. The third race is still up in the air. We rate Putnam's claim False.

pomt-09939	Says he didn't call Dr. George Tiller a baby killer, as liberal groups charge, but was merely reporting what "some prolifers branded him."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jun/05/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-called-george-tiller-baby-killer/	Liberals are criticizing conservative talk show host Bill O'Reilly for his harsh comments about Dr. George Tiller, who was shot to death while attending church on May 31, 2009, in Wichita, Kan. Their argument is that O'Reilly repeatedly named Tiller as a late-term abortion provider and called him a "baby killer." That publicity contributed to Tiller's death, they say. Antiabortion activist Scott Roeder, 51, has been charged with Tiller's murder. To be clear, we haven't found anyone saying that Roeder watched O'Reilly's show or was influenced by him directly. And we aren't attempting to check any claims or suggestions that O'Reilly's words incited violence. O'Reilly responded to his critics in an opinion article posted on BillOReilly.com and in the conservative journal Human Events . He began by saying that Tiller "did not deserve his fate" and was "an American citizen entitled to protection." "No matter what you think about abortion, it is a sad day for the country when vigilantism takes a life," O'Reilly wrote. O'Reilly said that liberal groups were targeting him unfairly. "Even though I reported on the doctor honestly, the loons asserted that my analysis of him was 'hateful,'" O'Reilly wrote. "Chief of among the complaints was the doctor's nickname, 'Tiller the baby killer.' Some prolifers branded him with that, and I reported it. So did hundreds of other news sources." O'Reilly went on to criticize media outlets for glorifying Tiller in order to silence those who oppose abortion, especially late-term abortion. We wanted to see what O'Reilly had said about Tiller, to see if O'Reilly was indeed being criticized for his reporting on other groups' characterization of Tiller as he said. We searched transcripts of The O'Reilly Factor , his show that appears on the Fox News Channel. We found at least 42 instances of O'Reilly mentioning Tiller by name, going back to 2005. In 24 instances, we found that O'Reilly referred to Tiller specifically as a "baby killer." Most of the time, O'Reilly would simply refer to the Tiller as "Tiller the baby killer" or as "Dr. George Tiller, known as Tiller the baby killer" without attributing it to anyone. We found four times when O'Reilly said that "some" called him Tiller the baby killer. We did not find any instance where O'Reilly named an individual or a particular antiabortion group that referred to Tiller that way. Here is how O'Reilly has discussed Tiller in 2009, prior to Tiller's death: • May 15: O'Reilly discussed President Barack Obama's commencement speech at Notre Dame University, saying he was troubled that a Catholic school would allow Obama to speak. "Barack Obama throughout his political career has enabled abortion. There's no doubt that he has. All right? He has recently appointed Gov. (Kathleen) Sebelius to (Secretary of) Health and Human Services. Gov. Sebelius is the most proabortion governor in the United States. Based upon Dr. Tiller, the baby killer in her state and all of that, all right." • May 11: O'Reilly wondered whom Obama would nominate to the Supreme Court, saying that he thought Obama was "callous" when it came to abortion. "I mean, the guy puts Sebelius in as the health — you can't get a more fanatically — and that woman is proabortion," O'Reilly said. "She wants the babies done for. She supported Tiller the Baby Killer out there. So, enough with her." • April 27: O'Reilly discussed Sebelius' nomination as secretary of Health and Human Services. O'Reilly said that Sebelius "recently vetoed a bill that placed restrictions on late-term abortions in Kansas. The bill was introduced because of the notorious Tiller the Baby Killer case, where Dr. George Tiller destroys fetuses for just about any reason right up until the birth date for $5,000. There's no question Ms. Sebelius is one of the most proabortion politicians in America." • March 27: Tiller was charged with misdemeanor offenses for violating Kansas law on late-term abortions. Tiller was acquitted. O'Reilly said, "Now, we have bad news to report that Tiller the baby killer out in Kansas, acquitted. Acquitted today of murdering babies. I wasn't in the courtroom. I didn't sit on the jury. But this, there's got to be a special place in hell for this guy." • March 26: O'Reilly talked about the ongoing trial: "Another revolting situation is Dr. George Tiller in Kansas, known as Tiller the Baby Killer, who's on trial for killing babies who are about to be born, late-term abortions." O'Reilly also said, "If you want to kill a baby, you hire Tiller, you've got to pay him 5,000 up front, and he'll kill the baby. ... You should know, his best friend is the governor of Kansas, Sebelius. ... She has taken specific steps to carve out the law so that it will protect Tiller the baby killer." • March 17: Still on the Tiller trial, O'Reilly said, "You know this George Tiller, called Tiller the baby killer, is charged with 19 misdemeanors. And what this guy does, and we have proven it beyond a reasonable doubt, Kelly, is that he kills babies in late term. He aborts them in late term. They're no longer fetuses. They're viable babies. He aborts them for any and all reasons if you pay him $5,000." • March 2: O'Reilly said Sebelius took "campaign money from George Tiller, known as Tiller, the baby killer. He's currently charged with a variety of crimes centering on his abortion practice. He aborts babies at any time for just about any reason if you pay him $5,000." • Jan. 26: O'Reilly discussed an executive order Obama signed allowing federal money to go to international family planning groups that provide abortions. O'Reilly complained that Obama quietly signed the order rather than publicizing it. "I wanted George Tiller the baby killer going, 'Yeah, can I make more money killing babies now,'" O'Reilly said. That's just from 2009. There were many other examples in previous years. These instances and others we reviewed clearly show that O'Reilly was not reporting the views of others, but was expressing his own views on the doctor. O'Reilly said in his column that "Some prolifers branded" Tiller a baby killer, "and I reported it," as if he were reporting the views of others. But the transcripts show O'Reilly repeatedly referred to Tiller as a baby killer without attribution. So we find his statement that liberal groups are targeting him for his reporting of what others said to be False.	None	Bill O'Reilly	None	None	None	2009-06-05T15:45:22	2009-06-03	['None']

pomt-01170	On timing of right to work legislation	half flip	/wisconsin/statements/2014/dec/10/robin-vos/did-robin-vos-change-his-tune-timing-right-work-de/	As they sought re-election in 2014, Gov. Scott Walker and Republican legislative leaders downplayed their interest in blocking private-sector unions from requiring workers to become members when hired at unionized shops. But as 2014 winds down, a sudden push for quick consideration of so-called "right to work" legislation is attracting much attention at the Capitol. The turn of events drew scorn from Democratic legislative leaders and labor officials but was cheered by some conservatives. "Reversal: WI Republicans to push right-to-work legislation after all": That was the headline over conservative blogger Ed Morrissey’s commentary in a Dec. 4, 2014 posting. This is a good opportunity to put the Flip-O-Meter to use. We’ll focus on Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a longstanding and high-profile backer of right-to-work -- specifically on his stance on when Wisconsin should debate the issue and when it might take effect. In short, on the urgency of the issue. As usual, we offer our disclaimer. The Flip-O-Meter does not rate the rightness or wrongness of a position, of even the merits of changing it. It is simply a measure of whether someone has changed positions or made inconsistent statements. Right to work A state is considered a "right-to-work" state if it prohibits unions from negotiating contracts with employers that provide for a "union shop." A union shop is a workplace in which all employees are required to pay union dues. On the flip side, a state that allows union shops is considered by unions to be a "free-bargaining" state. The National Right To Work Legal Defense Foundation says the 24 states that have passed Right to Work laws are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,Utah, Virginia, and Wyoming. Unions say right to work laws break people’s bargaining power and lead to reduced wages and benefits. Proponents of such laws, including Vos, have cited higher rates of income growth and employment in right-to-work states. We have summarized the evidence this way in various fact checks: There is some evidence of economic advantage in right to work states. But evidence is lacking that right to work, rather than other factors, is the cause. Let’s look at what Vos has said in recent years, since Republicans won control of the three branches of government, about taking it up. December 2010: After Walker’s election, Vos said he might propose rewriting state law so Wisconsin workers could no longer be required to pay union dues to hold a job. At the time, he was the incoming Finance Committee co-chairman. "From my perspective, I think that if you look at all of the data that has been collected, states that have non-forced, compulsory union membership when you want to work somewhere have higher rates of income growth, have higher rates of manufacturing -- actually, over time, have seen much greater increases in their standard of living," Vos said at the time on WISN’s "Upfront with Mike Gousha." A few months after Vos spoke, Walker introduced Act 10, which focused only on public-sector unions. It all but eliminated collective bargaining for most public employees. Act 10 also prohibited the automatic deduction of union dues from government workers’ checks. Amid the controversy over Act 10, Vos did not pursue a similar measure for private-sector unions. May 2012: During the Walker recall race, Vos said he supported right to work but "I am not going to pursue that any time in the foreseeable future, and I am confident that Gov. Walker is not either." He spoke after a video surfaced in which Walker told a billionaire backer of his that he planned to "divide and conquer" unions starting with public-sector ones. January 2013: A month after Michigan outlawed forced union membership, Vos pledged that no private-sector right-to-work bill would be voted on in the legislative session starting January 2013 and ending January 2015. He kept that promise. April 2013: When conservative talk show host Jerry Bader asked if right to work would be on the agenda if Walker is re-elected in 2014, Vos said it could be four or more years away. "It's going to take a long while for us to really see the impact of what it will take to turn Wisconsin around." July 2014: After Act 10 was upheld in the state Supreme Court, Vos said he remained a backer of right to work, but he "does not think this is the time to try it in Wisconsin." October 2014: Days before the Nov. 4 elections, Vos said on Wisconsin Public Radio: "It’s not on our agenda. I know the Democrats have used a lot of scare tactics to say it’s going to be brought up in the next two years. It’s not going to be." He spoke as the Assembly Republicans released a detailed written agenda for 2015. It did not mention right to work. Nov. 9, 2014: Less than a week after Republicans retained full control in Madison, Vos again appeared on Gousha’s show. He was asked if there was "any chance" right to work could happen in the next couple of years. "I definitely think we should have the discussion of whether it’s good or bad," Vos said. Vos made it clear, though, that he wanted to make a detailed case to the public and not rush to action. "The public support for right to work is not necessarily there today, and I say that once again as a supporter," Vos said. He noted the "big ruckus" ignited in Madison in 2011 when Walker introduced Act 10. Dec. 1, 2014: After news broke of a newly formed private group to promote right to work legislation in Wisconsin, Vos issued a statement: "I have long been a supporter of right to work and drafted a proposal in the past. I look forward to a healthy discussion as the case is made for the benefits of being a right to work state." Dec. 4, 2014: Republican Sen. Scott Fitzgerald, the Senate leader, jumped in and gave new urgency to the issue. Fitzgerald said right to work must be debated early in the session that begins in January 2015. Vos didn’t disagree that it should be debated during the session, but said he had no plans to take the issue up right away in January in the Assembly. For this item, we asked Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer whether Vos had been consistent on the timetable of taking up right to work. The Journal Sentinel’s story about Fitzgerald’s comments, she noted, quoted Vos saying: "Rushing into it certainly doesn't serve any purpose." "As a supporter of right to work, he welcomes a healthy discussion on the issue, one that looks like it is just beginning," Beyer told us. Our rating There’s no dramatic change by Vos here, even on the timing of considering right to work. Even after the election, Vos seemed reluctant to let another contentious debate over unions take precedence over the rest of his agenda. But he’s no longer talking about years of waiting before legislators take up the issue, in contrast to his campaign-season rhetoric. On balance, we rate this a Half Flip.

pomt-09381	Did not vote for tax increases as a member of the West Miami City Commission.	false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/28/marco-rubio/rubio-says-he-didnt-vote-tax-increases-member-west/	The tax-cutting bona fides of former House Speaker Marco Rubio and Gov. Charlie Crist were center stage during their first U.S. Senate primary debate. In front of a national television audience March 28, 2010, on FOX News Sunday, Crist and Rubio tried to one-up each other on their voting records and accomplishments. If you weren't watching, it went something like this: I cut taxes. You raised taxes. Nuh-uh. You raised taxes. I cut taxes. You're a liar. Well, you're a bigger liar, you tax raiser. Crist told Fox's Chris Wallace that he signed the largest tax cut in the state's history, (a claim we twice have rated False) while Rubio proposed the largest tax increase ever in Florida (a claim we plan to rate soon). Rubio claimed that Crist broke a no new taxes pledge (he signed a 2009 budget with $2.2 billion in increased fees) while Rubio kept the same pledge (a claim we also rated False). Rubio also said Crist is distorting Rubio's tax record. That prompted a comeback from Florida's sitting governor. "Just let me say that (Rubio) voted for tax increases when he was on the West Miami City Commission, and he said on his Web site that he has never voted for a new tax," Crist said. "That's just not the truth, and he ought to be truthful to the people of Florida before he asks for their vote." Rubio responded flatly: "Chris, that's also inaccurate." Because both candidates seem hung up on if either ever supported a tax increase, we wanted to examine Rubio's time as a West Miami City commissioner. Before he was elected to the state House, Rubio was a member of the West Miami City Commission from 1998-2000. Records show that in 1998 and 1999, he voted to increase the city's property tax collections. Understanding the process can be a little tricky. Cities and counties across Florida set a property tax rate. That rate, which essentially is a percentage, is then mulitplied by the value of a person's property. The result of the calculation is a person's property tax bill. West Miami didn't raise its property tax rate in either 1998 or 1999, but because property values increased (the other half of the calculation). West Miami took in more money in 1998 and 1999, and West Miami residents paid more in property taxes. West Miami published a "notice of proposed tax increase" in 1998 and 1999, according to the Palm Beach Post, and state law requires city leaders to announce the tax rate as a tax increase. PolitiFact Florida tracked down the final budget resolutions for both years. They show that the city of West Miami, without raising tax rates, was increasing property taxes -- 1.402 percent in 1998 and 5.545 percent in 1999. The roll call has then-Commissioner Rubio as voting "Y" both years. A Rubio spokesman, Alberto Martinez, told the Post that Rubio did not vote for tax increases because the tax rate did not change. It's an ironic argument because Rubio argued as a member of the Legislature that local governments were raising taxes while being able to claim they were keeping the tax rate the same. "One of the reasons the system is broken is because with the massive escalation of valuations, local governments have been able to brag about cutting your millage, yet you are still paying more in property taxes," Rubio wrote in a 2007 letter to supporters. That's what happened in West Miami. Responding to a claim from Crist, Rubio said it was "inaccurate" to say he voted to raise taxes while a member of the West Miami City Commission. But Crist got it right, records show. We rate Rubio's statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6bb3a85b-4a9b-4edf-8d5d-91984241c709	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2010-03-28T14:43:05	2010-03-28	['None']

pomt-06629	Says an amendment specifying when military members may use deadly force "does nothing to change existing rules of engagement for American service members."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/sep/18/david-cicilline/cicilline-says-he-opposed-measure-use-deadly-force/	In recent weeks, U.S. Rep. David N. Cicilline, D-R.I., has come under fire for voting against an amendment which a Florida lawmaker says would give U.S. troops in conflict areas the right to "proactively defend themselves." Talk show host Helen Glover took Cicilline to task earlier this month for the vote on the amendment to the military’s "rules of engagement." She was joined on WHJJ’s "Helen Glover Show" by Michael Napolitano, spokesman for John Loughlin, who was Cicilline’s Republican opponent in 2010. Loughlin, an Army lieutenant colonel currently serving in Iraq, is one of two Republicans seeking to knock Cicilline from the seat in 2012. Monique Chartier, a columnist for the conservative Anchor Rising blog, also took aim at Cicilline, challenging him in a blog posting to explain his vote "without platitudes and with specificity." Cicilline responded in a letter addressed to Chartier. He said that he joined 141 other Democrats and 18 Republicans in voting against the amendment in May "because it does nothing to change existing rules of engagement for American service members...." Cicilline went on to say that "our men and women in uniform already possess the right to bear arms whenever they are in harm’s way. Furthermore, when they are instructed on the rules of engagement, our troops are explicitly told that nothing prevents them from using deadly force to defend themselves." We wondered whether Cicilline was right when he said the amendment would do nothing to change existing rules. U.S. Rep. John L. Mica, a Florida Republican, introduced the amendment to the 2012 Defense Reauthorization Act in response to conversations he’d had with troops in Afghanistan during a congressional visit. He told The Wall Street Journal that when he asked the troops if there was anything he could do to help them do their job better, they told him they "felt constrained" by the current rules of engagement. Gerry Lynam, Mica’s legislative assistant, explained Mica’s amendment this way: The military’s counterinsurgency strategy requires a soldier to "go through a whole checklist" prior to taking any defensive action, Lynman said, and soldiers lose "the ability to defend themselves." "The purpose of this amendment was to have the military give them (troops) a little more leeway to protect themselves." Mica’s amendment to the 2012 defense reauthorization act, passed in the House by a vote of 260 to 160. (Voting for the bill were 127 Republicans and 43 Democrats, including U.S. Rep. James Langevin, D-R.I. The amendment is now before a Senate committee.) The amendment reads: "The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the rules of engagement applicable to members of the Armed Forces assigned to duty in any hostile fire area designated for purposes of section 310 or 351 (a) (1) of title 37, Unites States Code -- (1) fully protect the members’ right to bear arms; and (2) authorize the members to fully defend themselves from hostile actions." So, would change the current rules of engagement for troops in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq? We asked three military experts. They all said no. "The ROE (rules of engagement) never constrain a soldier’s right to self defense," said Gary D. Solis, an author, law professor and 26-year veteran of two combat tours in Vietnam. "You can always defend yourself. Always." Solis has a Ph.D. in the law of war from the London School of Economics and formerly headed the Law War program at West Point. He now teaches several courses at George Washington University Law School and Georgetown University Law Center. The "rules of engagement,’’ Solis said, are specific directives used by senior commanders to regulate the use of force in armed conflict. "They tell a soldier, Marine or sailor when he or she may use deadly force," he said. Anyone who understands the rules of engagement, he said, knows that the troops always have the right to defend themselves. "This (Mica’s amendment) is not a matter of protecting soldiers,’’ Solis said. "This is military ignorance combined with political opportunism." Victor Hansen, a professor at New England Law in Boston, described the language in Mica’s amendment -- "to proactively defend" -- as "loaded" and so broad that it was impossible to define for a practical purpose. "I’m not sure I know what that means," Hansen said, "nor am I sure that those who voted for the amendment could give a very clear definition of what it means." If the amendment became law, we asked, would it have any effect on the troops in Afghanistan or Iraq? "I doubt it," Hansen said. "This is so vague it’s not providing any clear guidance. I can’t see as it would have any practical effect on the ground." We also talked to Francis J. "Bing" West, a former assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs during the Reagan administration and award-winning author who lives in Newport. His most recent book, "The Wrong War: Grit, Strategy, and the Way Out of Afghanistan,’’ was published by Random House in February. What did West think the amendment would do? Nothing, he said, except to create years of "arguments among lawyers" over what it means. To test the experts’ view that the amendment doesn’t change anything, we asked the U.S. Army press office: Do the current rules of engagement allow U.S. military personnel to proactively defend themselves from hostile actions? "Yes," U.S. Major Jason Waggoner, an Army press spokesman, replied in an e-mail. "U.S. Forces always retain the inherent right of self defense. Nothing in the current Rules of Engagement (ROE) limits this right." In summary, Cicilline said Mica’s amendment would do nothing to change existing rules of engagement for service members. The experts we consulted agreed. We rule his statement True.	None	David Cicilline	None	None	None	2011-09-18T00:01:00	2011-09-04	['United_States']
pomt-07304	Says people who signed recall petitions against Wisconsin state Sen. Jim Holperin received "harassing phone calls from out-of-state telemarketers claiming to represent the Democratic Party and insinuating foul play by petition circulators."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/may/18/kim-simac/wisconsin-tea-party-leader-says-democrat-hired-tel/	Kim Simac, a Wisconsin tea party leader, took aim at state Sen. Jim Holperin after the Conover Democrat fled to Illinois in February 2011. Like 13 other Democratic senators, Holperin, who represents a North Woods district where Simac lives, spent three weeks in Illinois. The move delayed a vote on Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s budget-repair bill, which curtails the collective bargaining power of most state and local government employees, although the bill eventually became law. Court challenges have kept the collective bargaining changes from taking effect. But the law, and the Democrats’ reaction to it, spurred a recall movement of historic proportions. Campaigns were launched against all 16 state senators -- eight Democrats and eight Republicans -- who were eligible to be recalled. Simac, vice-chairwoman of the Vilas County Republican Party and founder of Christian values group called Northwoods Patriots, headed the signature-collecting campaign to recall Holperin, a first-term senator who previously served 10 years in the state Assembly. On April 21, 2011, Simac submitted some 23,000 signatures to the Government Accountability Board, which has not completed its review. She has announced plans to run against Holperin if a recall election is set. Eight days after the petitions were filed, Simac issued a news release that claimed petition signers, "are being subjected to harassing phone calls from out-of-state telemarketers claiming to represent the Democratic Party and insinuating foul play by petition circulators." Let’s see if that’s what happened. When we asked Simac for evidence to back her claim, she asked people who received the calls to contact PolitiFact Wisconsin directly. We received calls from 17 people and e-mails from more than 30 others. We interviewed 10 of the people who called. Here’s what we found: The calls began days after the Holperin recall committee filed its petitions in Madison on April 21, 2011. Some people said they received one call, while others said they received two or more. Many of the people, including five we interviewed, said the callers identified themselves as representing the Wisconsin Democratic Party. Some of the people said the callers identified themselves as being from Minnesota. And one caller, when pressed by a woman he called, said he was being paid by Meyer Teleservices, a telemarketing company in St. Cloud, Minn. Nearly everyone who contacted us said they were asked if they understood what they had signed. "It was questions as though, ‘Do you know what you’re doing?’ It was very irritating," said Robert Means of Eagle River. Others said the callers were polite and they didn’t feel harassed. Some people said the callers told them that some people had been misled about what they were signing. "They stated the signers were lied to on what the petitions were for," said Jeff Kirschmann of Eagle River, one of five people we interviewed who signed petitions and also circulated them. "It really irritates me that they called us liars." Those statements back the claim made by Simac. What did Holperin and the Democrats have to say about it? Holperin said he authorized the Wisconsin Democratic Party to call about 5,000 of the people who signed recall petitions against him. Graeme Zielinski, spokesman for the party, said the Minnesota telemarketing firm was hired to call people who signed petitions against Holperin and against two other Democrats who are facing possible recall elections. Holperin said he authorized the calls because, although petition circulators who worked under Simac were "earnest, honest and friendly," more than a third of the 23,000 signatures were collected by Kennedy Enterprises, a Colorado marketing and consulting firm hired by the Wisconsin Republican Party. Those petition circulators were often aggressive and misleading when they asked residents to sign petitions, Holperin said. According to Holperin, 534 petition signers -- about 10 percent of those who were called by the Minnesota telemarketing firm -- said they were given misleading information and that they asked to have their names removed from the petitions. He said that was the basis for a complaint he filed with the Government Accountability Board challenging the petitions. Holperin provided a script that he said the firm used in asking questions of people who signed recall petitions against him. The script shows that, among other things, callers were to: identify themselves as representing the Wisconsin Democratic Party; ask people whether they were aware their signatures appeared on a Holperin recall petition; and state that reports had been received that "out-of-state paid circulators were misleading people about what they were being asked to sign." "So, did we ‘insinuate’ that foul play had occurred?," Holperin said. "You bet we did, and we think we offered ample evidence that backs up our claim." Let’s wrap up. Simac said people who signed Holperin recall petitions received "harassing phone calls from out-of-state telemarketers claiming to represent the Democratic Party and insinuating foul play by petition circulators." Some people who received calls said they felt harassed even if they received just one call because they didn’t expect to be questioned about signing a petition. The callers were employed by an out-of-state firm, they did identify themselves as representing the Wisconsin Democratic Party and did claim that petition circulators misled signers of the petitions. We rate Simac’s claim as True.	None	Kim Simac	None	None	None	2011-05-18T09:00:00	2011-04-29	['Jim_Holperin', 'Wisconsin', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-01789	Says a 9-year-old girl was recently raped in Austin, Texas, by a guy previously "caught four times and released."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/jul/25/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-9-year-old-girl-raped-austin-man-p/	When talk-show host Glenn Beck said a horrific crime occurred in Austin, we wondered what he was talking about. Beck made his statement, in a July 17, 2014, interview of Gov. Rick Perry shared online more than 32,000 times by the next day, after Perry said he was looking at deploying National Guard troops to secure the Texas-Mexico border; he later said up to 1,000 troops would be dispatched. In the interview, Perry expressed concern that over 3,000 homicides had been committed "by illegal aliens over the" last six years. "That’s unacceptable," Perry said, "and that’s the reason that we have to secure that border." We rated this murder count as Pants on Fire; the state-gathered information behind Perry’s claim had to do with homicide charges (not convictions) leveled against both legally authorized and unauthorized U.S. residents over an unstated period of time. Beck replied to Perry: "OK. In Austin Texas yesterday, a rape of a 9-year-old girl, of a guy who had been caught four times and released," his implication being the attacker wasn’t living in the country with legal permission. We were unable to reach Beck to glean the basis of his claim--and we didn’t find other reports of such a crime in Austin. But an online search revealed an alleged crime committed near Fort Worth with some details aligning with Beck’s statement. Perpetrator northwest of Fort Worth? According to a July 13, 2014, news story in the Dallas Morning News, a man previously deported to Mexico four times had been arrested in Parker County the day before after he entered a house through a window and fondled a 9-year-old girl. The story, quoting county authorities, said the incident in Springtown, 20 miles northwest of Fort Worth, resulted in the arrest of Israel Andrade, 35, who was jailed on a charge of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit another felony. A blog post by the Parker County Sheriff’s Department said the other felony was "indecency with a child by sexual contact." By telephone, Sheriff Larry Fowler told us the attacker did not commit a rape; he was groping and fondling, Fowler said. The News’ story said the girl told investigators she had been awakened where she slept on a couch by a man who groped her. The man spoke in broken English, the story said, and motioned for her to follow him back to the bedroom, but the girl screamed and he fled. Authorities said they later found him at a relative’s home, also finding two pair of children’s underwear in a pair of his jeans, and tennis shoes with a tread pattern matching the footprints outside the girl’s home, the newspaper reported. The child’s mother identified the underwear as her daughter’s, the story said. His relatives told authorities he’d returned to the U.S. from Mexico a month before, the story said. According to a web page drawing on Parker County records, Andrade was held on $500,000 bail and had an INS "detainer" placed on him. A detainer, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement says, means the agency intends to assume custody of an individual once the person is no longer subject to local detention. Three confirmed deportations, no Austin arrest Parker County’s blog post said that according to federal records, Andrade had been deported in July 2003, February 2004, September 2009 and December 2010. Carl Rusnok, a Dallas-based ICE spokesman, confirmed three deportations of Andrade, telling us by email they occurred in 2004, 2006 and 2012. Also, Andrade was thrice sentenced to federal prison for illegally entering or re-entering the country, Rusnok said. Finally, we looked into whether Andrade had been arrested in Austin. Roger Wade, spokesman for the Travis County Sheriff’s Department, emailed that no one by that name showed up in the agency’s computer records. Veneza Bremner, spokeswoman for the Austin Police Department, said by phone Andrade’s name wasn’t in department arrest records. Our ruling Beck said a 9-year-old girl was recently raped in Austin, Texas, by a guy previously "caught four times and released." Beck got the alleged crime and location wrong, but authorities northwest of Fort Worth did detain Israel Andrade, an unauthorized U.S. resident previously deported three times, on a charge of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit another felony, which local officials referred to as indecency with a child by sexual contact. There was no rape. On balance, we find this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

"On Friday, when Britain voted to leave the European Union, he crowed from his golf course about how the disruption could end up creating higher profits for that golf course, even though, within 24 hours, Americans lost $100 billion from our 401(k)s," Clinton said in Ohio June 27. "He tried to turn a global economics challenge into an infomercial." Trump did say last week that Brexit would benefit Turnberry, his golf course in Scotland, because a weaker pound would bring more tourists. We wondered, though, about the other part of Clinton’s claim: that Brexit caused 50 million Americans with 401(k) retirement savings accounts to lose $100 billion in just 24 hours. The nitty-gritty Most 401(k) accounts are tied, at least in part, to the stock market. And the market took a pretty big hit from the British referendum, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 3.4 percent and the S&P 500 index falling 3.6 percent. However, we couldn’t find an ongoing daily log of the total value of Americans’ 401(k)s. The Investment Company Institute puts the figure at $4.8 trillion as of March 31, 2016. The Clinton campaign explained to us how they calculated that $100 billion figure, and experts told us the reasoning was sound. Basically, the campaign took that March figure for the total value of all 401(k) accounts, $4.8 trillion, and calculated any growth through June 23, the day before the Brexit vote, and then the subsequent fall. They based the growth on changes in the U.S. stock market, as stocks account for about 66 percent of 401(k) assets, and fixed income, which accounts for 27 percent. Their end result: An estimated drop of $110 billion in 401(k) assets from June 23 to June 24. Click here to see the full explanation of the campaign’s math. The campaign approached this analysis correctly, said Wade Pfau, an expert in retirement finance and founder of RetirementResearcher.com. "They may have even underestimated the loss by assuming all stocks are U.S. stocks. International stocks fell a lot further," he said. "But, certainly, I think their analysis is a fair and reasonable assessment about the extent of the impact on 401(k)s." Jack VanDerHei, research director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, also said the campaign’s calculation was a decent approximation of 401(k) losses after the Brexit vote. Running his own numbers, he came up with an estimated $104 billion loss. Experts said, though, that average 401(k) account holders don’t need to panic. The big picture "The number sounds big, but it is a small percent of the total, and it is not as though this money is lost forever," Pfau said. Four days after the Brexit vote, the U.S. stock market is starting to stabilize and creep back up. Consequently, so are the values of Americans’ 401(k)s. Spokesmen at 401(k) providers Charles Schwab and Fidelity told us they had received many calls from account holders worried about their assets following the Brexit vote. They both said they encourage clients to stay the course and remember that saving for retirement is a long-term investment that shouldn’t be irreparably harmed by last week’s market volatility. Generally, 401(k) accounts belonging to younger people have a higher concentration of stocks, in order to maximize growth for as long as possible. But as account holders get closer to retirement, they should reduce that concentration, effectively reducing their accounts’ exposure to market volatility, said Fidelity spokesman Mike Shamrell. "People who have the most stock in 401(k) are those who will be impacted the most, so young people," Shamrell said. "But they’ve got the longest until they retire, so years and years and years to make it up." Alternatively, if someone were to sell some of his or her assets amid the post-Brexit vote market turmoil, that would permanently lock in some of their losses, Pfau said. Our ruling After Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, "within 24 hours, Americans lost $100 billion from our 401(k)s," Clinton said. Experts told us that Clinton’s calculation was a reasonable approximation of the loss of 401(k) assets amid market turmoil following the Brexit vote. That being said, those losses are very likely impermanent. 401(k) accounts are long-term investments designed to withstand brief shocks like this. The claim is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/84b364ce-64ad-4ea9-adc6-8ec227f42988	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-06-28T16:46:58	2016-06-27	['United_Kingdom', 'European_Union', 'United_States']
pomt-08226	"We’ve been able to create about 60,000 net new jobs" in Virginia since February.	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/17/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-virginia-has-gained-60000-jobs-/	It’s all about jobs, Gov. Bob McDonnell says. During an Election Day interview, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough hailed McDonnell as the "Elvis" of the job creation message that moved voters this fall. "You started this in 2009 before anyone got this," Scarborough told the governor, referring to McDonnell’s pledge to create jobs during his successful campaign last year. McDonnell replied that since taking office in January, "we’ve been able to create about 60,000 net new jobs" in Virginia. We had two questions about McDonnell’s statement: Is his number right; and how much credit does the governor deserve for any upswing in Virginia employment since he took office? We first checked the claim of "about 60,000 net new jobs." Stacey Johnson, McDonnell’s press secretary, said the number came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our next call went to the office of Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, who heads McDonnell’s jobs team. Randy Marcus, Bolling’s chief of staff, compiles the job-creation figures for the administration. Marcus said he takes the most current BLS monthly figure for non-farm jobs in Virginia. Then he subtracts the number of non-farm jobs in Virginia in February, McDonnell’s first full month in office. The remainder is what the administration considers to be Virginia’s net job gain under McDonnell. It includes full and part-time jobs in the public and private sectors. We ran the computation, based on the latest BLS numbers that had been posted more than a week before McDonnell’s appearance on MSNBC. Here’s our result: Virginia Workers, Sept. 2010 3,637,200 Virginia Workers, Feb. 2010 3,581,800 Net job gain under McDonnell 55,400 The governor’s claim of creating about 60,000 new jobs was a tad inflated, but certainly in the ballpark. In July, McDonnell claimed 71,500 new Virginia jobs had been created since he took office. We checked those numbers and found them dead on. Much of the job loss since then was caused by the layoff of federal census workers and the slowing of construction. McDonnell also said on MSNBC that only Texas has gained more jobs than Virginia since February. He’s right, according to BLS statistics. Texas has added 128,800 jobs since February. Virginia has experienced a 1.55 percent increase in jobs since February. That ranks sixth. The District of Columbia leads everyone with 2.38 percent growth. Now, let’s look at McDonnell’s statement "we’ve" created about 60,000 jobs. It suggests the new slots are the result of his administration’s actions. "It’s not unique to the Governor, but it bothers me how all politicians take credit for creating jobs," said John Knapp, senior economist for the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at The University of Virginia. "Barack Obama is not president of the economy and Bob McDonnell is not governor of the economy. Of course, what they do can have a marginal affect on things, but there are many other elements involved in creating jobs." Knapp added that state policies affect job creation development over the long run. "But as year or two out, new state policies are not going to have a major impact on the economy." During recent decades, an array of prominent publications have consistently rated Virginia in the top handful of business-friendly states, noting the Commonwealth’s low tax rates, and laws barring compulsory union membership. Johnson said it is not McDonnell’s intention to claim credit for all new jobs under his watch. "It’s a cumulative effort," she said. "It’s the private sector that creates jobs; government can merely help set a conducive climate." Johnson said that when McDonnell said "we’ve" created about 60,000 net new jobs, "he was referring to Virginia." It’s noteworthy that this February -- the month McDonnell uses as the starting benchmark for his administration’s job efforts -- Virginia’s unemployment rate was 7.2 percent, the highest in 28 years. The unemployment rate in September dipped to 6.8 percent, ranking Virginia as the eighth lowest state. The national unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in February and 9.6 percent in September. The vast majority of new Virginia jobs since February fell into one of three broad categories: leisure and hospitality; professional and business services; or trade, transportation and utilities. McDonnell, a Republican, has been praised by legislators from both political parties for aggressively recruiting new businesses. Over the first nine months of his administration -- starting in February, as the governor prefers -- the state has announced 186 business development deals promising 12,249 new jobs, according to statistics kept by the Virginia Economic Development Partnership. In comparison, the state announced 213 development deals promising 11,656 new jobs during the final nine months of Gov. Tim Kaine’s term, ending in January. It’s impossible to know how many how many of the jobs promised in state economic development announcements actually translate into employment gains recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many of the jobs are speculative and depend on construction and expansion of plants before people are hired. So let’s review. It’s clear the governor wants credit for the new jobs created in Virginia since February. But many factors beyond a governor’s purview influence employment figures and Virginia has benefited a strong business climate for decades. Some of the jobs filled since McDonnell took office were no doubt spawned by economic developments deals announced Kaine. It’s impossible to assign full credit to anyone. Regardless of credit, have "about 60,000 net new jobs" been created in Virginia since February? It depends how you measure "about." The correct number at the time was 55,400. The governor was a little bit off, but he wasn’t blowing smoke. For that reason, we rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2010-11-17T09:30:00	2010-11-02	['Virginia']
pomt-05951	The InterLink at T.F. Green Airport is the closest air-rail link in the country.	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/26/lincoln-chafee/rhode-island-governor-lincoln-chafee-says-interlin/	One of the key selling points of the new $267-million InterLink at T.F. Green Airport is the easy access it gives passengers coming in by rail to get to their flights. Because of the intermodal transportation hub that was largely completed in 2010, they can simply hop on a train, get off at the airport’s rail station, and travel a mere 1,570 feet on moving walkways into the terminal. At a news conference at T.F. Green on Jan. 11, Governor Lincoln Chafee, a longtime champion of the project, called it "the closest air-rail link in the country," according to a story in The Journal. He was repeating a claim that has been made in various ways by numerous state officials and agencies, including Warwick Mayor Scott Avedesian, the Rhode Island Airport Corporation and the Federal Highway Administration. Most used the superlative "closest." A PolitiFact Rhode Island reader asked us to check out Chafee’s claim, noting that he had visited several airports that seemed to have closer rail links. Because we had a request -- and because taxpayers footed most of the $267-million bill for the InterLink -- we decided to get to the bottom of it. We called T.F. Green, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation and Chafee’s office to see if any studies had been done that could answer the question. While we waited for answers, we found a number of online railroad and airport forums with discussions of this very topic. Although none had clear-cut answers, they included anecdotal information that we used as a jumping-off point. From that start, we put together a partial list of airports with rail connections. They include Hopkins International Airport, in Cleveland, which in 1968 became the first airport in the country to be connected to a commuter rail system; and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which is connected to a light rail commuter system. Other major airports also have commuter rail links, including Reagan National Airport, in Washington, D.C., Chicago Midway International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. We also found that Philadelphia International Airport has multiple rail stops that are very close to its terminals. The rail line bisects the airport, with the terminals on one side and baggage claim areas and parking facilities on the other, according to a map of the complex. Victoria Lupica, spokeswoman for the airport, said that passengers who get off at any of the airport stations can get into the terminals by riding an escalator one floor up. "The airport line was designed so you can get off the train and go directly into the airport," she said. We couldn’t find any measurements of the distances from the train stops to the terminals, so we asked Lupica how long it takes to get from one of the platforms into the airport. "Thirty seconds," said Lupica, who rides the train daily. "You literally get off the train and walk into the building. While we continued our search, we heard from Dana Alexander Nolfe, a spokeswoman for the DOT, and Patti Goldstein, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Airport Corporation. Nolfe said T.F. Green’s InterLink should accurately be called "the closest air-to-Amtrak rail line in the country." "We do not have the closest air-to-commuter rail line in the country," she said. Goldstein agreed and said the Amtrak claim was first made in 1998 at a news conference attended by then-Warwick Mayor Lincoln Chafee, Governor Almond and officials from the Federal Railroad Administration. She gave us subsequent published references to the distance to the rail line made by Chafee (1,200 feet) and former Governor Bruce Sundlun (1,170 feet). Meanwhile, we heard that Bob Hope Airport, in Burbank, Calif. also has a nearby rail line that serves both commuter trains and Amtrak. There are stops for the two train services outside the airport. We asked Victor Gill, a spokesman for that airport, how far the Amtrak line is from the closest terminal and he estimated the distance at 300 yards, or 900 feet. We checked for ourselves on Google Maps and found that the walking distance from the Amtrak station to Terminal B is about 1,056 feet and from the station to Terminal A is about 1,584 feet. The rail line itself is literally across the street from a runway on the southwest side of the airport. Our ruling Governor Chafee said the T.F. Green InterLink is the closest air-rail link in the country. Whether he meant closest commuter link or closest Amtrak link, he’s wrong. Several major airports have closer commuter links, including some that run adjacent to or through their terminals. And Burbank’s Bob Hope Airport is closer to an Amtrak line. Plus, it has something T.F. Green does not: an actual Amtrak station. Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor does indeed pass near T.F. Green, but Amtrak trains do not stop at the InterLink. Only commuter trains that are operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority -- and use the Amtrak line -- do. Officials have talked of having Amtrak trains stop at the InterLink eventually, but it hasn’t happened yet. So at this point it seems irrelevant that the airport is so close to the Amtrak rail line. We rule Chafee’s statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-05947	Says Steve Jobs was responsible for creating more jobs than the stimulus bill.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/26/mitch-daniels/mitch-daniels-says-steve-jobs-created-more-jobs-st/	Did Apple founder Steve Jobs do more to boost American employment than the $800 billion federal stimulus program? In the Republican response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address on Jan. 24, 2012, Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels said just that. "Contrary to the president's constant disparagement of people in business, it's one of the noblest of human pursuits. The late Steve Jobs -- what a fitting name he had -- created more of them than all those stimulus dollars the president borrowed and blew." Many readers suggested that we check this comparison. First we’ll look at jobs numbers for both Apple and the stimulus, then we’ll discuss whether this comparison is valid. Apple Apple, the iconic technology company, was started in 1973. According to its 2011 SEC filing, Apple now employs about 60,000 people, 43,000 of whom work in the United States. Its contractors add another 700,000 to its overall workforce, but few of them work in the U.S. Daniels didn’t specify in his speech if he was including overseas jobs. But we aren’t in this analysis. So the job tally for Jobs stands at 43,000. The stimulus The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act passed Congress along party lines and was signed by Obama in early 2009. Its purpose was to save and create jobs immediately. How well the program worked in jump-starting employment is a matter of great controversy. Numerous Republicans have said the stimulus created zero jobs, a claim we rated Pants on Fire. In this case, we’ll rely on the same figures we have in the past, which come from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. In this report (see the chart on page 3), the CBO provides high and low estimates for how the stimulus affected the number of people employed and how many jobs it generated. Bear in mind, some of those were temporary jobs (such as work on construction projects) that came and went. On the other hand, jobs that were created and still existed year after year were counted in each year’s totals. That said, the CBO report credits the stimulus with creating between 900,000 and 4.7 million jobs in 2010 and between 600,000 and 3.6 million in 2011. It projects between 200,000 and 1.3 million jobs will be created in 2012. We’ve also looked at estimates by other private analysis. IMH/Global Insight estimated that 1.25 million jobs were created or saved by the end of 2009, 2.45 million were created or saved by the end of 2010, and 1.97 million were created or saved by the end of 2011. Macroeconomic Advisers projects 2.1 million jobs will be created or saved through early 2012. Moody’s economy.com put the peak of the employment impact in the third quarter of 2010, when the stimulus was responsible for an additional 2.5 million jobs. This report from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, released in July, estimates the Recovery Act "raised employment by 2.4 to 3.6 million jobs relative to what it otherwise would have been." Of all these studies, the single lowest estimate -- CBO’s -- was 1.5 million jobs through the end of 2011. So based on the raw numbers, the stimulus created about 35 times as many jobs as Apple did. Even the CBO’s lowest estimate of jobs created in a single quarter (200,000 in the second quarter of 2009, right after the law was passed) is more than four times larger than Apple’s current workforce. "Daniels is not in the ballpark," said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. Beyond the numbers But there are issues that complicate any Apple-stimulus comparison. Bruce Bartlett, a economist and former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, calls it an "apples and oranges comparison." Here are some of the issues raise by Bartlett and other economists: • The job figures for Apple’s full-time U.S. staff are solid, but the stimulus job statistics are only estimates. J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, discounts the stimulus job estimates and says "no one knows, or will ever know" how many it created. "In my view, the best one could hope for is that the stimulus did not destroy any jobs, on net," Foster said in an email. • It’s difficult to gauge the indirect impact of Apple on jobs created among suppliers -- or jobs lost by companies that faced competition from Apple. On the upside, for every U.S. staff job at Apple, some number of additional full- or part-time jobs has been created indirectly, from freelance app designers to short-order cooks in restaurants near Apple’s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. Estimating how many additional jobs owe their existence to Apple is tricky, but it’s likely a substantial number, making Apple’s actual job footprint bigger than the 43,000 jobs cited above. Although Daniels' office didn't respond to our request for back-up for his statement, Jane Jankowski, a spokeswoman for Daniels, told CNNMoney: "Between Apple and its suppliers, there are hundreds of thousands of jobs that have been created and sustained over years and years ... Meanwhile, a number of credible economists, including Robert Barro of Harvard have questioned whether the stimulus created any net new jobs; if they did, the jobs were temporary and disappeared as the stimulus money ended." On the other hand, as Apple has grown, some new jobs have come at the expense of its competitors. As the iPhone took off, did Motorola fire workers when its phone sales slipped? The aggregate loss among competitors is hard to calculate, but it’s likely not a trivial number. And the number is one that should be considered if a full comparison is desired. "Once you look at what Apple's success does to competitors, then you must eventually conclude that all job creation is a zero-sum game, which bodes ill for unemployment," Foster said. • Apple is a company that created jobs continuously over 30 years, while the stimulus was a government program that was largely over within a couple years. It’s not clear whether a 30-year, ongoing business concern should be compared directly to a two- to three-year federal program. There are too many differences in scope, duration and mission. Even so, Foster argues that Daniels’ comparison is valid. "There's nothing wrong with comparing a company to a nation," he said. "Nationally, jobs are created and destroyed. Even within Apple, not every division grew monotonically. They fired people, and hired them. It's not a common comparison, but that's what makes it interesting and still valid." Other economists, including Gary Burtless, an economist for the Brookings Institution, suggest that Daniels’ comparison is speculative at best, and incorrect at worst. "Perhaps if we assume there were large spillover effects of Apple employees’ consumption and Apple supplier contracts on U.S.-based employment, we might reach an estimated impact of Apple that reaches or exceeds the stimulus total," Burtless said. "On the other hand, some of Apple’s success has come at the expense of competitors who have shrunk, disappeared, or grown more slowly than would have been the case if Apple had not been founded. No one knows the number of people who lost their jobs or failed to find jobs in those competing companies as a result of Apple’s existence, but it is likely to represent a sizeable percentage -- far more than half -- of the employees that Apple hired or caused to be hired by its suppliers within the United States." Our ruling There’s no question that the lack of information -- particularly about Apple’s indirect impact on jobs and how many jobs were lost at its competitors -- weakens how certain we can be about the exact numbers. There’s also a more fundamental question of whether it’s fair to compare Apple (an ongoing business) to the stimulus (a short-term federal program). But even if you were to assume that Apple's net impact on job creation was five times the 43,000 jobs the company listed in its SEC report, that would still be just one-seventh of the lowest estimate of jobs created by the stimulus. The "hundreds of thousands" of additional jobs from Apple and related companies, cited by Daniels' spokeswoman, also falls far short of the most cautious estimates of the stimulus by a large margin. In addition to the huge discrepancy in the numbers, one of the principles of the Truth-O-Meter is that people who make factual claims are accountable for their words and should be able to provide evidence to back them up. We will try to verify their statements, but we believe the burden of proof is on the person making the statement. In this case, the best we have from Daniels' staff is a vague extrapolation that Apple created "hundreds of thousands" of jobs. We rate Daniels’ statement False.

pomt-03326	"In Providence, R.I., it's illegal to sell toothpaste and a toothbrush to the same customer on a Sunday."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jul/25/buzzfeed/buzzfeed-awesome-fact-about-toothbrush-and-toothpa/	Hey fans of Rhode Island trivia! Did you know that in the capital city of Providence "it's illegal to sell toothpaste and a toothbrush to the same customer on a Sunday"? Neither did we. But that's what we were told in a July 14 feature titled "11 Awesome Facts You Never Knew About Rhode Island," listed on the popular news and entertainment website BuzzFeed. Here at PolitiFact, we had two questions. First: Is that really true? Second: Who thinks the inability to buy a toothbrush and toothpaste together on a Sunday is awesome? For the uninitiated, BuzzFeed, which regards itself as a legitimate news website, is always trying to take a hot topic and make it hotter. BuzzFeed loves lists. Its July 19, 2013 home page featured "The 33 Fluffiest Animals On The Planet," "38 Things Catholic Girls Love" (#7 is "Pancakes." No explanation is offered), and "14 Not-At-All Gratuitous Breast Ads (Note to BuzzFeed: They ARE gratuitous)." We had our doubts about some of the other items on the Rhode Island list. (For example, we couldn't find any reference in state law to BuzzFeed's contention that "It is illegal to throw pickle juice on a trolley in Rhode Island.") We decided to focus on the toothbrush claim because we don't want Providence residents to be at a disadvantage when it comes to dental hygiene. We emailed BuzzFeed and asked for its source. We also checked Rhode Island law to see if there was a toothpaste-toothbrush statute that applied to Providence (or any community). We came up with nothing. We also checked the online version of Providence's city ordinances. We found nada. Then we called Providence City Hall and spoke to Deputy City Clerk Lori Hagen, who indulged us and did her own check. She found zip. The ordinances don't contain any derivative of the word "tooth." If it existed, "it would be in the code of ordinances," Hagen said, adding that she's never heard of any such restriction. She's worked for the city for 24 years. We thought it might be an old ordinance, repealed long ago. City Archivist Paul Campbell came up with bupkis. When we heard back from BuzzFeed, spokeswoman Augusta Mellon said in an email that a Google search for "sell toothbrush toothpaste sunday rhode island" produced over 8 million hits. (We checked that claim as well. Actual number of hits: about 650, and some of those didn't even refer to the "law.") Mellon said, "There's multiple accredited sources that have written about it, including the Brown Daily Herald and the Telegraph" in Australia. The unnamed blogger for the Herald, Brown University's student newspaper, reported buying both items at a local CVS, insisted that the prohibition was real, and treated the purchase like an act of civil disobedience. The blogger's source turned out to be a list at DumbLaws.com, which cites no actual law, past or present. At least the Telegraph story begins: "Here is a list of the world's most ridiculous laws or urban myths - we’re not quite sure." BuzzFeed's Mellon ended her email by saying, "It seems like it's a commonly referenced piece of information." She should have added, "Which nobody ever checks." So oral hygiene fans can breathe a minty-fresh sigh of relief. A toothbrush and toothpaste can legally be purchased together any Sunday in Providence. Maybe someday this PolitiFact item will be part of a BuzzFeed list titled "217 Examples of How BuzzFeed Didn't Check Its Facts." It'll be a hot one because we give the website a Pants on Fire!

pomt-07327	"(George) LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/may/12/george-lemieux/emigeorge-lemieux-claims-he-never-requested-single/	A new Web ad from the campaign for former Sen. George LeMieux claims there's a big difference between him and Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson on the issue of earmarks. A narrator in the ad, called "The Choice," says, "Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere. LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all." We broke this claim into two fact-checks. In a separate item, we explore the claim that, "Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere. " In this item, we will address the second half of the equation, the claim that, "LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all." While this is technically true, the contrast isn't as black-and-white as the ad suggests. Here's why: LeMieux was appointed to the Senate by then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist to fill the remaining term of retiring Sen. Mel Martinez. LeMieux took office on Sept. 10, 2009, and served until Jan. 3, 2011. Soon after taking office, LeMieux voted in favor of a handful of appropriations bills that included thousands of earmarks worth billions of dollars. We'll break it down. On Oct. 15, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for energy and water development and related agencies for the 2010 fiscal year. According to a Congressional Research Service report, the bill included 2,293 earmarks at a cost of $5.7 billion. On Oct. 6, 2009, and Dec. 19, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of appropriations bills for the Department of Defense. They included 1,719 earmarks at a cost of $4.2 billion. On Oct. 20, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. It included 192 earmarks at a cost of $420 million. On Nov. 5, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for Commerce, Justice, Science and related agencies. The bill included 1,513 earmarks at a cost of $781 million. On Nov. 17, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for military construction and veterans affairs. It included 745 earmarks at a cost of $14.5 billion. In other words, LeMieux voted for bills containing billions of dollars in earmarks, the very thing the ad criticized Nelson for in the previous sentence. But the ad is artfully worded. It doesn't say LeMieux never voted for an earmark, it says he never requested a single one. That's true, but it's also true that earmarks bound for Florida were already packed into the appropriations bills before LeMieux took over for Martinez. We checked the earmark database for the 2010 fiscal year compiled by Taxpayers for Common Sense -- a group that tracks federal earmarks -- and found several dozen earmarks at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars requested by Martinez (sometimes jointly requested with Nelson and others) for various Florida projects, which were included in the appropriations bills that LeMieux voted for. We didn't find any evidence that LeMieux tried to remove those Florida earmarks. We asked LeMieux about those votes via e-mail. "I never requested an earmark," LeMieux said. "It became clear to me after my first couple months in D.C., and those first appropriation bills, that earmarks are the engine that drive the train of increased spending. After that experience I had a press conference with Sens. DeMint, Graham and others pledging not to seek an earmark." In that press conference, the Republican legislators called for a one-year moratorium on all earmarks. "Let me tell you why I think earmarks are a problem," LeMieux said at the press conference. "They're not just a problem for the amount of the budget that they are, because it's not a huge amount. They are a problem because they are the enabler. "In my short time here, I have seen that if you ask for a project and you bring it back for your home state, then when the budget that they bring before you on a particular appropriations bill is 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent more than last year, you can't vote against it or you'll never get another project again. So I haven't done earmarks since I've been here, and I made a decision last month not to do them for the rest of the time I'm here, because the nation is in dire financial straits." So there's no question LeMieux pushed to ban earmarks, as the ad claims. But to back up that point, the ad cites LeMieux's vote on Nov. 30, 2010, in favor of an amendment that sought to establish a moratorium on earmarks through the 2013 fiscal year. The amendment failed with 39 senators voting in favor (including LeMieux) and 56 against. But here's what the ad doesn't say: Nelson also voted for the moratorium. "Sen. Nelson may have voted to ban all earmarks, but he still sought them and still supports them," LeMieux wrote to us in an e-mail. "My vote was sincere." Also, LeMieux stated, "I have signed a pledge not to seek any earmarks if I have the honor of serving again." We contacted Nelson's press office for comment but did not hear back. Again, the wording of the earmark claims in LeMieux's ad are technically true. LeMieux has not personally requested any earmarks, and he has pushed to ban them all. But we think it's a bit hypocritical for LeMieux to call out Nelson for voting for a bill that included billions of dollars worth of earmarks (and specifically the infamous Bridge to Nowhere). LeMieux also voted for bills that included thousands of earmarks worth billions of dollars. By the same logic in LeMieux's ad, Nelson could counter with an ad that says LeMieux voted for billions in earmarks including any number of outrageous-sounding pet projects from around the country that were included in the handful of appropriations bills LeMieux voted for in late 2009. LeMieux makes the distinction that he never personally requested earmarks (while Nelson certainly has). But again, we think it's worth noting that the appropriations bills LeMieux voted in favor of were stuffed with dozens of Florida earmarks -- costing hundreds of millions of dollars -- that were requested by his Republican predecessor, Martinez. LeMieux has put himself out front on the issue of reining in earmarks, taking a stand early in 2010 calling for a complete ban. And LeMieux may not buy that Nelson has found religion on earmarks, but Nelson was among only a half dozen Democrats in the Senate who also voted for the earmark moratorium. We think that's a lot of missing context, and so we rate the claim Half True.	None	George LeMieux	None	None	None	2011-05-12T18:46:33	2011-05-10	['None']
pomt-07951	"Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known ... corporate profits are up."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-state-union-says-corporate-profits-ar/	In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama suggested that the economy is in recovery mode. "We are poised for progress," the president told a joint session of Congress. "Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back. Corporate profits are up. The economy is growing again." We decided to see if corporate profits are indeed up in the past two years. Statistics on corporate profits are calculated by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. They are determined both on an annual and a quarterly basis. According to BEA, corporate profits -- officially known as "corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments" -- were as follows: 2007: $1.511 trillion 2008: $1.263 trillion 2009: $1.258 trillion Unfortunately, since we’re only 25 days into 2011, BEA has yet not calculated the figure for 2010, so we’re left to use annualized estimates based on the quarterly figures. The most recent quarterly estimate, based on the third quarter of 2010, produced annualized corporate profits of $1.659 trillion. Even the lowest annualized estimate for corporate profits, based on the first quarter of 2010, pegged them at $1.567 trillion -- still well above either of the full-year amounts for 2008 and 2009. So, the only thing that could make Obama’s statement incorrect would be a woeful under performance in the fourth quarter of 2010, but that seems unlikely based on current expert estimates. Prasad Patkar, who helps manage about $1.8 billion at Platypus Asset Management in Sydney, told Bloomberg Businessweek in mid-January that "the earnings recovery in the U.S. has been exceptional post-crisis. It seems the recovery in the U.S. economy is starting to broaden, which will support revenue and earnings growth. China’s economy is robust, but it’ll take at least six months of strong data to silence those calling a policy-induced hard landing." Indeed, if the third-quarter rate holds, corporate profits for 2010 would set a record. The current record was set in 2006 -- the last full year before the onset of the recent recession. That year, corporate profits hit $1.608 trillion. Of course, corporate profits are just one component of the economy -- and just one part of Americans’ perceptions of how well the nation is doing economically. Unemployment is still stubbornly high, and indeed, some commentators have been critical of companies’ hesitancy to invest on new hires amid such high profits. Still, Obama was correct in his description of the trend in corporate profits. One could say that he’s being presumptuous by assuming what the full 2010 figure will be before it’s officially announced, but we think that the current trendlines for corporate profits, combined with recent fourth-quarter reports, put the level so far above the 2009 level that it’s highly unlikely to drop once the full-year numbers have been released. So we rate Obama’s statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-01-25T21:06:04	2011-01-25	['None']
pomt-03081	Warren Buffett says stop Obamacare now and start over.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/27/tom-graves/rep-graves-wrong-about-buffetts-health-law-stance/	As the nation winds down to a government shutdown and possible default on its debt, the fight over President Barack Obama’s health care law continues. PolitiFact Georgia was asked to check a claim made by Georgia Congressman Tom Graves about the law, more commonly referred to as Obamacare. Graves, a Republican from Ranger, has become one of the legislative leaders for a GOP push in the U.S. House to defund Obama’s health care law in order to prevent the government shutdown. During an appearance last weekend on ABC’s "This Week," Graves defended his plan and cited additional evidence to show that support for Obamacare is dwindling. In response to a question about a Wall Street Journal editorial regarding the GOPs inept strategizing on budget issues, Graves said: "That’s their opinion. An editorial clearly is what that is. But when you read the Chicago Tribune, they say delay and stop Obamacare," Graves said. "Warren Buffett says stop it now, start over. … It’s not just Republicans, this is widespread." Graves’ comments about Buffett were familiar to us and to our audience, which asked us to review the claim. Did Warren Buffett, one of Obama’s early presidential backers, withdraw support for the president’s signature public policy legacy? Graves’ claim about Buffett was set in motion by posts from conservative bloggers, who began posting earlier this month, that the Omaha billionaire recently said "scrap Obamacare and start all over." The claim originated with a Sept. 13 post on Money Morning website titled "Buffett: Scrap Obamacare and Start Over." That post used a portion of Buffett’s comments from three years ago, before the health care law was passed. Other sites, including the Weekly Standard and Wall Street Journal, linked to or included portions of the Money Morning post in their stories. Our PolitiFact national colleagues recently completed a fact check of the bloggers’ claim, and found the statements were taken out of context and not representative of Buffett’s opinions. The claim was rated Pants On Fire. The same day as the Sept. 17 PolitiFact article, the Washington Examiner also ran a story discrediting the bloggers’ Buffett claim. And FactCheck.org reviewed the claim this week. We asked Graves’ office about his ABC News statements. The office noted that the Money Morning claim, along with follow-up stories by other media outlets, included inaccurate timeline context with their Buffett claim. But outside of the faulty time element, Buffett did say he would stop Obamacare, start over and explain how to do that, Graves’ office said. And, because Graves did not attribute an inaccurate time frame to Buffett’s comments, they believe his statement was true, the office said. But what exactly did Buffett say about Obamacare, when did he say it and what are his current thoughts on the matter? Buffett’s Obamacare statements included in the Money Morning blog were taken from an interview he gave with CNBC on March 1, 2010. A Politico article from the same year -- which was also quoted by Graves’ office in response to our questions -- summarized the interview. In that interview, Buffett was asked whether he was "in favor of scrapping this and going back to start over." He said: "I would be if I were President Obama." What the blog posts and Graves did not include in their comments was the full context of Buffett’s statements. At the time, Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., was referring to a pending health care bill. (The Affordable Care Act was signed into law days later on March 23, 2010.) Buffett went on to say that he would be in favor of scrapping the Senate version of the bill, but that he’d vote for it instead of doing nothing. Ultimately, Buffett said he’d like to see a plan that really attacked (health care) costs. Last week, Buffett refuted the assertion that he did not support Obamacare. "I’ve never suggested nor thought Obamacare should be scrapped," Buffett said in an interview with the Omaha World-Herald. "I support it. It relates to providing medical care for all Americans. That’s something I’ve thought should be done for a long, long time." Buffett’s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, told us in an email that Buffett’s office set the record straight for any news organization that contacted them. She also mentioned her boss’s explanation during a CNBC news interview last week. After fact checkers began exploring the claim, the Weekly Standard updated its original blog post to say: "It appears that Buffett made his anti-Obamacare comments in 2010, thereby showing that he, like most of the American people, has opposed Obamacare since even before it was passed …" So what about Graves’ claim? The Georgia congressman stated that Warren Buffett said stop Obamacare now and start over. The claim was similar to other blogger claims debunked by fact checkers, and based on an interview Buffett gave three years ago before Obamacare was signed into law. Buffett did say he would scrap the then Senate bill, but also noted that he would vote for it instead of continuing with the existing health care situation. Graves’ claim may not have misrepresented Buffett’s comments as being recent like the bloggers did, but his comments were made after similar claims about Buffett were found to be misleading. And Graves still made the claim, without any additional context, five days after several fact checkers debunked the claim. We rate Graves’ statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-06479	Says the reforms in state Issue 2 "will save taxpayer dollars"	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/17/building-better-ohio/building-better-ohio-touts-issue-2-potential-savin/	A key thrust of Issue 2 proponents is that public employees need to pay their fair share of the cost of health and pension benefits. The issue, a referendum on Senate Bill 5 and its overhaul of Ohio’s collective bargaining laws for public workers, would require public employees to contribute at least 15 percent of the cost of their health benefits and 10 percent of their salaries toward pensions. Gov. John Kasich has repeatedly said it’s only fair to demand such participation in light of what private sector employees pay for their health care and retirement benefits. A campaign ad from Building a Better Ohio, an organization pushing for passage of Issue 2, focuses specifically on those two figures, and touts the savings they could yield. "Issue 2’s reasonable reforms will save taxpayer dollars," the ad claims. We’ll leave it to others to debate the phrase "reasonable," but PolitiFact Ohio decided to explore the purported savings. We’re focusing here on health care and pension costs because that’s what the ad discussed. It’s clear governments will save money if their employees contribute more toward the costs of their benefits, but those savings are not across the board, applying to each level of government. Savings in those two areas will not come at the state government level because its employees already pay 15 percent of their health care costs and put 10 percent of their wages toward their pensions. But what about the counties, cities, townships, school districts and the like across the state that employ more than 300,000 workers? For health care benefits, the savings would vary greatly from community to community, . Cities like Akron, for instance — where union and nonunion workers alike do not pay for health insurance — could save millions in personnel costs. The city’s tab for health care in 2010 was $23.5 million. If the new law had been in effect, Akron workers would have paid more than $3.5 million of the cost. For the 1,941 workers with health care, that would amount to about $1,800 each. Employees in Avon, on the other hand, already pay 20 percent of their health care costs. So they wouldn’t pay a dime extra for coverage under the law, and there would be no savings to the community. In an analysis of the fiscal impact of SB 5, The Department of Administrative Services estimates that localities will save about $98 million a year in health care costs if their employees are made to pay at least 15 percent of their health care costs. DAS calculated the estimate using State Employment Relations Board statistics from 2010 (2011 numbers were not available at the time) that show employees of cities, school boards, townships and counties now pay a combined average of 10.8 percent of their health care costs. That comes to a total of $255.9 million. If the average contribution is raised to 15 percent, the total increases to $353.9 million. That translates into a combined savings of $98 million with school districts saving the most at $61.4 million, cities at $30.6 million, townships at $4.1 million and counties at $1.8 million. Still, these numbers are estimates, based on a self-reporting survey in which only 79 percent of the 1,359 governmental jurisdictions in the state participated. Melissa Fazekas, spokeswoman for Issue 2 opponent We Are Ohio, said the numbers can’t be trusted because they are based on an incomplete survey. The state contends the sample size far exceeds the required number and has a margin of error of three percent. Coming up with an estimated savings on the pension side is more difficult, and the state makes no attempt to do so. But we’ll offer up a few figures to ponder. As it stands, state law requires all employees to contribute 10 percent of their wages toward their pension. In some cases the employer pays some or all of that amount, a benefit that’s known as a "pension pickup." There are 3,285 union contracts at the local level, according to the State Employment Relations Board. Of those contracts, 2,504 do not include pension pickups, so on those there would be no savings. Another 245 do have pickups. The remaining 781 have not been reviewed sufficiently to say one way or the other. It’s also worth looking possible savings in the five state pensions plans that represent public employees in Ohio. We can check the Ohio Highway Patrol Retirement System off the list because its members are all state employees who already meet the requirements of SB 5. The Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, the largest pension plan in the state and the eleventh largest in the country, represents 3,700 employers, but only about 9 percent of those employers offer their employees some level of pension pickup, said spokeswoman Julie Graham-Price. The State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio estimates that 92 percent of its nearly 176,000 members already pay their full 10 percent, and of the 8 percent who don’t, most get only a partial pickup, said spokesman Nick Treneff. The School Employees Retirement System of Ohio estimates that 95 to 97 percent of its 126,000 members pay their 10 percent share, said spokesman Tim Barbour. The only pension plan that can attach a dollar figure to its volume of pension pickups is the Ohio Police & Fire Pension Fund. Fund members paid more than $197 million in pension contributions last year with nearly $60 million of that amount picked up by their employers, said spokesman Dave Graham. So, clearly, the evidence suggests that taxpayer dollars -- perhaps millions -- will be saved if the health care and pension mandates in SB 5 become law. On that count, the statement in the Building a Better Ohio ad is accurate. But there are some points to keep in mind. At the state level, employees already are contributing at the 10 and 15 percent thresholds, something the ad does not mention. Without examining each and every contract, it’s impossible to know exactly where the savings will occur and how large the savings will be at the local level. For communities in which the employees already meet those thresholds, there won’t be a savings. For others, the savings would vary depending on how much of the cost the communities pickup now with taxpayer dollars. In the case of pension pickups, we can deduce that many localities will see little to no savings because employees already meet the mandates. And there’s one other thing to consider. If union employees lose pension and health care benefits, they may be able to negotiate to get some of it back in the form of higher wages. And that could cancel out some of the savings to the taxpayer. Those points provide additional information and clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly True.

pomt-11212	"In San Francisco, we were successful in reducing our street population 40 percent. We got 12,000 people off the street."	half-true	/california/statements/2018/may/10/gavin-newsom/did-gavin-newsom-help-san-francisco-reduce-its-hom/	Candidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed San Francisco dramatically shrunk its homeless street population, implying the change took place under his leadership. "In San Francisco, we were successful in reducing our street population 40 percent. We got 12,000 people off the street," Newsom said during a gubernatorial debate in San Jose on May 8, 2018. The event was broadcast statewide on NBC and NPR stations. Newsom is a Democrat and California’s lieutenant governor. He was San Francisco’s mayor from January 2004 through January 2011. Before that, he served eight years on the San Francisco County Board of Supervisors starting in January 1997. Polls show Newsom is currently the favorite in the race to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown. Whoever becomes California’s next governor will be faced with a growing homeless crisis, one made worse by a lack of affordable housing. Homelessness in the state shot up nearly 14 percent in 2017, as it remained flat nationwide, according to federal data and our recent fact check on the topic. Given the importance of the issue, we wanted to know whether Newsom got his facts right. We set out on a fact check. Our research We started by examining Newsom’s claim about a 40 percent reduction in the city’s "street population," which includes people living outside, in abandoned buildings, tents, cars and storage structures. It’s a subset of the city’s overall homeless population, which includes people living in emergency shelters and transitional housing. Some might interpret Newsom’s statement as meaning the city’s overall homeless population dropped significantly during his time in office. That’s not the case. But because Newsom twice referenced "street population," we examined that category. Though he doesn’t give a timeframe, we assumed Newsom was speaking mainly about his tenure as mayor. Nathan Click, Newsom’s campaign spokesman, said the candidate’s statement is supported when comparing street population totals from 2002 to 2009, or two years before he became mayor to two years before he left that office. A 2009 San Francisco Homeless Count and Survey does show the total dropped 40 percent, from 4,535 individuals to 2,709. By 2011, however, the city’s street total climbed to 3,100, a gain of about 400 people over Newsom’s final two years as mayor, according to the city survey from that year. Trent Rhorer, who served as Newsom’s homeless czar, has worked as executive director of the San Francisco Human Services Agency since 2000. He said the increase during the last part of Newsom’s tenure took place "in the context of a massive recession" that forced many onto the streets. Rhorer said it was also driven by the shuttering of several nonprofit homeless programs, including two drop-in centers, a shelter and a treatment program when private landlords sold buildings housing those services. Even considering the uptick in the last two years of Newsom’s term, the city’s unsheltered total still decreased by 31 percent from 2002 to 2011, he noted. The executive director added that the city’s overall homeless population held steady from 2009 to 2011, hovering near 6,500. "Is homelessness solved? Absolutely not," Rhorer said, but Newsom "got results." 12,000 people off the streets? Rohrer also explained the 12,000 figure. He said it represents the total number of people removed from the streets through two strategies from January 2004 through November 2010, a period that nearly spans Newsom’s time as mayor. The city placed about 7,000 in permanent housing programs, while the remainder left the streets with a bus ticket through Homeward Bound, a program that’s been criticized by some homeless advocacy groups as simply moving the problem to another city. Chris Herring, a doctoral candidate of sociology at UC Berkeley who studies homelessness, told The San Francisco Examiner in June 2016 the program "should not be used as a policy to boost up numbers or some vision that San Francisco is ending homelessness." Rohrer described Homeward Bound as a well-vetted and voluntary program that connected homeless street people with caretakers who agreed to take them in. It included three follow-up phone calls by city officials, he said. Overall homeless numbers Newsom’s statement does not reflect the slight increase in San Francisco’s overall homeless population during his time as mayor. The first available report during his tenure, from January 2005, shows a total of 6,248. By January 2011, Newsom’s final month in office, that number was 6,455. San Francisco’s most recent overall count, from June 2017, places the total at 7,499. While the homeless crisis continues in San Francisco, Newsom has been credited as a leader on the topic. A 2010 San Francisco Chronicle article said Newsom had "moved more homeless people into supportive housing in his seven years in office than any other mayor in the city's history - and has one of the best track records of any mayor in the country on that score." "Yet many of San Francisco's neighborhoods," the article continued, "remain plagued with panhandlers, and residents and tourists alike complain of feeling scared or just plain disgusted." Our rating Candidate for California governor Gavin Newsom recently claimed at a gubernatorial debate that, "In San Francisco, we were successful in reducing our street population 40 percent. We got 12,000 people off the street." His campaign spokesman pointed to a city homeless survey that shows for one selective window of time, 2002 to 2009, San Francisco reduced its homeless street population by 40 percent. But that report ignores the last two years of Newsom’s tenure as mayor. Looking at those years, we found San Francisco’s homeless street population jumped by 400, diminishing the reduction Newsom described at the debate. We interpreted his statement as reflecting his full tenure as mayor, not part of it. Newsom also spoke of just one segment of the homeless population -- those on the streets, but not the overall total including people in shelters. The overall total has gone up, not down. His claim that "We got 12,000 people off the street," is supported by statements from his former homeless czar. It’s important to note, however, that the city used Homeward Bound, a bus ticket program, to move about 5,000 of those people out of San Francisco. Newsom’s overall statement is partially accurate. But the first portion uses a cherry-picked timeframe that ignores the last quarter of Newsom’s term as mayor. The second part of his claim leaves out some key context. We rate Newsom’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-01788	A tax plan promoted by North Carolina Senate candidate Thom Tillis will "overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/25/patriot-majority-usa/liberal-pac-says-senate-candidate-thom-tillis-tax-/	Controversial changes to North Carolina’s tax code passed under Thom Tillis’ leadership are now a target in his Senate campaign. In 2013, the North Carolina government received national attention for a wave of conservative legislation. The Republican-dominated General Assembly -- with Tillis as speaker of the House -- passed laws increasing voter ID requirements, lowering business regulations, upping restrictions on abortion providers, tightening education spending and trimming unemployment benefits. Now, Patriot Majority USA, a liberal political action committee, has released a television ad saying Tillis’ policies have disproportionately benefited the wealthy. The ad notes in particular the tax legislation enacted last summer -- which Tillis touts in his campaign against incumbent Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. The ad says Tillis is cozy with Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who cofounded Americans for Prosperity, an influential conservative PAC. And his policies are designed to benefit people like them. "Thom Tillis thinks the wealthy, like the Koch brothers, deserve tax breaks, while teachers get a pay freeze," the ad says. "Tillis thinks corporations like the ones owned by the Koch brothers should also get tax breaks, while seniors see their pensions taxed and pay more for prescription drugs. Thom Tillis: He may not be a Koch brother, but he certainly treats them like family." At one point, text on the screen says the Tillis tax plan will "overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy." We looked into it and found that the law does not overtly harm those at lower-income levels, but the wealthy reap more of the benefits. Let’s go to the numbers. Income taxes Supporters of the tax plan most often point to the reduced income tax rate, which they say cuts taxes for people in every income bracket. That’s true. However, people in higher-income brackets get bigger cuts than those in the lowest brackets. The income tax part of the law sets the rate for everyone at 5.75 percent. Previously, the state had a graduated three-tier system, with rates of 6 percent for the lowest earners, and rates of 7 percent and 7.75 percent for higher earners. The lowest earners’ tax rates shrunk only marginally -- 0.25 points, while higher earners’ rates went down 1.25 and 2 points, respectively. Lower earners get a small break, though, in the income tax changes. The child tax credit goes from $100 to $125 per child for those earning below $40,000. The North Carolina Legislature’s Fiscal Research Division calculated how much people in various scenarios would owe on average based on the changes to the income tax (other tax changes not included). Here’s a sample of what they found: Scenario Tax owed before change Tax owed after change Change in taxes owed Married, two children, $20,000 income $40 $38 -$2 -5% change Married, two children, $250,000 income $15,832 $13,398 -$2,434 -15% change Married, no children, $20,000 income $540 $288 -$252 -47% change Married, no children, $250,000 income $16,142 $13,398 -$2,744 -17% change Single, $20,000 income $870 $719 -$151 -17% change Single, $250,000 income $17,858 $13,786 -$4,072 -22% change In none of the scenarios examined by the Fiscal Research Division do people owe more in income taxes than they did under the previous tax code. But some benefit more than others. "There’s no question who benefits the most -- the people at the upper end of the income distribution," said Lawrence Zelenak, a tax law professor at the Duke University School of Law, which is in North Carolina. "For most people, it hardly makes any difference. But the people who get the major decrease have incomes of $200,000 or more." Other changes Critics say the new tax law also disproportionately benefits the wealthy because the Legislature did not renew -- effectively eliminating -- the State Earned Income Tax Credit, which is a refundable tax credit for low-income workers. In 2011, about 907,000 North Carolina tax filers claimed the state EITC, according to the North Carolina Justice Center, a liberal advocacy group. The maximum credit ranges between $24 for a single person and $302 for a family with three or more children. Additionally, the Legislature expanded the sales tax base -- making more goods and services subject to the tax, which everyone pays regardless of income. The tax base widened to include natural gas, electricity and some entertainment services, including admissions charges. The law also eliminated North Carolina’s sales tax holidays and several sales tax exemptions, such as those for newspapers, vending machines and meals sold in schools. Opponents of raising the sales tax and other regressive taxes say they are unfairly burdensome on lower-income people because a higher percentage of their income is subject to these taxes than wealthier people. For example, if two people -- one making $500 a week and the other making $2,000 a week -- spend $100 each on groceries, the person with the lower income is spending a greater share of their income on these taxed items than the person with a higher income. It’s worth noting that in 2011 -- Tillis’ first year as speaker -- the Legislature reduced sales tax rates from 5.75 percent to 4.75 percent. Tillis and other Republicans also say the new law’s reductions in corporate tax rates (down from 6.9 percent to 5 percent, and 3 percent if certain parameters are met) will bring business and jobs to North Carolina, which will benefit everyone and bring in more revenue over the long term. In total, the new tax code will reduce tax-collected revenue by about $684 million between 2013 and 2015, according to the Fiscal Research Division. Less revenue means less money for the state to spend on social programs, which hurts people in low income brackets, Zelenak said. Even if the law does not obviously harm poor people, this is a possible indirect effect. Our ruling A Patriot Majority USA ad said Tillis’ tax plan would "overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy." North Carolina’s tax code saw a wide array of changes in 2013 under Tillis’ leadership. We found that changes to the income tax code reduced taxes for everyone, but much more for wealthier people than lower-income people. Additionally, sales tax expansions, less government revenue and eliminating the state EITC are especially burdensome on poorer people. But some changes -- such as the increased child credit for lower-income tax filers and the possibility of more jobs and business due to lowered corporate tax rates -- could benefit the whole. "Overwhelmingly" is a strong word. For that reason, we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Patriot Majority USA	None	None	None	2014-07-25T11:25:27	2014-07-22	['None']

pomt-00173	Says Ted Budd "voted to gut protections for pre-existing conditions … letting insurance companies deny coverage for (necessary) treatment."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/22/kathy-manning/fact-checking-kathy-mannings-ad-ted-budd-and-pre-e/	Two years ago, Republicans were attacking Democrats for backing the Affordable Care Act. But the tables have turned. These days, Democrats across the country are citing the popularity of the ACA, also known as Obamacare, and blasting Republicans for their repeated efforts to chip away at it. In North Carolina’s 13th Congressional District, which includes Statesville, High Point and parts of Greensboro, a 30-second television ad from Democratic congressional candidate Kathy Manning targets incumbent Republican Rep. Ted Budd for his vote on a "repeal and replace" bill. The ad cites the case of a woman named Lilly who "worked her way through UNC while living with a tumor that radiation and surgery could not cure." "But Lilly’s congressman, Ted Budd, voted to gut protections for pre-existing conditions like hers, letting insurance companies deny coverage for the treatment she needs," the ad says. Budd is not the first Republican to see this attack. In the last several weeks, PolitiFact’s state affiliates have awarded Half True ratings to nearly identical ads and statements from Democrats in Wisconsin, Florida, Virginia and California. Manning’s ad has been active on Facebook for more than a month, and the Manning campaign even set up a special website to showcase it. So we decided to give it a fresh look and see how it stacks up against the facts. The American Health Care Act and the MacArthur amendment The Manning campaign declined to comment, but its website cited articles from Time, CNN and the AARP to back up the claim. The website noted that the vote in question was related to the American Health Care Act of 2017, a Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare. The AHCA, as the bill was called, passed the House with a 217-213 margin before ultimately failing in the Senate. The AHCA would have retained some components of Obamacare while eliminating the individual mandate and making other modifications. Budd voted yes on the AHCA, and while it did not allow states to refuse coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, it did open the door for insurers to hike premiums for those people under certain circumstances. Specifically, an April 2017 amendment from Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., would have allowed states to apply for waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. As PolitiFact noted in its guide to the MacArthur amendment, the amendment would have let states seek waivers from the AHCA’s "continuous coverage" provision, which was supposed to require that Americans continuously carry health insurance or else face higher premiums for one year. Insurers in states receiving waivers would have been permitted to consider a person’s health status when setting premiums in the individual market for the year of penalty. In other words, they would have been able to raise the premiums, for one year, of a person with a pre-existing condition so long as that person had been uninsured for 63 consecutive days the previous year. Currently under Obamacare, premiums can only vary based on certain conditions, such as age, location or tobacco use. Any person without employer or government-provided health insurance is guaranteed access to coverage in the individual market — regardless of his or her health status — and cannot be charged a higher rate because of a pre-existing condition. What would the AHCA have meant for pre-existing conditions? Elizabeth Oglesby, Budd’s campaign manager, said Manning’s claim about protections for pre-existing conditions was inaccurate. "Not one person would be denied health insurance for pre-existing conditions, and (Manning) should apologize for her false, smear campaign and take down her ad," she said. Indeed, the MacArthur amendment explicitly stated that "nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions." But there’s more nuance to unpack here. As we mentioned before, the amendment would have allowed insurers to consider pre-existing conditions when writing policies for people who had lapses in their coverage the previous year. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that could mean that 6.3 million people could have faced higher premiums under the AHCA because of pre-existing health conditions. That’s a significant number, but a small portion of the estimated 50 to 120 million people under 65 with pre-existing conditions. That means somewhere between 4 and 13 percent of people under 65 with pre-existing conditions could have experienced heightened premiums under the AHCA. As PolitiFact has noted before, many low-income people have trouble staying covered without lapses, and the waiver system could have led insurers to drive premiums too high for these people during penalty years. The ACHA would have appropriated $8 billion over five years to assist people who could not afford the penalty premiums. The waivers would have also allowed states to set up high-risk pools or participate in a federal invisible risk-sharing program to reimburse insurers for taking on high-risk individuals. But it’s not clear how effective either measure would have been. In a press release, the American Medical Association warned that the AHCA’s waiver program "could make coverage unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions." That’s why, when President Donald Trump and North Carolina Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger said the AHCA included coverage for pre-existing conditions, PolitiFact gave them both Mostly False ratings. Our ruling Manning’s ad said Ted Budd "voted to gut protections for pre-existing conditions … letting insurance companies deny coverage for the treatment (Lilly) needs." The bill included a line stating that insurers would not have been allowed to restrict access to healthcare for people with pre-existing conditions. But in a limited way, the AHCA would have rolled back protections for pre-existing conditions by letting some insurers raise premiums based on a person’s health status under certain circumstances. This could have led to somewhere between 4 and 13 percent of people under 65 with pre-existing conditions facing higher premiums. Overall, Manning’s ad is partially accurate, but leaves out important details and context. We rate this statement Half True.

pose-01082	In 2010, then-Congressman Nathan Deal unveiled a series of education initiatives he pledged to enact if voters would sign off on his plans for a job change and elect him Georgia’s 82nd governor. Among them was the promise that teachers would have a big financial incentive to work in bad schools. "Teachers who agree to dedicate their time in one of our state's most underperforming schools would further be rewarded by accruing service credit at twice the rate, earning two years of credit for each calendar year served,” Deal said in a press release dated Sept. 7, 2010. At that time, 503, or 22.6 percent, of the state’s 2,221 public schools were failing to make adequate yearly progress, the measure of achievement under the federal No Child Left Behind law. We checked in with some in-the-know education advocates to see whether they’d heard of any action on this Deal campaign promise. None had. “That’s a campaign promise that probably fell victim to a comfortable electoral margin,” one said. We went to Deal’s re-election campaign and spokeswoman Jennifer Talaber with some basic questions. Has the governor taken any steps to see whether this could become a reality or is feasible? Has he gotten any projections on the potential costs? Is he still pursuing this? In one of several email exchanges that followed, Talaber said: “It’s still a goal.” But other things had to come first, she said. “In order to enact any merit-based incentives, we first had to fix the flawed (teacher) evaluation system which, when Deal came to office in 2011, was rating 99 percent of teachers as ‘satisfactory’,” Talaber said. “We did that in 2013.” The new evaluation system will be fully implemented during the 2014-2015 school year, she said. “Once that groundwork is laid, we can begin pursuing new initiatives,” Talaber said. Deal’s plan would allow teachers to earn two years of credit toward retirement for every one year they work in one of the state’s most underperforming schools, the spokeswoman said. No study has been done to determine the costs, Talaber said. Under the Teacher Retirement System of Georgia, a teacher who retires with 30 years of service can draw about 60 percent of the average of his or her highest two consecutive years of pay. Some districts also offer their teachers a local pension or allow them to participate in Social Security. As of May 31, the state’s teacher retirement system had 214,567 active members and 104,091 retired members. The system paid out more than $3.5 billion in fiscal 2013 and expects to pay out $3.7 billion for the year ending June 30, said Jeff Ezell, the system’s executive director. Deal “remains committed to improving the quality of students’ education and rewarding Georgia’s most effective teachers,” Talaber said.	stalled	https://www.politifact.com/georgia/promises/deal-o-meter/promise/1165/pay-working-tough-schools-still-goal-spokeswoman-s/	None	deal-o-meter	Nathan Deal	None	None	Pay off for working in tough schools 'still a goal,' spokeswoman says	2014-06-10T00:00:00	None	['Nathan_Deal', 'Georgia_(U.S._state)', 'Social_Security_(United_States)']
pomt-03958	Employers and schools have no right to conduct "surveillance of a dorm room or a worker’s cubicle."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/feb/17/brian-patrick-kennedy/rep-brian-patrick-kennedy-suggests-employers-and-s/	These days, it can be hard to figure out what is private and what is not. At the same time people are concerned about the type of information collected by companies when they go on the Internet, people are also posting a lot of very personal information online via Facebook, Twitter and blogs. State Rep. Brian Patrick Kennedy, a Democrat from Hopkinton, R.I., wants to put some limitations on how much private information you must reveal if you apply for a job or enroll in a school. He is proposing legislation that would prohibit employers or schools from requesting social media information, including an applicant's personal username or password. For example, it would be illegal for an employer or education official to ask to be added to the applicant's Facebook friend's list. It was this sentence in his news release that caught our eye, particularly the reference to employer rights: "Employers and schools have no more right to this private information than they do in providing surveillance of a dorm room or a worker's cubicle." We were under the impression that employers had every right to keep an eye on you while on the job. If you use a company-owned computer on a company-owned network, for example, the company has the right to track every e-mail, every web-page visit, and even every keystroke you make on that machine. So we decided to investigate. We made two phone calls over two days to Kennedy asking him for his source. He never responded. But if such monitoring is illegal, as Kennedy maintains, a lot of companies are already doing it. We found a 2007 survey of 304 U.S. companies conducted by the American Management Association in which 7 percent said they use video surveillance to track employee's performance on the job. But 48 percent reported that they use video monitoring to some degree to look for theft, violence and sabotage. Most of the time workers are informed of the surveillance, but not always. Is it legal to monitor workers that way? "In some workplaces, the answer is pretty clearly yes," said Michael Yelnosky, who specializes in labor law at Roger Williams University School of Law. In a private workplace with no union, placing a surveillance camera is no different from having a supervisor sit behind the worker and watching everything, he said. "It might come out differently if there's a union in place," he said. "The employer would have to bargain that issue before he went ahead and unilaterally made that change" because it would be a change in working conditions. The rules are a bit different if the employer is the government, he said. "The Supreme Court has said you have some protections in the workplace against your public employer that you wouldn't have from your private employer because the Constitution prohibits some state invasions of privacy where it doesn't say anything about private employers." And there are other limitations. Rhode Island has an overall privacy law, passed in 1980, that protects against "unreasonable intrusion upon one's physical solitude or seclusion," the "appropriation of one's name or likeness," "unreasonable publicity given to one's private life," and publicity that "places another in a false light before the public." There is also a state law that deals specifically with privacy in the workplace; it has special rules regarding areas of the workplace where people might expect an extra degree of privacy, such as a bathroom or locker room. In general, video monitoring of workplaces is allowed, but there are restrictions if you want to add sound to that surveillance. "You have to give your consent to personal conversations," said Robert Ellis Smith, publisher of Privacy Journal, a 38-year-old monthly publication. "If The [Providence] Journal were to install microphones in the city room, they can overhear business-related conversations. But once they turned personal, then the employer is not supposed to listen in. Rhode Island law pretty well tracks federal law [on this matter]. Courts have said employers have latitude to listen in on conversations, but they must be business related." The Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union's pamphlet on "Your Rights to Workplace Privacy in Rhode Island," agrees that in most private workplaces, video surveillance is legal. But it is not legal if it's done to monitor employee activities related to the exercise of collective bargaining rights or the forming of a labor union. While Rhode Island may not have a specific law about monitoring a cubicle or dorm room, said Steven Brown of the ACLU, the state’s general "right to privacy" law would apply. Smith, of Privacy Journal, also said there is no ban on monitoring in dormitory rooms. "They're the landlord," he said. Installing a camera might be permissible, said Smith, however, "there could be a lawsuit if it picked up nudity, near-nudity, and sensitive areas but there's no law on it either way. It goes to the content of what's being picked up and how sensitive it is." Audio surveillance in a dorm room would not be allowed without permission. "It's only employers who have that latitude," said Smith. We also checked with Brown University, where spokesman Mark Nickel said the university's lawyers are "not aware of any legislation that either permits or forbids surveillance in dorm rooms. As a matter of well-established practice, Brown does not allow surveillance in private areas like dormitory rooms, and the general counsel's office is unaware of any college or university that does." Our ruling State Rep. Brian Patrick Kennedy said: "Employers and schools have no more right to this private [social media] information than they do in providing surveillance of a dorm room or a worker's cubicle." Kennedy didn’t return our phone calls seeking backup for his claim. One could read his statement two ways. In one reading, Kennedy could be giving an opinion that employers shouldn’t have rights to that type of surveillance. PolitiFact doesn’t rule on opinions. But in our reading of his news release, Kennedy is asserting a fact -- that employers and schools don’t have such rights. From that standpoint, it is clear that state and federal law does not prohibit schools and employers -- with some important restrictions -- from monitoring workers and students on their property, although we can't imagine anyone, other than students wanting to be in some sort of reality TV series, being willing to move into a dorm where school officials can watch you in your room. Kennedy’s statement has some element of fact -- there are existing protections in the law. But it ignores important facts that would give a different impression -- the right of employers and landlords to monitor workplaces and living spaces. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-01405	If Florida had not taken the stimulus, it "would have led to the firing of 20,000 teachers."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/10/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-debate-stimulus-saved-20000-tea/	During the first debate between Republican Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist, Scott repeatedly hammered Crist for jobs lost during his tenure. Scott said that 832,000 jobs were lost during Crist’s tenure. Crist -- who served from January 2007 through January 2011 as a Republican but is now running as a Democrat -- countered that he governed during a global economic meltdown. "One of the decisions I made to get us through it was to work with the president so that we would have funds available to keep teachers on the job. Now, Rick Scott has said taking the recovery was an absolute mistake, which would have led to the firing of 20,000 teachers." Crist used the term firing, which isn't quite accurate, since these would have been layoffs. However, we don't see this as a serious issue, because the context makes clear the kind of job losses he's talking about. Is it true that by taking federal stimulus dollars Crist saved 20,000 teachers from being laid off? Stimulus money saved jobs Crist made a similar statement when he announced he was running for governor in St. Petersburg in November. It is one of many back-and-forth attacks about education funding and teacher layoffs hurled between the two candidates. Crist’s statement refers to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the $787 billion federal stimulus bill pushed by President Barack Obama and passed by Congress in 2009. The Florida Department of Education published information in 2010 about how many "instructional personnel" the Recovery Act affected. The department identified 19,166 full-time equivalent jobs affecting a total 31,003 employees for the quarter ending June 30, 2010. Instructional personnel included classroom teachers as well as other school employees including guidance counselors, librarians and audio-visual workers. The state’s education commissioner at the time, Eric Smith, said that the stimulus dollars saved 26,000 teacher jobs. (Smith was appointed by Crist.) The stimulus money was paid out over two years: In 2009-10, nearly $908 million went to K-12 education, and another $873 million the year after, according to Ruth Melton, director of government relations for the Florida School Boards Association. "The infusion of this federal cash was tremendously important in keeping school districts solvent during the recession," Melton told PolitiFact Florida when we first looked into this claim in 2013. But it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact number of teachers who would have been laid off without the federal infusion of money, because we can’t predict how each district would have handled their own budgets. Some districts with healthier reserves might have avoided or minimized layoffs more than other districts. Or perhaps they would have found ways other than teacher cuts to reduce their budgets. "It could have meant actually more teachers than reported," Melton said. At the other extreme, some districts could have laid off more expensive teachers who were close to retirement -- and that could have lowered the number. Our ruling Crist said that if Florida had not taken the stimulus it "would have led to the firing of 20,000 teachers." The Education Department identified 19,166 full-time equivalent jobs affected by the stimulus money. That’s close to what Crist said, but that figure includes not just teachers but other types of school workers as well. In addition, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact number of teachers who would have been laid off statewide, since districts would have had discretion in how to handle budget cutting and may have had other options to reduce spending beyond laying off teachers. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2014-10-10T16:51:19	2014-10-10	['None']
pomt-11731	"Even with full control of the House, Senate and White House, Republicans have still failed to deliver on their promise of higher wages for working families."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/12/nancy-pelosi/have-wages-failed-go-donald-trumps-watch/	On the heels of a generally favorable jobs report, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., criticized Republicans for failing to boost wages for American workers. "November’s jobs report reveals that hard-working Americans still aren’t getting the bigger paychecks they deserve," Pelosi said in a statement that she tweeted out. "Even with full control of the House, Senate and White House, Republicans have still failed to deliver on their promise of higher wages for working families." See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Her talking point is a stretch: Federal data shows wage growth since President Donald Trump took office in January, though one of the two measurements shows the gains barely outpacing inflation. One of the two key statistics for judging this statement is median usual weekly inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 16 years and over. This information is collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is available quarterly. For the last quarter fully under President Barack Obama -- the fourth quarter of 2016 -- this amount stood at $348. After Trump took office, it rose to $350 in the first quarter of 2017, rose again to $354 in the second quarter, and remained the same at $354 in the third and most recent quarter. The $6 increase may not seem like much, but it's still almost a 2 percent increase above the rate of inflation over the course of just three quarters, and that runs counter to the point Pelosi was trying to make. Here’s the full chart, which shows that earnings continued to rise after Trump took office (the three most recent quarters shaded in red). See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "Generally speaking, earnings increase during economic expansions," said Chris Lafakis, a director at Moody's Analytics. "There can be some debate over how much wage growth a healthy economy should have, and who is responsible for the growth, but it can’t be debated that earnings increased under President Obama and they have continued to increase under President Trump." We also looked for wage growth in another BLS statistic, namely average hourly earnings for all private-sector employees. This statistic shows a slow but steady rise in wages, from $25.98 in December 2016 to $26.55 in November. (The chart below shows the final year under Obama in blue and the months so far under Trump in red): See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com There’s a reason that these two statistics can look a little different. The time period studied is different (hourly vs. weekly), as is the typical case studied (median vs. average). This statistic is also released every month rather than every quarter. The most important difference, however, is that the BLS does not adjust the hourly earnings data for inflation. When adjusted for inflation, the earnings gains on Trump’s watch shrink, though they do not disappear. When Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, ran an inflation adjustment for us, he found that in 2017, average hourly earnings rose by 0.05 percent. That’s an increase, but it’s barely outpacing inflation. When we checked with Pelosi’s office, they cited a statement by Gary Cohn, the White House’s own National Economic Council director, who said on CNBC’s Squawk Box that "we're still not growing wages in this country." They also said that in January 2016, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., tweeted that "wages are stagnant" even though at the time, they were growing at least as fast as they are today. Our ruling Pelosi said, "Even with full control of the House, Senate and White House, Republicans have still failed to deliver on their promise of higher wages for working families." The two best statistics for judging this assertion both show wage growth. One of them, however, shows growth that’s barely above inflation, meaning that Americans wouldn’t necessarily keep any more of their income in their pocket. We rate her statement Mostly False.

pomt-05877	President Obama told people "to skip coming here (Las Vegas) for conventions and meetings."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-president-told-people-skip-vegas-/	Fired up from a victory in Nevada’s caucuses, Mitt Romney used his stump speech in Las Vegas to remind supporters that President Barack Obama has not fixed the state’s economic woes. "Four years ago, candidate Obama came to Nevada, promising to help. But after he was elected, his help was telling people to skip coming here for conventions and meetings," Romney told the crowd at the Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa on Feb. 4, 2012. Did we hear that right? Was the president urging a business boycott of Sin City? Time for a fact-check. Obama’s remarks on Vegas Asked for the source of Romney's remark, his campaign pointed us to this story, which covers the president's prickly history with Las Vegas. Romney was right, at least, in saying that Obama has spoken unflatteringly of the city in the past. Twice he has landed in hot water for grasping at a metaphor linking trips to Vegas with extravagance and irresponsibility. But was Romney right that the president wasn’t just dissing all-American weekend trips of debauchery to Vegas -- he was hating on business meetings? On Feb. 11, 2009, Obama spoke about excess on Wall Street to a crowd in Elkhart, Ind. "You are not going to be able to give out these big bonuses until you pay taxpayers back," Obama said. "You can't get corporate jets. You can't go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayers' dime. There's got to be some accountability and some responsibility." Okay, so CEOs shouldn’t blow federal bailout money at the $10,000 minimum blackjack tables. We get it. But we didn’t hear anything about blowing off conventions. What else? A year later, in February 2010, Obama infuriated the oddsmakers again by drawing an analogy between the federal government’s fiscal practices and those of an average family. "Responsible families don't do their budgets the way the federal government does. Right? When times are tough, you tighten your belts," Obama said at a town hall-style meeting in Nashua N.H. "You don't go buying a boat when you can barely pay your mortgage. You don't blow a bunch of cash on Vegas when you're trying to save for college. You prioritize. You make tough choices. It's time your government did the same." Please, Mom and Dad, don’t raid our college fund for a night in the Rain Man suite! Again, the comparison is clear; the reference to conventions and meetings is nonexistent. The backlash Obama’s words landed with a loud thud. The mayor of Las Vegas demanded an apology. Several major companies canceled meetings worth hundreds of thousands of dollars "not because of costs but because of appearances," according to Newsday. "The president needs to lay off Las Vegas and stop making it the poster child for where people shouldn't be spending their money," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat who is normally an ally of the president. "Las Vegas is suffering through one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, and we cannot afford for the president to bring us down any further," added Republican Sen. John Ensign. Obama had to clarify his love of The Strip, telling the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce in February 2010, "Let me set the record straight: I love Vegas...There you go. Always have. I love Vegas." Our ruling Romney said that Obama told people "to skip coming here (Las Vegas) for conventions and meetings." Obama said heads of corporations shouldn’t use taxpayer money for Vegas jaunts (or corporate jets or Super Bowl excursions or any other flight of luxury paid for by the rest of us). And he said parents shouldn’t spend their money on Vegas trips when they need to be saving for kids’ college. That could certainly be construed as a rap on tourism. But a suggestion to skip meetings and conventions? The president said no such thing. Romney’s claim, like so much about Las Vegas, was over the top. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-00638	Says Jeb Bush "once held $1 million in family planning grants hostage until the programs receiving the money agreed not to discuss birth control at all."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/may/20/emilys-list/jeb-bush-held-1-million-hostage-abstinence-only-ed/	A Democratic political action committee ripped Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, saying his positions as Florida’s governor preview what he’d be like as commander in chief -- particularly when it comes to women’s issues. Stephanie Schriock, president of the group Emily’s List, said in an essay on Medium that Bush spent his two terms curbing women’s reproductive and health rights. (Emily’s List helps Democratic women candidates who support abortion rights.) Schriock ticked off several actions that ran counter to the group’s stance, including Bush’s support of abstinence-only sex education. "And let’s not forget that Jeb once held $1 million in family planning grants hostage until the programs receiving the money agreed not to discuss birth control at all," she wrote. We wondered what Schriock meant about Bush holding grant money hostage, so we took a closer look at the books. Not talking about it We found only a few media mentions of a situation resembling a hostage crisis, and they were the same ones Emily’s List sent to us as proof. The primary source was a March 2001 story in the Tampa Bay Times that focused on a budget request from Bush for lawmakers to consider during the legislative session. The story detailed how Bush wanted $1 million of the state Department of Health’s $5.7 million family planning allocation to create education grants for chastity counseling. This would have mirrored some federally funded programs in the state that told teens to wait until marriage to have sex, without discussing birth control methods. Those programs, many of which were privately run by religious groups, operated under names like Best Friends, Sex Can Wait and Everyone's Not Doing It. The request would have marked the first time the state would have funded an abstinence-based counseling program. The idea was criticized by sex education advocates and legislators who said teaching abstinence didn’t work. They also said diverting $1 million would keep many poor women from getting HIV tests, pap smears, birth control counseling and other services at clinics and county health departments. But except for a couple of mentions in other articles about the proposal, the March 2001 Times article was the only place we found that the request was fully examined. Even Emily’s List couldn’t tell us what happened to Bush’s proposal. They did tell us their aim was to point out Bush had made clear he preferred abstinence-only counseling, and was willing to put conditions on funding to achieve that goal. That doesn’t strike us as Bush literally preventing that money from being used for regular family planning services, however. Though the Times story says the request was supported by then-health secretary Bob Brooks, it was still just a request. Florida governors routinely submit a proposed budget each year before the session, but the Legislature has the final say on how money is spent. It appears in 2001 lawmakers didn’t follow Bush’s wishes. The state Department of Health shared appropriations for family planning services going back to 2000 and found nothing specifying funds had to go to abstinence education exclusively. "It does not appear that there was any proviso language that directed $1 million to be spent on chastity programs from the family planning category," spokeswoman Mara Burger told us. The 2001 appropriation for family planning was almost $5.8 million, a figure that has since fallen to $4.2 million today. Florida continues to specify abstinence should be taught as a part of sex ed classes, although school districts are given plenty of leeway. The state is still one of the biggest recipients of federal money for chastity programs. Even anti-Obamacare Republicans in the Legislature agreed in 2012 to take millions set aside for abstinence education in the Affordable Care Act, even while rejecting other aid tied to the law. Our ruling Emily’s List said, "Jeb once held $1 million in family planning grants hostage until the programs receiving the money agreed not to discuss birth control at all." There are a handful of news stories that say Bush in 2001 asked the Legislature to set aside $1 million for chastity programs out of the state’s almost $5.8 million for family planning. That's a bit different from threatening existing programs with a gag order. More importantly, there's no evidence Bush's proposal went into effect. The health department said no requirements for abstinence programs were passed by lawmakers. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-02665	"The amount of attention paid this week to Chris Christie makes the coverage of Benghazi ... pale in significance."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/12/karl-rove/karl-rove-says-media-coverage-benghazi-pales-signi/	New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has always attracted a fair amount of media attention. But when news broke last week that a close adviser and a top appointee allegedly orchestrated a traffic jam for political retribution, the Republican leader became the top news story of the day. In fact, Christie’s apology press conference, which lasted nearly two hours and attracted dozens of reporters and cameras, was aired in its entirety on CNN and MSNBC. On Fox News Sunday, Bob Woodward, the Washington Post journalist who helped uncover the Watergate scandal, said he wanted to see more reporting on how the events in New Jersey transpired. But Republican strategist and Fox News contributor Karl Rove said he also wanted more reporting on Benghazi and other incidents involving President Barack Obama. "The amount of attention paid to Chris Christie makes the coverage of Benghazi, at the same time, the coverage of the IRS, pale in significance." Rove said. In this fact-check we decided to focus on the comparison between the events, and the media coverage, in New Jersey and in Libya. Counting the stories Conservatives have long accused the media of covering up controversies in the Obama administration, including the attacks on a U.S. consulate in Libya that resulted in the deaths of ambassador Chris Stevens and three others, and reports that the IRS targeted tea party groups. Rove pointed us to reports from the Media Research Center, a conservative website critical of the press, highlighting what they say are disparities in the amount of coverage Christie garnered versus other scandals. We link to them here and here for your consideration. But we also conducted our own analysis to see if Christie’s coverage pales in significance to Benghazi. It’s fair to say the coverage of Christie’s week was significant. When the story first broke in New Jersey newspapers, every major outlet quickly followed their lead. By Sunday, Christie was a topic of debate on all of the political talk shows. Just how much was Christie in the news? A quick search through Lexis-Nexis, a research service that tracks the work of the media, found Christie’s name mentioned in 203 transcripts posted from the cable (CNN, Fox and MSNBC) and network (ABC, CBS and NBC) news outlets, plus National Public Radio. CNN led the way with 83 mentions. A simple search of "Chris Christie" and "bridge" also came up in 30 New York Times articles and 27 Washington Post articles, and 778 times in newspapers and wire stories across the country. Clearly, Christie became a national story. He is a well-known figure thought by many to be the GOP frontrunner for the presidential nomination in 2016, and a potential scandal in his administration instantly attracted widespread press attention. But how does that compare to the coverage of Benghazi? It’s tough to put the two controversies side-by-side. The Christie news, which broke under the nose of the New York media, has a clear starting point (when the New Jersey media first reported on it) and climax (Christie’s news conference). The events surrounding Benghazi garnered immediate attention, but had several watershed moments: Obama’s statement from the White House Rose Garden, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice’s news blitz pinning the attacks to an anti-Muslim YouTube video, the presidential debate between Obama and Republican Mitt Romney during which Benghazi was an issue, and the congressional hearings featuring Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, among other events. We decided to focus on the week after the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya, which occurred Sept. 11, 2012. It’s a little bit longer of a time period to track (the Christie news broke mid-week so we have just four days of search results), but stick with us. Using the same news outlets we tracked for Christie, we found 250 transcripts that mentioned "Benghazi." Again, CNN led the way with 100 mentions. There were more than 2,800 stories that contain "Benghazi" in newspapers and wire services, though that also includes international newspapers. Domestically, the New York Times wrote 69 stories and the Washington Post had 49. Mainstream news outlets also gave airtime and space to Republicans who alleged a cover up on the part of the administration. During Oct. 18-25, 2012, when accusations were especially frequent, CNN and MSNBC referred to "Benghazi cover up" a combined 13 times. Benghazi was also competing for airtime against other large national news events, like the presidential election and later Hurricane Sandy. With Congress just returning to town, the scandal in Christie’s office broke during a relatively slow week in politics. How in-depth did they go? So that’s a quantitative breakdown. How about a qualitative analysis? Benghazi was a rare international story in 2012 in that Americans actually cared about it. According to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press, a nonpartisan think tank, 43 percent of the country told pollsters they "closely followed" the attacks in Benghazi. That made it the eighth most followed news event, trailing continued coverage of the economy and the U.S. Supreme Court decision on Obama’s health care law. It was the only international event in the top 10. Another 31 percent said they specifically followed the Libya investigation very closely. That says volumes about how much Americans were exposed to Benghazi reports in the media. And how about how closely media followed the events in Libya? Well, the New York Times, for starters, had three stories the day after the attack, Sept. 12, 2012. And soon they were starting to challenge early reports on what caused the attacks. By Sept. 13, the New York Times reported that there were actually two attacks on the embassy, "the first one spontaneous and the second highly organized and possibly aided by anti-American infiltrators of Libya’s young government." The New York Times did receive criticism from its own ombudsmen, public editor Margaret Sullivan, after the paper did not put on the front page an October congressional hearing on Benghazi. Instead, it was on A3. But after conservatives held up her column as proof of bias in the press, she penned another column on Oct. 20, 2012, stating "it is utterly wrong to say that the Times has ignored or buried the Libya story. As of Friday, editors had placed it on the front page on 18 days out of 38, sometimes with news, sometimes with analysis. The coverage has been extensive, aggressive and sweeping." The New York Times published an extensive investigation into the Benghazi attack last month. CNN was criticized strongly by the Obama administration for its initial coverage of Benghazi while questioning the White House narrative. The news outlet ran a heavily cited story documenting the final days of Ambassador Stevens from witness accounts. And when reporting on scene in Libya, CNN found Stevens’ personal diary and aired excerpts from the journal against the wishes of the U.S. State Department (and Stevens’ family). The network went on to win an award for its coverage of Benghazi. The New York Times and CNN are just singular examples, and there are others. Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of media and politics at University of Mary Washington, said "at the end of the day, the media was an equal opportunity offender." "The coverage of Benghazi was heavy, in part because Republicans made an issue of it," said Farnsworth, author of Spinner in Chief: How Presidents Sell Their Policies and Themselves. "The coverage of the ‘bridgegate,’ if you raise it to the level of a a ‘-gate’ scandal, is a reflection of Christie’s prominence in national politics." Our ruling Rove said that the coverage of Christie pales "in significance" to the coverage of Benghazi. When news of the attacks on Benghazi broke, coverage was widespread, and it continued through congressional hearings. Moreover, a lot of the coverage questioned the administration’s narrative and response to the attacks. Indeed, Christie has occupied much of the conversation, but it was also in a relatively slow news week. Benghazi garnered significant coverage, even during the height of the presidential election. Perhaps the outcome of those reports didn’t unearth the conspiracy conservatives alleged and hoped for. More is still likely to come out, and Republicans continue to keep it in the news. But to insinuate the mainstream media ignored the attacks while putting Christie through the ringer goes too far. We rate Rove’s statement False.

pomt-13279	Says Deborah Ross "supports the Iran nuclear deal and the ransom it paid for hostages."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/oct/12/john-bolton-superpac/attack-ad-gets-deborah-ross-stance-iran-nuclear-de/	North Carolina’s incumbent senator, Republican Richard Burr, is facing a closer-than-expected re-election campaign against Democratic challenger Deborah Ross. Now a national conservative group is coming to Burr’s aid, with a $1 million ad campaign that criticizes Ross’ views on foreign policy and national security. "Now she supports the Iran nuclear deal and the ransom it paid for hostages, despite it being bad for America," the ad says. It was paid for by the John Bolton SuperPAC, run by the former U.N. ambassador and Republican political advisor John Bolton. Burr is the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and has had several prominent moments in that position. He helped lead the government’s fight against Apple to try to make the company unlock the phones used by the terrorists in the San Bernardino attack last year. He also spearheaded efforts to keep a report on the CIA’s torture program out of the public eye, calling it politically motivated. Ross has no foreign policy experience. She was formerly a state legislator and executive director of the North Carolina ACLU. The new ad campaign attempts to tie her to the policies of the Obama administration. But is it true that Ross supports "the Iran nuclear deal and the ransom it paid for hostages" like the ad claims? A refresher on the Iran deal The nuclear deal was an exchange: Iran would give up its aspirations for a nuclear weapon, and in return the international community would lift many of the economic sanctions on the country. We’ve previously written summaries of both the negotiations and the technical details of the deal and its enforcement. It can be a tricky subject to talk about, and claims on both sides often lack nuance. Burr previously received a Half True for his claim that Obama and Hillary Clinton were "responsible for leading America into a deal that will arm Iran." And for a more complete picture on the billions of dollars Iran will receive via the deal – largely coming from overseas bank accounts that had previously been frozen – and whether that money could be put toward terrorism, see this Half True claim from Rudy Giuliani. Support for the deal? Ross does say she supports the nuclear deal, although she adds a caveat. "In the future, the U.S. should extend Iranian sanctions and consider increasing them to stop Iran from financing terrorism around the globe," Ross says on the foreign policy section of her website. This position seems to be contradictory, since the main part of the deal was to remove many sanctions from the country. So does she support it or not? Experts told us that while Ross’ two sentiments seem at odds with one another, they actually aren’t – as long as any new sanctions are added due to Iran’s financing of terrorist groups, like Hezbollah. But it’s a slippery slope. "Iran could pull out of the deal" if the United States adds sanctions for the wrong reason, said Aaron Arnold, an international affairs expert at Harvard University. According to Jim Walsh, who leads the Security Studies Program at MIT: "If Iran does something new and egregious that warrants new sanctions, the U.S. has every right under the deal to respond any way it wants, including sanctions. But if this is just, ‘I hate Iran so we should have more sanctions,’ that is an agreement killer." Duke University professor Peter Feaver referred to Ross’ support of both the Iran deal and extra sanctions as "tip-toeing through a minefield." Feaver worked in defense policy under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He said Ross’ seemingly contradictory position is technically possible since the deal had to allow the possibility for future American sanctions in order to survive Congress. Republicans have tried to pass legislation killing the deal but don’t have enough votes in the Senate. "While in practice those objectives have been in tension with each other, increasingly so as the Obama Administration resorts to ever more desperate measures to prop up the Iran deal, they are not fundamentally at odds," Feaver said. Prisoners and ransom? So Ross supports the Iran nuclear deal, even with the caveat that she also supports new sanctions on Iran. But what about her support for "ransom" payments? PolitiFact has previously looked into whether the $400 million the United States sent to Iran, shortly before several Americans were freed in January, was actually a ransom. We ruled that Mostly False. It was the first part of a $1.7 billion settlement the U.S. agreed to pay in an international arbitration tribunal, related to a failed 1979 arms deal. Yet at the same time, U.S. officials have acknowledged they withheld the money until they were sure that five Americans held in Iranian jails had been released. That previous fact check concluded that, "While some in the national security community might consider the transaction unsavory, ineffectual, or legally questionable, calling it ‘ransom’ isn’t quite accurate." Whatever the appropriate phrase for that payment, Deborah Ross has clearly said she does not support it. She said as much in a TV interview earlier this month, and in a paper outlining her foreign policy positions. "The United States government should not pay Tehran for the return of American prisoners," Ross wrote. So we asked Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the PAC, if there were examples of Ross saying anything that could back up the ad’s claim. Marquis didn’t point to any examples, but he said that doesn’t matter. "You can’t have one without the other," he said. "Of course she’s not going to say she’s for ransom payments. But she supports the Iran deal which included the payment. It seems that Ross is trying to have her cake and eat it too." However, several legal experts we spoke with said it’s not necessarily true that the payment was part of the Iran deal. Eric Lorber, a terrorism financing expert and senior associate with the Financial Integrity Network consulting firm, testified before Congress last month regarding the payment. He said in an interview the timing had more to do with the release of the prisoners than with the implementation of the nuclear deal, even though all three happened around the same time. "The bottom line is that the payment wasn't part of the nuclear deal," he said. Our ruling A new ad attacking Richard Burr’s challenger Deborah Ross says Ross "supports the Iran nuclear deal and the ransom it paid for hostages." Ross does support the nuclear deal. She does not support "ransom" payments for American prisoners. The group behind the ad said she can’t support the Iran deal and also oppose the payment, arguing that the payment was part of the deal, but experts say that isn’t correct. Since the ad gets one part right and one part wrong, we rate this claim Half True. Correction: The payment from the U.S. to Iran was agreed to in a settlement in an international tribunal. It was not from an order from that tribunal. This correction does not change our ruling. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/80b12778-8fbb-4312-8585-24c71767571e	None	John Bolton SuperPAC	None	None	None	2016-10-12T11:58:42	2016-09-27	['Iran']

pomt-05442	In the "Obama economy ... the youth unemployment rate is double the unemployment rate for all Americans."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/26/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-youth-unemployment-rate-double-wh/	For the third time in recent weeks, Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign has released an "infographic" that criticizes President Barack Obama’s jobs record for key demographic groups. First came women, then Hispanics, and now youth. One of its claims got our attention: "The youth unemployment rate is double the unemployment rate for all Americans." The graphic goes on to say that the unemployment rate is 8.2 percent overall and 16.4 percent for youth. When we looked at data compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that these numbers referred to the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for Americans 16 years and older (the category the graphic calls "all") and ages 16 to 24 (the category it calls "youth"). We confirmed that those numbers are correct. However, we wondered the 2-to-1 ratio was unique to Obama. It’s not. Not by a long shot. We downloaded historical BLS unemployment rate data for the two age ranges, then divided the "all" number by the "youth" number. Going back to January 2001, the month President George W. Bush took office, the ratio of the two unemployment rates has been remarkably consistent. Over that 135-month period, the ratio has barely budged, ranging only from 1.9 to 2.4. That’s essentially the same 2-to-1 ratio that the Romney graphic used to criticize Obama’s record on youth jobs. In other words, the two statistics essentially move in lockstep, regardless of whether the broader job market is in a period of modest growth, general stability or precipitous decline. In fact, if you average together all the monthly ratios under Obama, it’s lower than it was under Bush. The average ratio under Obama was 1.9, compared to 2.2 under Bush. While it’s accurate to say the two unemployment figures are in a 2-to-1 ratio today, "it’s a meaningless, or perhaps misleading, statistic for people who are unaware that the youth unemployment rate is always well above the unemployment rate of people 25 and older," said Gary Burtless, a labor and employment economist at the Brookings Institution. (Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) Romney does have a point that younger Americans are suffering during the current recession. We found that in January 2008 -- a year before Obama took office and right after the most recent recession began -- the unemployment rate for Americans 16 to 24 years of age was 11.7 percent. By January 2009, that had surged to 14.9 percent, and it surged again by January 2010 to 18.7 percent. By January 2011, it had begun to recover, dropping to 17.9 percent and falling again by January 2012 to 16.0 percent. So the unemployment rate has recovered from its high point under Obama, but it’s still significantly above its pre-recession level. Our ruling Romney has a point that young Americans are hurting in today’s job market. There’s no question that employment prospects have dried up for many recent high-school and college graduates. But bolstering this argument by making the claim that the "youth unemployment rate is double the unemployment rate for all Americans" is silly, since that's consistently been the case under both President George W. Bush and Obama. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-04-26T15:27:55	2012-04-24	['Barack_Obama', 'United_States']
pomt-05115	"The median income in America has dropped by 10 percent in the last four years."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/27/mitt-romney/romney-says-median-income-has-dropped-10-percent-l/	Milking an opponent’s mistake is a campaign staple, especially if you happen to be a presidential candidate visiting the Dairy State. During his June 18, 2012, trip to Janesville, presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney again mocked President Barack Obama’s recent declaration that the private sector is "doing fine." And he used a recycled line to make his case that Obama was dead wrong in his perception. "The median income in America has dropped by 10 percent in the last four years," Romney told a sweat-drenched crowd at a manufacturing plant, "even as gasoline prices have doubled and the prices on many things we buy have gone up and up and up." Romney used the same line about falling incomes in a GOP presidential debate on January 23, 2012. It earned a Half True from PolitiFact National, which said the numbers were outdated by six months, somewhat off the mark and from a respected but unproven data-analysis firm. We wondered what the numbers look like now, with another 10 months in the books. In this case, we’ll look only at the income trend, not to what degree Obama is to blame for any decline. In Janesville, Romney surely was out to criticize Obama, but his remarks show it was more for being out of touch than saying he was responsible for creating the problem. The gold standard of income data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey -- Annual Social and Economic Supplements. But it is generated only once a year, so it is not very timely. The 2011 data is not out yet. More on that later. In both instances, Romney turned to household income figures generated by a private economic research agency, Maryland-based Sentier Research. The firm uses other Census Bureau income data that is released monthly and adjusts it to provide a more timely look at income trends. Its reports have become widely quoted in media accounts. In January, and again in Janesville, Romney said he was comparing changes in the "last four years," which takes us to different periods in the George W. Bush presidency as the starting point. We examined Sentier’s reports from April 2008 to April 2012, the latest available from the firm at the time of Romney’s speech. The inflation-adjusted median household income declined 8.3 percent when comparing those two points in time, a decline of $4,596 per household. So by the latest numbers in the report Romney used, he’s in the ballpark but off more than a percentage point. Case closed? Not quite. Romney’s campaign told us relied on a reference to earlier Sentier research that was highlighted in an April 30, 2012, Bloomberg news report. That piece referred to February 2012 data from Sentier showing a 9.7 percent drop compared with the same month in 2008. The big swing in just a couple months is not unusual in the month-to-month data. So, as in the presidential debate reference, Romney was very close using outdated data, but high compared to the latest data available when he spoke. Either way, according to the Sentier data, the income trend has gone the wrong direction in the last four years. Median household incomes move up and down, but overall trended sharply downward during Obama’s first two and a half years before recovering somewhat since summer 2011, according to the firm’s index. The more standard source of income statistics, the annual Census Bureau data, has figures only through 2010 because 2011 is not out yet. That survey asks people in the spring what they earned for the previous calendar year. Using that annual data for a four-year comparison going back to 2007, incomes declined 6.4 percent from 2007 to 2010. Because the reference periods are different, the trends identified by the annual census data can’t really be compared directly to monthly census data that Sentier uses. PolitiFact National has examined in detail the data source that Romney uses, Sentier Research. The firm is run by two retired Census Bureau officials (one of whom, Gordon Green, directed the income statistics program) whose work has been cited in many national news publications. Sentier’s client list has included major government clients and think tanks on both sides of the ideological spectrum. Economists have said the Sentier-created income index fills a knowledge gap in a timely way, but still has to stand the test of time. Our rating Romney chided Obama for being out of touch, saying that median household incomes have fallen 10 percent. He uses data from a reputable private firm that used census data to create a new income index. At one point in Obama’s term incomes were down about 10 percent from four years earlier, but the decline is now closer to 8 percent, based on the firm’s data. Romney continues to use the outdated figure, making the decline sound somewhat larger than it is. We’ll stick with the Half True rating he received in January, based on the Truth-O-Meter definition of a claim that is "partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."

pomt-06424	Every month since 9/11, there have been as many suicide attacks against the United States and its allies as there were in all the years leading up to 9/11.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/24/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-terror-attacks-have-increased/	Rep. Ron Paul, R-Tex., has made a name for himself by railing against federal government overreach. After remarks at Politics & Eggs, a popular political forum in Manchester, N.H., one Granite Stater in attendance asked Paul to describe his foreign policy position. Again, Paul mentioned federal government intervention, this time our behavior as "policeman of the world." That activity, according to Paul, has cost America money, safety and created foreign enemies in the process. Paul cited the animosity that our foreign entanglements have created, comparing suicide attacks against the U.S. and its allies before and after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. "Suicide terrorism has been around for awhile," Paul said. "There was a bit of it before 9/11, obviously, but if you look at all the suicide terrorist attacks prior to 9/11, if you equate that number, it’s equivalent to the attacks on us and our allies every month, compared to all the years before 9/11, which means that we’re under systematic attack." Really? As many per month as all the years before? His campaign e-mailed us a list of articles and news stories before 9/11 with a list of four al-Qaeda plots and attacks against the U.S., including its embassies, before 9/11. Not all of the incidents listed were suicide attacks (the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center) or even carried out (the thwarted Bojinka plot in 1994). The list of attacks post-9/11 provided by Paul’s campaign included 30 or more al-Qaeda actions against U.S. troops, foreign citizens working for the Defense Department, attacks in foreign nations in which Western tourists — including Americans — were killed, and suicide attacks carried out against U.S. allies, including Israel, Great Britain and Australia. The links ranged from October 2002 to January 2011, but the incidents were sporadic and not monthly. So what Paul's office provided didn't square with what Paul had said. When we tried to get additional information, Paul’s campaign did not respond. We decided to look for additional resources for a more accurate listing of the suicide attacks that have occurred against America and its allies before and after 9/11. The University of Chicago’s Project on Security and Terrorism (CPOST), features a database of all suicide attacks from 1981 to 2011, which includes the location of attacks, the target type, the weapon used, as well as information on the demographic and general biographical characteristics of the suicide attackers. The database, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense since 2004, according to Robert A. Pape, Professor and Director of the CPOST project, uses 1981-2011 as parameters because that's when suicide missions as they are understood today began. "It goes back to the early ‘80s because that’s when suicide attack really begins," said Pape, who is also the author of Cutting the Fuse: The Explosion of Global Suicide Terrorism and How to Stop It. "Before that you have people who kill themselves to avoid capture -- that’s different than killing yourself to kill someone else. Then you have the Kamikazes in World War II. …But in terms of the modern phenomenon – it goes back to the early ‘80s." Because Paul’s campaign specified al-Qaeda as attackers in their lists of sources, we searched the CPOST database for its category "al-Qaeda vs. U.S. & Allies" suicide campaigns from 1981-2011. Pape said CPOST means by that category, "Americans and those working with or for Americans." The database revealed al-Qaeda carried out 42 suicide missions against the U.S. and its allies from 1981-2011. Four were prior to 9/11, in 1995, 1996, 1998 and 2000. After Sept. 11, 2001, there were 37 suicide attacks. With 37 suicide attacks in the 121 months post-9/11, clearly there are some months with no attacks. In the months when attacks occurred, they numbered from one to three a month. The maximum number occurred twice: in April 2007 and January 2011. So the monthly levels of al-Qaeda attacks post-9/11 is not equivalent to all the suicide attacks on the U.S. and its allies that predated that date. But since Paul’s campaign provided a list that was broader than just suicide attacks by al-Qaeda — some of them were not suicide attacks, and others, foiled plots — we figured they might have also misinterpreted which group Paul meant in his remarks. Paul didn’t actually identify a specific group. We decided to see how the data compared if we searched all suicide attacks committed against the U.S. and allies before and after 9/11 — not limited to al-Qaeda attacks, but also those carried out by Afghani rebels, Hezbollah, Iraqi rebels, Pakistani militants and Uzbek rebels. With expanded parameters, the database revealed 1,844 suicide attacks against the U.S. and its allies —10 of which happened before 9/11. The 1,833 suicide attacks in the months following 9/11, from the end of 2001 into 2011, occurred from once a month (Nov. 2002) to 48 times (July 2007). We posed Paul’s claim to Pape. He said the number of suicide attacks committed against Americans and their Allies each month after 9/11 is substantially greater than the years before. "What happens is, the more we put troops overseas, the more we’ve had this explosion of anti-American inspired suicide terrorism. "A good way to think about that, the year before 9/11, the year 2000, there was one suicide attack against the USS Cole that was anti-American inspired and killed US troops abroad," Pape said. "Last year, there were nearly 300 suicide attacks around the world, about 270 of them were anti-American inspired -- that is, against Americans or people working with or for Americans." "Even when they’re attacking Muslims, they’re very often attacking people directly for America." "We have troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, then on the border of Pakistan, that’s where the hotbeds of suicide terrorism are. They’re not happening in Bangladesh. The real hotbeds of suicide terrorism are exactly where we put the troops after we put the troops there, not before. …There was no suicide terrorism in Iraq period until we put our troops there." We asked Pape if it was accurate to say that "each month" suicide attacks against Americans and their allies are "equivalent" to the total that occurred before 9/11. "Each month -- that would probably be about right," Pape said. "It’s going to vary month to month, and the year 2000 is a good proxy for before 9/11. … If anything, he’s still sort of under-counting." To be certain, PolitiFact went through each the 1,833 suicide attacks that have occurred against the U.S. and its allies in the months since 9/11, tallied up the number of incidents each month since the tragedy, and found the median. The median was 18 suicide attacks per month—more than the 10 total suicide attacks against the US and Allies CPOST cited before Sept. 11, 2001. So, like Pape said, Paul actually is under-counting when he suggests that the number of suicide attacks against the U.S. and its Allies each month is equivalent to the total attacks before Sept. 11. "It’s overwhelmingly born out by the data, the truth is we just don’t like to hear this," Pape said. "(Paul) is just pointing out an inconvenient fact." Pape said the suicide attacks of more recent years contain the significant months to compare. "In recent years, it’s more like the difference is between 10-25 (suicide attacks a month) around the world," Pape said. "In Afghanistan and much less now in Iraq, as we’ve pulled our troops out, the suicide attacks are falling like a rock." Our ruling: Whether Paul meant al-Qaeda suicide attacks only, or all groups who have executed suicide campaigns against the U.S. and its allies, was unclear. Either way, the number of suicide attacks against the U.S. and its allies since 9/11 is not "equivalent" to the total before 9/11. The average number each month is actually greater than the total number that predated that day, so Paul is actually understating the magnitude. And the data support his underlying point that the number of attacks since Sept. 11, 2011, has grown. We rate Paul's claim Mostly True.

pomt-13526	Says GOP U.S. Senate candidate Darryl Glenn "wants to eliminate the Department of Education" and jeopardize college funding for 320,000 Coloradans.	true	/colorado/statements/2016/aug/31/colorado-democratic-party/colorado-dems-say-darryl-glenn-wants-eliminate-dep/	The Colorado Democratic Party says Republican U.S. Senate candidate Darryl Glenn wants to eliminate the Education Department and "jeopardize" federal student funding for more than 300,000 Coloradans. "Darryl Glenn as a United States senator would be no friend to students," Chris Meagher, spokesman for the Colorado Democratic Party, said in a news release. "Glenn wants to eliminate the Department of Education and jeopardize Pell Grants and federal student loans for 320,000 Coloradans. He opposes student loan forgiveness programs and even believes the government has no responsibility to help curb the rising costs of a college education." The state Democratic Party took its message to events at Colorado State University and the University of Colorado in Boulder. Republicans have called for abolishing the federal Education Department since President Ronald Reagan vowed to do so in his 1980 presidential campaign. The department was created in 1867 but did not become a Cabinet-level agency until 1980. It "establishes policy for, administers and coordinates most federal assistance to education," according to the department website. President Barack Obama has requested a $69.4 billion department budget for fiscal year 2017. The agency's kindergarten-through-12th grade programs annually serve about 50 million students attending more than 98,000 public schools and 28,000 private schools. Department programs also provide grant, loan, and work-study assistance to more than 13 million students attending college and other postsecondary programs. We wanted to fact-check this statement by the state Democratic Party: "(Darryl) Glenn wants to eliminate the Education Department and jeopardize Pell Grants and federal student loans for 320,000 Coloradans." The Colorado Department of Higher Education, the agency that oversees the state’s public university and college system, confirms that nearly 324,000 people in the state received federal student aid in fiscal year 2015. State students received a total of $1.4 billion in federal student aid. We asked the Democratic Party for information supporting the claim about Glenn’s intentions for the Education Department and federal grants and loans. Meagher pointed to responses Glenn made to a candidate survey for the Denver Post’s June Voter Guide. Asked what significant spending cuts he would support to balance the budget and reduce the annual deficit, Glenn replied in part: "I support the elimination and defunding of all agencies like the Education and Energy Departments because they fall outside of the framework of the Constitution." "Does the federal government have a responsibility to help with student debt, and what ideas do you think would make a difference?" the Post asked. "No," Glenn said. "There is no constitutional basis for the federal government to be mandated to assist with student debt. Better educating our college students on the risks of high student debt and helping them to find alternatives to taking out student loans would help make the difference to their financial future." Glenn put his position a little differently on his campaign website, saying he puts more stock in parents managing students’ financial burdens than the federal government. "I'm not talking about cutting one dime out of education. I’m talking about who is in charge," Glenn wrote. "I trust Colorado families and teachers way more than I trust D.C. central planners who think they know better than parents do." Glenn says instead of sending millions of dollars to the Education Department, "I believe those dollars should be returned to Colorado so parents, teachers and superintendents have the freedom to make choices and direct the education of their kids." Glenn campaign spokeswoman Katey Price told PolitiFact, "Eliminating the Department of Education doesn't mean cutting education; it means returning all those dollars back to the states. These things aren’t in conflict." How would it work? Glenn has not said how the federal funding should be "returned" to Colorado parents and local school districts. For example, would state government administer the funding? Price also did not elaborate. An expert on student financial aid systems said state-run programs lack the federal government’s ability to leverage better interest rates for students. "What the federal government does when it makes student loans is to use its size to get lower rates than states and MUCH lower than students are able to get on unsecured loans," Robert Shireman, a former deputy undersecretary in the Department of Education for the Obama administration, said in an email to PolitiFact. Shireman was the architect of a 2010 financial aid overhaul by the Obama administration and Congress, which had the federal government lend directly to students -- eliminating the government-subsidized private sector loan program. "While there have been state loan programs, they tend to be small and usually lack helpful protections like income-based repayment (which is possible because the federal government has income information through the IRS)," added Shireman, who is now a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a left-leaning think tank. The New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority, the largest state-based program in the nation, has become a symbol of the pitfalls of state loan programs. A ProPublica and New York Times investigation found the New Jersey program charged higher interest rates than similar federal programs and, in disputes, the state aggressively uses lawsuits against borrowers along with its power to garnish wages, seize state income tax refunds, revoke professional licenses and even take away lottery winnings. A 2015 story titled, "What Happens If We Abolish the Department of Education?" by the New America think tank, said eliminating the department and its student aid funding would likely lead to the closure of some private schools and community colleges and a decrease in the number of people going to college. The story said it would also increase the number of people seeking to attend state schools, and likely require a jump in state taxes to support public colleges and universities. Our Ruling The Colorado Democratic Party said Darryl Glenn "wants to eliminate the Department of Education and jeopardize Pell Grants and federal student loans for 320,000 Coloradans." Glenn has acknowledged he wants to abolish and defund the department, adding "there is no constitutional basis for the federal government to be mandated to assist with student debt." He said he wants the federal education department’s funding to be "returned to Colorado so parents, teachers and superintendents have the freedom to make choices and direct the education of their kids." But he doesn’t propose an alternative, such as an organization to administer a state loan program.

pomt-09476	"The Republicans have repeatedly said that they agree with 80 percent of what's in our bill."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/01/debbie-wasserman-schultz/wasserman-schultz-says-republicans-regularly-say-t/	On the Feb. 28, 2010, edition of NBC's Meet the Press, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., urged congressional Republicans to join negotiations over a health care bill, citing what she said were their own past statements about the health care reform process. "The Republicans have repeatedly said that they agree with 80 percent of what's in our bill," she said. "And, at the end of the day, what we need to do is sit down and negotiate over the differences on the 20 percent. The Republicans right now are focused all about regaining power. They don't have any interest in us accomplishing comprehensive health care reform. That's been evident. There isn't anyone that is saying, 'Come on, let's just work this out.' What they're saying is, 'Start over.' 'Start over,' the American people understand, means, 'Do nothing.' " The part that caught our eye was her claim that "Republicans have repeatedly said that they agree with 80 percent of what's in our bill." We wish we could have tested whether there actually is 80 percent agreement between the parties on health care, but we couldn't think of a way to pull it off. So we'll do the next best thing and see whether Wasserman Schultz is correct that Republicans have made this argument repeatedly. Wasserman Schultz is in good Democratic company in making a claim of wide bipartisan agreement on health care. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., once put the level of agreement at 90 percent, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., put the figure at "at least 80, 85 percent." Most notably, President Barack Obama used the figure near the close of his Sept. 9, 2009, health care address to Congress, saying that "there is agreement in this chamber on about 80 percent of what needs to be done, putting us closer to the goal of reform than we have ever been." We can see why Democrats seeking to pass a health care bill would like to play up the common ground they share with their political rivals. But what about Republicans? Using Lexis-Nexis and Google, we looked through news coverage, transcripts and news releases to see if Republicans had indeed invoked the 80 percent figure with any frequency. We'll start with a caveat. Wasserman Schultz referred to agreeing "with 80 percent of what's in our bill." To some, that suggests she's referring to the bill in her own chamber, the House. In the examples we found, it's sometimes hard to tell which of the various Democratic proposals a speaker is referring to. But we do think that Wasserman Schultz could just as easily have been speaking as a Democrat, rather than a House member, when she used the term "our" bill. So we'll note two instances -- the first two listed below -- that fit the strict definition of referring to the House bill after passage, as well as four others in which Republicans were talking about Democratic bills more generally. • Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La. Boustany -- a physician who was tapped by Republicans to deliver the response to President Barack Obama's Sep. 9, 2009, address to Congress on health care -- issued a news release on Feb. 25, 2010, after the conclusion of the president's Blair House health care summit, which Boustany attended as a delegate. In the statement, Boustany said, "Most Democrats, Independents and Republicans do agree on 80 percent of the solutions to bring down health care costs, but these bills focus where we disagree. Rather, we should scrap these bills, like the American people want us to, and focus on bringing down health costs. As a doctor, I know people want to buy insurance across state lines, pool together to get a better price and limit frivolous lawsuits -- all of these will lower costs, and they can be done in a simple way. Unfortunately, Democrats' 2,000-plus page bills complicate health care instead of lowering costs when families struggle to make ends meet." • Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-Ohio. On Jan. 21, 2010, LaTourette, an eight-term House member, took to the House floor and said, "Let's get a bill. Let's get something done on the 80 percent that we can agree about. We can fight for the rest of the couple years on the 20 percent we don't. But let's get something done for the American people." • Gov. Haley Barbour, R-Miss. On the Nov. 8, 2009, edition of Meet the Press, two politicians -- Barbour and Gov. Ed Rendell, D-Pa. -- both cited the 80 percent. Taking his cue from Rendell, who first cited the percentage, host David Gregory asked Barbour whether it's "a problem, politically, for Republicans to be the party of 'No'" on a health care bill. Barbour responded, "Well, I think, first of all, most people in America don't want this. So to be the people that defeat it will be popular. But Ed said something very important -- 60 percent, 80 percent of the things that we talk about in health care could have passed the House last night 400 to 20. But instead the (Democratic) leadership chose not to stop there but to try to cram down the country's throat a government-run health care system that CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, says it's going to drive up health insurance premiums. ... Yes, we could have a very good health care reform bill that will pass overwhelmingly, but about 10 things in here wouldn't be included." • Wisconsin Republican Party. On Oct. 9, 2009, the Wisconsin Republican Party issued a press release titled, "The Truth About Democrat's (sic) Health Care Experiment." The release said in part, "Both parties agree on 80 percent of these common-sense health care reforms and these ideas could quickly pass if Democrats began working with Republicans on these issues." • Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Cornyn -- a member of the Senate Republican leadership -- said the following on the Sept. 13, 2009, edition of Meet the Press -- and then sent out a news release touting his comments. "I would suggest," Cornyn said, "that this is a case where the 80/20 rule applies -- that 80 percent of this we could probably agree with, as long as people would agree to leave the 20 percent we can't agree with out." • Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. On June 11, 2009, several Republican senators held a news conference on health care. Enzi, the top Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, was asked by a reporter, "Senator, you often speak of an 80-20 rule, that if people can agree on the 80 percent, then you -- (off mike). What's the 80 percent that you could see agreement on?" Enzi acknowledged that the bill emerging from his committee was "very complicated. ... So if I tried to point out what the 80 percent is, it would take me a real long time. But there is 80 percent there that we can have agreement on." It's important to note that some think the notion that the parties agree on 80 percent is bunk. "I don't know what that number means. I have no idea how you'd calculate something like that," said Senate Budget Chairman Kent Conrad, D-N.D., according to a McClatchy Newspapers column by David Lightman that was titled: "80 percent agreement on health care? No way that's true." Lightman also quoted Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, saying, "I don't see it," and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, joking, "Most of the 80 percent doesn't involve money." Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., also pointed out a small but potentially significant difference in wording. "Republicans and Democrats probably agree on what 80 percent of the problems are with health care -- but those problems and various solutions are entirely different than agreeing on 80 percent of a bill, especially one to the size, scope and costs that Democrats keep trying to force," Dayspring said. He suggested, for instance, that both parties may agree on the need to address pre-existing conditions, to improve access to insurance for small businesses, and to reduce costs. "Even though there are differences as to the precise remedy or method of the solution, these are issues that could probably be worked out," Dayspring said. "Unfortunately, Democrats ... are fixated on the 20 percent where there will never be agreement, namely a much more expansive government role." Wasserman Schultz is correct that Republicans have been using the "80 percent" talking point. We found at least six examples in which Republicans used it, several in high-profile settings, including two tapings of Meet the Press and a televised House floor speech. But it's unclear in many of those instances what precisely the Republicans are referring to. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-12025	Says "92 percent of the people agree on DACA."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/18/donald-trump/president-donald-trumps-half-true-claim-support-da/	President Donald Trump has questioned why undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children should be deported, a sharp departure from the campaign when he advocated for the removal of all who were violating immigration laws. Trump’s administration is phasing out Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation. At the same time, Trump wants Congress to pass a permanent solution for the so-called "Dreamers," saying the idea has very high support among Americans. (DACA recipients are commonly called "Dreamers.") "Look, 92 percent of the people agree on DACA, but what we want is we want very, very powerful border security," Trump said Sept. 14 before traveling from Washington to meet with Floridians affected by Hurricane Irma. He said Republican congressional leaders were also on board. Later in Florida, he said they were not looking at amnesty or citizenship, but "looking at allowing people to stay here." If and when funding for Trump’s border wall will come or what will be part of a DACA deal is still unclear. For now, we were curious about Trump’s claim that 92 percent of people agree on a solution for DACA recipients. We did not find a poll showing support that high, but several polls do show that the majority of Americans want a favorable outcome for Dreamers. The White House declined to comment for this fact-check. Public opinion on DACA We found several polls that asked about DACA and showed majority support for not deporting Dreamers. But we did not find nearly universal support that Trump described. • A Morning Consult and Politico poll conducted between Sept. 7-11, after the Trump administration announced it was eliminating DACA, found that of 1,976 registered voters polled, 45 percent said it was the wrong thing to do; 35 percent said it was the right thing to do; 20 percent did not know or had no opinion. Asked about the issue in a different way — "When it comes to legislation regarding Dreamers, which of the following would you most like Congress to pass?" — 54 percent of respondents said they would want legislation that allowed Dreamers to stay and become citizens if they met certain requirements; 19 percent favored legislation that would allow them to stay legally but not become citizens, if they met certain requirements; 12 percent wanted legislation that removes or deports them; and 15 percent did not know or had no opinion. So, for this second question, 73 percent favored legislation that would protect Dreamers from deportation. A previous Morning Consult and Politico poll, conducted from April 20-24 asked about 2,000 registered voters what they thought was the best way to handle Dreamers. Fifty-six percent said they should be allowed to stay and become citizens if they met certain requirements, and 22 percent favored allowing them to stay and become legal residents, but not citizens, if they met certain requirements. Overall, 78 percent definitely did not want Dreamers to be deported. • An NBC News and SurveyMonkey poll, conducted online from August 24-29 among a national sample of 10,129 adults, found 64 percent support for DACA. • A Sept. 3-5 poll from The Economist and YouGov of 1,500 U.S. adults also found that 55 percent of responders somewhat or strongly supported DACA, though support for the program was lower among Trump voters and Republicans. Several polling and public opinion experts we reached out to say they were not aware of any recent poll showing a 92 percent support for DACA, but that a solid majority does seem to favor the program. Our ruling Trump said "92 percent of the people agree on DACA." We found several polls in which a majority of people said they supported DACA or favored legislation that would allow Dreamers to stay in the United States. But the level of support was not as high as 92 percent. Overall, we rate Trump’s statement Half True.

pomt-11446	Says Richard Cordray directed an Ohio commission to "permit an armed group to have a rally on the statehouse grounds, even taking the extraordinary step of assuming personal responsibility for waiving an insurance requirement in the event of an incident."	true	/ohio/statements/2018/mar/13/dennis-kucinich/richard-cordray-helped-pro-gun-group-get-go-ahead-/	In a speech after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., Dennis Kucinich said fellow Democrat Richard Cordray ran his attorney general’s office as "an extension of the NRA." That included Cordray helping a gun rights group hold a rally outside of the statehouse, Kucinich said in a Feb. 27 speech to the City Club in Cleveland. Kucinich has vowed to make guns a key topic as he competes with Democrats, including Cordray, in the May 8 primary for governor. "One unpublicized official act was a very unusual intervention with the Capitol Square Commission," Kucinich said. "As the commission’s attorney, the attorney general directed it to permit an armed group to have a rally on the statehouse grounds, even taking the extraordinary step of assuming personal responsibility for waiving an insurance requirement in the event of an incident." Our fact-checking ears perked up with an "unpublicized official act," so we went in search of the facts about Cordray’s actions related to a 2010 gun-rights rally. Cordray’s actions related to a 2010 gun rights rally Kucinich was referring to the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board, which oversees the statehouse in Columbus. The Attorney General’s office serves as legal counsel to the board. Although he has shown support for some gun control measures after the Parkland shooting, Cordray has had strong support in the past from gun rights groups. Kucinich was talking about a rally organized by Ohioans for Concealed Carry. The event was part of a national wave of marches leading up to the national Second Amendment March in Washington in April 2010. Kucinich’s campaign website linked to a YouTube video clip posted by Progress Ohio, a liberal group, showing about 10 minutes of the April 10, 2010, rally. The clip starts with Dan White, who was active with Ohioans for Concealed Carry, saying: "I’m not lying, if it wasn’t for them I don’t think we would be on the square right now today. They were instrumental. They did their jobs very well." Cordray, as attorney general, then followed: "Thank you, Dan. So as he said, I’m counting on all of you because if there are any troubles it's my responsibility, but I am comfortable with that. I’m pleased to be here today at this Second Amendment rally." Months later while speaking at an Ohioans for Concealed Carry rally in August 2010, Cordray recounted the difficulties in pulling off the April rally. The Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board was "very unhappy and resistant" about the planned rally, Cordray said. "In the end, after having no real leg to stand on and denying a permit, they decided at the last minute they were going to require some giant insurance policy to have to be obtained for people to be able to have a rally on the statehouse grounds," Cordray said. Cordray said he spoke with board chair Richard Finan and asked, "Look, you don’t require this of other groups, why would you be requiring this here?" According to Cordray, Finan then asked, "Are you willing to take responsibility?" "And I said, yes, I am willing to take responsibility," Cordray told the group. Finan, who has since retired from the board, told PolitiFact that he recalled Cordray reaching out to him before the rally. "He told us we could go ahead and allow the rally to occur on the statehouse grounds," Finan said. Concealed Carry group exchanged letters with state board We sought records from the board related to the 2010 rally, but a spokesman told us that it only keeps records for four years. However, Jeff Garvas, who organized the 2010 rally and is the president of Ohioans for Concealed Carry, shared with PolitiFact some of his correspondence with the board. Garvas told PolitiFact that his group obtained a permit from the advisory board about eight months before the event. Then, about two weeks before the rally, he said the board told the group that it had to pay for 10 state troopers and promise that no one would show up with a firearm. At some point, the board also told the group that it would have to obtain a half-million dollar insurance policy, he said. (Its special events policy states that the board may require the permit holder to file a certificate of insurance at least seven days prior to the event.) Garvas sent the board’s executive director, William Carleton, a letter raising objections to the firearm ban at the rally. Carleton wrote in an April 10 letter that Garvas had also verbally sought a waiver for the bond requirement and proof of insurance. Carleton granted the waiver as long as the group met certain conditions including holstering firearms and paying $1,000 for five state troopers. Carleton waived the requirement for a bond and proof of insurance. Carleton’s letter doesn’t mention Cordray, but an assistant attorney general was copied on the letter. Cordray’s spokesman Mike Gwin didn’t dispute Kucinich’s statement. Gwin said that the Attorney General’s office "provided legal advice during the course of the permitting process that denying this group a rally permit would likely result in a costly and successful lawsuit by the protest organizers, as had happened with similar denied permits for statehouse rallies in the past." Our ruling Kucinich said Cordray directed an Ohio commission to "permit an armed group to have a rally on the statehouse grounds, even taking the extraordinary step of assuming personal responsibility for waiving an insurance requirement in the event of an incident." Kucinich was referring to a rally held in April 2010. A video shows Cordray speaking at the rally where he said "if there are any troubles it's my responsibility but I am comfortable with that." Months later, in another video, Cordray said that when the Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied a permit and required a "giant insurance policy" Cordray spoke with the board’s president and agreed to take responsibility for the event. Finan, the advisory board chair at the time, told PolitiFact that Cordray gave the go-ahead for the rally. Cordray didn’t appear to play the only role in allowing the group to hold the rally. The executive director of the board ultimately granted the waiver after exchanging communications with Ohioans for Concealed Carry. We rate this claim True.

pomt-04879	"Ninety percent of the topsoil has inadequate moisture to grow crops."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/08/john-kasich/ohio-gov-john-kasich-says-drought-has-left-90-perc/	Ohio Gov. John Kasich may not know much about planting crops, but he knows how to pick an audience. When the GOP governor was looking for a place on July 25 to announce the state's plans to ask the federal government to declare a drought emergency in Ohio, he headed for the Ohio State Fair. Before a farming crowd at the fairgrounds in Columbus, Kasich portrayed the drought's impact in fairly stark terms, calling it "devastating" to Ohio's number one industry. After mentioning that a majority of Ohio's crops are rated either poor or very poor, Kasich asserted that nearly all of the topsoil in Ohio was in terrible shape. "Ninety percent of the topsoil has inadequate moisture to grow crops," Kasich said. While the drought had brought declarations of emergency to more than two dozen states across the country, was the soil in the Buckeye State really in that poor of shape? Or was the governor exaggerating the problem? We slipped on a pair of overalls down at PolitiFact Ohio headquarters and started digging. Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols said the governor's July 25 statement was based on a weekly crop weather report produced by the National Agricultural Statistics Service, which is a branch of the United States Department of Agriculture. The crop weather report for July 23 rated the topsoil moisture in four categories, from short to surplus. The report said that topsoil moisture was rated at 53 percent very short, 37 percent short, 10 percent adequate and zero percent surplus. The report notes that "there has been more rain this week, some areas throughout the state report 1-2 days of rain; however topsoil moisture is still far below normal conditions." Trying to find out more about how the reports are produced, we reached Richard Snead, an agricultural statistician with the Ohio Field Office for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Snead said the soil reports are the average of about 100 weekly reports forwarded from the Farm Service Agency, National Resources Conservation Agency and Ohio State University agricultural extension agents out checking soil conditions in Ohio fields every week. The four categories in the report have specific definitions, with "short" being defined as dry soil where plant growth would be curtailed. Meanwhile, "very short" means growth has been stopped and there are visible signs of stress in the plants, Snead explained. In the very short conditions, the plants would suffer "irreparable damage" if the conditions continued, he said. A check of the weekly reports for three preceding weeks of July show that throughout the month the "very short" and "short" categories combined to account for between 88 and 94 percent of the ratings. That means that the weekly report cited by Kasich clearly was not an aberration. But are the weekly USDA reports the best measurement of soil conditions in Ohio? We checked with one of the leading crop-watchers in the state, Harold Watters, an assistant professor at OSU. "It is dry, and the driest we have been in a very long time, drier than 1988," wrote Watters, an OSU Extension Field Agronomist, in an email response to PolitiFact. Watters said the governor's assessment based on the July 23 report is "pretty close" to accurate. "I read the weekly crop reports and visit fields across western Ohio and am confident they are pretty close," Watters wrote. "We have been well below average on rainfall since very early summer. Does that mean we have inadequate soil moisture to grow a normal crop? Absolutely." In the email, Watters did allow that the reporting process for soil conditions is subjective "so we cannot say they are entirely accurate and people’s emotions get involved when we are under this much stress in the crops across Ohio." So where does that leave our agrarian-minded governor as we harvest our crop of facts? While an argument could be made that the weekly crop weather report shows only that 90 percent of the Ohio topsoil is inadequate to grow "normal" crops, we think it’s clear that’s what Kasich meant in his remarks, even though he didn't use the word normal. We rate his statement True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2012-08-08T06:00:00	2012-07-25	['None']
pomt-12898	"Pads and tampons (are) still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/22/ashley-judd/are-pads-and-tampons-taxed-viagra-and-rogaine-not/	Actress Ashley Judd declared herself a nasty woman at the Women’s March in Washington D.C., referring to President Donald Trump’s comment about Hillary Clinton during the general election campaign. Reciting a poem from 19-year-old Nina Donovan of Tennessee, Judd said she is nasty as in "loud, vulgar and proud" but not as nasty as "racism, fraud, conflict of interest, homophobia, sexual assault, transphobia, white supremacy, misogyny, ignorance, white privilege." "I am not nasty like the combo of Trump and Pence being served up to me in my voting booths. I'm nasty like the battles my grandmothers fought to get me into that voting booth," Judd said. "Tell me, why are pads and tampons still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not?" We’re happy to oblige, because Judd’s claim isn’t fully accurate. (We tried to reach Judd the day after the march but didn't hear back; we'll update this item if we do.) When it comes to sales taxes on purchases, states typically set the rules. Seven states currently exempt tampons, menstrual cups and pads from taxation, the latest of which came into effect Jan. 1, 2017 (Illinois), said sales tax consultant Diane Yetter. Washington D.C.’s exemption, passed in December 2016, is pending congressional approval, and Connecticut's will kick in July 1, 2018. Five states (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon) have no sales tax at all. So, as of Jan. 22, 2017, 38 states and D.C. tax feminine hygiene products. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Because it is a prescription drug, Viagra, an erectile dysfunction medicine, isn’t taxed in any state except Illinois. Rogaine, a product for hair loss, is exempt from taxes in eight states because it is an over-the-counter treatment and doesn’t require a prescription. (Four states have qualified exemptions for nonprescription that Rogaine does not appear to qualify for.) See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We won’t weigh in on whether the disparity between taxation of feminine hygiene and erectile dysfunction drugs is ethical or sexist. But there is context for how that disparity came to exist. Nicole Kaeding, a state tax policy analyst at the free-market oriented Tax Foundation, stressed that the term "tampon tax" is a misnomer because feminine hygiene products are not subject to a specific tax in any state. "There is no more a tampon tax than there is a soap tax, shampoo tax, or toilet paper tax," Kaeding said. As we mentioned, many states do provide exemptions for necessities like food and medicine. (Kaeding and the Tax Analysts’ David Brunori believe these items should be taxed as well.) But "menstruation isn’t considered a disease or illness," said Yetter. "Tampons and pads are often included in the category of grooming and hygiene products." It’s also important to note that tax exemptions apply to broad categories and not any male product explicitly. "You could easily pick a drug that only applies to females, say birth control pills, and those would fall under the same sales tax exemptions as Viagra or Rogaine," said Kaeding. Our ruling Judd said, "Pads and tampons (are) still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not." Most states do tax tampons and pads, but not Viagra. Judd is off the mark for Rogaine, which is taxed in most states. But it’s important to note that these taxes apply to broad categories and are not specific to tampons or Viagra. Birth control, for example, would also be exempt from taxation in most states because it, like Viagra, is a prescription drug. We rate Judd’s claim Half True.

pomt-05571	"Richard Hayne, president and CEO of Urban Outfitters … (is) a supporter of Rick Santorum and donated over $13,000 to him."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/apr/04/facebook-posts/facebook-post-claims-urban-outfitters-ceo-backs-sa/	Somewhere between the pictures of cute Corgi puppies or tucked in with requests to play "Hidden Chronicles" and the 14th not-so-clever Happy Birthday wish for a friend, you might have seen a Facebook post about the CEO of Urban Outfitters -- a man named Richard Hayne. "This is Richard Hayne, president and CEO of Urban Outfitters. He’s also a supporter of Rick Santorum and donated over $13,000 to him. He’s against gay marriage and abortion," says the post, with an attached photo. "His company pulled a pro-gay shirt back in ‘08, they also blatantly ripped off an Etsy designers work, featured a T-shirt for women that said ‘eat less’ and most recently had a card with a ‘tranny’ slur on (it). "He also owns Anthropologie and Free People." Hayne, 64, is indeed the chairman and CEO of Urban Outfitters Inc., a company that owns Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People -- popular stores with locations across the country. Hayne is worth $1.1 billion, according to Forbes. Friends here in Florida who saw the Facebook post asked us to look into the connection between Hayne and Santorum, the former Republican U.S. senator who is running for president. Hayne is from Philadelphia and attended Lehigh University near Allentown. Santorum was elected to the U.S. House to represent a western Pennsylvania district in 1990, then was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994, where he served two terms. The campaign donations Hayne has not contributed to Santorum’s presidential campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tabulates campaign contributions. But Hayne and his wife Margaret have contributed to Santorum and his political action committee in the past. From 1994-2005 the Haynes contributed $13,900 to Santorum or a PAC he started, Fight-PAC, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Margaret Hayne donated $2,400 to Santorum directly and $5,000 to his political committee. Her donations came in 1997 and 1998. Richard Hayne gave $3,500 to Santorum and $3,000 to Fight-PAC. Hayne’s first donation was in October 1994; his last contribution was recorded in May 2005. The donations ended when Santorum lost his Senate seat in 2006 to Democrat Bob Casey Jr. The Haynes, over time, also have contributed to former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican political committee and more recently to Joseph Torsella, a Democrat who briefly ran for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, and Republican Rep. Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania. Hayne’s political stances The record on Hayne’s personal and political beliefs is less clear. For his part, Hayne has tried to avoid the topic. (Santorum is a known opponent of abortion and gay marriage.) In a profile in Philadelphia Weekly from 2003, Hayne was asked about his support for Santorum. He at first denied contributing to Santorum, according to the article. Asked to clarify after being shown proof of his contributions, Hayne said: "I don't want to mislead you. Like many people, I have some affinity for Rick Santorum, and I have problems with some of his positions." The author of the article, Jonathan Valania, then asked where does Santorum's position on homosexuality (Santorum opposes same-sex marriage and has suggested homosexual sex should be illegal) fit in Hayne’s comfort zone? "I'm not going to comment on it," the magazine quoted Hayne as saying. "I have my own opinion, but I am not going to share it. Our job as a business is not to promote a political agenda. That's not what we do. There are all kinds of political views held by my employees. Some would be horrified to learn that we contributed to Santorum's campaign, and others would be fine with it. We openly discuss and joke about our political differences." In a 2007 interview with Philadelphia Magazine, Hayne explained the contributions and support of Santorum this way: "I don't like paying taxes -- is that a sin?" he asks. "I like small government," Hayne said, explaining a libertarian streak. The company, for the record, has not commented on this latest kerfuffle or a similar uproar started in 2011 by a tweet from pop-star Miley Cyrus. Snopes.com failed to turn up anything additional on Hayne’s political positions, though they do a fine job in explaining the rest of the Facebook post if you’re looking to read more. Our ruling We’re focusing here on the Facebook claim that Urban Outfitters CEO Richard Hayne is a supporter of Rick Santorum and donated over $13,000 to him. What we know is that Hayne was at one time a supporter of Santorum, who donated -- between him and his wife -- more than $13,000 to Santorum and one of his political action committees. Hayne has not contributed to Santorum’s run for president, and we do not know if Hayne is supporting Santorum this time around. That, combined with the fact that the donations are nearly 7-18 years old, is enough for us to rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06495	The poverty rate for families in which a husband and a wife work is 5 percent, but in families headed by one person … "it's 30 percent today."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/13/rick-santorum/rick-santorum/	Rick Santorum wants to fight poverty at the altar. In a Republican presidential primary debate on Oct. 11, 2011, the former Pennsylvania senator and ardent social conservative said one answer to reducing the economic disparity in the U.S. is to support two-parent families. "The biggest problem with poverty in America, and we don't talk about here, because it's an economic discussion -- and that is the breakdown of the American family," Santorum said. "You want to look at the poverty rate among families that have two -- that have a husband and wife working in them? It's 5 percent today. A family that's headed by one person? It's 30 percent today. ... We need to have a policy that supports families, that encourages marriage." That’s an interesting statistic, so we decided to see if it holds up. The U.S. Census Bureau collects and maintains that kind of data in many forms. According to its chart "People and Families in Poverty by Selected Characteristics: 2009 and 2010," the percentage of married-couple families living below the poverty line was 5.8 in 2009. It ticked up to 6.2 in 2010. For a single householder, the poverty rate was 26.3 percent in 2009 and 27.3 percent in 2010. The numbers are different, however, based on if the single parent is a man or a woman, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Among "female householder, no husband present" families, the poverty rate was 29.9 percent in 2009 and 31.6 percent in 2010. In "male householder, no wife present" families, the rate was 16.9 percent in 2009, and down slightly in 2010 to 15.8. Male-headed households compromised more than 15 percent of all single-parent households, the Census found. There are many different factors that contribute to poverty such as age, education, race and the health of the economy. Austin Nichols, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, wrote a paper in 2006 about changes in child poverty rates. He said child poverty spiked in the 1970s, and that was directly attributable to a rise in single-parent households. Then the rate dropped in the 1990s as the labor market improved for nearly all economic levels. Since then, Nichols said, changes to the child poverty rate have consistently been tied to economic factors. Take the current recession, for example. "There hasn’t been a rise in single-parent families during this time that child poverty has increased, whereas the job market you can see directly. The parents are losing their jobs, whether there are two parents or one," he said. "All the recent changes in child poverty and more broadly in all poverty have been due to changes in the job market." Nichols added that separating out single-parent households headed by men in a statistical group isn’t relevant because there are relatively few of them -- only about 15 percent of all single-parent homes are headed by men. And single-parent homes, Nichols said, always suffer higher poverty rates than two-parent homes. Our ruling Santorum said the poverty rate "among families that have two -- that have a husband and wife working in them? It's 5 percent today. A family that's headed by one person? It's 30 percent today." U.S. Census data backs the general point Santorum is making, that households with two adults fare better than those with a single head of household. But his numbers are off on both ends, so the difference is not as great as he suggests. For married couples, the percentage in poverty is higher than he said -- 5.8 percent in 2009 and 6.2 percent in 2010, versus 5 percent. And for households with a single head, it was lower -- roughly 27 percent for both 2009 and 2010. Santorum represented the general trend correctly, but his numbers were off in both cases. More importantly, not only marriage, but also the job market is important to families staying out of poverty. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-13978	"The labor force participation rate -- the share of the potential workforce that is actually working or looking for work-- currently stands below 63%, the lowest level since the 1970s."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/jun/13/dave-brat/dave-brat-us-labor-participation-rate-lowest-70s/	Rep. Dave Brat says the U.S. economy is stuck in the doldrums. "The labor force participation rate - the share of the potential workforce that is actually working or looking for work - currently stands below 63%, the lowest level since the 1970s," Brat, R-7th, said in a May 24 Facebook post. No doubt, the economy has had a choppy recovery from the Great Recession. But we wondered if it’s true that the percentage of potential workers who are employed or trying to find a job is at the lowest level in 40 years. Ivan Schwartz, spokesman for Brat’s re-election campaign, backed his statement by pointing to monthly tallies by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. They show that in April, the latest month for which figures were available when Brat made his comment, 62.8 percent of people who were 16 or older either were employed or actively seeking work. We should start by noting that 62.8 percent was not the lowest proportion of people in the labor force during the past several decades. The bottom came in September 2015, when the rate was 62.4 percent. You’d have to go back to October 1977 to find a time when the rate sank to that level. Still, Brat has a point in that the share of potential workers has been hovering near its lowest point in several decades. From the late 1970s up until the Great Recession, the percentage of people in the labor force for the most part was on the upswing. But in 2007, the year the recession started, the proportion of people in the labor force started to fall from 66.3 percent and continued that decline after the official end of the recession in June 2009. The drop continued until the September 2015 low point. Daniel Culbertson, an economist at the Indeed.com hiring website, told us that the economic downturn and simple demographics are the commonly cited cause of the drop in the percentage of people who are in the labor force. "Those that cite a deteriorating economy believe more workers are becoming discouraged and leaving the labor force altogether due to lack of opportunity, low wages, etc.," Culbertson wrote in an email. "Others opine that the majority of the decline can be explained by aging baby boomers leaving the labor force as they begin to retire en masse. How much of the LFPR (labor force participation rate) decline is attributable to each is a common topic of debate among economists." Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, attributes at least half of the drop to baby boomer retirements. That would have happened even if the recession never had occurred and the economy kept growing at the pace it had been in 2007, Burtless told us in an interview. Other factors are at play, Burtless said. Younger people who could enter the workforce are staying in college longer, he said. Some of the dropoff, particularly among potential workers ages 25 to 54 not in the labor force, remains a mystery, Burtless said. As we noted above, there’s been a bit of an uptick in the percentage of people who are in the workforce since last September - but not much. It rose from 62.4 percent to 63 percent in March. But then it fell to 62.6 percent in May - a figure that was not available when Brat made his statement. Even so, it’s still up a bit from the September 2015 low point. A final note, our colleagues at PolitiFact National have examined a similar claim that Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas has made over the years that the percentage of people working is at its lowest level since the 1970s, a statement Cruz has made to argue that Obama shares blame for the trend. PolitiFact has rated the statement Mostly True, saying the trend is real, but at least some of the drop is due to demographics beyond the president’s control. Brat, in his post, did not assign political blame for the drop. He predicted, however, that the situation will get worse if people "buy into solutions being offered by Democrats." Our ruling Brat said the labor force participation rate "currently stands below 63%, the lowest level since the 1970s." His percentage is right, and the congressman is correct that the rate of potential workers in the labor force has been hovering near a four-decade low since the start of 2014. Our one minor quibble is that the actual low point occurred in September 2015, when the labor participation rate fell to 62.4 percent. It’s been slightly higher this year. Still, we rate Brat’s statement True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d80c1293-0d5b-462f-a4a6-32eeaaaf2a88	None	Dave Brat	None	None	None	2016-06-13T08:59:42	2016-05-24	['None']

pomt-13144	Joe Morrissey "has been a delegate in the General Assembly for eight years with no laws passed to help our black community with education or workforce."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/nov/01/michelle-mosby/michelle-mosby-soft-ground-about-joe-morrisseys-la/	Richmond City Council President Michelle Mosby pulled no punches in a recent radio ad that took aim at Joe Morrissey, one of her opponents in the city’s mayoral race. "Joe has been a delegate in the General Assembly for eight years with no laws passed to help our black community with education or workforce," Mosby said in the 60-second clip that started running in early October. The ad began airing with polls showing Morrissey drawing substantial support from the black community. Mosby warns voters, "Don’t trust him." Mosby told us back-up information for her claim about Morrissey’s General Assembly record can be found on the state’s Legislative Information System, which tracks measures that lawmakers write and pass every year. So we took a look. Morrissey served in the House from 2008 to 2015. We found a dozen bills that were signed into law for which Morrissey was listed either as the patron or chief co-patron. But almost all fell outside of Mosby’s specification regarding laws "to help our black community with education or workforce." The lone exception we found was a 2009 law Morrissey wrote that required colleges, in the middle of a semester, to give full course credit to students who are deployed on active military duty. We asked Morrissey for his take on Mosby’s statement, and he sent us a letter pointing to 26 laws that he said "had some connectivity to either education or workforce." Only three of the laws Morrissey cited were measures where he was chief patron: • The 2009 military academic credit law mentioned above. • A 2008 law to allow people who had their driver's license suspended for failure to pay fines to get a restricted driving permit if they showed there was a good reason they didn't pay their parking tickets. Morrissey's legislation was rolled into a similar bill sponsored by then-Del. Rosalyn Dance, D-Petersburg, that was signed into law. • A 2009 law that established guidelines for state investigations of licensed health professionals. Of the 26 laws Morrissey cited, the other 23 were measures he co-sponsored. Sometimes he was one of a few delegates backing a bill, but often he was among dozens of fellow lawmakers who supported a bill. Sometimes the connection between the statutes to which Morrissey points and the categories Mosby cites is tenuous. But we did find some that could fall into the broad categories of education and workforce issues: • Morrissey was one of 21 legislators who co-sponsored a 2010 law establishing virtual schools that allow public school students to take classes online. • In 2013, Morrissey was one of 26 co-sponsors of a law that established guidelines for school districts to tackle bullying. • In 2008, Morrissey was among 37 co-sponsors of a law authorizing $350 million in bonds for construction projects at colleges. In 2009, he was among nine sponsors of a law to establish guidelines for teaching financial literacy to K-12 students. Our ruling Mosby said "Joe (Morrissey) has been a delegate in the General Assembly for eight years with no laws passed to help our black community with education or workforce." A review of Morrissey’s record shows he was not a prolific writer of laws that helped the black community in those two categories. But we don’t come up empty. Morrissey introduced a bill - which became a law under another legislator’s name - that allows people who can’t afford to pay traffic fines to keep driving. That will help some people - black and white - get to work. Morrissey wrote a law that requires colleges to give credit to students who are deployed by the military during mid-semester. That will help some people - black and white - complete college. So Mosby’s statement has some basis but also overlooks some of Morrissey’s broad legislative accomplishments. We rate it Half True.

pomt-02657	"If you make the average amount of people in Wisconsin, $50,000, you got $1.60 less a week in taxes" under the state income-tax cut, but "it didn’t show up in your paycheck."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jan/14/kathleen-vinehout/vinehout-says-160-tax-cut-didnt-show-weekly-payche/	Despite lower income-tax rates enacted by lawmakers, Wisconsin workers didn’t see the result in their paychecks in 2013 unless they took special action. Taxpayers will see the benefit when they file their tax returns this year and get either a larger refund or a smaller bill. Why? The state did not change the tax withholding tables to reflect the new, lower rates -- following a long tradition in Madison. The state currently has no plan to update the withholding tables in 2014, either. That’s the sum of what we learned as we checked out a claim by state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, D-Alma, about what the average worker would save from the tax cut approved in 2013 by Republican lawmakers and Gov. Scott Walker. Vinehout, who is mulling a run for governor this fall, opposed the tax cut, as did many Democrats. She says the savings for individual families wasn’t worth the $650 million in lost revenue to the state over two years. This is what she told a small audience in Waukesha on Dec. 5, 2013: "Get rid of the tax decrease," Vinehout said. "Did you know -- you might not know this -- if you make the average amount of people in Wisconsin, $50,000, you got $1.60 less a week in taxes? You might not have known that because they didn’t change the withholding tables, so it didn’t show up in your paycheck." She added: "But, if you file for your refund, and let’s say you file it a little late, and you get that refund sometime in June, you’ll maybe have a little more money, which might be just about the time the governor’s is out there on the campaign trail saying, hmm, you got more money in your pocket because of what I gave you." Let’s examine the elements of Vinehout’s claim. Check’s in the mail Wisconsin Revenue Department spokesperson Laurel Patrick confirmed that withholding tables were not updated after the tax cut, and said no decision has been made to do so in 2014 either. The tax cut reduced rates in all five tax brackets. That means the tax-rate changes are not automatically reflected on people’s paychecks. To get the tax savings on their regular paycheck, employees must file a new WT-4 or WT-4A form with their employer. Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the state, with a few exceptions, has long tried to help its immediate cash flow needs by not automatically making tax cuts show up on people’s paychecks. The practice predates Walker. The state is now over-withholding by 20 percent or more because it has typically not adjusted the tables, Berry said. Many taxpayers may prefer getting a lump sum at refund time, Berry said, but they should understand that as a group they essentially are giving state government a billion-dollar annual no-interest loan that adds to the state deficit under generally accepted accounting principles. "Politicians know it’s more politically valuable for people to get a nice refund in 2014," Berry said. What’s the savings? The rest of Vinehout’s claim was that "if you make the average amount of people in Wisconsin, $50,000, you got $1.60 less a week in taxes" under the income tax cut. When we asked for evidence, Vinehout’s office pointed to a Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis of the tax savings from the income-tax changes, and to separate state figures on tax burdens. The average Wisconsin adjusted gross income, across all types of filers, was $47,310 for tax year 2010, according to a Revenue Department analysis. There is 2011 data, the latest available, that puts the figure at $48,537, according to Dale Knapp, research director at the Taxpayers Alliance. Vinehout looked up that average income in the June 2013 memo by the non-partisan Fiscal Bureau, which presents ranges of income along with tax changes estimated for 2014. The Fiscal Bureau is the independent budget scorekeeper in Madison, and its reports on taxes are used by both parties to gauge the impact of proposals. The bureau’s analysis said that in the $40,000 to $50,000 range, the average savings is $85 for one year. That works out to $1.63 a week, which Vinehout referred to as $1.60 in her claim. So, Vinehout puts the average income into the slot, and with a bit of rounding her figure for the average tax change is on target. There’s some imprecision built in here, though, because the Fiscal Bureau memo uses income ranges rather than one particular income. So while Vinehout mentions $50,000, she gets the $1.60 average tax change from an income range of $40,000 to $50,000. And because the average state income is above the midpoint of that range, it’s likely the average tax change would differ slightly from the $1.60. There are other ways to illustrate the impact of the tax cut. One is to look at the types of filers rather than just the composite income brackets as in the Fiscal Bureau memo. Depending on the example used, one approach yields a smaller tax change figure than Vinehout’s approach, the other a larger one. The average single person who filed taxes had $26,556 in income, while married couples had an average of $83,480, said Knapp. Walker, for his part, chooses the married couple example. Such a couple with two children would save about $173 a year, or $3.33 per week over the two years. On the lower end, the average single would see a weekly savings of about 73 cents. The overall state average that Vinehout cites is a middle ground between those two numbers. Our rating Vinehout said that "if you make the average amount of people in Wisconsin, $50,000, you got $1.60 less a week in taxes" under the $650 million state income-tax cut, but "it didn’t show up in your paycheck." The average income she cites is slightly high but within reasonable rounding range. She uses a reliable source for her tax-change numbers, and they are on target or very close, with the caveat that the analysis is set up for income ranges rather than a precise income. She’s right that the tax cut did not just show up in workers’ paychecks, due to inaction by the state. With the clarifications noted, we rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-09596	"The Washington Times ... pointed out that we had succeeded where previous administrations had failed" on spending cuts.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/20/barack-obama/Obama-Washington-Times-budget-cutting/	Under fire from Republicans for his sweeping plans to reform health care and the $787 billion economic stimulus bill, President Barack Obama is trying to portray himself as a budget-cutter. So in a recent speech, he said the Washington Times, a newspaper famous for its conservative editorial page, had given him a shoutout. During a speech at a retreat of the House Democratic Caucus on Jan. 14, 2010, Obama said, "The Washington Times -- not known for (being) a big promoter of the Obama agenda -- pointed out that we had succeeded where previous administrations had failed because of the work that was done here in this Congress to finally get serious on some of these spending cuts that had been talked about for years." That surprised us, so we looked into it. Indeed, we found that on the same day the president delivered the speech, the Washington Times had published a story with the headline "Obama wins more spending cuts than Bush." Anyone who heard Obama's speech or read the transcript very well could have thought he was referring to praise from the Times' conservative editorial page. In the parlance of the nation's capital, references like this are usually referring to editorials, not news stories. But in this case, it was a news story. It began: "President Obama notched substantial successes in spending cuts last year, winning 60 percent of his proposed cuts and managing to get Congress to ax several programs that had bedeviled President George W. Bush for years." The story offered a remarkably positive account of Obama's budget cutting, saying that he "was victorious in getting Congress to slash 24 programs and achieved some level of success in reducing nine other programs." It called the cuts a "bright spot in an otherwise dreary budget picture" and said Obama's "success rate at cutting programs was significantly higher than President Bush. But the article noted that the cuts would barely put a dent in the overall federal deficit, pointing out that they accounted for "well less than one-half of 1 percent of the total federal budget." So Obama was right that the Washington Times had run such an article. But his comment suggested it was editorial praise when it wasn't. So we'll take Obama down one notch for not noting it was a news story and rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-01-20T18:18:13	2010-01-14	['The_Washington_Times']

pomt-00056	Says Walker "wants to get rid of" students’ ability to stay on their parents’ health insurance.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/nov/02/tony-evers/tony-evers-claim-against-scott-walker-student-heal/	In a final push before the Nov. 6, 2018 election, Democrat Tony Evers levied a new claim against Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s health care policy. Health insurance has been a key issue throughout the campaign — Walker wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Wisconsin is suing in federal court in Texas to try to make that happen. Meanwhile, Walker offered a last-minute proposal on pre-existing conditions, saying he would codify into state law the same protections offered by the ACA. Speaking Nov. 1, 2018, in Eau Claire, Evers reiterated that he would protect Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions, then pivoted to new anti-Walker claim. "How many students here are still under their parents' health care (insurance)? There’s more than a handful," Evers said, then added: "He wants to get rid of that, too." Does Walker really want to force students off their parents’ health insurance? Evers offers no specific evidence Asked for back up for the claim, Evers spokesman Sam Lau pointed only to Walker’s opposition to the ACA, commonly called Obamacare. "The Affordable Care Act allows you to stay on your parents’ health care until you are 26, and Walker is suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act," Lau said. True enough. The Affordable Care Act does require that insurers offering dependent child coverage make that coverage available until the child turns 26. But Wisconsin law also has a similar – though less comprehensive – requirement that would remain in place even if the ACA is repealed. The provision was put into place as part of the 2011-’13 budget, based on wording added by the Joint Finance Committee to comply with ACA requirements. The Wisconsin language would not apply to employer-sponsored insurance that is self-funded — about half the employer plans in the state. That exemption, which is part of federal law, means half the employer plans wouldn’t be required to cover children up to age 26, said Jon Peacock, research director for Kids Forward, a Madison-based advocacy group. Nevertheless, Walker has already signed a provision that does what Evers says Walker opposes -- provides the ability for "kids" to be on the health plans of their parents. What's more, past statements from Walker have gone further. And Walker campaign spokesman Ben Voelkel said the governor continues to support leaving the provision as it is in the ACA. He cited several articles, including an Aug. 18, 2015 one from the website Becker’s Hospital Review. That article, in the midst of Walker’s brief presidential campaign, looked at key points from Walker’s plan to replace the ACA. Among the points noted: "Under his proposal, Americans would not be fined for not having health insurance and those under 26 years old can stay on their parents' plans." He also noted a 2017 Washington Post interview, in which Walker identified coverage "for young people" as among the things he’d keep from the Affordable Care Act if he were creating new policy after a repeal. Our rating Evers says Walker "wants to get rid of" students’ ability to stay on their parents’ health insurance. But Evers offers no direct evidence of that claim. The only evidence offered — that Walker opposes the ACA, which also includes coverage through age 26 — does not logically connect. It’s not reasonable to extrapolate from Walker’s opposition of the ACA that he opposes each and every individual policy position within it. And the claim ignores the fact that Walker has already signed into law a requirement that health insurers in Wisconsin allow young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26. We rate Evers’ claim False. Editor's note: This item was updated on Nov. 5, 2018 to reflect information from Joe Peacock of the Kids Forward about how the provision in state law compares to the ACA. The rating remains False.	None	Tony Evers	None	None	None	2018-11-02T18:35:54	2018-11-01	['None']
pomt-12872	"New York state law says you are alive when you begin to breathe."	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2017/jan/30/deborah-glick/new-yorks-definition-when-fetus-becomes-person/	Assembly Democrats want to guarantee access to abortion for New York state residents if the Supreme Court overturns the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. A bill, commonly referred to as the Reproductive Health Act, would change state law to guarantee women the choice to have or refuse an abortion or contraception if the Supreme Court reverses Roe v. Wade. Different versions of the bill have been introduced for at least seven years in the Legislature. This year’s debate over the measure included tough questions to the bill’s sponsor, Assemblymember Deborah J. Glick, from members opposed to the bill. "So, if a baby is born intact and alive but has not yet taken its first breath, it has no rights?" Assemblymember Steven F. McLaughlin asked. "Is that the position you are taking?" "New York state law says you are alive when you begin to breathe," Glick said. "That’s not me, that’s just the law." Is Glick right? Is that the law? State abortion law Glick said her definition comes from the current state law on abortion. The definition is included in the state’s penal law, or criminal code, which defines the crime of abortion, where someone intentionally causes a pregnancy to be terminated without consent or justification. The law says a person, "when referring to the victim of a homicide, means a human being who has been born and is alive." So a fetus inside the womb is not considered a person, and therefore does not have rights under state law. That is why someone can legally have an abortion after being pregnant for 24 weeks to preserve the life of the mother. State health law State health law goes a step further in defining when someone is considered born. Under Public Health Law, live birth is defined as "the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached; each product of such a birth is considered live born." It is up to a medical professional to determine if there is evidence of life in the infant. If the medical professional finds evidence, it is legally considered the birth of a person. "The reality is that if they are born and alive they are a person and have full rights," Glick said in a phone interview. "And that is the determination of a medical person at the time." Our ruling Glick said during an Assembly debate that "New York state law says you are alive when you begin to breathe." State law says a person has been born alive when the fetus has exited the woman’s body and shows signs of life. The law specifically mentions breathing as one of the signs. But the law also mentions other evidence of life, such as a beating heart. We rate this claim as Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d7c7b893-a127-4f3a-a477-ae2ef6cc526a	None	Deborah Glick	None	None	None	2017-01-30T12:00:00	2017-01-17	['None']

pomt-07547	Since Oregon’s prescription-only law took effect, meth lab incidents have dropped by 96 percent and meth-related arrests by 32 percent.	true	/oregon/statements/2011/apr/02/rob-bovett/oregon-district-attorney-says-meth-lab-seizures-an/	Oregon got some press in a recent New York Times articleabout a growing methamphetamine problem in Southern and Midwestern states and their efforts to stanch it. According to the article, a laundry list of states -- Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, West Virginia, Alabama, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Tennessee and "several other(s)" -- are trying to reverse the growth of home-grown producers and Oregon might be a model. Since 2006, Oregon has required a prescription for drugs that contain pseudoephedrine, like Sudafed. For those who don’t know the intricacies of meth production, pseudoephedrine is a key ingredient in the drug and can be leeched out of some over-the-counter medications. The thinking goes that if you put drugs like Sudafed behind a prescription barrier, meth manufactures will have to close shop. The New York Times talks to one of Oregon’s very own, Lincoln County District Attorney Rob Bovett, about the state’s results. Bovett tells the Times that the law is working well in Oregon. Specifically, he says, the rate of meth lab incidents has tumbled 96 percent since the law took effect while the number of meth-related arrests has shrunk by 32 percent. Those are not numbers to ignore -- provided they’re accurate. We gave Bovett a call and he pointed us in the direction of the data he used. First up was the claim that meth lab incidents are down by 96 percent. For this statistic, Bovett gathered numbers from the Department of Justice’s High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program. The program keeps tabs on the number of "meth lab incidents." These incidents, Bovett said, include three scenarios: full labs (whether operating or not), partial labs (a lab that’s not set up) and dump sites (discarded labs). Bovett gathered month-by-month data from the organization going as far back as January 2003. The information is now in a handy tableon the Oregon Alliance for Drug Endangered Children website. We looked over the data and calculated an average number of incidents per month in 2003 (roughly 40) and then did the same for 2010 (roughly 1.5). These numbers do, indeed, show a 96 percent drop in the number of meth lab incidents per month. The New York Times article specifically talks about the drop occurring between now and 2006, so why did we look at numbers in 2003? Well, between the end of 2004 and the middle of 2006, Oregon instituted progressively more onerous requirements for the purchasing of products containing pseudoephedrine. First, the state put them behind the counter (November 2004 through May 2005) and then we started requiring an ID and logging the number of purchases (June 2005 through June 2006). If you look at the numbers, these two moves actually reduced the number of meth lab incidents by 77 percent on their own. It might be easy, then, to assume that the prescription-only policy reduced incidents by only the remaining 19 percent. But, the 96 percent reduction has been sustained for more than four years now. We feel comfortable giving the prescription-only law the credit here. So on the first statistic, Bovett is right. Now for the claim that the number of meth-related arrests has shrunk by 32 percent. For this statistic, Bovett relied on a data setpublished by Oregon Criminal Justice Commission. To avoid problems with changing populations, we went with the number of arrests per 100,000 Oregonians. This is typically how crime rates are assessed. The prescription-only law went into effect in November 2006. We reached a peak of meth-related arrests in March 2007 when there were 25.3 arrests per 100,000. The number reached its lowest point since then in December 2009, 14.2 arrests for every 100,000. It’s seen a slight bump since that low and, as of February 2011, sits at 17 arrests per 100,000. Compare that peak of 25.3 to our current 17, and you do, indeed, find a drop of roughly 33 percent. Again, Bovett appears to be right. (It’s worth noting here -- though it doesn’t affect the rating of these claims -- that overall drug-related arrests per 100,000 have declined by nearly 11 percent over the same time frame.) We could be harder on Bovett’s number here and use the November 2006 figure of 23.7 per 100,000, which would cut into the decline somewhat, leaving it at 28 percent. That said, it seems reasonable that it might take some time for the new law to really take hold and for current manufacturers to run out of whatever back-stock they might have held at the time. Even so, 28 percent is still a pretty nice drop and not all that far from 32 percent. For our rating, Bovett’s statistics hold up to scrutiny: Since our prescription-only law went into effect, we have, in fact, seen meth lab incidents decline by 96 percent and meth-related arrests dip by about 32 percent. We rate Bovett’s claim True. Comment on this item.	None	Rob Bovett	None	None	None	2011-04-02T06:00:00	2011-03-28	['None']

pomt-04656	Says Georgia will send more state money per child to state charter schools and that budget cuts are not applied to those charter schools.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/11/herb-garrett/charter-school-funding-claim-hits-close-mark/	A math exercise by one prominent education advocate in Georgia had folks asking some questions. Herb Garrett, executive director of the Georgia School Superintendents Association, recently sent a letter to education officials and other interested parties noting that state special charter schools will receive more money per pupil than those attending traditional public schools under a revised formula set by the Georgia Legislature. Garrett sent his letter to Atlanta Journal-Constitution education columnist Maureen Downey, who then posted it on the AJC’s Get Schooled blog. It’s complicated, but he concluded that state-approved charter schools actually come out ahead when the budget cuts are applied. Some well-versed on education wondered if Garrett’s conclusion about which schools will get more money from the state is correct. Some read the part about austerity cuts and said Garrett was just wrong. PolitiFact Georgia thought it would be worthwhile to do some homework on all of this. Charter schools will be a hot political issue this fall. These are public schools that are independently managed and given organizational and curriculum flexibility while meeting state and federal education standards. Such schools are approved by local school boards or, if rejected by the local board, by the state Board of Education. On Election Day in November, Georgia voters will decide by referendum whether the state constitution should be amended to allow the state to authorize and pay for more charters. Georgia Schools Superintendent John Barge surprised many fellow Republicans last month when he announced his opposition to the amendment, citing concerns that the state is having trouble funding public schools. There are currently 15 state-approved charter schools. Now, back to Garrett’s statements. PolitiFact Georgia decided to examine the second part first. In 2003, the state began the first of several austerity cuts, due to declining revenue. For four of the prior past five years, local school districts were shorted millions that they were due under the Quality Basic Education Act, the state formula for funding public education, the AJC reported in 2010. Garrett admitted he erred when he wrote that austerity cuts differed between traditional public schools and state-approved charter schools. "I wish to correct one piece of information about the funding of state special charter schools that I included in the version of Friday notes that I sent earlier today," Garrett wrote in an email he sent to the state Department of Education. "In fact, it appears that the allotment sheets for state special charter schools DO, in fact, reflect a reduction based on austerity cuts. Thus, the paragraph in which I stated that those state special charter schools are not subject to the same austerity cuts as traditional k-12 schools was in error." Garrett confirmed he sent that email to the state, but said his larger point was state charter schools will get more money than traditional public schools under the amendment, which brings us back to the first part of his claim. The QBE formula gives money to schools based on each student and "indirect" costs, such as administration. Georgia requires local systems to pay an amount equal to five mills of property tax generated within their taxing authority for those educational costs within the school district. Downey asked state Education Department spokesman Matt Cardoza to review Garrett’s claim that state charter schools will receive more money per pupil under the new formula. His answer: "I’ve confirmed that those numbers are correct. Our financial review team ran the numbers based on what the legislation says." The AJC recently examined the question of which types of schools get more money. An article concluded that state-approved charter schools would get more money per pupil, citing an analysis of school funding completed for Gov. Nathan Deal, who backs the amendment. However, traditional schools will get local money that state-approved charter schools do not. In 2011, the state Supreme Court ruled state lawmakers do not have the power to grant the state authority to approve and fund charter schools over the objection of local school boards. In conclusion, Garrett was correct on his larger point that state-approved charter schools will get more money per pupil under the proposed amendment than traditional public schools. Garrett admitted he was incorrect about the secondary part of his claim that state-approved charter schools are exempt from austerity cuts. We give Garrett a grade of Mostly True.

pomt-14463	"Spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars" because of Arizona’s immigration laws that drove out undocumented immigrants.	mostly false	/arizona/statements/2016/mar/03/ted-cruz/has-arizonas-economy-improved-because-its-immigrat/	Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has talked tough on immigration, saying he would deport all 12 million undocumented immigrants. CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Cruz what is wrong with letting the "good ones" come back to the United States during the Feb. 25 GOP debate in Houston. Cruz referenced a Feb. 9 Wall Street Journal article and said Arizona’s strict immigration laws have prompted undocumented immigrants to flee the state. As a result, it has become tougher for business owners in the state to find skilled workers, but at the same time state spending decreased. "Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state. ... Some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars," Cruz said. "And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop, are seeing wages rise. That's who we need to be fighting for." Arizona is no stranger to controversy with some of its immigration laws. But has the departure of undocumented immigrants after legislation helped Arizona’s economy to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars? We decided to fact-check Cruz’s complex immigration claim. But first, some background on Arizona immigration policy. Why did immigrants leave? Arizona’s undocumented immigrant population was on the climb prior to 2007, according to a Pew Research Center study. The population peaked in 2007 with about 500,000 undocumented immigrants in-state. But from 2007 to 2012, the undocumented immigrant population dropped 40 percent. However, immigrants across the state were already leaving because of the December 2007 recession. Arizona’s housing market crashed and construction jobs, one of the state’s major sectors, dried up. Immigrants "have left long before the passage of these anti-immigration laws," said Lisa Magaña, an associate professor in the School of Transborder Studies at Arizona State University. Arizona passed Proposition 200 in 2004, which requires citizenship to receive social services such as childcare and housing assistance. The state passed Proposition 300 two years later, which bars in-state tuition for college students without a lawful immigration status. But the meat of Arizona’s policies toward undocumented immigrants did not start until 2008. Arizona required employers to use the federal E-Verify system in 2008, which requires an employee to have a Social Security number to legally work. Finally, then-Gov. Jan Brewer signed SB 1070 into law in April 2010. The measure allowed law enforcement officers with "reasonable suspicion" to ask for a person’s immigration papers when engaging in a stop. Most of the law was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court, but last September a U.S. District Court Judge upheld the law’s provision that allows police to question the immigration status of those they suspect are undocumented. Welfare Welfare has "never gone" to undocumented immigrants, Liz Schott, a senior fellow and welfare expert at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said. However, some children of undocumented immigrants are eligible for benefits if they were born in the United States and are citizens. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors reduced immigration, noted that these U.S.-born children could share their cash welfare benefits with their undocumented parents. In 2008, Arizona spent more than $121 million in cash welfare. In 2014, they spent more than $32 million on cash welfare. According to Schott, Arizona just spends more in other welfare areas, such as child-care assistance for those working and/or attending school. "They’re spending it all, they’re just spending it elsewhere," Schott said. Because it is difficult to determine how many undocumented immigrants receive cash welfare, it’s hard to credit this drop to people leaving the state. Prisons As for state prisons, Arizona’s Department of Corrections tracks noncitizens, either documented or undocumented, with a felony conviction. From fiscal year 2010, which ran from July 2009 to June 2010, to fiscal year 2015, the state’s noncitizen prison population has declined almost 23 percent, but that’s just about 1,400 inmates. The daily cost of keeping a noncitizen in a state prison hasn’t changed much, either. In fiscal year 2010, it cost $59.85 per day to house a noncitizen. In fiscal year 2015, it cost $61.55. Because of the dip in noncitizen inmates, that’s a savings of almost $28 million. However, overall state spending on prisons has increased almost 17 percent between 2008 and 2015. Elliott Pollack, CEO of his own Scottsdale-based economic consulting firm, said Cruz’s rationale bothers him. "The cause and effect might be there to some extent, but I just don’t see how it saves hundreds of millions of dollars," Pollack said. "There’s no evidence of that." Meanwhile, Camarota said the departure of undocumented immigrants "makes things a little better." "Could he (Cruz) be right? He could be," Camarota said. However, Cruz’s points are subject to error. Camarota also notes that undocumented immigrants "paid something" in taxes. A February 2016 report from the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates that Arizona’s undocumented immigrants pay more than $231 million a year in state and local taxes. Education On education, the state also does not track spending on undocumented immigrants in schools. The Wall Street Journal article Cruz described uses the state’s decline in intensive English student enrollment -- about 80,000 students between 2008 and 2012 -- as a potential cost-saving measure, noting that it could save the state about $350 million per year. But it’s not that simple. "I think it’s a combination of factors," Arizona Department of Education spokesman Charles Tack said, noting that the decline could be attributed to students leaving the system or being reclassified elsewhere. Plus, that measure correlates intensive English with undocumented immigrants, which isn’t tracked to begin with. We reached out to the Cruz campaign for comment but did not hear back. Our ruling Cruz said, "spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars" because of Arizona’s exodus of undocumented immigrants. That’s far from clear. While it’s technically possible to receive cash welfare through U.S.-born children, undocumented immigrants do not receive cash welfare directly. And, the state’s prison and education budgets do not solely account for those without papers. Even then, any potential savings would be hard to calculate. It is not an apples to oranges comparison. The recession played a significant role in Arizona’s immigrant population decline, too. There’s been no noticeable windfall in the state budget for welfare, education and prisons that we could document. We rate Cruz’s claim as Mostly False.

pomt-08299	Robert Hurt supported a bill that helped the uranium industry after taking contributions from the industry and because his father had a stake in it.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/31/sierra-club/conservation-groups-accuse-robert-hurt-conflict-in/	The television and direct-mail ads aimed at state Sen. Robert Hurt’s vote on a uranium mining study say he’s guilty of a "shocking conflict of interest." The ads are shocking all right, but not necessarily for the reasons stated by the conservation groups that produced the ads. Hurt, a Republican, is running to unseat Democratic Rep. Tom Perriello in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. The TV ad, "Robert Hurt’s Shocking Conflict of Interest," challenges Hurt’s decision to vote in 2008 on a Senate bill that would have created a commission to study the potential for uranium mining in Virginia, which has been banned since 1982. The ads produced by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters call Hurt’s decision to vote yes on the bill "a shocking conflict of interest ... maybe it’s because Hurt’s father has a financial interest in uranium mining, or because Hurt has taken thousands from uranium interests." A subsequent direct-mail ad goes further, saying:. "When family money is involved, a radioactive conflict of interest means nothing to Robert Hurt." That’s a nuclear statement that ends up half-baked. The TV ad overstates Hurt’s personal ties to the uranium industry, and three direct-mail ads take the issue over the top. One, showing a young girl on a swing and bearing the headline, "There’s a hidden danger lurking underground ...," resembles an infamous Lyndon Johnson ad in the 1964 presidential race that featured a girl picking flower petals moments before a nuclear explosion. Hurt’s campaign called the ad "a despicable, false negative attack" run by "liberal special-interest groups on Congressman Perriello’s behalf." Perriello’s campaign said the issue demonstrates the danger of accepting political contributions from corporate interests. We agree the ads go too far, but the issue of uranium mining is legitimate and timely. Last Tuesday, the National Academy of Sciences convened the first meeting of a one-year study requested by the state and paid for by a uranium company headquartered in Chatham, Hurt’s hometown in Pittsylvania County. Hurt’s father, Henry C. Hurt Jr., is an investor in the company, Virginia Uranium Inc. It was formed in 2007 by Walter Coles Sr., whose farm, Coles Hill, contains a major deposit of uranium discovered in the late 1970s. The study was requested by the Virginia Coal and Energy Commission last year, but Hurt’s alleged conflict occurred more than a year earlier in a vote in the Virginia Senate on a bill to authorize the study. That bill eventually died in the House of Delegates but Virginia Uranium is paying $1.4 million for the National Academy of Sciences Study, which will examine the potential socioeconomic impact of allowing uranium mining in Virginia. It is indisputable that Hurt’s father -- a writer, local bookseller and former Reader’s Digest editor -- invested in Virginia Uranium in 2007. The connection was documented in articles published by the Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Washington Post that were cited in the ads. The elder Hurt is unabashed about his support for the business. "I am delighted to be one of the founding investors in the company," Hurt told us. Prior to the uranium study bill coming to the Senate floor, Hurt asked the Senate ethics panel if it would be a conflict of interest for him to vote on the matter. The panel, controlled by Democrats, advised that he was not in conflict and gave him a green light to vote. The panel ruled that under Virginia’s ethics laws, Hurt’s father is not part of the senator’s "immediate family" and their financial interests were not entwined. It also said Hurt could vote "because the impact of a proposed study on his father’s financial interests are speculative and because the study may have a broad impact on persons interested in uranium mining." The bill passed the Senate by a 36-4 vote, with Hurt voting yes. The conservation groups correctly say voters have a right to make up their own minds about whether the vote was a conflict. While the bill only would have created a study, opponents of uranium mining -- including the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club -- prefer maintaining the ban. Technically, the ads are correct about Hurt’s contributions from uranium interests, but by the barest of margins. Walter Coles Jr., a vice president of Virginia Uranium and son of its CEO, gave three checks totaling $1,500 over a period of seven years to then-Del. Hurt, who ran for the state Senate in 2007. Norman W. Reynolds, who was the first CEO of Virginia Uranium, gave Hurt’s campaign $500 in 2007. Together, that’s $2,000, just qualifying for the "thousands," in contributions claimed in the TV ad. The conservation groups also based the claim on $7,054 in contributions made to Hurt over five years by his father, who presumably had plenty of reasons other than uranium mining for supporting his son. All of the father’s donations were made before 2006, when Henry Hurt said he began exploring investing in mining for uranium. Further, most of the contributions weren’t cash at all. About $5,300 came in donations of office space, a political luncheon, and food for a police dinner. "It’s just despicable, scurrilous," Henry Hurt said of the ads in an interview with PolitiFact. So let’s review the key facts in the claim that Hurt put his own interests ahead of the public by voting on the Senate uranium study bill. Hurt did vote for the bill, and he accepted $2,000 cash contributions from uranium industry executives, barely justifyinghe Sierra Club’s claim. His father also contributed to his campaigns, but those donations came before the elder Hurt invested in uranium. There is no question his father stands to gain if uranium mining is allowed in Virginia, but Hurt disclosed that and was cleared by the Senate ethics panel to vote on the issue. Therefore, we find the claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03598	"Two years ago Providence alone spent $50,000 a year notifying the school department" about residents in the state's sex offender registry.	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/may/12/joee-lindbeck/assistant-attorney-general-joee-lindbeck-says-prov/	Rhode Island state law and state Parole Board guidelines say residents in the community must be notified if a Level 2 or Level 3 (moderate or high-risk) sex offender is living in their neighborhood. Notifications are also supposed to be sent to schools, police departments, daycare centers and community organizations that might have contact with the offender. The costs associated with that requirement were raised at an April 11 hearing before the House Finance Committee. At issue was House bill 5557, submitted at the request of the attorney general's office, which would revise the state's sex offender registry system to comply with federal guidelines. Under the bill, responsibility for notifying residents, schools, community organizations and businesses such as daycare centers about sex offenders living in the vicinity would shift from city and town police departments to the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety, which includes the state police. During the hearing, two witnesses made interesting comments about how the proposal would cut notification costs for cities and towns. One was Rep. Peter Palumbo, D-Cranston, whose statement is being fact-checked separately. The other -- and the subject of this item -- was Joee (pronounced Joey) Lindbeck, a special assistant attorney general who heads the office's Legislation and Policy Unit. "Two years ago Providence alone spent $50,000 a year notifying the School Department" about sex offenders. "This act would allow for e-mail notification alone," she said. That seemed like a lot of money, so we decided to check that portion of her statement. Because the data came from a report from the attorney general’s office, we made that our first stop. That office sent us a 2012 PowerPoint presentation that included cost estimates from several communities. There was quite a range. We've ranked the communities by the number of current Level 2 and Level 3 offenders (listed in parentheses) because a community that tends to have more offenders is going to have to spend more. It's important to note that the number of offenders may have been different when these cost estimates were developed and that some may have ended up back in the Adult Correctional Institutions on a new charge or violating probation after they registered. Per notification Per year Providence (163) $50,000 Cranston (124) $9,137 Pawtucket (39) $3,261 Woonsocket (38) $1,500 West Warwick (16) $22,784 Central Falls (16) $123 Warwick (15) $1,365 Coventry (11) $5,657 Cumberland (5) $4,000 Newport (4) $2,000 West Greenwich (4) $2,000 Johnston (3) $11,000 Hopkinton (3) $2,550 Smithfield (2) "Minimal" Middletown (1) $1,000 Richmond (0) $1,000 When we asked about the source of the Providence number, the attorney general's office produced a memo from Police Chief Hugh Clements reporting the cost was "approximately $50,000 [that year] for the registry and notifications. [Detective Teddy Michael] indicated that the bulk of the cost is related to the notifications to the schools." Providence currently has 39 schools. So the $50,000 was not just for school notifications, although most of it was. David Ortiz, spokesman for Mayor Angel Taveras, said the total was $65,000 in 2009, $36,000 in 2010 and $55,000 in 2011. How much of that was spent on school notifications? Ortiz referred us to the Police Department, where Detective Sgt. Philip Hartnett, recently put in charge of Providence police's special victims unit, said firm numbers are not available. He said Detective Michael estimated that the schools took up roughly 60 percent to 65 percent of the money. The costs were high, Hartnett said, because in 2011, the department has routinely sent notices to individual homes of students, although it was not required. "There are 26,000 students in Providence and it had to be something like that two years ago," he said. "I was amazed by that myself, but it was out of an abundance of caution. The law actually says to notify the schools. They took the step to notify the parents of all the students." Christina O'Reilly, spokeswoman for the Providence School Department, said when it gets a notice from police, it generates labels for all the students attending each school located within a half mile of a Level 2 offender or within one mile of a Level 3 offender. The labels go to the Police Department, which sends out the mailings, 45 of which have gone out since September. Bus drivers and principals are also notified by the School Department. Hartnett said there are efforts underway to streamline the system. "Now we are trying to set up an automated telephone system so that a call would go out to each student when we notify the school." The department was also trying to come up with posters, but with so many sex offenders to track in Providence, the posters quickly became outdated, he said. As Lindbeck told us, "The real problem is, they move so much and you have to redo this every time they move." Our ruling Special Assistant Attorney General Joee Lindbeck testified that "two years ago Providence alone spent $50,000 a year notifying the School Department" about residents in the state's sex offender registry. She was correctly quoting a memo regarding the approximate dollar amount but incorrectly attributed all of the spending on notifications to the School Department. On the one hand, everyone we spoke with said the biggest chunk of money went for school notifications. On the other, it's clear from the people with whom we spoke that a significant chunk of that money went to notifying other entities as well. We rate her statement Half True.

pomt-08277	"The interest on the debt now is going to approach in the next couple of years ... what we spend in the national defense budget."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/08/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-federal-interest-burden-will-approa/	As one of the highest-profile Tea Party candidates of 2010, Rand Paul made reducing federal spending a centerpiece of his successful campaign for a Senate seat from Kentucky. In a Nov. 7, 2010, appearance on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour, Paul -- who easily defeated Democrat Jack Conway on Election Day -- suggested the debt is growing to staggering levels. "The interest on the debt now is going to approach in the next couple of years -- just the interest on the debt -- will approach what we spend in the national defense budget," Paul said. We hadn't heard that comparison before, so we wanted to check it out. The first place we turned to was a historical table in the president's budget proposal for 2011. (Budget geeks will know it as Table 3.1: "Outlays by Superfunction and Function: 1940–2015.") Among the categories in this table are amounts for national defense spending and for net interest owed by the federal government. The defense spending figure begins at $719 billion for 2010, then rises a bit before declining to $685 billion in 2015. The net interest figure is smaller to start, but it rises more quickly. It starts at $188 billion in 2010, but ends up at $571 billion in 2015. That's roughly a tripling in five years. If you compare the two figures year by year, you find that in 2010, net interest is equivalent to 26 percent of defense spending. That percentage rises to 33 percent for 2011, 50 percent for 2012, 66 percent for 2013, 76 percent for 2014 and 83 percent for 2015. Paul has certainly characterized the general trendline correctly: Through 2015, net interest climbs closer and closer to the level of defense spending. But whether this counts as "in the next couple of years" -- and how close the percentage has to get to qualify as "approach(ing) ... what we spend in the national defense budget" -- is more of a judgment call. He would be more acccurate if he said 5 to 6 years instead of "couple of years" and relied on 90 percent as the threshold for "approaching." But both terms Paul used might be elastic enough to cover the numbers we found. We will add that these figures are projections that may or may not come to pass, depending on what happens with the economy, policy changes, and military threats over the next decade. And we'll note that we're using the statistic called net interest, which includes interest owed the public, not interest that the government owes itself. If we used gross interest instead, the amount of interest would be higher, making interest a higher proportion of defense spending in each year. But the economists we spoke to said the best statistic to use for this evaluation is the smaller, net interest figure, so we'll stick with that one. A Paul spokesman, Doug Stafford, added that "interest rates are historically low. There is no reason to believe that will continue. If they edged up to anywhere near historically average numbers, the interest on the debt would skyrocket as a percentage of the budget and would do so very rapidly." The economists we spoke to said that's a valid concern, but we won't use it to grade Paul's statement on This Week, since it's based on speculation. So let's put it all together. Paul is correct to point out the coming explosion in net interest payments -- a level that will rise steadily in comparison to defense spending over the next decade as defense spending falls modestly. He's a bit too aggressive when he says the interest burden will "approach ... what we spend in the national defense budget" in "the next couple of years." It will probably do so by 2015 or 2016, which would be the final two years of Barack Obama's second term, if he wins one. For a president who just survived his first midterm election, that seems pretty far away. Still, even if Paul's time span is slightly exaggerated, we don't think it's a fatal error, since his point about the trend is accurate. So we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-04546	Deficit spending ‘exploded during the Obama administration’ to $5.3 trillion over four years, compared to $2 trillion in eight years under President George W. Bush.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/28/ron-johnson/sen-ron-johnson-says-deficits-under-obama-total-53/	Remember those nerdy charts that Ross Perot flashed during his third-party run for president in 1992? The Texas billionaire’s visual aids warned of the perils of America’s mounting government debt. Twenty years later, Wisconsin’s junior U.S. Senator, Republican Ron Johnson, is taking a page from Perot as he acts as a surrogate for Mitt Romney and advocates for a spending slowdown. Explaining one of his digital charts during a Sept. 11, 2012 campaign stop in Sheboygan, Johnson ripped Obama for saying his administration’s proposed "Buffett rule" tax plan for million-dollar earners would "stabilize our debt and deficits for the next decade." "I haven’t yet publicly called President Obama a liar," Johnson told his audience. "But I’m saying he lies. Slight diplomatic difference." Johnson said the "Buffett rule" would raise just $5 billion a year. He’s right, as PolitiFact Ohio found in rating True a claim by Sen. Rob Portman that it would "bring in less than $5 billion per year. ... Enough to pay one week’s interest on the national debt." Johnson’s presentation uses a chart to contrast the "Buffett Rule’s" revenue potential to the deficits accumulated under Obama (2009-2012) and over the two terms of his predecessor, Republican George W. Bush (2001-2008). The chart shows deficits totalling $2 trillion in eight years under Bush, and $5.3 trillion under Obama in just four years. A caption on the chart says those deficits "exploded during the Obama administration." Is Johnson right on the deficit numbers and their rapid growth? As backup, Johnson’s campaign cited numbers from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. The figures show red-ink budgets in seven of eight years that coincide with Bush’s term. The annual deficits totalled $820 billion in his first term and nearly $1.2 trillion in his second. Add them up and there’s the $2 trillion figure cited by Johnson. That same White House table shows four years of deficits for 2009-’12, the time frame that coincides with the Obama era, ranging from $1.29 trillion to $1.4 trillion. The total, including estimated figures for 2012, is $5.33 trillion. That’s nearly triple the Bush deficit figure, in half the time. It seems simple, with the numbers and the trend matching up with Perot’s, er, Johnson’s chart. We wish it were that simple. But there is considerable disagreement in academic and political circles over how to assign responsibility to presidents for spending and deficits. Using the same table and a slightly different approach can put a somewhat different spin on the trend line -- though we found no scenario under which the Bush-era deficits top those under Obama. Here’s why. The big question any researcher faces is when to start and end the clock when looking at spending and deficit by presidents. It would be tidy to start the clock on Inauguration Day, but the federal budget year begins Oct. 1. That means an incoming president inherits a budget-in-progress from his predecessor, though he often makes changes. That timing mismatch makes a pretty big difference, for example, in pinning deficit numbers on Bush and Obama. To wit: Democrat Bill Clinton’s last budget, for fiscal 2001, resulted in a surplus of $128 billion -- the last black-ink budget on record. But Johnson attributed that surplus to Bush, who entered office Jan. 20, 2001. Johnson argues that once elected the budget can be changed by the new president. Similarly, on the back end of the Bush years, Johnson gives the eye-popping 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion all to Obama -- even though Obama was working with Bush’s last budget, which took effect in October 2008, during the final months of Bush’s second term. That methodology becomes even more important when you consider that just before Bush left office, the deficit for fiscal year 2009 already was projected to be $1.2 trillion, according to the scorekeeping agency for Congress, as reported by PolitiFact. So, Johnson attributes the 2009 deficit entirely to Obama even though much it was already anticipated before the Democrat’s inauguration. (By the end of the 2009 fiscal year, the deficit rose to $1.4 trillion in part due to Obama’s economic stimulus plan). What about Johnson’s methodology? We asked three experts who closely follow the budget, and each said there is no consensus on how to attribute the overlapping budget years. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said apportioning responsibility is "really tricky." "Looking at what has happened -- budget deficit-wise -- during the Bush and the Obama presidencies doesn’t tell the whole picture because of the differences of the fiscal year and impacts of policies that were enacted prior to either of them assuming office," Ellis wrote in an email. Still, Ellis said he considered Johnson’s numbers correct even if the presentation was simplistic. What’s more, there are some extra complicating factors unique to the Bush-Obama changeover, such as how best to parcel out the deficit blame for such things as Bush’s major tax cuts and Obama’s more modest tax trims, two wars that overlap their presidencies, two recessions, a Wall Street bailout that each supported, and major new programs under each (Medicare prescription drugs, stimulus). The Great Recession of 2007-2009, which fueled deficits when tax collections fell, also overlapped the two presidencies. Jason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Johnson’s numbers were defensible. He suggested looking at the increase in debt -- as opposed to deficits -- because it can be tracked to the day a president starts and ends a term. By that measure, we found a $4.9 trillion increase in gross public debt in Bush’s two terms vs. $5.4 trillion so far in Obama’s single term. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said "there is no good answer to your question that is going to satisfy everyone." Our rating Johnson’s chart showed $2 trillion in deficits under Bush and $5.3 trillion under Obama, and concluded that deficits "exploded" during the Obama administration. The numbers check out, but comparing presidents’ budget records is not as simple as Johnson’s chart suggests. For instance, Bush owns some debatable piece of the Obama deficits.

pomt-06319	The federal "limousine fleet has increased by 42 percent since Barack Obama took office."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/13/mark-neumann/gop-wisconsin-senate-candidate-mark-neumann-sees-m/	Wisconsin Republican Mark Neumann says he is running for the U.S. Senate "because our $14.6 trillion debt is destroying our country." "We must cut spending, balance the budget and repeal ‘Obamacare’ to create jobs," he declares on his campaign website. To cut spending, the former congressman and 2010 gubernatorial candidate announced on Nov. 9, 2011 a proposal to save $2 trillion by trimming or eliminating 82 programs. The same day, Neumann discussed his plan with Jay Weber, a conservative talk show host on WISN-AM in Milwaukee. He said he would eliminate an ethanol subsidy, make federal employees contribute more toward their pensions and save $10 million by reducing the size of the federal limousine fleet to what it was before President Barack Obama took office. "Tell me why the limousine fleet has increased by 42 percent since Barack Obama took office," Neumann said. "Why are we spending taxpayers’ money on that? Limos should be for weddings and proms, certainly not for government officials to be riding around in." Well, we at PolitiFact Wisconsin take limos to work every day, so we’re not sure what all the fuss is about .... But, seriously, Neumann’s claim made us wonder whether the federal fancy fleet has indeed grown by 42 percent since Obama was inaugurated in January 2009. Fortunately for us, our colleagues at PolitiFact National have already been down this road. In June 2011, presidential candidate and U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., made a claim similar to Neumann’s. She said on CBS’ "Face the Nation" that "the number of federal limousines for bureaucrats has increased 73 percent" under Obama. That earned her a Mostly False. Bachmann’s claim was based on an article by the non-partisan Center for Public Integrity, which does investigative journalism. The article, citing annual federal fleet reports, said the number of limousines rose from 238 in fiscal 2008, the last year of the George W. Bush administration, to 412 -- including 259 limos in the State Department -- in 2010. That would be a 73 percent increase. But as our colleagues pointed out, the article itself quoted a spokeswoman for the General Services Administration, which tracks federal vehicles, as saying the limo figures were not reliable. The spokeswoman said limousine had not been defined in the reports, which meant some vehicles listed as limos actually ranged from protective-duty vehicles to sedans. She also said her agency "cannot say that its report accurately reflects the number of limousines." In other words, there weren’t any good numbers on the number of federal limos. The General Services Administration promised at the time to fix its record keeping, so we contacted spokesman Gregory Mecher. He told us his agency issued a memo after PolitiFact National’s story was published, directing federal agencies on how to identify limos in their fleet reports. But those limo figures won’t be available until January 2012, he said. So, the limo numbers are still in limbo. We asked Neumann campaign spokesman Chris Lato for evidence to back Neumann’s claim. He cited the same flawed federal figures Bachmann did. If the government reduced the number of limos from 412 to 238, as Neumann proposes, that would be a 42 percent decrease. But again, the agency that tracks federal vehicles says that, despite the published fleet statistics, it really doesn’t know how many limos the federal government has -- and at least some in the count are not limos at all. Our conclusion Neumann said the federal limousine fleet "has increased by 42 percent since Barack Obama took office." Figures from the agency that tracks federal vehicles indicate the number of limos is up. But the agency says its record keeping is such that it doesn’t know how many limos there are, and won’t be able to calculate any level of increase under Obama until January 2012. We rate Neumann’s statement Mostly False.	None	Mark Neumann	None	None	None	2011-11-13T09:00:00	2011-11-09	['None']
pomt-15014	Today, the deficit is "below the average deficits over the past 40 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-deficit-now-below-its-40-year-av/	During an Oct. 2 press conference dominated by discussion of a mass shooting in Oregon and the ongoing civil war in Syria, President Barack Obama took time out for a victory lap on the federal budget. "I want to repeat this because the public apparently never believes it," Obama said. "Since I took office, we’ve cut our deficits by two-thirds. The deficit has not been going up; it has been coming down -- precipitously. We’ve cut our deficits by two-thirds. They’re below the average deficits over the past 40 years." We have previously rated Obama’s claim that "we've cut the deficit by two-thirds" as Mostly True. But we hadn’t heard the other claim -- that today, the deficit is "below the average deficits over the past 40 years." So we took a closer look. Economists tend to make long-term comparisons using a measurement of the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product. (The gross domestic product, or GDP, is a measure of the overall size of the U.S. economy.) Looking at the deficit as a percentage of GDP takes account of the economy’s dramatic growth since 1975. A larger economy can sustain a larger budget, and thus a larger deficit. Using that yardstick, Obama’s claim is on target. We calculated the current deficit as a percentage of GDP by dividing the Congressional Budget Office’s $426 billion deficit estimate (which was released in September) by the nearly $18 trillion estimate for GDP in 2015 (which was released in August). That works out to a deficit that’s 2.4 percent of GDP. So how does that figure compare? We looked at historical data for the deficit as a percentage of GDP going back to 1975, as published by the Office of Management and Budget. When we averaged those annual percentages, the average worked out to be a little under 3.2 percent. That would make Obama’s claim correct. Indeed, the percentage has fallen from 9.8 percent in 2009 to 2.4 percent today. This may be easier to visualize through the graph below. The blue line shows the deficit as a percentage of GDP, year by year, for the last 40 years, with the red line denoting the 40-year average. Though the percentage has been quite a bit above-average for most of Obama’s tenure, it has fallen significantly and has now fallen below the 40-year average, at least based on current-year estimates. And even if you keep unusually high percentages during the Obama years out of the calculation and limit the comparison to 1975 to 2008, the current level (a deficit that’s 2.4 percent of GDP) is still slightly lower than the average going back to 1975 (2.5 percent). In our previous fact-checks of Obama’s claims on the deficit, we’ve noted that Obama has glossed over the long-term outlook, which is not as rosy. Programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will become increasingly expensive as the Baby Boom generation ages. This can be seen in the following graph from the Congressional Budget Office. Over the next decade, the deficit as a percentage of GDP is set to push closer and closer to 4 percent, which is above the average level for the past 40 years. (In this graph, deficit percentage figures are shown as negative, rather than as positive in the graph above.) Our ruling Obama said today’s deficit is "below the average deficits over the past 40 years." He’s correct when measuring the deficit as a percentage of GDP, which is the yardstick most economists tend to use when making deficit comparisons over long periods of time. Still, Obama didn’t specify that he was talking about deficits as a percentage of GDP, and the comparison’s accuracy depends on the absence of major budgetary and economic changes between now and time the fiscal 2015 data are finalized. The claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-10-06T18:00:00	2015-10-02	['None']
pomt-15246	Austin is "effectively" imposing "a ban on barbecue restaurants."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2015/aug/04/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-austin-effectively-banning-barb/	Conservative Rush Limbaugh told listeners that liberal Austin has moved toward wiping out local barbecue joints. On his July 28, 2015, program, the commentator read from a web post stating the Austin City Council in April 2015 "passed a preliminary plan" restricting smoke from barbecue restaurants. Limbaugh said the web post went on to say the contemplated requirement that restaurants install costly devices to diffuse smoke led a business expert to tell council members "these restrictions will certainly kill all but the largest barbecue restaurants in Austin." "It is effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue," Limbaugh echoed. What "kind of an absurd requirement is this anyway?" he added. Smoke pouring from commercial barbecue smokers has been a hot Austin topic, in particular pitting a new South Austin restaurant against nearby homeowners who say its smoke wafting their way has reduced the value of their homesteads. And did the council adopt a plan amounting to a ban on ‘cue restaurants? Citing a website Limbaugh, according to a transcript of his program, recited as fact a July 25, 2015, web post on IAmATexan.com, headlined "Austin City Council Votes to Ban BBQ Restaurants." That post said the council had passed a preliminary plan to restrict smoke from barbecue restaurants, continuing: "The city council’s current proposal will require smoke diffusers and will also limit the amount of time that restaurants can smoke. These restrictions will require at least $100,000 in extra investments for most barbecue restaurants as they will be forced to buy extra smokers along with severely expensive diffusers, and in some cases will have to lease or purchase more property. "One business expert told council members that these restrictions will certainly kill all but the largest barbecue restaurants in Austin. "It is effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue." We didn’t connect with the unnamed authors of that post. Nor did our query to Limbaugh draw a reply. But Austin American-Statesman news stories, City of Austin documents and responses by a city spokeswoman indicate that after the council talked about imposing controls to reduce unwanted smoke from restaurant smokers, members directed the city manager, Marc Ott, to gather public input and make recommendations. As of late July 2015, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean said, one City Council committee had recommended no citywide restrictions while another council panel, slated to reconvene Aug. 3, 2015, had not made a recommendation. Limbaugh’s claim, Dean said, is not true. Blowing smoke in Austin Let’s scrape up the details--which extend to the city pulling together this 2015 document delivering a breakdown of Austin barbecue trailers and restaurants and the hours each one operates a smoker (around the clock to three times daily "for flavor" to not at all). After Terry Black’s Barbecue opened, on Barton Springs Road just south of Lady Bird Lake, nearby neighbors objected to smoke from its pit blowing into their yards and homes--not every day, residents initially said, but often enough depending on prevailing winds. Mike Black said in a January 2015 statement to the American-Statesman that he intended to work with residents to address concerns. In July 2015, residents filed a lawsuit against the restaurant. Credit for publicly suggesting the city regulate smoke from restaurants belongs to Austin City Council Member Sabino "Pio" Renteria, whose idea to require smoke mitigation wasn’t embraced by pitmasters who said purchasing expensive "smoke scrubbers" could kill barbecue stands inside the city limits. "It will force 99 percent of Austin BBQ places to either close or move out of town," John Mueller of John Mueller Meat Co. said in a statement. In March 2015, Renteria said he was revising his original proposal to have it apply only to restaurants and mobile food vendors within 100 feet of residential property—down from 150 feet. He also said he wanted to look at other smoke-mitigating options besides scrubbers. At a March 31, 2015, work session, council members questioned how regulating smoke emissions would affect small businesses and longtime businesses, and whether there might be a way to target regulations at new businesses or ones that had been the subject of complaints. The Statesman reported that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality in 2014 received two complaints about odor and smoke coming from Terry Black’s Barbecue, and one complaint in 2014 and another in 2015 about an East Austin establishment, la Barbecue. In all cases, the agency determined the odor and smoke were not nuisances subject to state intervention, commission spokeswoman Andrea Morrow said, adding that a nuisance would have to "be injurious to or adversely affect human health, welfare, animal life, vegetation or property" or "interfere with normal use and enjoyment of animal life, vegetation, or property." On April 2, 2015, council members voted 9-2 to gather input from neighbors and businesses in the lead-up to a "possible" writing of smoke-control rules. The issue was to go first to the Economic Opportunity and Health and Human Services committees, both consisting of council members. Specifically, the council’s resolution said members were initiating a possible amendment to the city code to address smoke from cookers, restaurants and trucks and their impact on residences with provisions to be considered including a requirement that restaurants and mobile vendors using a wood- or charcoal-burning stove or grill and located within 100 feet of a property used or zoned as a residence "take appropriate action to mitigate the impact of smoke emissions" on the lives of nearby residents "by relocating smoke-emitting equipment" or "installing smoke-mitigating devices." The resolution also directed Ott to gather input from affected residents, business owners and others before presenting recommendations to the committees by July 31, 2015. Committee recommendations On May 11, 2015, the Economic Opportunity committee voted 4-0 to not pursue a city ordinance either requiring establishments to install smoke-clearing devices or to regulate nuisances. Instead, the members said that city officials, in conjunction with the state commission, should review concerns case by case. Members acted after taking public comments and fielding a May 4, 2015, city presentation indicating that none of 54 restaurant barbecue smokers in the city already had smoke scrubbers. The other council committee also gathered. But it hadn’t made a recommendation by the day Limbaugh suggested Austin barbecue was about to vamoose. Then again, Ora Houston, the Austin City Council member who chairs the Health and Human Services panel, earlier made the motion against the city limiting barbecue smoke by ordinance that was adopted by the Economic Opportunity committee. By phone, Houston responded to our inquiry by saying she continues to prefer that the city address smoke concerns one by one. "I would not be a supporter of a motion to have a citywide ban on barbecue smoke," Houston said. "That’s what the city is known for, music and barbecue." Our ruling Limbaugh said Austin is "effectively" imposing "a ban on barbecue restaurants." In early 2015, there was worry that a mandate that barbecue restaurants limit smoke from smokers would have that impact. However, the council didn’t adopt such a regulation and we sniffed out no factual indication it’s poised to do so. Before Limbaugh spoke, the latest panel to make a recommendation suggested city staff tackle complaints one by one--without a change in law. When a claim is not so and seems ridiculous, we see smoke.

pomt-06304	"The job [of correctional officer] lowers your life expectancy . . . Metropolitan did a study in, I believe it was 1998, and the life expectancy was 58."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/nov/16/david-mellon/rhode-island-corrections-union-president-david-mel/	Life expectancy has been a key element in the pension overhaul debate playing out in Rhode Island, in part because retirees are living longer, requiring more money to fund their retirements. Public safety workers -- police, firefighters and correctional officers -- have been characterized as an exception. For example, in July we examined a claim that law enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than the general population. We found it to be False because studies showed that they lived nearly as long, or perhaps a bit longer, than other public employees. During an Oct. 27, 2011, General Assembly hearing on pension reform, David Mellon, president of the Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, made a similar claim. "The job lowers your life expectancy," he said, adding later that "Metropolitan did a study in, I believe it was 1998, and the life expectancy was 58 from that study." A lower life expectancy seems plausible, but age 58 seemed extraordinarily low when a 35-year-old male is predicted to live to age 77. We decided to track down the truth. It turned out to be as easy as handcuffing a ghost. We called Metropolitan Life to ask about the table. They couldn't find it and suggested we contact the Society of Actuaries. But the society doesn't keep that kind of data on life expectancies for various professions. A Google search uncovered other cases in which people made the same assertion, but they also offered no documentation. For example, William Hepner of the New Jersey Department of Corrections, during testimony before the Commission on Safety and Abuse in America's Prisons in 2005, said he was citing Metropolitan Life Actuary Statistics from 1998. Corrections spokeswoman Deirdre Fedkenheuer said Hepner was retired and not reachable. We found a similar pattern when we followed a separate thread -- a comparable claim that correctional officers typically died at age 59. Articles and websites would incorrectly credit another author or website with doing the research to back up the claim. The source appears to be an unnamed report, supposedly written in 1982 or earlier, from a union we couldn't find: New York State Council 80 of the American Federal of State, County and Municipal Employees. (Council 82 currently represents correctional officers in New York, but that union couldn't find a copy of the report.) We also contacted the National Institute of Corrections, part of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the American Correctional Association. They had no definitive data either. At this point, Mellon's statement appears to be an urban legend -- a plausible but unfounded "fact" that is repeated so often it comes to be regarded as gospel. "That's exactly what we found," said Joshua Stengel, program manager for NIC's information center, who tried unsuccessfully to track down the source of the statistic in June 2010. "My concern was that it was being cited by somebody like a union as a bargaining chip. And if they created it, they were essentially citing themselves." Stengel and Council 82 subsequently directed us to an Oct. 17, 2011, Florida report -- published on a police union website and done by Brevard County Sheriff J.R. "Jack" Parker -- that concludes that law enforcement and correctional officers typically die at age 62.5, 12 years earlier than all Florida residents. Parker used the report to argue for a rollback of the minimum age and length of service requirements for the pension benefits of law enforcement and correctional officers. The most obvious flaw in the report is that it compared the average age of death in those male-dominated professions to the age of death among both men AND women in Florida, failing to take into account the fact that women outnumber men in the Sunshine State and tend to live six years longer. And while Parker's report also claims that scientific studies show that law enforcement officers have shorter life spans than the general public, some of the evidence cited in his report shows the opposite, as we found in our earlier PolitiFact analysis. The truth may be far less ominous. In 1993, the Correctional Service of Canada released an analysis of 148,850 active and retired public service workers, 1,422 of whom were retired correctional officers. The analysis, by Daniel J.K. Beavon and Paul S. Maxim, modified in 2009, found that male officers had an average life expectancy of 77.5 years. That's just a year less than the longevity for all male Canadian public service employees and at least two years longer than the overall life expectancy of Canadian males. After adjusting for factors such as starting age of employment, age of retirement, length of service, class and reason for retirement, the researchers concluded that the longevity difference was not statistically significant. When we asked Mellon about his original statement, he said it made sense because "We don't have a lot of old correctional officer retirees." Of the 177 former correctional officers collecting retirement benefits, "we have nobody collecting in their 80s," 22 are in their 70s and 97 are in their 60s. That means that two-thirds of the retirees are 60 or older, but those numbers only reflect who is living. The issue is the age at which they die. "Over the years, unfortunately, I have been to many funerals of correctional officers under 55 and many retirees under 60. I think the numbers speak for themselves," he said. Our Ruling David Mellon testified that the life expectancy for correctional officers is 58, and he said he got the information from Metropolitan Life. But he did not actually get that statistic from the insurance company. He was citing an often-quoted number that, as far as we could tell after nearly two weeks of looking for its source, has no real documentation to back it up. A similar claim still making the rounds is actually 30 years old and comes from a questionable source. The most recent report we could find, from Florida, failed to make even the most basic adjustment -- for gender -- that would make it a valid study. And the only thorough analysis we could find concluded that male correctional officers actually live longer than the general population. We don't doubt that working as a correctional officer is hazardous and stressful, and we can understand how the funerals Mellon is attending could give him the impression that his coworkers are dying prematurely. But the hard evidence cited to back up such claims turns out to be unreliable, ethereal or contradicts his testimony. We rule Mellon's statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-10443	A gas tax holiday "would at best provide 30 cents a day for three months for a grand total of $28."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/06/barack-obama/obamas-per-car-number-is-reasonable/	Sen. Barack Obama says that the gas tax holiday promoted by Sen. Hillary Clinton will save people $28 over the course of the summer. Clinton, meanwhile, claims it will save $70. Who's right? Obama's campaign cites a number from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, a group that opposed Sen. John McCain's version of the gas tax holiday because it feared the holiday would wipe out $8.5-billion for highway programs. Clinton proposes a windfall tax on oil company profits to make up the difference. A spokesman for the highway association walked us through its estimate: The average vehicle drives about 12,000 miles a year. The proposed gas tax holiday would last from Memorial Day to Labor Day, about three months. Assume that people drive 3,000 miles during that time, and assume an average mileage rate of 20 miles per gallon, which comes to 150 gallons of gas. The tax on gasoline is 18.4 cents, so multiply that by 150 gallons, and you get $27.60. Purists could quibble with a few assumptions here. The estimate doesn't account for diesel fuel, which is taxed at a higher rate of 24.4 cents a gallon. Cars and other two-axle, four-tire vehicles get about 20 miles per gallon on average, but mileage for large trucks is a lot lower, so those drivers would save more. Historical seasonal data also indicates that people drive more in the summer, so the 3,000 number is likely a little low. And another complicating factor is that some individuals own more than one car. On the other hand, this calculation makes the generous assumption that drivers will reap 100 percent of the tax reduction. Many transportation experts and economists believe that consumers will see only a fraction of that amount, or even none of it. Certainly, oil companies and retailers could decide to keep part of the money for themselves. But a cut in prices will also stimulate demand by making people more willing to use their vehicles. Increased demand is likely to send prices up, eating away at the 18.4 cents a gallon. "I'm saying no more than half. Some pessimists are saying a lot less than half," said Lee Schipper, an energy expert and visiting fellow at University of California at Berkeley. "Maybe something will come back to consumers, but it's not a big number." The Tax Policy Center, for example, published an analysis that says consumers should expect a gas tax holiday to save them only $5 or $10 per vehicle . Also complicating matters is that the government no longer collects complete data on the public's driving habits, relying instead on estimates. Schipper has found gaps between estimates and actual fuel sales data, as well as uncertainties for both the number of automobiles in use and the distance each is driven. "We're condemned to endless arguing because there's no good data," he said. Clinton, on the other hand, arrives at a higher number by calculating savings for a family of four with an average of 2.3 vehicles per household. We examined her claim in detail and concluded it was False . Obama's statement that a gas tax holiday "would at best provide 30 cents a day for three months for a grand total of $28" is in line with estimates we have for average fuel consumption. The back-of-the-envelope calculation is clearly based on a few assumptions, but the assumptions are reasonable. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-14014	"The Chicago Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the last 10 years than the total number of tenured (UW) faculty fired during the last two decades."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/03/robin-vos/robin-vos-takes-aim-chicago-bears-quarterbacks-and/	It can be hard for Green Bay Packers fans to remember a time without consistency at the quarterback position. For the past 24 seasons, the Packers have had two primary quarterbacks — Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers. Combined, they have a total of 5 MVPs and two Super Bowl wins. One was just voted into the Hall of Fame, the other seems headed there. The Chicago Bears? Well, that’s a different story. They’ve had Jay Cutler in the spot since 2009, but that came after years of churning through quarterbacks. In a May 26, 2016 column published on the Right Wisconsin website, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, used the Bears’ quarterback situation to make a point about the University of Wisconsin System’s tenure policy. In his view, changes to relax the tenure system — ones harshly criticized by some faculty members — give the UW System more flexibility to deal with budget issues and other matters. In noting that under the old system, few faculty members with tenure ever lost their jobs, he invoked the Bears: "The Chicago Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the last 10 years than the total number of tenured faculty fired during the last two decades." He also claimed under the former policy a tenured a tenured faculty member was less likely to get fired than someone is to hit a hole in one in golf. But we’re more familiar with quarterback turnovers, er, the quarterback turnover on the Bears. The analogy used by Vos may seem trite, but it gets at a central issue in the tenure debate — how secure faculty are in their positions. Is Vos right? What the details show Here’s the easy part, assuming you’re not a Bears fan. Since the 2006 season, the Chicago Bears have had nine different starting quarterbacks: Rex Grossman started 16 games in 2006, seven in 2007 and one in 2008; Brian Griese started six games in 2007; Kyle Orton started three games in 2007 and 15 in 2008 Jay Cutler started 16 games in 2009, 15 in 2010, 10 in 2011, 15 in 2012, 11 in 2013, 15 in 2014 and 15 in 2015; Todd Collins started one game in 2010; Caleb Hanie started four games in 2011; Josh McCown started two games in 2011 and five games in 2013; Jason Campbell started one game in 2012 and Jimmy Clausen started one game in 2014 and one in 2015. (The Green Bay Packers, by contrast, had a total of nine games started by quarterbacks other than Favre or Rodgers during the same period.) Now for the trickier part. Vos said the Bears had more starting quarterbacks in the past 10 years than the number of faculty members fired in the past two decades. Kit Beyer, Vos’ communications director, defined "fired" as "dismissed for just cause." Under UW’s tenure policy, tenured faculty members have always had the potential to be dismissed for just cause such as misconduct. (We rated Gov. Scott Walker’s claim that tenure at the UW amounts to a "job for life" Half True.) By this measure, a total of six faculty members were fired since 1996, according to both Beyer and data provided by the UW System. UW System spokesman Alex Hummel said this number is extremely low in large part because the "weeding out process" of employees happens both in the hiring stage and during the probationary years of employment before professors are granted tenure. At most institutions, 40% of professors are not granted tenure, he said. By the time faculty members are tenured, they have already been tested. "Termination of tenured faculty anywhere you go in the United States is pretty rare," he said. Hummel also said a faculty member faced with the possibility of being fired might choose to resign instead, which would make the number lower than it would be if it included these cases. He did not have data on how many times this happened in the past 20 years. But Vos specifically used the word "fired," which means faculty dismissed for just cause. That doesn’t include resignations. Our rating Vos said the Chicago Bears have had more starting quarterbacks in the past 10 years than the number of UW faculty members who have been fired in the past 20 years. Six faculty members have been fired in the past two decades, while there have been nine different starting quarterbacks for the Bears in the past decade. We rate his claim True.

pomt-09553	"We cut property taxes by one-third."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/feb/03/rick-perry/perry-says-he-cut-property-taxes-one-third/	Talking about tax cuts can score a candidate big points, and Gov. Rick Perry didn’t let that opportunity sail by during the Jan. 14 GOP gubernatorial debate. When his record on jobs was attacked by both of his challengers, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Wharton businesswoman Debra Medina, Perry struck back. "We cut property taxes by one-third," he said. That sounds like a lot. We decided to check the numbers. First, some history. In 2006, the Legislature passed and Perry signed a tax overhaul that was intended to reduce property taxes paid to school districts. To help offset the revenue lost by the districts, lawmakers restructured the state’s business tax and raised the cigarette tax. During the debate, Perry's reference to cutting property taxes left out some key facts. For one, the cut applied only to school taxes, which means that all the other property taxes paid by Texans — including those going to cities and counties — were unaffected. Secondly, the Legislature reduced the tax rate, not Texans' total tax bills, by 33 percent. And thirdly, only one portion of the school property tax rate was affected — the part used for maintenance and operations. True, most of every dollar in school taxes goes for maintenance and operations. According to a 2008 report from the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a nonprofit business group, that accounted for about half of all property taxes levied in Texas in 2005, the year before the cuts began. But Perry’s shorthand statement that property taxes were cut by a third, which has been repeated by other politicians, is an oversimplification. Overall, school tax collections did decline 6.4 percent between 2005 and 2007, the year the cuts were fully implemented. And the portion collected for school maintenance and operations dropped $2.2 billion, a 12.5 percent decrease, according to the Texas Education Agency. However, most taxpayers focus on the bottom line of their tax bill. That's where we looked, too. We found that the total amount of local property taxes paid by Texans — to all the different taxing entities — actually rose nearly 5 percent from 2005. When all was said and done, taxpayers paid $1.6 billion more in 2007. We did find some support for Perry's claim in the 2008 report from the TTARA, titled "Property Tax Relief: The $7 Billion Reality." The report compared those 2007 property taxes with what it calculated Texans would have paid without a rate cut. The savings amounted to about $7 billion, it said. "The average Texan's total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been had there been no tax relief initiative," the report concludes. That still didn't get us to Perry's 33 percent (one-third) claim. Next, we went to the Texas Education Agency. It offered data showing that collections for school maintenance and operations taxes were indeed 30.2 percent lower in 2007 than the state projected they would have been without the tax cut. The problem is, taxpayers don't compare their tax bills to what they might have paid but to what they actually paid last time. Why didn't school taxes fall more between 2005 and 2007? Dale Craymer, president of the TTARA, said there are two major reasons. The first was a provision in the 2006 tax overhaul that gave school boards the option of voting to raise the maintenance and operations rate by a few cents for enrichment purposes. By 2007, more than 1,000 Texas school districts had done so, according to the TTARA report. That lessened the impact of the mandatory 33 percent rate reduction in those districts. Craymer said the second — and the most powerful — factor was rising property values. If values rise proportionately more than tax rates are cut, savings are negated and tax bills go up. In both 2006 and 2007, the total taxable value of property in Texas rose more than 10 percent each year. The association's report identified other reasons that the overall reduction in property taxes did not meet expectations: increases in the portion of school taxes dedicated to bond debt, as well as increases in taxes paid to cities, counties and other taxing districts. Summing up: In the debate, Perry failed to accurately characterize the tax cut passed in 2006 and its impact on Texans. Total property tax collections rose, not fell. And though it's estimated that Texans did receive significant tax savings compared with what they would have paid without the cuts, those savings were probably closer to 20 percent than 33 percent. We rate Perry's claim as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09889	The health care reform bill -- on Page 16 -- outlaws private insurance.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/22/ibdeditorialscom/private-health-insurance-page-16-house-bill/	We got several e-mails from readers asking if new health care legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives bans private health insurance for individuals. We tracked the statement back to its source, an editorial from Investor's Business Daily. "It didn't take long to run into an 'uh-oh' moment when reading the House's 'health care for all Americans' bill," the editorial says. "Right there on Page 16 is a provision making individual private medical insurance illegal." The editorial continues, "Under the Orwellian header of 'Protecting The Choice To Keep Current Coverage,' the 'Limitation On New Enrollment' section of the bill clearly states: 'Except as provided in this paragraph, the individual health insurance issuer offering such coverage does not enroll any individual in such coverage if the first effective date of coverage is on or after the first day' of the year the legislation becomes law." The editorial, published July 15, 2009, adds, "So we can all keep our coverage, just as promised — with, of course, exceptions: Those who currently have private individual coverage won't be able to change it. Nor will those who leave a company to work for themselves be free to buy individual plans from private carriers." Since then, the allegation about Page 16 has been repeated in many blogs and by at least one member of Congress. We read the section of the bill to which Investor's Business Daily referred, as well as a summary of the legislation provided by the House Ways and Means committee. While the quotation is correct, it's taken out of context. Individual private health insurance means coverage that someone buys on his or her own from a private company. In other words, it's for people who can't get coverage through work or some other group, and the rates tend to be much higher. Under the House bill, companies that offer insurance to individuals will do it through an exchange, where the government sets minimum standards for coverage. The new regulations require insurance companies to accept people even if they have previously existing conditions and to provide a minimum level of benefits, among other things. To be sure we were reading the bill correctly, we turned to an independent health care analyst at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. The foundation has analyzed the major health care proposals, including those of the Republicans, providing point-by-point analysis . Jennifer Tolbert, the foundation's principal policy analyst, told us that Page 16 doesn't outlaw private insurance. "There will be individual policies available, but people will buy those policies through the national health insurance exchange," she said. The House bill allows for existing policies to be grandfathered in, so that people who currently have individual health insurance policies will not lose coverage. The line the editorial refers to is a clause that says the health insurance companies cannot enroll new people into the old plans. The IDB editorial has caught the attention of some of the bill's most direct supporters. Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat who is guiding the legislation through Congress, wrote a letter to the publication saying the editorial was "factually incorrect and highly misleading." The conservative Heritage Foundation also said the editorial misread the legislation, writing on its Foundry blog, "So IDB is wrong: individual health insurance will not be outlawed." Heritage believes that the new regulations will be so onerous as to drive private insurance out of business "which is effectively the same thing." But that is a substantially different argument than what the editorial said. President Barack Obama had the chance to personally quash the IDB editorial himself when asked about it in a conference call with left-leaning bloggers. He said he wasn't familiar with the provision, before reiterating his general commitment to not forcing people out of health insurance that they like. (Impress your friends at parties by referring to the proper section on page 16 of the bill: It's Section 102.) In response to Waxman's letter, Investor's Business Daily says it's sticking to its guns. In a follow-up editorial, it said that private insurance offered on the exchange will be too regulated to be considered true private insurance, hence its original editorial is correct that the bill bans private insurance. This seems like a creative way of covering up a factual error, though. Many private companies are highly regulated but are still considered to be private. The original editorial said, "Right there on Page 16 is a provision making individual private medical insurance illegal." That's not what the legislation says. When the error was pointed out, a subsequent editorial said it was still true.

pomt-04182	"In recent years, menhaden numbers along our coast have plummeted by 90 percent."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/dec/14/pew-environment-group/pew-environment-group-says-atlantic-menhaden-popul/	The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission is scheduled to vote today, Dec. 14, on whether to cut the catch limit for Atlantic menhaden. Environmentalists say the menhaden population, a crucial part of the Atlantic ecosystem, has dropped to dangerous levels. Menhaden are an important food source for tuna, cod, striped bass, whales, dolphins, ospreys and eagles. Opponents of a strict limit, mostly from the fishing industry, say there are enough fish and the size of the population rises and falls naturally. The fish are used for fertilizer, bait, and fish-oil supplements. On Dec. 11, three days before the meeting, the Pew Environment Group ran a large ad in The Providence Journal headlined, "Governor Chafee: When this little fish disappears we're in big trouble." It talked about the importance of the species, adding, "But in recent years, menhaden numbers along our coast have plummeted by 90 percent." Fish counts are a contentious topic. After all, it's tough to do an inventory of undersea life, most of which you can't see. We wondered whether Pew’s number was accurate. We asked Pew for its source. Spokesman Jeff Young referred us to the 2011 Stock Assessment Report by the fisheries commission, a compact of 15 states that deals with fishing issues on the East Coast. Table 7.5 offers a complex calculation -- using lots of different data sources -- of the number of menhaden at the start of the year. The estimates go from 1955 to 2008. Young said biologists focus on the number of fish that had survived their first year, when they're more likely to be caught. We will do that as well. The estimates over the years show two peaks and two valleys. The population was high in the 1950s. It dropped precipitously and remained low in the 1960s. Then it started rising significantly, peaking from 1976 to 1989 before falling back to the 1960-ish range during the last two decades. Whether the population declined by 90 percent, as Pew asserts, depends on where you want to start calculating and when you want to stop. The Pew ad says the 90-percent decline was "in recent years." It gives no time frame. If you think of "recent" as the last 10 years, the drop from 1999 to 2008 has been 43 percent, far from 90 percent, according to the chart Pew referenced. Over the last 20 years, it's been 76 percent. To show a drop close to 90 percent, you have to start at 1982, when the estimated number of menhaden was 20.2 billion, the second-highest ever reported, and compare it with 2008, when the population was about 2.4 billion -- a drop of 88 percent. If you started with the first year of data -- 8.3 billion fish in 1955 -- and compared it with 2008, you’d have a decline of 71 percent. We found smaller percentages when we looked at the more recent commission report, from 2012, because it gives a higher number for the menhaden population for 2011, the most recent year the report looks at. Using that estimate, the decline since 1982 has been 82 percent. But Pew Environment's chief scientist Jud Crawford said the most recent report is considered less reliable because questions have been raised about the way the estimates were calculated. We also consulted with Mark Gibson, deputy chief of the marine fisheries division of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. "There's no question there's been a decline downward," he said. "But when you have a fish stock that varies up and down across time, you can cherry-pick your window across time, say it declined and get a whole bunch of people alarmed." Our ruling The Pew Environment Group said that "in recent years, menhaden numbers along our coasts have plummeted by 90 percent," a very specific number. It says overfishing must be halted to rebuild the population. The estimated number of menhaden is clearly well below the estimated population for the late 1980s. But it's currently at levels seen in the 1960s. If you want to claim a 90-percent drop, you have to compare the 2008 population to a very specific -- and very exceptional -- year, 1982. We don't consider a 30-year-old benchmark to be "recent." Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-10230	"I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/03/sarah-palin/she-killed-it-but-it-was-nearly-dead/	In a speech to the Republican National Convention on Sept. 3, 2008, Gov. Sarah Palin portrayed herself as a reformer who had cut waste in government. "I told Congress, 'Thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere," Palin said, echoing comments she made five days earlier when she was named John McCain's running mate. She was talking about a nearly $400-million Alaska bridge project that became the subject of national ridicule and a symbol of federal pork-barrel spending. The bridge was to connect the city of Ketchikan (population 8,200) to Gravina, an island with just 50 residents but also an airport, and only accessible by a five-minute ferry ride. The project came into national prominence when a government watchdog group tagged it as an extreme example of wasteful pork-barrel spending. Its national notoriety was cemented with a Parade magazine cover story that ran Nov. 6, 2005, under the headline, "Are Your Tax Dollars Being Wasted?" The project also raised bitter debate in Congress, and several attempts were made to yank funding for the project. In the fall of 2005, Congress removed the language specifically directing the money to the bridge, but it kept the money in place and left it up to Alaska to decide which transportation projects the state would like to spend it on. By the time Palin pulled the plug on the Gravina bridge project in September 2007, much of the federal funding for the bridge had already been diverted to other transportation projects. The bridge would cost $398-million, Palin said then, and Alaska was $329-million short. "Ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport, but the $398-million bridge is not the answer," Palin said. "Despite the work of our congressional delegation, we are about $329-million short of full funding for the bridge project, and it's clear that Congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between Ketchikan and Gravina Island." Lois Epstein, director of the Alaska Transportation Priorities Project, which opposed funding for the Gravina bridge, said while it's true that Palin formally put an end to the project, "It wasn't really a bold move when she did it." Although the project had local support in Ketchikan, Epstein said, it was not a popular project around the state. And had Palin decided to continue forward with the bridge project, she said, it would have required either a lot more federal funding - which there clearly was no support for - or for the state to pick up the bulk of the tab at the expense of other more urgent road projects. Keith Ashdown, a spokesman for Taxpayers for Common Sense, the government watchdog that first drew attention to the project, believes Palin has "hyperinflated her role" in killing the project. "She put the final stake in the project," Ashdown said. "But there was already tremendous momentum for the project to be scrapped. She gets credit for saying that they were not to go forward with the bridge, but it was at death's door." (We'll also note that Palin wasn't always a foe of the Bridge to Nowhere. In our Flip-O-Meter ruling, we conclude that her decision to kill the bridge was a Full Flop from the position she had taken while running for governor.) Today, when Palin says "I told Congress, 'Thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere," it implies Congress said, "Here's a check for that bridge" and she responded, "No thanks, that's wasteful spending; here's your money back." That's not what happened. Fact is, Alaska took the bridge money, and then just spent it on other projects. Palin did make the final call to kill plans for the bridge, but by the time she did it was no longer a politically viable project. We rule Palin's claim is Half True.

pomt-03183	Says Ken Cuccinelli supported a law that could allow people to carry missile launchers into airports.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/sep/03/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-cuccinelli-fought-law-banning-missi/	In Republican Ken Cuccinelli’s Virginia, people could walk through airports with loaded missile launchers. So says Terry McAuliffe, Cuccinelli’s Democratic opponent for governor. "In 2004, Ken Cuccinelli voted against making it a misdemeanor to carry a missile into an airport terminal," McAuliffe tweeted on Aug. 23. The tweet contains a picture of an airport sign with the silhouette of a loaded missile launcher. The sign says: "Attention Passengers Passengers are now permitted to carry missiles in Virginia airports. Your safety is our priority. --Gov. Ken Cuccinelli." Underneath the sign, McAuliffe wrote, "This is Cuccinelli’s Virginia." We checked whether Cuccinelli really has voted to allow armed missile launchers in airports. McAuliffe is not the only Democrat making this explosive claim. It began Aug. 19 when American Bridge 21st Century, a pro-Democrat PAC, tweeted, "Missiles in Airports? In 2004, Ken Cuccinelli voted against legislation to ban missiles and guns in airports in Virginia." That same day, an entity called Terry4Gov tweeted a doctored picture of a smiling, dark-haired, man with a heavy beard carrying a launcher on his shoulder in an airport terminal while a missile rises to his right, tailing smoke. Terry4Gov describes itself on Twitter as an "unaffiliated grassroots group." We tried to reach a spokesperson, but group does not offer any contact information. Brian Coy, a spokesman for the Democratic Party, said he does not know anything about Terry4Gov, other than it is not affiliated with the party or McAuliffe’s campaign. The basis for all the claims -- including McAuliffe’s tweet, four days after the others -- is a 2004 bill that banned bringing a "gun or other weapon designed or intended to propel a missile or projectile of any kind," into an airport terminal. That included any "frame, receiver, muffler, silencer, missile, projectile or ammunition designed for use with a dangerous weapon." Passengers checking firearms, law enforcement officials and approved airline employees were exempted. "Critics of the legislation fought unsuccessfully to exempt holders of concealed weapons permits," the Roanoke Times said in a March 13, 2004 article. That’s exactly where Cuccinelli, then a state senator, took issue with the legislation. He was concerned that the bill could prevent people with concealed carry permits from possessing their firearms at airport drop-off areas, according to Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for Cuccinelli’s gubernatorial campaign. Despite Cuccinelli’s opposition, the legislation passed the Senate on a 23-16 vote and was signed by then-Gov. Mark Warner. There are a few points to make about the bill. First, the state has limited jurisdiction over airports. It can legislate items that may be brought into a terminal, but once a person gets to security checkpoints, federal laws take over. According to Transportation Safety Administration rules, travelers may only transport unloaded firearms in a locked, hard-sided container as checked baggage. All firearms, ammunition and firearm parts, including firearm frames and receivers, are prohibited in carry-on baggage. Another point: The sign in McAuliffe’s tweet implies that state law defines "missile" as a warhead that’s fired from a rocket launcher. But Virginia’s code offers no definition of the term. State laws ban shooting or throwing missiles at vehicles, at or inside buildings and pointing or holding a weapon, including missiles, to induce fear. It also illegal to carry weapons, including missiles, into courthouses unless the person is a law enforcement official on duty. In 2007, Jessica Hall of Jacksonville, N.C. spent two months in a Virginia jail after angrily hurling a large McDonald’s cup filled with ice into the open window of another car in stalled traffic on I-95. Although no one was hurt, a Stafford County jury convicted Hall of maliciously throwing a missile into an occupied vehicle. According to an article in The Washington Post, the jury was instructed that "any physical object can be considered a missile. A missile can be propelled by force, including throwing." Finally, it should be noted that automatic firearms and other destructive devices, such as grenades and military-style missiles, are tightly regulated and difficult for individuals to acquire. Such weapons require registration under the National Firearms Act. The size of those weapons are restricted and someone interested in owning automatic firearms or any form of rocketry would need to find a registered dealer, undergo an extensive background check and pay federal taxes to do so. Our ruling McAuliffe, in a tweet bearing a picture of a loaded missile launcher, says "Cuccinelli voted against making it a misdemeanor to carry a missile into an airport." In 2004, Cuccinelli was one of 16 people in the 40-member state Senate that voted against a bill barring people from entering an airport terminal carrying a "gun or other weapon designed or intended to propel a missile or projectile of any kind." It can be argued that the description does encompass missile launchers, but that’s an interpretation that doesn’t weigh the debate at the time the bill was considered. A 2004 news article said Senate opponents were concerned that the bill undercut the rights of some gun owners. The article made no mention of missile launchers. McAuliffe’s tweet focuses on the term "missile" and suggests that the bill’s purpose was to ban warheads from airports. But the term "missile" is undefined in state law and could mean bullets, rocks, or even a cup of soda if it’s thrown maliciously. So there’s a trace of truth to a deeply distorted and inflamed statement by McAuliffe. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-05428	Some "20,000 Delphi salaried retirees lost up to 70 percent of their pensions" as a result of "political favoritism and backroom deals."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/30/michael-turner/michael-turner-says-political-favoritism-and-backr/	Editor's note: We updated this ruling in September 2013 after a report from the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program issued a report that revealed more about the Treasury Department's involvement. The claim now is rated Half True. The 2009 bailout of General Motors and Chrysler still resonates in political campaigns. President Barack Obama and his supporters say it helped revive the economies of states like Ohio. Critics including Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, say it saddled taxpayers with loans that still have not been paid back fully, and that market forces, not government intervention, should have been allowed to play out. We won’t attempt to settle that here. But there is another still-ripe issue from the bailout, concerning retiree pensions from a major parts supplier. Rep. Michael Turner, a Republican from Dayton, brought it up April 23 while speaking in support of Romney and responding to claims by the Obama team that the auto bailout was a success. Part of Turner’s rebuttal was this: "In the process" of the $80 billion auto rescue, "20,000 Delphi salaried retirees lost up to 70 percent of their pensions. Governor Romney will make decisions based on what’s best for the economy and for American workers, not based on political favoritism and backroom deals." Did 20,000 Delphi salaried employees lose part of their pensions, some as much as 70 percent? The short and general answer is yes. But tacked onto Turner’s statement was a claim of blame: While salaried and managerial employees of Delphi, a major parts supplier to General Motors, lost part of their pensions, unionized employees did not. The unions got a pension rescue -- which is what Turner, like other critics, meant by "political favoritism and backroom deals." This is a raging complaint among retirees of Delphi, which until 1999 was a GM division. It has turned into a political complaint as well, with the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform holding hearings and federal agencies investigating. Turner is a member of the House committee. To understand the issue, it helps to have some background. GM spun off Delphi as an independent company in 1999. It was risky and the unions, particularly the United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), knew it, so GM agreed to a guarantee. If Delphi faltered and the union pensions got cut, GM would "top up," or supplement, those smaller pensions so Delphi retirees could have the retirements they’d always expected. Not every union had this deal, nor did Delphi’s salaried workers. By making such a promise, GM bought a degree of labor peace and certainty, which was important because of the number of car components Delphi provided. A disruption by Delphi could bring GM production to a halt. Besides, Delphi’s pension plan for salaried workers was fully funded at the time, while it’s plan for hourly workers was not. Delphi did stumble financially, filing for bankruptcy protection in 2005. Because the company failed to make minimum contributions to its pension plans, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that insures pensions, placed liens to protect the pension plan assets. But a few of the unions still did not have to worry about reduced pension payments because of those earlier "top up" agreements, and in 2007, Delphi, GM and the unions signed agreements continuing the deals. As the Government Accountability Office noted in a detailed chronology of events, salaried workers still had no such deal. Delphi at this point was trying to find a buyer, and GM agreed to take control of $3.4 billion in net liabilities from Delphi’s hourly pension plan. But by 2008, the entire auto industry was struggling, and both Delphi and GM were in trouble. GM sought bankruptcy protection June 1, 2009. The Treasury Department by now was deeply involved, helping GM restructure with the use of government money (and taking stock in the restructured company as collateral). The Obama administration, like GM, wanted Delphi to survive because of its key role as a parts supplier. And both GM and Delphi needed buy-in from the UAW. So with consent from Treasury, a restructured GM agreed to continue the top-up agreement with Delphi’s UAW workers. By this point, Delphi had turned its pension plans over to the PBGC. One problem remained. GM also had top-up agreements with two other Delphi unions from the spin-off: the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers (IUE); and the United Steelworkers of America (USWA). Delphi needed consent from those two unions to finalize the sale of its assets to new owners and emerge from bankruptcy. And GM needed a solvent Delphi to keep parts coming to its factories. After reviewing court filings, testimony and other documents in order to provide what is arguably the most dispassionate analysis of the situation, the GAO said: Treasury wanted to assure the "sanctity" of GM’s supply chain with a post-bankruptcy Delphi (which itself was getting new owners). Failure to extend the top-up agreement to the other two unions would have stood in the way. And all three unions had long-standing top-up agreements, which salaried workers never had. So on Sept. 10, 2009, GM agreed to keep the top-up agreements of all three unions. Salaried workers who spent their careers at Delphi got no such deal, and they have seen their pensions cut. They have been fighting in court ever since, with lawmakers, including Turner, on their side. Was this political favoritism for the unions? A backroom deal? In researching this matter, PolitiFact Ohio read congressional testimony, news reports, government studies and websites with claims from all sides. We read allegations about coziness, or lack thereof, of certain players, such as GM and the UAW. But the evidence to date is thin when it comes to claims of unfairness from the Obama administration. The PBGC, the federal agency that rescues failing pension plans, played no role in influencing the GM decision to support the Delphi pensions through the three unions, according to testimony in November by agency’s deputy director, Vincent K. Snowbarger. But what about Treasury, which played a central role in negotiations? The most impartial answer we found was a GAO report from December 2011. It concluded that GM had strategic reasons to keep unionized auto parts workers happy, namely, the need for on-time parts delivery without disruption. But the GAO concluded that the Treasury Department, representing the Obama administration in the bailout, did not unduly influence this portion of the deal. Said the GAO: "As GM’s primary lender in bankruptcy, Treasury played a significant role in helping GM resolve the Delphi bankruptcy in terms of GM’s interests. Treasury’s guiding principle was to see the bankruptcy resolved with the least possible amount of investment by GM while still preserving GM’s supply chain. However, with regard to GM decisions about the Delphi pension plans — their sponsorship and the decision to honor existing top-up agreements — court filings and statements from GM and Treasury officials support that Treasury deferred to GM’s business judgment." This is unlikely to be the end of the matter. The inspector general for the Treasury Department’s Troubled Asset Relief Program is conducting its own audit to determine Treasury’s role in the top-up decision. It wants to know whether the administration or its automotive task force pressured GM to provide additional funding for the union pensions. That report is expected this summer. Meantime, we return to Turner’s claim: "In the process, 20,000 Delphi salaried retirees lost up to 70 percent of their pensions. Gov. Romney will make decisions based on what’s best for the economy and for American workers, not based on political favoritism and backroom deals." His statement contains some element of truth. The bad deal for the salaried retirees is not in dispute. Whether it resulted from political favoritism, however, is. And the GAO, the one truly nonpartisan entity to opine so far, suggests otherwise. That’s a critical fact that Turner’s claim ignores. We may return to this if warranted after the TARP inspector general’s work is done, but right now Turner leaves us with a statement that is accurate only in part. Based on what is known now, Turner’s claim It suggests a government role that neither he nor anyone else has nailed down. It’s his job to on the House oversight committee to get at the truth, but as a proxy for a presidential campaign, he reached conclusions that the Truth-o-Meter cannot support. On the Truth-O-Meter, his statement rates Mostly False.	None	Michael Turner	None	None	None	2012-04-30T06:00:00	2012-04-23	['None']

pomt-13612	Donald Trump is "against marriage equality. He wants to go back."	true	/new-york/statements/2016/aug/14/sean-patrick-maloney/donald-trump-against-same-sex-marriage/	U.S. Rep. Sean Maloney, D-N.Y., called out Donald Trump during a speech to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia for the Republican nominee's position on same-sex marriage. Maloney, who is openly gay and married, said Trump has opposed same-sex marriage and wants the Supreme Court to reverse its 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage throughout the United States. "It matters who’s leading the country, and it matters if they care," said Maloney, whose Hudson Valley congressional district includes all of Putnam and Orange counties, part of northern Westchester County and the southwest section of Dutchess County. "America, we have a choice. Donald Trump doesn’t care about some families. He’s against marriage equality. He wants to go back." Trump has been criticized for flip-flopping on social issues. Is Maloney right about the Republican candidate’s stance on same-sex marriage? Trump through the years The earliest reference from Trump on the issue that we could track down is an interview in The Advocate in 2000. At the time Trump was rumored to be considering a run for president. "I think the institution of marriage should be between a man and a woman," Trump said during the interview. He said he would favor a domestic partnership law that afforded same-sex couples the same benefits as married couples. Fast-forward to 2011 when Trump was again considering a run for the White House. He sat down for an interview with Bill O’Reilly on Fox News and talked about his position on same-sex marriage. "I just don't feel good about it," Trump said. "I don't feel right about it. I'm against it, and I take a lot of heat because I come from New York. You know, for New York it's like, how can you be against gay marriage? But I'm opposed to gay marriage." And, last year Trump said in an interview on CNN that he supported ‘traditional marriage.’ ‘He wants to go back’ Maloney’s claim was made in the context of the Supreme Court’s 2015 decision on same-sex marriage. Trump does not agree with the decision. He has said efforts to overrule the court through an amendment to the U.S Constitution are not realistic. He has said in interviews that he would have preferred the court leave the decision on same-sex marriage at the state level. Trump also suggested in at least one interview that he would consider appointing Supreme Court justices who would support reversing the ruling. Our ruling Speaking at the Democratic National Convention, Maloney said Trump is "against marriage equality" and "wants to go back" on the Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage decision. Trump has consistently opposed same-sex marriage in interviews since 2000. He also said he would consider appointing justices to the Supreme Court who would favor reversing the decision and leave the issue of same-sex marriage to the states. We rate this claim as True.

pomt-06136	Scott Walker’s school-aid cuts were so devastating that students are without chairs and a government survey found 47 kids in a classroom.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/23/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/greater-wisconsin-committee-says-cuts-school-aid-l/	Highlighting $800 million in school aid cuts in Wisconsin’s 2011-’13 budget, critics of Gov. Scott Walker are attacking what they view as serious side effects from his fiscal medicine. A TV ad by the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee uses interview clips to hammer Walker for backing business tax breaks while reducing state support for local schools. The speakers -- unidentified by name or position, but described by the group as teachers, parents or grandparents -- make claims about school staffing cuts and larger class sizes. Their claims are presented as more than random anecdotes; one source listed on the screen is a report issued by the state Department of Public Instruction, which oversees public education in Wisconsin. A few of the statements caught our attention -- and that of many readers: "My daughter has not enough tables and chairs in her room and she has kids sitting on the floor," a man says, sitting with a woman and two young girls in a restaurant. A citation flashes on the screen: the state budget bill. Then a young man standing outside says: "Forty-seven in a room, they don’t get much attention." An onscreen graphic reads, "Classes are overcrowded," and cites the aforementioned report issued by the Department of Public Instruction -- a widely publicized report summarizing a statewide survey of schools following the budget cuts. Together, they essentially make the same point: Walker’s school-aid cuts were so devastating that students are without chairs and a government survey found 47 kids in a classroom. Is the Greater Wisconsin Committee right? First, viewers may have seen slightly different versions of the Greater Wisconsin Committee ad -- at least three were produced and they all vary a bit. And we can’t show them to you here: The group does not post its ads online but released a script. We’ll test the specific anecdotes but also look at the statewide situation. The group argues the ad does not suggest that the anecdotes are representative of the situation statewide, but we disagree. The "not enough chairs" anecdote is presented as one family’s experience, but the "47 in a room" line is presented as a broad statement of fact, bolstered by the "classes are overcrowded" tagline and citation of a statewide survey as proof. And the GWC is paying for the ad, so it is responsible for the message that the individuals are conveying. When asked for backup, the group’s leader, Michelle McGrorty, cited the statewide survey published in November by the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators in conjunction with the state DPI, which is independent of the governor’s office. Previously, we rated two claims from that survey. We found False a statement by Walker that "the overwhelming number" of school districts reported their staff stayed the same or grew after the 2011-’13 state budget. And we also rated False a claim by the state’s largest teachers’ union that state budget cuts for schools resulted in nearly 4,000 educator layoffs. Let’s study up. Both sides have used the survey to argue their case on class sizes. The survey covered most schools, so it has value. At the same time, its conclusions have to be treated with caution because a district is counted as having higher class sizes even if only one grade was affected. There is no doubt that at least one class size went up in a significant number of cases. In elementary school, 42 percent of districts reported at least one class size increased. The middle school and high school data was more specific; 21 percent to 24 percent of core subject-area classes saw an increase in class sizes. Cutbacks in teaching staff in the wake of the state aid cuts played a role in increased class sizes, the survey found. Nearly two out of three districts (63 percent) reported a net loss of teachers. That’s what we know. What we don’t know -- and what the GWC cannot establish from the report -- is the size of the classes to bolster its "overcrowding" view. The survey did not ask how many kids were in classrooms, or how many more students were added to classrooms. It simply asked whether any class sizes had increased. Nowhere in its analysis of the survey does DPI describe the resulting class sizes as "overcrowded." According to WASDA and DPI officials, the survey did not attempt to get at whether school officials viewed their classes as overcrowded -- in part because it is a subjective term. The survey does not document any shortage of desks or chairs in classrooms either. Asked about the survey, McGrorty said the findings "definitely" mean there will be some overcrowding. But we contacted DPI and WASDA and another trade association and found no one claiming overcrowding or any specific increase in class size averages. WASDA has long tracked increased class sizes -- and says they are not a new phenomenon. Twenty years of state limits on school taxation have driven up class sizes for years, said Miles Turner, executive director of the group. He and others noted particularly that "specials" classes such as art and music have been combined as districts have laid off some of those teachers. Another statewide association, the Wisconsin Association of School Boards, said class size increase have not risen to "troublesome" levels. Judging whether a class is overcrowded depends on the grade level, the type of students, the subject and other factors, Turner and several school superintendents and administrators told us. We have none of that information from the ad. So the claim has plenty of problems. That leaves us with fact checking the specific anecdotes, but Greater Wisconsin -- which is funded by labor, Democratic Party groups and wealthy individual donors -- refuses to name the people or even cite the districts involved. McGrorty told us the group is concerned about potential harassment or threats of violence against the speakers. She also said the group was told that a school had to combine two classrooms because a teacher was laid off, and it lacked enough chairs. In the claims of classes increasing to 47, McGrorty contends it was a high school English class. We were not able to identify the districts. The statewide teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, said it couldn’t identify them either, but said it had received reports from members about increased class sizes. We also contacted schools in Milwaukee and Janesville, two districts hit hardest by budget cuts because they had teachers’ contracts in place and could not take advantage of health insurance and pension savings that Walker’s budget provided. Janesville told us class sizes were limited to 30 for most grades by school board policy. The board in December 2011 bumped that up to 32. A district spokesman could cite no overcrowding. In Milwaukee, the president of the teachers union, Robert Peterson, told us no survey had been done there but he was receiving numerous reports of larger class sizes -- more than 40 in some. District spokeswoman Roseann St. Aubin concurred in part: Class sizes vary from 17 to 41 depending on the type of class and students. But she said no comparable data was available for the year before. Class sizes did jump in schools that lost special funding due to budget cuts, she said. We heard that a gym class at Burroughs Middle School in Milwaukee had almost 50 kids. True, St. Aubin said, but two aides assist the teacher. We read a comment on a Fox Valley TV news story, apparently posted by a teacher, that claimed she lacked enough chairs for a kindergarten class. The district in question was Oshkosh, best we could tell. An official there said the classes had enough chairs; the teacher who apparently posted the comment did not return calls. Our conclusion In trying to show that Walker’s budget has caused school overcrowding, the Greater Wisconsin Committee misuses a survey of schools, cloaks its anecdotes in anonymity and provides no verification of its assertions. In our view, the ad’s message is that school crowding is common and dramatic, assertions not backed up by key school officials or the research cited. Class sizes have increased, and Walker’s budget is partly responsible, but that trend began before Walker, and other factors play in. In any case, that is not the same as "overcrowding" -- a description not even school and union officials are using. We may revisit this item if new evidence emerges, but these claims -- as presented -- are thin and misleading. We rate the claim False.

pomt-07829	The Muslim Brotherhood has "openly stated they want to declare war on Israel."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/15/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-muslim-brotherhood-wants-declare-w/	One of the thorniest questions to emerge from the tumult in Egypt has been what to make of the Muslim Brotherhood. Western observers have characterized the enigmatic group -- also called Al-Ikhwān -- as everything from democratic reformers to Islamic Socialists bent on global dominion. On his Fox News Channel program for Feb. 4, 2011, Glenn Beck wrapped up five days of frightening Egypt forecasts with this blunt assessment: "We told you this week how if (President Hosni) Mubarak does step down, however, the Muslim Brotherhood would be the most likely group to seize power. They've openly stated they want to declare war on Israel and they would end the peace agreement with Israel and they would work towards instituting something we told you about, a caliphate." That’s a lot to unpack. We decided to check Beck’s claim that the Brotherhood has "openly stated they want to declare war on Israel," because so much of the debate in the United States revolves around the Muslim Brotherhood's intentions toward the main U.S. ally in the region. Beck neglected to name a source in that Feb. 4 broadcast, so we took a look through the rest of his transcripts for the week. Sure enough, three days earlier he informed viewers that "a top official in the Muslim Brotherhood has just said that … ‘The people should be prepared for war against Israel.’" Who was that top official? Beck’s website pointed to a Feb. 1, 2011, item in the Jerusalem Post that had a "leading member" of the Brotherhood, Muhammad Ghannem, declaring that "the people should be prepared for war against Israel." The next day a Washington Times editorial picked up the quote, saying it "succinctly summed up" the Muslim Brotherhood's foreign policy. Then Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., repeated the fiery words in a floor speech. The Jerusalem Post piece cited an interview Ghannem gave to an Arabic-language Iranian network, Al-Alam. With deft use of Google Translate we were able to verify that Ghannem was quoted saying something along those lines in a Jan. 31, 2011, piece on Al-Alam’s website. The key question then becomes whether Ghannem can speak for the sprawling Muslim Brotherhood. "I have never heard of him," said Dr. Jason Brownlee, an associate professor in the Department of Government at the University of Texas and a scholar with the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. "It’s a big organization, and there may be people who say things like that, but that doesn’t mean it’s policy. It doesn’t jibe with my experience visiting Egypt and doing research on the Muslim Brotherhood for over a decade." Three other experts on the Muslim Brotherhood all agreed. "The MB is a massive organization with many different ideological trends within it," explained Dr. Joshua Stacher, a political scientist at Kent State. "I have never heard anyone on or off the record say they ‘wish to declare war on Israel.’ " None were familiar with Ghannem, who we confirmed is not among the the Brotherhood’s policy elite, the 16-member Guidance Bureau. Still, there’s no doubt that the Brotherhood officially condemns Israel, its neighbor across the Sinai Peninsula. According to a report on the group’s own website, a controversy erupted in 2007 when spokesman Essam El-Erian was quoted in London-based paper Al-Hayat saying that the Brotherhood would recognize Israel if it came to power. In response, then-Supreme Guide Mohamed Mahdy Akef clarified that "the Brotherhood does not and will never recognize Israel. ... Israel does not exist in the Brotherhood’s dictionary." El-Erian maintained that he had been misquoted and was only calling for a referendum on the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. That’s still the official line since the protests in Tahrir Square began. At a press conference in Cairo on Feb. 9, 2011, El-Erian and Mohammed Musri -- both of whom do sit on the Brotherhood’s Guidance Bureau -- declared that the group respects the treaty and any changes would be up to a democratically elected government. Brownlee pointed out that many Egyptians believe the 1979 treaty lacks legitimacy; it passed with nearly unanimous approval in what was seen as a fraudulent vote. Opinions vary as to how it would fare today, but, as George Washington University professor Nathan Brown pointed out, revoking a peace treaty is a far cry from declaring war. In a Feb. 2 interview on NPR’s All Things Considered, El-Erian confirmed that view. He called again for revising the terms of the treaty but, asked what that would mean, dismissed fears of armed conflict. "Oh, no threat of war," El-Erian told Robert Siegel. "The people are not pushing for war. But it is not our duty to protect Israel from Palestinians. We are not guards for Israel." So some members of the Muslim Brotherhood may be calling for war. But the ones who say that don’t speak for the group; and the ones who do speak for the group, don’t say that. We rate Beck’s claim False.

pomt-14625	When a Gallup poll asked about presidential candidate characteristics, "When they get to the question on, 'Would you vote for a socialist,' it is even less popular than voting for atheists."	true	/punditfact/statements/2016/jan/29/jennifer-granholm/jennifer-granholm-says-americans-would-rather-elec/	Is Democrat Bernie Sanders going to suffer in the polls because he calls himself a socialist? Jennifer Granholm, the former Democratic governor of Michigan and a Hillary Clinton backer, thinks so. During the Jan. 24 edition of ABC's This Week, she said "the word socialist is a really hard word" for voters. "Now, I love Bernie Sanders, really, I appreciate the fact that he's bringing out young people. But when you look at that word ‘socialist,’ the Gallup poll did an analysis of what are the characteristics that people would vote for in a president. 'Would you vote for a Mormon?' 'Would you vote for a Jew?' 'Would you vote for a Catholic?' When they get to the question on would you vote for an atheist, it is -- or, excuse me, a socialist, it is even less popular than voting for atheists," Granholm said. "That is why it's an issue." Because the polls say that Sanders is giving Clinton a run for her money, we wondered whether calling yourself a socialist really carries the type of stigma that Granholm described. We contacted Granholm's office but didn't hear back. The Gallup poll in question is a survey of 1,527 adults in June 2015. The survey found 47 percent of respondents would vote for a socialist presidential candidate nominated by their party even if the candidate was "generally well-qualified." Fifty percent would not. An atheist candidate would be tolerable to only 58 percent, with 40 percent saying they would not vote for any atheist candidate. Here's the list: Willingness to vote for a qualified candidate who is . . . a Catholic 93% Jewish 91% a Muslim 60% a woman 92% a Mormon 81% an atheist 58% black 92% gay or lesbian 74% a socialist 47% Hispanic 91% an evangelical Christian 73% Survey taken June 2-7, 2015 In a similar vein, a 2010 Fox News survey found that while only 39 percent of Americans would be comfortable with having an atheist on the Supreme Court, support for a socialist was even lower — 31 percent. Yet if Americans have such antipathy to socialists, why is Sanders, a self-declared socialist, doing so well? For one thing, Sanders makes it clear that he's not a socialist in the old Soviet Union sense. He often calls himself a democratic socialist who talks about the type of socialism seen in the Scandinavian countries, where the political system is democratic. His socialism is often in line with what would be considered strong liberal beliefs. PolitiFact explored the issue in detail in August 2015. Scott Clifford, a political scientist as the University of Houston, said it's important to remember that each person surveyed was "asked not about support for atheists/socialists in general, but in the context of their own party nominating one." So Democrats will be more open to socialist ideas because the party tends to be liberal, "home to secular Americans," he said. The Republican Party tends to be home to more evangelicals and other religious traditionalists, Clifford said by email, so Republicans would be naturally wary of a nominee who is a socialist. "After all, a Republican socialist is effectively an oxymoron in modern American politics," he said. That was clear when Gallup broke the results into party lines. Willingness to vote for Democrats Republicans Difference An evangelical Christian 66% 84% 18 points An atheist 64% 45% 19 points A gay or lesbian 85% 61% 24 points A Muslim 73% 45% 28 points A socialist 59% 26% 33 points John Geer, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University, said there are a lot of misunderstandings about the term socialist, "so the survey questions you have in Gallup are probably not very indicative of the amount of support socialists might have." The term "socialist" may lose some of its sting because Sanders offers it as a solution to voters’ concerns, such as income inequality, he said. He is also highlighting the idea that other industrialized countries that have embraced socialism are doing better on matters such as health care, "and people are giving him high marks for dealing with the (socialist) question directly and not trying to hedge," Geer said. Whether Sanders can change the country's aversion to actually voting for a socialist remains to be seen. Our ruling Granholm said a Gallup survey found that the idea of voting for a socialist for president is even less popular than voting for an atheist. That's precisely what was found in the poll, the first time Gallup has asked about socialist presidential candidates. We rate the claim as True.

pomt-08972	Providence has "the lowest crime rate in three decades."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/19/david-cicilline/cicilline-says-providence-crime-rate-lowest-30-yea/	Providence Mayor David Cicilline has made Providence's falling crime rate one of the key selling points in his campaign in the 1st Congressional District. He repeated it during the July 13 debate with his three Democratic challengers, saying the city now has "the lowest crime rate in three decades." In addition, the mayor's website says, "Under his leadership, Providence has seen crime drop to its lowest rate in 30 years." We asked the campaign for numbers to support that assertion. They provided statistics collected by the Providence Police Department on various crimes going back to 1960. Cicilline is basing the claim on the sum of all reports of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft, which the police call the "crime index." Those numbers show that in 2009, there were 9,252 such crimes reported in the capital city. The last time the number was that low was in 1965, when 8,521 crimes were logged in those categories. That's a span of 44 years. So by that measure, Cicilline's claim is understated. The annual number of reported crimes hasn't been this low in more than four decades, not three. But is the mayor's leadership responsible for that decline? When we invited Karen Watts, the mayor's director of communications, to address that issue, she responded in an email that, "I think I'll just let the facts speak for themselves." We compared the rise and fall of crimes in Providence to the national pattern, using numbers from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Justice. Over the years, the Providence trends have been very similar to the U.S. numbers. The number of crime reports rose steadily, except for some sporadic dips, throughout the 1960s, '70s and '80s. Around 1990, things began to change. Nationally, the numbers began a gradual decline. Chris Menton, a professor of criminal justice at Roger Williams University, said there are lot of theories for the trend, but one of the most solid holds that when there are more young people in a population, the crime rate is higher. Beginning in the 1960s, the Baby Boomers were of an age where they were more likely to get into trouble and, in reaction, "our tolerance for deviant behavior went down." That upward trend changed after the early '90s because the population was older and a booming economy meant more jobs, which helps keep younger people out of trouble. Locally, the numbers fell dramatically, beginning around the time then-Mayor Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr. began his second administration. Then, during Cianci's final three years, before he went to prison on a federal corruption charge, crime made a sharp spike upward again, a trend that was far more muted on the national level. It was after this 2001-2002 peak that Cicilline took over and - with the exception of a bump in 2008 when the number of incidents went up by 6 percent over the previous year - the number of reported crimes has fallen steadily. So the decline in the number of crimes reported in Providence coincides with a similar, although much less steep, decline nationally. In other words, whatever effect Cicilline or his administration might have had on the crime rate, national forces were likely at work as well. A few other issues complicate this analysis. For example, Cicilline is talking about the crime rate when the number his administration is using is the total number of crime reports, which is different. But when we looked closely, we found that those issues didn't actually affect the conclusion. For a discussion of those factors, CLICK HERE. In the end, the number of incidents of crime in Providence has declined since Cicilline took office and the number of incidents reported in 2009 is the lowest in 44 years, which makes the mayor's claim seem modest. Even though the ebb and flow of crime reports roughly mirrors what's been going on in the rest of the nation, and it's not clear how much he or his administration is directly responsible for a rate that began dropping during the second Cianci administration, we rate his statement as True.

pomt-13291	Says Hillary Clinton "viciously" attacked women abused by Bill Clinton.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-viciously-attack/	Donald Trump said at the second presidential debate that his lewd 2005 comments were "locker room talk," but what Bill and Hillary Clinton did was much worse. "If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse," Trump said Oct. 9, 2016. "Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he's done to women. There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women." Trump then criticized Hillary Clinton. "Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight." Here we’re fact-checking Trump’s claim that Hillary Clinton "viciously" attacked women who say they were abused by Bill Clinton. What we found is that Hillary Clinton has been accused of threatening or shaming accusers of Bill Clinton. But all the accusations remain unproven, as do the specific allegations against Bill Clinton. In most cases, evidence Hillary Clinton intervened in any significant way doesn’t exist. An error in Trump’s counting Before we explain the case with each accuser, a small note. While Trump invited four women to the debate at Washington University in St. Louis, only three of them -- Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones -- accuse Bill Clinton of sexual assault. The fourth woman, Kathy Shelton, was a victim in a rape case. Hillary Clinton defended Shelton’s attacker while working at a University of Arkansas legal aid clinic. You can read our fact-check related to that incident here. Hillary Clinton and Juanita Broaddrick In 1978, Juanita Broaddrick managed a nursing home in Arkansas. During the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, Broaddrick came forward to say that he had raped her in her hotel room in 1978. Broaddrick also said that she believed Hillary Clinton knew about the rape and tried to intervene. She described an encounter to the conservative website Breitbart. Broaddrick said that soon after the alleged event took place, she went to a Democratic fundraiser that the Clintons attended. Broaddrick said Hillary Clinton approached her. Clinton said, "I just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate the things you do for him. Do you understand? Everything you do," Broaddrick recounted. Broaddrick told Breitbart, "What really went through my mind at that time is ‘She knows. She knew. She’s covering it up and she expects me to do the very same thing.’" Broaddrick did not go public with her story, even going so far as to deny that the rape occurred in a sworn deposition (as part of the Paula Jones case). Two decades later though, investigators with independent counsel Ken Starr approached her and she told it all. Ultimately, Starr’s team decided there was "inconclusive evidence" to press charges. We found no evidence of Hillary Clinton viciously attacking Broaddrick, as Trump claimed, nor is there independent confirmation of the exchange at the fundraising event. Also, in a 1999 interview with NBC News, Broaddrick was asked if Bill Clinton or anyone close to him had ever done anything to keep her silent. Broaddrick said, "No." Kathleen Willey In 1993, Kathleen Willey was a Clinton supporter and a volunteer at the White House. Willey said that when she went to the president to ask for a paid position, he groped her. Willey, now a Trump supporter, has said that Hillary Clinton "wrote the book on terrorizing women." Willey described what she believed to be efforts to intimidate her in an interview with the conservative website Daily Caller. That list included "a dead cat found on her porch, a man she saw at night under her deck, and a stranger in her remote neighborhood inquiring threateningly about how her children were doing." Willey also mentioned being told that Clinton insider Sidney Blumenthal said about her, "She may look good today … she’s not going to look good by Friday." In the course of responding to a lawsuit in 1999, Blumenthal did say Hillary Clinton played some sort of role in the White House response to Willey’s allegations. She approved the public release of letters Willey had sent after the alleged event. The letters were characterized as "friendly" and, according to Blumenthal, Clinton thought they would undermine Willey’s credibility because the tone was at odds with the episode she described. We reached out to Willey to get more details but have yet to hear back. Paula Jones In 1994, Arkansas state worker Paula Jones accused Bill Clinton of making an unwanted sexual advance. Clinton ultimately paid $850,000 to settle with Jones without admitting guilt. Jones has harsh words for Hillary Clinton. She said Clinton was out to discredit her. "She don’t care nothing about women. Because if she did she would believe what I had to say," Jones told Breitbart. Jones said Clinton was an enabler of her husband’s transgressions. After Jones sued Bill Clinton, his legal team questioned her and looked into her background. But, again, we found no evidence Hillary Clinton attacked Jones. The closest was in 1998 when Clinton said she felt that Jones’ lawsuit was part of a larger political agenda. Other allegations Long-time Washington journalist Carl Bernstein wrote in his biography of Hillary Clinton A Woman in Charge that in the 1992 campaign Hillary Clinton directed a special "defense team" to deal with allegations about "Bill’s history with the Selective Service System, women claiming to have had affairs with him, and other personal aspects of the Clintons’ lives." One aide was sent to Little Rock, Ark., to dig for facts about the most worrying revelation from Gennifer Flowers, a woman who claimed to have had a long affair with Bill Clinton. The campaign hired a detective to look into the backgrounds of any women who had come forward. The Trump campaign pointed to a New York Times article that described the work of that detective. The newspaper reported that in a memo, the detective said he would impugn Flowers’ "character and veracity until she is destroyed beyond all recognition." Importantly, however, while Flowers claimed she had an affair with Bill Clinton, she did not claim she was abused. In a 1992 interview, Clinton herself called Flowers "some failed cabaret singer who doesn’t even have much of resume to fall back on." And on another occasion, she said if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, she "would crucify her." But the same New York Times article quotes a statement provided earlier this month by the Hillary Clinton campaign from James Carville, the 1992 campaign’s top strategist. "Hillary wanted us to defend the governor against attacks," the statement said. "It’s just ridiculous to imagine that she was somehow directing our response operation. That was my job, not hers." ABC News host George Stephanopoulos served as the communications director in Clinton’s 1992 campaign. Stephanopoulos wrote in All Too Human, that when Connie Hamzy, one of the first women to claim a sexual encounter with Bill, came forward Hillary said, "We have to destroy her story." Hamzy said Bill Clinton propositioned her, but she didn’t object. Lastly, no account of Bill Clinton’s transgressions would be complete without mentioning one-time White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Lewinsky aimed to get the attentions of the president and succeeded. When Lewinsky’s story came to light through the Starr investigation, Hillary Clinton forcefully rejected that there was any truth to it. Clinton basically wrote it off as part of "this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president." When Hillary Clinton said that, Lewinsky was still publicly denying her affair with the president. Our ruling Trump said that Hillary Clinton "viciously" attacked women who accused Bill Clinton of abuse. Bill Clinton certainly has been accused of sexual assault and having affairs. The record shows Hillary Clinton played a role in defending her husband, and that the Clintons’ first presidential campaign deployed tough tactics to defend against stories of consensual sex. But in the cases of alleged abuse by Broaddrick, Willey and Jones, Hillary Clinton was largely silent. The words she allegedly had with Broaddrick are subject to interpretation. Approving the release of Willey’s letters does qualify as an attack, but using a person’s words against them is a fairly tame tactic. And Clinton did not attack Jones directly. Overall, we rate the claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-10T12:45:17	2016-10-09	['Bill_Clinton']

pomt-04899	Says Congressman Jon Runyan does not want to cut taxes for the middle class, but only for millionaires.	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/05/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-ad-campaign-targets-house-republicans-wanting/	Between images of a supermarket employee and a wealthy guy sitting in a robe outside his mansion, a new Democratic ad campaign goes after House Republicans for apparently supporting tax breaks for millionaires, but not the middle class. With a series of videos posted on YouTube last week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is targeting 23 GOP House members, including New Jersey’s Jon Runyan (R-3rd). Runyan is seeking reelection in November against Democratic challenger Shelley Adler. The campaign aims to "expose" the representatives "who are about to vote for another tax cut for millionaires at the expense of the middle class and seniors," the committee said Monday in a news release. Each online ad starts off like this: "Good news! Republicans want to cut your taxes. Not you," the narrator says as an image of the supermarket employee appears on the screen. "You!" the narrator continues, as the ad shifts to an image of the wealthy guy outside his mansion, followed by images of a yacht, private jet and waterfront home. "And you deserve a break -- after all, these things are expensive." Returning to images of middle-class folks, the narrator later adds: "This guy? Her? They don’t need it. They’ll just buy groceries and pay the mortgage." The ad targeting Runyan ends with this on-screen message: "Tell Congressman Jon Runyan -- Stop putting millionaires over the middle class." Here’s the problem with these ads: the proposal from House Republicans would extend tax cuts for all income levels -- not just millionaires. This Democratic campaign centers on the pending expiration of federal income tax cuts first enacted under President George W. Bush, and commonly known as the "Bush tax cuts." The lower income tax rates were originally set to expire at the end of 2010, but President Barack Obama and Congress later extended them through the end of 2012. Democrats have been pushing a bill that extends the tax cuts through 2013 for individuals with income below $200,000 and married couples earning less than $250,000. Republicans want to extend the Bush tax cuts for all Americans. In a 256-171 vote on Wednesday, the GOP-controlled House approved a Republican bill that extends all of the tax cuts through 2013. Runyan and the other 22 representatives targeted by the DCCC campaign voted for the bill. Higher-income households would see greater tax savings under this Republican proposal, compared with other households. Still, it’s wrong for the DCCC to suggest the GOP only wants to cut taxes for millionaires. In response to our findings, DCCC spokesman Josh Schwerin said in an e-mail: "If Congressman Runyan wanted to give the middle class a tax cut he wouldn’t be holding it hostage in order to get more tax cuts for millionaires." But unlike the Democrats’ plan, the House Republicans’ bill would not extend five other tax policies benefiting lower-income households, which are separate from the Bush tax cuts. Those provisions -- which were first included in the economic stimulus bill approved by Obama in 2009 -- include an income tax credit worth up to $2,500 to offset higher education costs. "The (House) GOP bill would continue most of the tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of the year but would allow the Obama tax cuts enacted in 2009 and extended in 2010 to expire," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. "The latter would raise taxes on some families, mostly those with low income." Our ruling In an online ad campaign, the DCCC suggests Runyan and other House Republicans support a bill that cuts taxes for millionaires, but not the middle class. It’s true that the House Republicans’ bill would not extend certain tax benefits originally included in the stimulus package, but the legislation would extend the Bush tax cuts across all income levels, thereby giving all taxpayers a break.

pomt-12864	The language that's part of the president's National Security Council memo "is identical to the language" used by President George W. Bush in 2001 and President Barack Obama in 2009.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/31/sean-spicer/spicers-misleading-claim-trumps-national-security-/	Following outcry over a reported shakeup of the National Security Council, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said stories about demoting the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National Intelligence were "utter nonsense." President Donald Trump has been criticized in the media for politicizing the council by adding chief strategist Steve Bannon. Spicer, in his daily press briefing on Jan. 30, 2017, pushed back by claiming that the presidential memorandum announcing the makeup of the council hadn’t really changed dramatically. "The language that's part of the president's memo is identical to the language for Presidents Bush's 2001," Spicer said, holding up copies of the various memos (around the 6:55 mark of this video). "The only thing that's changed in this is the addition of the Director of National Intelligence as a position that didn't exist in 2001. For what it's worth, it's the same as Obama's, save for the word ‘also.’ " For those who don’t know, the National Security Council was established in 1947 and gathers foreign and domestic policy and military officials to advise the president on national security. The two issues with Trump’s restructuring concern the makeup of the full council and its principals committee, a subset of senior officials that is also "literally 100 percent the same," according to Spicer. So is Spicer right that the Bush, Obama and Trump memos are nearly "identical"? We read Bush’s 2001 memo, Obama’s 2009 memo and Trump’s 2017 memo, and found that Spicer’s claim is misleading. The regular council Spicer is right about the makeup of the full National Security Council, albeit in a limited way. This sentence — "The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as statutory advisers to the NSC, shall also attend NSC meetings" — appears pretty much verbatim in each president’s memo. (The Director of National Intelligence was a position created in 2004, so Bush’s memo says the CIA Director instead.) But in a broader sense, Spicer is off the mark. Each president has invited different government officials to sit on the council, but neither Bush nor Obama added his chief strategist. Trump appears to be the only president since the establishment of the council to include his, Bannon, according to a Congressional Research Service report. By statute, the members of the council are the president, vice president, secretary of state, secretary of defense and, as of 2007, secretary of energy. As noted in the memos, the chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff and National Security Advisor are statutory advisers. Here are the additional members each president has requested to join the council (positions unique to each president are bolded): Bush 2001 Obama 2009 Trump 2017 "Regular attendees" or "members" • Secretary of treasury • National security adviser • Secretary of treasury • National security adviser • Secretary of homeland security • Homeland security adviser • Representative to the United Nations • Chief of staff • Deputy national security adviser • Secretary of treasury • National security adviser • Secretary of homeland security • Homeland security adviser • Representative to the United Nations "Invited to attend any meeting" • Chief of staff • Economic adviser • Counsel to the president • Chief of staff • Chief strategist (Bannon) • Counsel to the president • Deputy counsel for national security • Director of the Office of Management and Budget Invited when appropriate • Counsel to president • Attorney general • Director of the Office of Management and Budget • Secretary of commerce • U.S. Trade representative • Economic adviser • Chair of Council of Economic Advisors • Homeland security adviser • Director of the Office of Science and Technology • Secretary of commerce • U.S. Trade representative • Economic adviser The principals committee Similarly, Bannon’s addition to the principals committee undercuts Spicer’s claim that the senior interagency group, first established by former President George H.W. Bush in 1989, is "literally 100 percent the same." Trump’s memo reads: "The Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed." Again, barring the inclusion of the Director of National Intelligence, that is verbatim the language of Bush’s 2001 memo: "The Director of Central Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall attend where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed." But Obama’s 2009 memo makes clear that Director of National Intelligence and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are "regular members" of the committee. And again, the chief strategist was not a member in either Bush’s or Obama’s committees (or George H.W. Bush’s or Bill Clinton’s). Here’s a breakdown of the organization of the principals committee under each president (positions unique to each president are bolded): Bush 2001 Obama 2009 Trump 2017 "Regular attendees" or "members" • Secretary of state • Secretary of treasury • Secretary of defense • National security adviser • Chief of staff • Secretary of state • Secretary of treasury • Secretary of defense • National security adviser • Chief of staff • Secretary of homeland security • Representative to the United Nations • Director of the Office of Management and Budget • Director of national intelligence • Chairman of the joint chief of staff • Secretary of state • Secretary of treasury • Secretary of defense • National security adviser • Chief of staff • Secretary of homeland security • Chief strategist (Bannon) • Homeland security adviser Invited to or shall attend all meetings • Vice president • Deputy national security adviser • Deputy national security adviser • Deputy secretary of state • Counsel to the president • National security adviser to the Vice President • Deputy national security adviser • Counsel to the president • National security adviser to the Vice President • Director of the Office of Management and Budget • Deputy counsel for national security • Executive secretary Invited when appropriate • CIA director • Chairman of the joint chief of staff • Attorney general • Director of the Office of Management and Budget • Counsel to President • Secretary of commerce • U.S. Trade Representative • Economic adviser • Secretary of Agriculture • Secretary of commerce • U.S. Trade representative • Economic adviser • Chair of Council of Economic Advisors • Homeland security adviser • Director of the Office of Science and Technology • Director of national intelligence • Chairman of the joint chief of staff • Secretary of commerce • U.S. Trade representative • Economic adviser • Representative to the United Nations • Intergovernmental and technology initiatives adviser Our ruling Spicer said, "The language that's part of the president's memo (on the National Security Council) is identical to the language for Presidents Bush's 2001" as well as President Obama’s 2009. We reached out to the Trump administration but did not hear back. Spicer is right in a limited sense: each memo specifies that the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Director of National Intelligence are statutory advisers to the regular council. While both the Bush and Trump memos stipulated they attend principals committee meetings when appropriate, both were regular members of the subcommittee under Obama. Trump also includes one major departure from both Bush and Obama: adding the position of chief strategist as a member of both the regular council and principals committee.

pomt-05212	"We spend in tax loopholes annually $1.1 trillion. That's more than we spend on our defense budget in a year, on Medicare or Medicaid in a year."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/08/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-tax-loopholes-total-11-trillio/	Military and entitlement spending may be among the country’s biggest expenses. But, with more than $1 trillion in tax revenue sacrificed each year, cutting expenses may not be the only way to solve the country’s deficit woes, according to U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. "We spend in tax loopholes annually $1.1 trillion," Shaheen said during a May 31, 2012 meeting with The Telegraph editorial board. "That’s more than we spend on our defense budget in a year, on Medicare or Medicaid in a year. … So we’ve got to deal with the revenue side because we just can’t get there (with spending cuts alone)." Tax loopholes have generated a lot of discussion during the election season, which has been dominated by discussion of the wealthiest 1 percent versus the other 99 percent. But, the premise that the U.S. gives away $1.1 trillion in loopholes is an intriguing concept. PolitiFact decided to take a look. To start, we reached out to Shaheen’s office, which pointed us to the White House. As part of its Fiscal Year 2013 budget proposal, the White House’s Office of Management and Budget keeps a spreadsheet of tax expenditures, which includes all tax exclusions, exemptions, deductions and credits, among other revenue losses, do match Shaheen’s $1.1 trillion figure, adding up to $1.172 trillion to be exact. That number does exceed the entire defense budget. For Fiscal Year 2013, the White House projects $700 billion in defense spending - down from $709 billion in FY2012 and up from 699 in FY2011, according to the President’s 2013 budget proposal. The $1.1 trillion figure also beats out the numbers for Medicare and Medicaid, as Shaheen claimed. According to the budget proposal, the country will spend $528 billion on Medicare in 2013, along with $283 billion on Medicaid. So, the numbers line up. But, does the language? Do the tax expenditures meet Shaheen’s characterization of loopholes? That leaves more room for debate. According to the White House, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 defines tax expenditures as "revenue losses attributable to provisions of the Federal tax laws which allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or which provide a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability." In short, expenditures include all deductions, exemptions, credits and other programs that lead to revenue losses from the tax system. But are those really loopholes? For example, can the popular home mortgage deduction -- a key part of most families' 1040s -- be considered a loophole? Contacted later, Shaheen's office referred to the Webster’s Dictionary definition of "loophole," which defines the term as "a means of evading an obligation," according to Jonathan Lipman, her communications director. "All tax expenditures, by definition, allow taxpayers to avoid paying the full tax rate," Lipman wrote in an e-mail to the Telegraph. But, some tax analysts take a different view. The list of tax exemptions certainly includes many ways for individuals and businesses to evade their tax obligations. But they also include many basic elements of our tax system, according to Donald Marron, director of the Tax Policy Center, an analyst group led by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. These include exemptions for social security benefits, state and local taxes, veterans pensions and employee benefits, among hundreds of others. To do away with these expenditures would be to rewrite major facets of the federal tax structure, said Marron, former interim director of the Congressional Budget Office, who wrote the article "How Large Are Tax Expenditures? A 2012 Update." "Some tax expenditures are loopholes, but a lot of them are very broad economic or social policies," he said. "They’re fundamental choices about how we choose to define our tax system." For example, removing the tax exclusion for employer health insurance contributions could take more from workers’ paychecks, and eliminating the deduction for interest on student loans could drive students deeper into debt. "(Loophole) is a very common term used on both sides, but I think, when people look behind what those expenditures were, that's not what comes to mind," added Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Our ruling: The official definition aside, we think loophole conjures images of a narrow tax break that gives a special -- and, in many cases, unfair -- advantage to a specific constituency. But we don't think the entire list of tax deductions, exemptions, credits fits that definition. She's right about the total cost of those "expenditures," but her definition of loophole is a big stretch. We rate Shaheen’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-14313	"The EPA has tried to define a puddle or a drainage ditch on your farm to be navigable waters and thus subject to massive environmental regulations."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/mar/31/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-epa-tried-regulate-puddles-and-drain/	Ted Cruz says the Environmental Protection Agency has gone overboard in regulating farms by regulating even puddles and ditches. "They're hurting from a federal government whose policies have been making it harder and harder for farmers to survive. They're hurting from an EPA who is imposing massive burdens on farms," Cruz said in a March 29 CNN town hall in Milwaukee, Wis. "For example, the Waters of the United States Rule (is) where the EPA has tried to define a puddle or a drainage ditch on your farm to be navigable waters and thus subject to massive environmental regulations." Are puddles and drainage ditches regulated by the EPA? We’ll wade through the research to find out. A Cruz spokesman did not answer our questions for this fact-check. What a water rule said about puddles The Clean Water Act passed in 1972 after high-profile disasters and pollution problems, including the Cuyahoga River fire in Ohio and fish kills at Florida’s Lake Thonotosassa in 1969. The goal of the act was to regulate discharges into water, but for years industry groups and environmental advocates debated which bodies of water should be included. U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 created uncertainty about the law’s reach. In May 2015, the EPA announced a new rule intended to clarify which bodies of water fall under the act. But within months it was put on hold nationwide pending litigation and remaind on hold as of the writing of this fact-check -- a key point that Cruz omitted. The crux of the rule wasn’t the size of the bodies of water, but whether a body of water could carry pollution into other larger waters. The EPA wants to regulate tributaries, ponds, streams and wetlands to prevent businesses, farms or other entities from dumping waste into the water. Before the rule was finalized, the EPA invited public comment and the regulation of puddles became a talking point for conservatives and business advocates who bashed the rule as federal overreach. To clear up matters, the final rule explicitly addressed the question of puddles: "The proposed rule did not explicitly exclude puddles because the agencies have never considered puddles to meet the minimum standard for being a 'water of the United States,' and it is an inexact term. A puddle is commonly considered a very small, shallow, and highly transitory pool of water that forms on pavement or uplands during or immediately after a rainstorm or similar precipitation event. However, numerous commenters asked that the agencies expressly exclude them in a rule. The final rule does so." The American Farm Bureau Federation has argued that the rule language was so broad that it could ultimately include something not much larger than a puddle. Spokesman William Rodger says that puddles could be classified as "vernal pools" or "wetlands" and then fall under the EPA’s jurisdiction. "We stand by our assertion that puddles – as commonly understood by the average person – can be regulated under the Waters of the United States rule," he said in response to our questions about Cruz’s statement But multiple environmental experts have told PolitiFact Florida that they were skeptical that the EPA would end up regulating puddles. "It is an absurd assertion," William L. Andreen, University of Alabama law professor, told PolitiFact Florida in October. "There are no cases on point because the agencies have never asserted jurisdiction in such fantastical situations." What the water rule said about ditches The EPA had previously interpreted the Clean Water Act to include jurisdiction over ditches but sought to provide clarity with the new rule, which also contained the puddle exclusion. The rule does not regulate most ditches, according to the EPA. Here is what it does say about ditches: "The rule continues the current policy of regulating ditches that are constructed in tributaries or are relocated tributaries or, in certain circumstances drain wetlands, or that science clearly demonstrates are functioning as a tributary. These jurisdictional waters affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of downstream waters. The rule further reduces existing confusion and inconsistency regarding the regulation of ditches by explicitly excluding certain categories of ditches, such as ditches that flow only after precipitation." Farmers feared that ditches that flow only during or after a rain would be classified in a way that would put them under enforcement. U.S. Rep. Dave Loebsack, D-Iowa, raised that concern in a March 22 congressional hearing. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said that even if it rains hard and looks like there’s streams everywhere, those don’t count, she said. "It only has to be something that is constructed or natural that really can impact the downstream water. After that, there's no connection," McCarthy said. The EPA wrote in a response to comments about ditches: "The agencies do not intend to increase the number of ditches that are jurisdictional. In fact, by clarifying and expanding the specific exclusions for ditches, the agencies anticipate that more ditches will be clearly excluded in comparison to previous regulations and guidance related to waters of the U.S." Our ruling Cruz said, "The EPA has tried to define a puddle or a drainage ditch on your farm to be navigable waters and thus subject to massive environmental regulations." The EPA’s water rule specifically excludes puddles. It only applies to ditches that are constructed out of streams or ditches that function like streams and could carry pollution to downstream waters.

The ad, posted on YouTube on Feb. 5 by the Florida Education Association, takes specific aim at House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O’Lakes, who has made Florida schools a top priority in 2018. The bill in question — HB 7055 — contains many education provisions and provides funding for the "Hope Scholarship" program, a top priority for Corcoran. The program would allow public school students who are bullied to transfer to other private schools with discounted tuition. "House Bill 7055 is another Tallahassee assault on our local public schools," the narrator says in a voiceover. "Political insider Richard Corcoran has a plan to divert even more of our tax dollars to unaccountable private schools." We wondered about this claim. Does Corcoran have a plan to "divert tax dollars to unaccountable private schools?" We found there is some truth to this claim, but getting there requires a lot more context. ‘Richard Corcoran has a plan to divert even more of our tax dollars’ Florida Education Association communications director Sharon Nesvig said that the the Legislature has repeatedly increased and expanded a 2001 program known as the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship. HB 7055 adds a new "voucher" for a similar program, the Hope Scholarship. Here’s how those programs work: The Florida Tax Credit Scholarship was established in 2001 under Gov. Jeb Bush in order to give scholarships to poor children to attend private schools. The program provides dollar-for-dollar income tax credits for corporations that give money to organizations that give the scholarships. The tax credit cap for the 2017-18 fiscal year is almost $700 million and has increased every fiscal year. The Hope Scholarship is a voucher-like program that would be funded through motorists making voluntary contributions when they purchase cars. In return, car buyers would get a credit on the taxes they would normally have to pay on the purchases. Tax credit opponents, including the Florida Education Association, argue that the money used on these credits would have been state revenue if the Legislature had not diverted it. "Those tax dollars would have gone into general revenue and been available to fund our neighborhood schools and pay for the books, curriculum, equipment and programs our students desperately need," Nesvig said. There is no way to know for certain that money would end up being spent on schools, but education experts agreed with the general idea. Kevin G. Welner, the Director of the National Education Policy Center at the University of Colorado, said that the word "diverted" is "just about the best word choice they could have used." "The tax payment is diverted from the state to a system that funds the private schools," he said. It’s important to note, though, that the programs create new revenue streams. They don’t literally move money from traditional sources of public school revenue. What about those ‘unaccountable’ private schools’? Nesvig pointed to an Orlando Sentinel months-long investigation about Florida private schools that receive these scholarships. It found that some schools "hire teachers without college degrees, hold classes in aging strip malls and falsify fire-safety and health records. Experts agreed there is a huge difference in oversight, transparency, and accountability between public schools to voucher-receiving private schools. The schools do not have to hire teachers with state certification or college degrees, and they don’t have to follow the state’s academic standards. In addition, local public schools and charter schools are evaluated every year and assigned labels based on tests and other evidence, but that accountability system does not apply to private schools that accept vouchers, however. But the word "unaccountable" does not address all of the nuances of the situation. Although experts said they are largely ineffective, private schools that receive vouchers do have to conform to accountability laws. "If the ad included a footnote saying that the schools are ‘subject to weak and ineffective regulatory accountability,’ they might lose the punch of the statement, but it would be on more solid footing than flat out saying that the schools are ‘unaccountable.’" Welner said. It’s also worth noting that there has been some legislation to fix this issue. In response to the investigation, Florida lawmakers took steps to increase accountability. SB 1756 would require private school to employ teachers who hold a bachelor's degree or higher from a "regionally or nationally accredited college or university in the United States or from a recognized college or university in another country." Our ruling The FEA said that "Richard Corcoran has a plan to divert even more of our tax dollars to unaccountable private schools." This claim requires some explanation. The plan for diverting dollars refers to the Legislature’s decision to expand the state’s Tax Credit Scholarship Program and the Hope Scholarship proposal, which is included in HB 7055. The bill does create a new funding stream, but it doesn’t literally move money from traditional sources of public school revenue. And while there are some rules that govern private schools that receive vouchers, experts said there is a huge difference in oversight between those schools and public school. With everything considered, we rated this claim Half True.	None	Florida Education Association	None	None	None	2018-02-09T10:52:43	2018-02-05	['None']
pomt-12163	"Undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/aug/03/antonio-villaraigosa/mostly-true-undocumented-immigrants-less-likely-co/	Candidate for California governor Antonio Villaraigosa jumped into the nation’s heated debate on immigration reform during a recent interview on MSNBC. The Democrat and former Los Angeles mayor rejected the idea that deporting undocumented immigrants was a sound strategy for reducing crime. His statement followed President Trump’s speech about combatting MS-13 gang members. The gang started in poor Los Angeles neighborhoods where many refugees from civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua lived in the 1980s. It’s grown into an international criminal organization with more than 30,000. Trump campaigned on the promise to deport millions of undocumented residents, often describing them as threats to public safety. Here’s what Villaraigosa said on July 31, 2017 on MSNBC. "I think we all agree that people that commit violent crimes ought to be deported. But going after the undocumented is not a crime strategy, when you look at the fact that the National Academy of Sciences in, I think it was November of 2015, the undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born. That’s just a fact." Watch the interview here. We decided to examine this last point as part of our Tracking The Truth series, which fact-checks claims in the 2018 California governor's race. We interpreted Villaraigosa’s statement to mean undocumented people commit crimes at a lower rate than the native born. But we wondered whether this was really a settled matter. We set out on a fact check. Our research We started by checking out the 2015 National Academy of Sciences study Villaraigosa cited. It found: "Immigrants are in fact much less likely to commit crime than natives, and the presence of large numbers of immigrants seems to lower crime rates." The study added that "This disparity also holds for young men most likely to be undocumented immigrants: Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan men." It continued: "Today, the belief that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes is perpetuated by ‘issue entrepreneurs’ who promote the immigrant-crime connection in order to drive restrictionist immigration policy." The academy is a nonprofit research organization charged with providing independent advice to the nation. It is funded largely by the federal government. Findings in a March 2017 study by the libertarian Cato Institute also support Villaraigosa's statement: "Illegal immigrants are 44 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal immigrants are 69 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives. Legal and illegal immigrants are underrepresented in the incarcerated population while natives are overrepresented." The Cato study used information from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey for immigrants aged 18 to 54 who are incarcerated in the United States. To examine Villaraigosa's claim, we also relied on research into similar claims by our partner national PolitiFact. In July 2016, it rated Mostly True a statement by Libertarian candidate for president Gary Johnson that Mexican immigrants "are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic." PolitiFact found several studies that back up this claim by citing incarceration rates. It also found groups that challenged those studies or said more research is needed. PolitiFact’s findings PolitiFact pointed to a July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit in Washington. The council analyzed data from the Census’ 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of all immigrant males (Census does not specify legal status) between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population. Looking at California prisons, immigrants are also underrepresented. U.S.-born men are incarcerated in the state at a rate of more than two-and-a-half times greater than that of foreign-born men, according to a study by the Public Policy Institute of California. The American Immigration Council also reported that 2010 Census data shows incarceration rates of young, less educated Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan men — which comprise the bulk of the unauthorized population — are "significantly lower" than incarceration rates of native-born young men without a high-school diploma. Specifically for Mexican men ages 18 to 39, the incarceration rate in 2010 was 2.8 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for native-born men in the same age group, the council’s report said. Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report’s authors. "They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police," he told PolitiFact. "This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence." Crime trends PolitiFact also noted that as the immigrant population has increased, crime has gone down, citing Ewing’s report. Between 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population increased from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent, and the number of unauthorized immigrants went up from 3.5 million to 11.2 million. At the same time, the violent crime rate (murder, rape and aggravated assault) decreased 48 percent and property crime rate fell 41 percent, the report said, citing FBI data. Bianca E. Bersani, an assistant professor and director of the Criminology and Criminal Justice Program at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, says her research also shows that crime involvement among foreign-born residents is lower than that of U.S.-born citizens. "The rhetoric of the ‘criminal immigrant’ does not align with the bulk of empirical research," Bersani said. According to Bersani’s research, while first-generation immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population, the second generation (individuals born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent) more closely resemble patterns of their native-born peers (three or more U.S.-born generations). "This does not suggest that the second generation is uniquely crime prone, but instead that they are acting in ways that are no different from the rest of the U.S.-born population," Bersani said. Datasets with information on both crime and immigrant status are rare, Bersani said, though more research and data are becoming available. More research needed? The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration policies, in a 2009 study said that overall understanding of immigrants and crime "remains confused" due to lack of data and contrary information. Unless inmates are identified as immigrant or native-born, incarceration rates are a poor way to measure links between immigrants and crime, the study said. As PolitiFact reported in 2015, there isn’t exact data on how many undocumented immigrants are currently incarcerated. PolitiFact California spoke about this critique with Ewing of the American Immigration Council, whose research supports Villaraigosa’s claim. He said he’s confident in the work that’s been done and said critics have used anecdotes, rather than full-blown research, to try to make their points. Ewing added that the studies backing up Villaraigosa’s statement are "from such a wide range of researchers using so many different methodologies and sources of data -- not everyone can be wrong." Our ruling Villaraigosa said "undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born." He cited a 2015 study by the National Academy of Sciences that backs up this claim. In a fact check last year, PolitiFact rated a similar claim Mostly True. It cited additional studies by scholars and partisan groups that show that the foreign-born population is less likely to commit crimes than the native-born. It also found that researchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime. It said this was a needed clarification. PolitiFact California agrees with these findings. We rated Villaraigosa’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

UPDATE: We have added information to the ‘Our research’ section of this fact check from a March 2017 study by the libertarian Cato Institute.

pomt-07260	Says the United States is "the Saudi Arabia of coal."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/may/27/eric-cantor/us-king-coal-cantor-says/	American politicians, it seems, love to talk about Saudi Arabia. During the 2010 election season in Georgia, several Democrats and Republicans separately proclaimed that the Peach State was "the Saudi Arabia of pine trees." We looked at that claim in July 2010 and rated it as Barely True. One of the latest comparisons to that oil-rich Middle East nation came from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, one of the most powerful politicians in Washington. Cantor, a Republican congressman from Virginia, made a stop at the Atlanta Press Club last week during a two-day visit to Georgia. During the question-and-answer part of the program, Cantor took several verbal swipes at President Barack Obama, a Democrat. The criticism included that Obama hasn’t done enough to promote more sources of energy, specifically coal, as motorists fume over high gas prices. "We are the Saudi Arabia of coal," Cantor said. More than 90 percent of U.S. coal production goes to generate electricity in the United States, according to the National Mining Association. Cantor explained his point about coal. "We ought to be able to figure out a way to use that resource so that we can continue to compete," he said. We wondered in what way was Cantor attempting to make the comparison to Saudi Arabia. John Murray, Cantor’s deputy chief of staff, said the congressman was attempting to be "illustrative." Murray added more in an email. "Coal is an abundant domestic resource that remains critical to meeting our country's energy needs," Murray said."While we wait for the administration to present a realistic national energy strategy, we need to harness our existing assets -- like coal -- to generate the power required by American businesses and families." So let’s look closer at this comparison between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Even Obama has repeated the phrase, during a 2009 television interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Co. Saudi Arabia exports more oil than any nation in the world, 8.7 million barrels a day, according to one U.S. government estimate. Saudi Arabia also has a larger oil reserve than any other country, the U.S. says. The U.S., by the way, ranks 13th and 14th, respectively, in those categories. Saudi Arabia, the numbers show, is the king of oil exports and reserves. Now, is the U.S. the king of coal? The U.S. leads the world in the amount of coal in its reserves, according to data kept by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Russia was second, but about 50 percent behind the U.S., the EIA data show. But is the former Cold War foe playing coy with its numbers? Some experts believe Russia and China are not releasing the complete estimates of their coal reserves. The U.S. is producing and exporting less coal than some other nations. The U.S. produced nearly 1.1 billion short tons of coal in 2009, second to China, according to the most recent data available from the EIA. A short ton of coal equals 2,000 pounds. America’s annual coal production has been about the same since 2000. China, whose economy has boomed during the past decade, has increased its coal production from nearly 1.3 billion short tons in 2000 to nearly 3.4 billion short tons in 2009, EIA data show. For eight of the past 10 years, the United States has exported an average of 50 million short tons of coal each year. The U.S. currently exports less coal than Australia, Colombia, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. The U.S. has the world’s most comprehensive and strongest coal mining regulations, the National Mining Association says. Hal Quinn, the association’s president, told a congressional committee Tuesday that the federal government has placed "high hurdles" on the industry’s efforts to access land where much of the nation’s coal reserves are held. The association represents about 325 corporations in the mining industry. Others question how minable those reserves are. West Virginia University law school professor Patrick McGinley said much of America’s coal is in places that are more difficult to mine. He noted recent research that concludes that the world’s coal production (its highest quality and reasonably minable coal) will reach its peak this year. "It’s not realistic to equate the coal reserves in the United States with the oil reserves in Saudi Arabia," said McGinley, who served on a panel that investigated the coal mine explosion in West Virginia that killed 29 people in April 2010. Cantor’s argument is supported by data that show the United States currently has the world’s largest coal reserve. America has fallen far behind China in terms of coal production, and the United States is behind several other nations in exporting coal. The congressman’s statement leaves out some details concerning America’s standing in coal. Since the United States is still the Saudi Arabia of coal reserves, we rate Cantor’s claim as Mostly True.

pomt-11894	Abortion in the U.S. "is at an all time legal low."	half-true	/new-york/statements/2017/oct/25/kevin-cahill/abortion-all-time-low-us/	Assemblyman Kevin Cahill, D-Kingston, said abortions are less common now than ever before in the U.S. Cahill claimed the number of abortions has decreased to the lowest point in history four decades after the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. "After the right was expanded, there was a rise in the number of abortions," Cahill said in a radio interview. "But that number has subsided tremendously. It is at an all time legal low." Most Democrats in the state legislature, Cahill included, support a bill that would guarantee access to abortion services in New York state if the Supreme Court overturns the landmark decision. Cahill believes having that access would keep the number of abortions low in New York state. But is he right that there are fewer abortions now than ever in the U.S.? Abortion data Abortion was not universally legal in the U.S. until the Supreme Court decision in 1973. Earlier national data on legal abortions does not exist, and the number of illegal abortions performed before the decision is impossible to know. Cahill was talking about the number of abortions in the U.S. in his claim, according to his office. Two organizations have statistics on abortion that date back to 1973: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health policy and research organization. Data from the Guttmacher Institute is considered more comprehensive than CDC data. The CDC relies on numbers reported from states while the Guttmacher Institute does its own census of known abortion providers in every state. Number of abortions There were 744,610 abortions in the U.S. in 1973, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Cahill’s right that the number of legal abortions increased immediately after Roe v. Wade. The Guttmacher data shows the number peaked in 1988, when 1,590,750 abortions were recorded. That number has since decreased, aside from two small increases in 1996 and 2008. The Guttmacher data does not show each year’s count, instead tracking it every two to three years. The number of abortions decreased to 926,190 in 2014, the latest reporting period. That’s still higher than when the institute starting tracking the data in 1973. The abortion rate Measured another way -- abortions per capita -- the rate is at an all-time low. There were about 54 million more women living in the U.S. in 2014 than in 1973, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In 1973, there were 16.3 abortions for every 1,000 women, and the 29.3 rate in 1980 remains an all-time high. There were 14.6 abortions for every 1,000 women in 2014, according to the Guttmacher Institute. New York state data In New York state, both the count and the rate fell to an all-time low in 2013 before increasing slightly in 2014. There were 119,940 abortions in New York state in 2014, compared with 212,700 in 1973. The rate has decreased from 54.5 abortions for every 1,000 women in 1973 to 29.6 in 2014. Our ruling Cahill said abortion "is at an all time legal low." That's true if you consider the rate. The 14.6 abortions for every 1,000 women in 2014 is an all-time low. But his statement is false when counting the number. The number of abortions has gone down since its peak in 1988, but has not dropped below the 1973 count. The statement is partially accurate.

pomt-13659	"The poverty rates in America today aren’t much better than when we started the War on Poverty."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/05/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-right-poverty-rates-havent-changed-much-/	Speaker of the House Paul Ryan rallied the Wisconsin delegation at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, highlighting his ideas to address some of the country’s biggest issues. First on Ryan’s "A Better Way" list: Poverty. "We think there are better solutions to fighting poverty because we see what the War on Poverty has produced," Ryan said at the delegate breakfast. "It produced tens of trillions of dollars in spending. It has been a 51-year exercise and yet the poverty rates in America today are not much better than when we started the War on Poverty." In his 1964 State of the Union address, President Lyndon B. Johnson launched what became known as the War on Poverty, declaring: "Our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it." Johnson wanted to expand the federal government’s role to reduce a poverty rate that at the time was about 19 percent. A few major initiatives passed, including measures to establish Medicare and Medicare, give permanency to food stamps and boost funding for primary and secondary education. In January, PolitiFact National checked another claim from Ryan on poverty. He said, "today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago." An analysis of income and educational-attainment data backed up Ryan’s point showing that "intergenerational mobility" has "remained extremely stable." The claim was rated True. Is Ryan right with this claim too? Measuring poverty The federal poverty rate, calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau, compares pre-tax cash income against the poverty threshold. The threshold is based on three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, adjusted for inflation. For 2016, the poverty threshold is $24,300 for a family of four. Anyone falling under that threshold is considered in poverty. In 2014, the last year for which data is available, more than 46 million Americans were living in poverty. With a population of more than 315 million, that means the poverty rate was 14.8 percent. That’s a decrease of about five percentage points from when Johnson declared the War on Poverty. It’s not a huge drop, but it’s not insignificant either. Most of the drop came in the first few years of the War on Poverty. By 1967, the official poverty rate dropped from 19 percent to 14.2 percent -- slightly lower than today. Some of the drop can be attributed to general economic expansion in the 1960s following a recession in 1960 and 1961. Since 1967, the rate has fluctuated between 15 and 11 percent. Shortcomings in the data Some issues exist with the official poverty rate, as it doesn’t take into account efforts to reduce poverty. For example, income is defined as the total pre-tax income of all family members. Assistance programs like tax credits for low-income workers or food-purchasing assistance benefits are not included, so it does not capture all the income of a family from programs aimed at addressing poverty. Rachel Sheffield, a policy analyst for the Heritage Foundation, said Ryan is on target saying the poverty rate is nearly unchanged in the last 50 years. "Part of the reason the poverty rate is nearly the same today as it was 50 years ago is that most welfare spending is not accounted for when measuring poverty," she said. Christopher Wilmer, co-director of the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, said the official poverty rate does not paint a full picture. "It’s misleading to use trends in the official poverty measure when it’s not including measures taken to address poverty," Wilmer said. An alternative measuring stick Another metric, the supplemental poverty rate, was created by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2010 to give deeper understanding of economic conditions and policy effects. It takes information about what people spend on basic needs like food, clothing and shelter to calculate a poverty threshold. The measure adds non-cash benefits from the government such as the school lunch program or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Wilmer and other researchers used the supplemental poverty rate to show historical trends in poverty, finding results more favorable than the official measure suggests. The team found that with government programs, poverty fell from 26 percent in 1967 to 16 percent in 2012, a 10 percentage point drop. So government spending has had an effect -- and a larger one than Ryan suggests. Our rating Ryan said, "the poverty rates in America today aren’t much better than when we started the War on Poverty." The official poverty rate has dropped from 19 percent in 1964 to about 15 percent today. Another measure, the supplemental poverty rate, suggests the rate of poverty decreased 10 percentage points over roughly the same time period. So, over time living conditions have improved with government assistance, but the measure of self-sufficiency has been relatively stagnant. For a statement that is partially accurate, we rate Ryan’s claim Half True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2016-08-05T10:15:00	2016-07-18	['United_States']

pomt-15095	Says Mexico doesn't have birthright citizenship, and Americans are the "only ones" to have it.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/17/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-mexico-doesnt-have-birthright-ci/	Donald Trump confused several facts about birthright citizenship — a 150-year-old practice he has pledged to end — in the second GOP presidential debate. CNN moderator Jake Tapper asked Trump to explain why this is part of his platform to foe Carly Fiorina, who has said Trump is pandering on the issue. Trump brought up a scenario of a pregnant woman crossing the border and having a baby in the United States, "and we take care of the baby for 85 years. I don’t think so." "And by the way, Mexico and almost every other country anywhere in the world doesn't have that," he said. "We're the only ones dumb enough, stupid enough to have it." We know from a previous fact-check that the United States is somewhat of an outlier in offering birthright citizenship, especially compared its peers. From the same fact-check, we also know the United States is one of 33 countries with such a policy, despite what Trump said about it being the only one "dumb enough, stupid enough" to have it. (We should note that later in this response, Trump slightly corrected himself, saying, "We’re the only country -- one of the only countries -- we’re going to take care of those babies for 70, 75, 80, 90 years? I don’t think so.") Trump’s claim about Mexico not offering birthright citizenship didn’t sound right, so we wanted to look it over. Our hunch proved correct. Mexico does offer birthright citizenship, even if it’s not an exact copy of the American model. Birthright citizenship in the United States was first established by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, primarily to grant legal status to emancipated slaves. The amendment stipulates that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside." The Mexican Constitution says the Mexican "nationality" is obtained by birth if the person is born "within the Republic’s territory whatever their parents’ nationality might be," among other circumstances. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org noted a technical difference between the Mexican and American constitutions. In Mexico, someone does not become a "citizen" — regardless of whether the person is born to Mexican parents or just in Mexico — until he or she turns 18. At that age, he or she can vote, hold public office or join the military. In addition to being Mexican and 18, he or she must also have "an honest way of life." A Mexican-born child is still considered Mexican even without voting rights, FactCheck.org found, similar to American children who also do not have access to voting until they turn 18. Article 37 adds that Mexican nationality by birth "shall never be revoked." Birthright citizenship also exists in Canada, Brazil and nearly every other country in Central and South America, according to a list of nations with birthright citizenship maintained by Numbers USA, which supports reduced immigration levels. Countries that offer birthright citizenship are located almost exclusively in the Western Hemisphere. No country in Europe or East Asia, for example, has a similar citizenship policy. Our ruling Trump defended his pursuit of ending birthright citizenship by saying not even Mexico has it, adding the United States is alone on this right. But that’s not true, no matter how many times Trump repeats this line. Anyone born on Mexican soil is considered Mexican by nationality, regardless of whether their parents are Mexican. No one in Mexico, even if a person’s parents are Mexican, is considered a "citizen" by the country’s Constitution until he or she turns 18.

pomt-04063	Says Virginia economic development officials "decided they didn’t want to bid on" his company's electric automobile plant.	false	/virginia/statements/2013/jan/24/terry-mcauliffe/terry-mcauliffe-says-virginia-officials-decided-no/	Terry McAuliffe, the only Democrat running for governor this year, is pledging to use his experience as an entrepreneur to create jobs in Virginia. At a news conference on Dec. 5, he was asked why he decided to locate the manufacturing plant of the electric car company he bought in 2009 in Mississippi instead of Virginia. The company, GreenTech Automotive, has promised to bring at least 1,500 jobs to Mississippi. McAuliffe replied that he wanted to bring the factory and jobs to the Old Dominion, but officials at the Virginia Economic Development Partnership -- the state’s business recruitment agency -- weren’t interested. "They decided they didn’t want to bid on it," he said. "We had sites, we had meetings and they chose that they weren’t going to bid on it," McAuliffe, chairman of GreenTech Automotive, added. "I have to go where obviously they’re going to put incentives, but the only incentives are if I create jobs, then I get incentives." McAuliffe said Virginia has not been aggressive in recruiting large manufacturers in recent years. "They’ve gone to all of our Southern neighbors. Hundreds of thousands have been created. I think its been a decision (by Virginia) not to go after these types of manufacturing facilities. I’ve always said we should go after these manufacturing plants. You cannot drive through Southside and Southwest Virginia and see those empty furniture and textile (plants) and not say we need manufacturing jobs." McAuliffe’s criticism of Virginia’s economic development efforts is likely to become an issue in this fall’s election. So we decided to see whether he is accurate in claiming that VEDP rejected GreenTech’s efforts to locate its car plant in Virginia. We asked McAuliffe’s campaign for evidence supporting the candidate’s claim and received this email reply from spokesman Josh Schwerin: "As Terry said, although GreenTech supplied extensive documentation to support their project, VEDP repeatedly made clear in meetings and correspondence that they did not want to pursue this project." The campaign declined to provide additional comments or proof. So we turned to VEDP. The agency, complying with our request under the Freedom of Information Act, furnished hundreds of pages of emails and documents detailing its dealings with GreenTech. Specific information GreenTech furnished about the cost of the plant, investors, key employees, product information and payroll estimates were blacked out. The documents and emails trace Virginia’s communications with GreenTech under the two most recent governors, Democrat Tim Kaine and Republican Bob McDonnell. They show that economic development officials were interested but wary about GreenTech’s ability to carry out the project. GreenTech deepened those concerns by not responding to some of the state’s questions, according to the emails. The story begins in 2009. McAuliffe lost a three-way Democratic primary for governor that spring. Shortly afterwards, he bought a Chinese electric car company, moved its headquarters to Northern Virginia and tried to set up a manufacturing base in the United States. That August, GreenTech officials approached the Kaine administration about opening a car plant in Virginia. After that point, there were many emails between Michael Lehmkuhler, vice president for business attraction at VEDP, and Gary Tang, GreenTech’s chief operations officer. On Sept. 11 and Sept. 14, 2009, Lehmkuhler asked a series of "standard diligence questions" about the company’s business plan. Tang replied on Sept. 16 -- his answers were heavily redacted -- and six days later, officials from VEDP and GreenTech toured a potential plant site. The emails show that a major part of GreenTech’s financial plan relied on a federal immigration program called EB-5. It allows foreigners who invest $500,000 into new enterprises in rural or struggling region, or $1 million in new enterprises in any region, to receive U.S. residency if at least 10 full-time jobs are created within two years as a result of the investment. The EB-5 program had never been used in Virginia. To set it up, federal laws required the establishment of a "regional center" that would administer the program on a state or regional basis. The center finds suitable EB-5 projects, interacts with potential investors and handles legal and reporting requirements to ensure the investors receive their residency. A regional center can be run by a state or local government or by a private business. GreenTech wanted to run Virginia’s program and asked Kaine to support that goal. The governor in September 2009 asked VEDP to weigh in, but officials there said they needed until at least the end of October to consider the plan. Meanwhile, Lehmkuhler arranged for GreenTech to tour potential sites in Danville, Martinsville and Waverly on Oct. 7 and 8. But then there was a surprise. On Oct. 6, GreenTech announced plans to build a plant in Tunica, Miss., where it had a regional center. McAuliffe’s company promised to initially employ 1,500 with a $1 billion investment and produce 150,000 vehicles annually in its first phase, the Memphis Business Journal reported. Watchdog.org later said that Mississippi and Tunica pitched in more than $8 million in public loans and grants, with more added in tax exemptions and rebates. The public investments will be taken back if the company fails to attract $60 million in capital and hire 350 full-time workers by the end of 2014, Mississippi’s Economic Development Authority said. VEDP officials learned about the plan through media stories published on the morning of the announcement. Lehmkuhler asked Tang for an explanation. "We will talk about (Mississippi) in a different occasion when our (Virginia) operations are on more solid ground," Tang replied in an email that same day. "(Mississippi) is moving fast, so we need get (Virginia’s regional center) up running quickly." Lehmkuhler, in an email to other development officials that day, wrote: "They’ve never indicated a second project until now. (Tang) confirmed this morning that there will be an announcement today, but in his words ‘our plan has always been doing some in MS but bigger one in Va.’" That same day, Lehmkuhler sent an email to Secretary of Commerce and Trade Patrick Gottschalk expressing concern about GreenTech. The "group has no demonstrated ability to run an automotive company," he wrote. "In my opinion, the Mississippi announcement today was prompted by the need to quickly establish an alternative for Chinese investors who are growing tired of waiting for Wang to get the EB-5 process started in earnest somewhere," he wrote. "After telling them about Mississippi for so long, (CEO and President Charles) Wang has told prospective investors that Virginia will now be their primary focus. He needs to have a Virginia EB-5 regional center up and running asap to accommodate those still willing to wait a little longer for the ‘best’ opportunity." During the next two days, GreenTech leaders made the scheduled site visits in Virginia. A week later, they told VEDP officials which site they preferred. On Oct. 22, Lehmkuhler sent an email to Tang detailing his concerns about the project. "After a second review of the business plan, we still do not see a direct value proposition that explains how GreenTech will reach forecasted sales that equal 100 percent of planned capacity, both at the start of construction in 2012 and after a major expansion occurs through 2015," he wrote. Lehmkuhler asked Tang to explain how GreenTech, with no car manufacturing experience, would compete with popular hybrids being marketed by major automobile companies. He asked GreenTech to justify its "overstated" estimate of the number spin-off jobs that would created by other companies servicing the auto plant in Virginia. In November 2009, McAuliffe, who suggested the project be referred to by the code name Project Go Clean Green, visited Gottschalk and Kaine separately to talk about GreenTech’s plans for a Virginia plant. Around the same time, VEDP finished its evaluation of GreenTech’s request for regional center support from the state. The blunt conclusions were laid out in a Nov. 19 memo that Jeffrey Anderson, executive director of the agency, sent to Gottschalk, the secretary of commerce and labor. Anderson wrote, "we have grave doubts about the business model presented to us" by GreenTech. He mentioned several times that the company had not answered key questions that had been raised by the agency. And he warned that Virginia could be sullied by linking a new EB-5 program to the fortunes of a startup company. "We are concerned that the financing plan does not fit the rules for the EB-5 Program," Anderson wrote. "If the rules of the EB-5 Program are not followed, the investors will not receive the visas that they thought they would receive. If all, or any significant portion, of the investors were to not ultimately receive the visas, that would give the commonwealth a black eye, in the view of other companies or investors looking for possible business connections with the commonwealth." Anderson was also troubled by GreenTech’s desire to run the regional center for an EB-5 program in Virginia. Foreigners would look to the center to steer them towards "reasonable business investments," he wrote. "We believe that having the principals of the regional center be the same as the principals of the company benefitting from the investment creates a conflict of interest." On the same day, Tang sent an email to Lehmkuhler suggesting that GreenTech was focusing on one state. "We have been under lots of pressure to move forward in MS..." Tang wrote. "Your expedited process and support is greatly appreciated... If we do not move the project soon in either place (not in both), our project momentum will be damaged." Several months of email silence ensued. In February 2010, Anderson asked Lehmkuhler if there was "any news" on GreenTech. Lehmkuhler replied that there wasn’t. GreenTech purchased a prototype vehicle in May 2010 when the company bought EuAuto, a Chinese company that developed MyCar. MyCar is an electric vehicle that can drive 115 miles on one charge and reaches top speeds of 45 mph. In the U.S., dealers can’t sell those types of vehicles if they go faster than 25 mph. Most state restrict the cars to roads with maximum speed limits of 35 mph. After the announcement, Lehmkuhler was asked for an update by Jim Cheng, secretary of commerce and trade for Gov. Bob McDonnell. Lehmkuhler, in a heavily redacted email, replied that the project was "stuck in neutral." Elizabeth Povar, director of business development at VEDP, added to the reply, "Bottom line, we have no reason at this point to believe there’s validity to the job creation numbers (or inferred project)." McAuliffe told Bloomberg News in October 2010 that the first 100,000 cars produced would sell for $8,500 apiece after federal and state tax credits reduced the price from $10,000. In articles written in 2012, the price escalated to $15,500, according to Torque News, and $18,000, according to the Memphis Daily News. In August 2011, GreenTech announced plans to build an assembly plant in Inner Mongolia to serve the Chinese market. A month later, Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling’s office asked Lehmkuhler about the project. Lehmkuhler shared his October 2009 due-diligence email with Randy Marcus, Bolling’s chief of staff. Lehmkuhler added, in a note, "Never received an answer to any of these observations, despite a promises (sic) 9 to the contrary." He also wrote Marcus that the Mississippi plant and product is not what the company originally shared with VEDP. Lehmkuhler wrote that GreenTech "keeps talking about doing this in Virginia but VEDP will not take another step" until the company produced "a qualified business plan and evidence of adequate financing." Lehmkuhler added that that Green Tech was receiving "no different treatment than any other prospect we deal with." GreenTech opened a manufacturing plant in a temporary location in Horn Lake, Mississippi in July 2012, surrounded by political luminaries such as former President Bill Clinton and former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour. McAuliffe said at the opening that the plant would make the innards of the vehicles destined for China, with assembly completed in the Chinese plant. But the Associated Press reported that work on the original plant in Tunica has not progressed beyond site work and Watchdog.org adds that the workforce runs just more than 100. The company says it has orders from some Domino’s pizza franchises and a Danish company. A recent story from The Commercial Appeal in Memphis, Tenn., said early exports are planned for Europe. A final flurry of conversations between GreenTech and VEDP occurred last summer. VEDP’s call center, which periodically contacts business prospects, dialed Wang, who said GreenTech would be interested in opening a plant in Virginia and moving engineers to the state. Lehmkuhler followed up with a phone call and emails to Wang. The GreenTech executive replied on July 23. "We always have interest to do projects in Virginia," he wrote and promised to follow up in August. No further emails between the two are recorded. In November, the McDonnell administration asked for another update on the project. "I reconnected with Gary Tang a few months ago because they expressed a further interest in Virginia when contacted by the call center (now marked as Do Not Contact)," Lehmkuhler wrote to Carrie Roth, deputy secretary for commerce and trade. VEDP officials declined to be interviewed for this fact check, saying the emails speak for themselves. For perspective, we spoke to Greg Wingfield, president and CEO of the Greater Richmond Partnership, which recruits and promotes business locally. Wingfield said the partnership and VEDP investigate companies seeking help move into the Richmond region. For publicly traded businesses, that means reading reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and learning about the leadership of the company. For privately held companies or startups, the partnership asks for the information. "If a privately held company won’t provide it, that sends up red flags and we can’t really go much further," Wingfield said. "There are numerous examples of startups that were playing one state off another state and Virginia has a philosophy that it’s not a pay up-front state. They pay out after a company has performed." Our ruling McAuliffe blamed VEDP for his company’s decision to locate an electric car plant in Mississippi rather than Virginia. "They decided they didn’t want to bid on it," he said. Records showed VEDP staff were interested in the project and were in the process of its due diligence when GreenTech moved ahead with a plant in Mississippi. VEDP had "grave concerns" about GreenTech’s business plan. The agency said GreenTech Agency officials had no "demonstrated experience" in manufacturing cars. It doubted the company’s job estimates. It questioned the ethics of GreenTech’s plan to raise money from foreign investors in exchange for U.S. residency. The record shows that VEDP asked GreenTech to address its concerns and waited in vain for replies. Without those answers, VEDP would not negotiate monetary support for that, or any, project. Contrary to McAuliffe’s claim, there is no evidence the state agency decided not to bid on the project. Emails show VEDP took GreenTech officials on a tour of potential sites and contacted the company about coming to Virginia almost two years after GreenTech announced it was building a plant in Mississippi.

pomt-15042	"Unlike virtually every other campaign, we don't have a super PAC."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/30/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-only-presidential-candidates-withou/	It’s no secret that Bernie Sanders isn’t a fan of billionaires and, according to Sanders himself, he’s practically the only 2016 presidential candidate to refuse their money as well. The democratic socialist senator from Vermont has long criticized campaign finance law and offered legislation to flush big money out of the political arena. His campaign prides itself on its small donations. Speaking at the University of Chicago on Sept. 28, Sanders vowed to nominate Supreme Court justices who will overturn Citizens United, the landmark 2010 decision that opened the floodgates for unlimited donations to political fundraising organizations known as super PACs. That same day, Sanders took to Twitter to demonstrate his consistency. "Unlike virtually every other campaign, we don't have a super PAC which collects money from billionaires and corporations," he tweeted. We wanted to look at which 2016 candidates have a super PAC. Is Sanders really the only candidate out of the 15 Republicans and six Democrats without one? A who’s who of outside spending We compiled data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign finance research group, and a Washington Post analysis. We found that Sanders’ claim largely checks out, albeit with some caveats. Sanders and Donald Trump are the only major candidates without an affiliated super PAC, the type that are typically campaign surrogates. But he and Trump both have unaffiliated super PACs backing them. We’ll get to the distinction in just a bit. Here’s a breakdown of various super PACs connected to the 2016 candidates. The data comes from the July 2015 quarterly filing to the Federal Election Commission. New quarterly reports are due in October 2015: Candidate Affiliated super PACs Unaffiliated super PACs Total raised (as of July 15, 2015) Jeb Bush, R-Fla. • Right to Rise • Millennials Rising • Vamos for Jeb $103,224,384 Ben Carson, R • One Vote PAC • National Draft Ben Carson for President • For a Better Tomorrow $6,844,986 Chris Christie, R-N.J. • America Leads • Ready for Christie $11,003,305 Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y. • Priorities USA Action • Faith Voters PAC • Balance of Power • BillForFirstLady2016 $15,674,490 Ted Cruz, R-TX • Keep the Promise • Keep the Promise I • Keep the Promise II • Keep the Promise III • Crusaders PAC • Jruz PAC • Take DC Back • Stand for Principle $38,425,747 Carly Fiorina, R • Carly for America • Unlocking Potential $3,492,728 Jim Gilmore, R-Va. • Growth PAC $193,094 Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. • Security Is Strength • West Main Street Values $2,897,457 Mike Huckabee, R-Ark. • Pursuing America's Greatness $3,604,987 Bobby Jindal, R-La. • Believe Again $3,685,919 John Kasich, R-Ohio • New Day for America 2016 $0 Martin O’Malley, D-Md. • Generation Forward $289,443 George Pataki, R-N.Y • We the People, Not Washington PAC $859,244 Rand Paul, R-Ky.. • Concerned American Voters • America's Liberty • Purple PAC • Forever Free PAC • Human Action • Rand PAC 2016 • OnlyRand.com $5,057,783 Marco Rubio, R-Fla. • Conservative Solutions PAC • Students for Rubio • Americans for Marco Rubio $5,057,783 Rick Santorum, R-Pa. • Working Again $0 Donald Trump, R • Make America Great Again • Hispanic Citizens for Donald Trump $0 Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. • Collective Actions PAC • BillionairesForBernie $8,795 Surrogates versus supporters The difference between unaffiliated and affiliated super PACs "gets to the core issue of coordination and non-coordination in the post-Citizens United era," said Robert McGuire, a research analyst with the Center for Responsive Politics. Affiliated super PACs are often created or staffed by the candidate's political allies and act as extensions of the official campaigns. Though these independent groups are not allowed to donate directly to or coordinate with campaigns, they’ve have found ways to toe the line. A few examples: Jeb Bush’s longtime strategist and friend Mike Murphy heads his Right to Rise super PAC, which has advertised on his behalf. Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign manager Guy Cecil is at the helm of the pro-Clinton Priorities Action USA, while her current campaign manager has met with potential PAC donors. Martin O’Malley’s Generation Forward super PAC, established by his former press secretary, has run attack ads against Sanders. Unaffiliated super PACs are different. The two pro-Sanders super PACs -- Collective Actions PAC and Billionaires for Bernie -- have no ties to Sanders or his campaign. In fact, Sanders team has asked the unaffiliated super PACs to cut it out. Sanders’ lawyers "have told them to stop," said Michael Briggs, communications director for the Sanders campaign, referring to a cease and desist letter sent to one that formed recently. (That group didn’t file with the FEC until mid September, but received a $50,000 donation from Daniel Craig, the actor who portrays James Bond.) But because anyone can register a super PAC (this fact-check would be remiss to not mention Stephen Colbert’s Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow), candidates can do little to stop one from forming and declaring its support. The distinction between an affiliated super PAC and an unaffiliated one is significant, said Anthony Corrado, a professor who studies campaign finance at Colby College. "Sanders has been clear in disavowing any such efforts and noting that he does not want the support of such groups," he said. "So I do not believe the mere existence of a registered committee renders his point invalid." Ahead of the PACs We should note that Sanders isn’t the only presidential candidate without an affiliated super PAC. The same could be said of Democratic rivals former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb (who’s polling at 0.8 percent), former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee (who’s polling at 0 percent) and Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig (who doesn’t appear in the polls at all and who, before declaring his candidacy, famously started a super PAC dedicated to ending all super PACs). But among the more prominent candidates, Sanders is indeed the odd man out. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has more affiliated super PACs than anyone else (four), while Bush’s Right to Rise has raised the most money by far: more than $103 million. In Sanders’ own party, the pro-Clinton Priorities USA Action has raised $15.6 million. Donald Trump, who repeatedly touts his financial independence from donors, seems to be friendly with a super PAC created in his honor. While Trump’s not coordinating with the group on the same level as Bush or Clinton, the connections are certainly stronger than Sanders’ with his backers and "worth noting," said McGuire. The billionaire attended a New York fundraiser hosted by the Make America Great Again PAC in July and said he’s grateful for their support, reports Politico. The group also received a $100,000 donation from the in-laws of Trump’s daughter Ivanka, according to Politico. Our ruling Sanders tweeted, "Unlike virtually every other campaign, we don't have a Super PAC which collects money from billionaires and corporations." Out of the 21 presidential candidates, Sanders is one of five who doesn’t have an affiliated super PAC. Sanders’ qualifier -- "virtually" -- makes his claim more accurate. If we narrow the count to major candidates, only Sanders and Trump can claim that, but both have two unaffiliated super PACs backing their candidacy. Trump has appeared at a fundraiser for one super PAC that’s also received donations from his in-laws. Sanders, meanwhile, has disassociated himself with these groups, through statements and legal action. We rate Sanders’ claim Mostly True.

pomt-08159	In "the fall of 2009, only 21 percent of Texas high school graduates enrolled in a four-year public university."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/dec/03/todd-staples/todd-staples-says-21-percent-2009-texas-high-schoo/	Who says campaigns fade in import after Election Day? On Nov. 11, for instance, we came across a statement about Texas high-school graduates that would be notable any time. Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, making a case for workforce training, writes on the "issues" part of his campaign website: "Preparing our students for a global economy means more and more of them will require college degrees, yet in the fall of 2009, only 21 percent of Texas high school graduates enrolled in a four-year public university." One in five hustled to college? Staples' posted statement includes a link to a Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board website, "High School to College Linkages." With advice from Staples' spokesman Bryan Black, we isolated a spreadsheet on the site indicating the percentage of public high school graduates who went on to higher education the fall after their spring graduations from 2000 through 2009. And according to the spreadsheet, 21 percent of the state's more than 264,000 2009 graduates enrolled that fall in four-year public institutions of higher education, with 28.5 percent enrolling in public two-year institutions and 4.4 percent marked as attending an in-state private or independent college or university. Dominic Chavez, senior director for external relations at the coordinating board, confirmed the figures for us. But we noticed a difference between the board breakdown and Staples' statement. The board's 21 percent refers solely to graduates who enrolled in Texas institutions, while Staples' statement refers to graduates who went to any four-year public university. Also, the board breakdown gives no information for many graduates. Nearly 42 percent of the 2009 graduates are categorized as "not found," meaning the students' identifying numbers -- usually Social Security numbers -- did not show up in enrollment records of state higher education institutions that fall, according to a footnote on the chart and Chavez. Another 4 percent of graduates are listed as not trackable; those graduates had non-standard ID numbers "that will not find a match at Texas higher education institutions," a footnote says. We wondered too about 2009 graduates who went to college out of state. Chavez told us the board did not research that because its research reach extends to Texas colleges only. Chavez said, though, that the board earlier paid for such information from the National Student Clearinghouse, a nonprofit that describes itself online as the nation's "trusted source for student degree and enrollment verification." Board spokesman Andy Kesling later told us that 4 to 5 percent of 2003 Texas high-school graduates enrolled that fall in out-of-state institutions of higher education; the clearinghouse's data set did not include colleges in Oklahoma, which attracts some Texas graduates, and did not specify the types of schools the graduates were attending. The same year, the board says, 20 percent of Texas high-school graduates enrolled that fall in a Texas four-year public institution. Kesling said it would be fair to conclude that more than 24 to 25 percent of graduates enrolled in a four-year college in or out of Texas (counting the unknown share of students who hitchhiked to Oklahoma) in fall 2003. Black, Staples' spokesman, said by e-mail that Staples' statement was in a column focused on Texas. "It's clear, both because of the context of the article" and that the coordinating board is the cited source, Black said, that Staples is commenting on graduates enrolled in Texas four-year public universities. We don't see that clarity. Upshot: Staples said that only 21 percent of Texas high school graduates in 2009 went on to a four-year public university, without noting that the statistic only applies to public universities in Texas. While the state has no data on the number of 2009 graduates who enrolled in out-of-state colleges, it stands to reason that more than 21 percent of graduates went to four-year public universities across the country.

pomt-11294	"British Intelligence Seizes Clinton Foundation Warehouse, $400 Million In Cash."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/20/blog-posting/no-british-intelligence-didnt-sieze-400-billion-cl/	The Clinton Foundation, established by former President Bill Clinton, has long been a favorite subject for sites looking to spread questionable news on the Internet. Here’s the latest example making the rounds. It was flagged as possibly providing false information, as part of Facebook’s effort to combat fake news. A website called NRTONLINE posted an article on April 14, 2018, headlined, "BREAKING: British Intelligence Seizes Clinton Foundation Warehouse, $400 Million In Cash." Here are the opening paragraphs: The Clinton Foundation is once again trying to distance itself from a scandal surrounding something they’re involved in. This time, the warehouse they use in the UK to store food and toiletries to make ready for shipping to Africa and Indonesia was raided by MI6. The warehouse, which is leased by the Foundation and one other tenant, is owned by a man known for shady arms deals and exploiting cheap Asian labor for counterfeit goods. The Brits took down his office and storage space, finding 400 Million in US Dollars. Maleek Bin Shalakta has been on the UK terrorist watch list for some time. The problem: None of this ever happened. The article was lifted wholesale from the website Reagan Was Right, which -- before the site was taken down earlier this year -- described itself as a "whimsical playland of conservative satire." Another disclaimer read: "Everything on this website is fiction." You can’t find the Reagan Was Right article on its original web page any more, but a version of the article dated Nov. 10, 2017, is available on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. Reagan Was Right was affiliated with Christopher Blair, a Maine man we’ve written about previously. Blair told us his websites are a carefully curated social experiment designed to "feed the Hoverounders their daily need for hate and their undying urge to blame everything in the known universe on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama." Among the dubious elements of both the original Reagan Was Right article and the NRTONLINE facsimile is a reference to the nonexistent country of Latkavia, as well as a stray reference to a correspondent for "LLOD." The article doesn’t explain the acronym, but fake news cognoscenti will recognize it as one of Blair’s other fake (and now shuttered) sites, the Last Line of Defense. Meanwhile, the photograph that accompanies the post was published in June 2017 by the Sun newspaper in the United Kingdom to illustrate an entirely different article -- one about police evicting a group of trailer-home residents who had seized a warehouse for 24 hours. As for the publisher of the most recent version, NRTONLINE, a quick click into the site’s "About Us" page shows not an explanation of the site’s background but rather an un-filled-in web page template. So, unlike the Reagan Was Right version, NRTONLINE offered no indication that this article was "satire." The Clinton Foundation confirmed to PolitiFact that the article is "totally false." "We don’t rent a warehouse in the U.K., the quote from ‘Chelsea Clinton’s assistant’ is made up, and nothing in this story seems to be based in reality," spokesman Brian Cookstra told PolitiFact. Fake Clinton Foundation raids are a staple of dubious web posts. For instance, in May 2017, some of our fellow fact-checkers debunked an Internet claim that a Clinton Foundation cargo ship had been caught smuggling people from Syria, drugs and illegal fruit. The source of that claim? The Last Line of Defense. Social media posts linked to an article headlined, "British Intelligence Seizes Clinton Foundation Warehouse, $400 Million In Cash." But that never happened -- the tall tale originated with a self-described satirical post. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-12945	Says a celebrity praises locals for their help after an automotive breakdown.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jan/06/blog-posting/celebrity-praise-helpful-locals-are-fake-stories-c/	According to a raft of faux news websites, Bill Murray sure does appreciate the people of Rochester, N.H., for helping him after his rental car broke down. If you believe the Internet, he’s also fond of the residents of Marion, Ohio. And Shakopee, Minn., too. And Hays, Kan.; Porterville, Calif.; Prescott Valley, Ariz.; Bay City, Mich.; and even Toowoomba, Australia. All for the same reason, none of which is true. A website called NewsDaily12.com said it had the story from Rochester, in which Murray is quoted from an unidentified radio interview as saying he was leaving the New England town when his rental car "overheated or something." Facebook flagged this story and others as part of its efforts to identify fake news. They’re right. It’s fake. Murray’s undated anecdote continues that while on the phone with the car company, a couple of locals lent a hand, calling a family member with a tow truck and taking the car to get repaired. While waiting, one of the Samaritans offers to take Murray to lunch, the story goes. "So we drove to the finest dining spot in Rochester — some place called Wild Willy’s — and get a burger. Great freakin’ burger too," Murray is quoted. "These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly. I’m telling you, these people in Rochester are the real deal. I’m gonna move there after I retire." The stories, which again, are fake, are part of a chain of websites that appear to bank on readers clicking on particular versions of the post to generate advertising revenue. These sites carry names that sound like official media outlets, like "KMT 11 News" or "16 WMPO." The sites are also known for including various versions of stories that falsely claim an event has happened. Other stories include that a celebrity is moving to a certain town or, say, that the next Star Wars movie is being filmed nearby. None of the stories specifically say the article is fake. But each site has a disclaimer (if you know where to look) that says the articles "are simply works of satire meant for entertainment purposes" and shouldn’t be considered true. (Claiming that these articles are somehow satire is bogus, too.) Each site says readers may submit concerns to a contact email, and the administrators "will offer you our condolences and provide you with a safe space where you can be shielded from any sort of satire in the future." We emailed them looking for condolences, but so far have received none. Every version of the story on each site is almost identical, with the name of a different town. The lunch destination is either changed or omitted altogether, depending on the version. (To the fake news purveyor’s faint credit, the name of the restaurant used is of an actual place in the specific town — there really is a burger joint called Wild Willy’s in Rochester, for example.) Something that also changes in the stories is the name of the celebrity having the experience. It’s not always Bill Murray. It also turns out that Adam Sandler had the same problem in Pflugerville, Texas. And Billings, Mont.; plus a flat tire in Reynoldsburg, Ohio; and a whole host of other towns. Tom Hanks got a flat tire in Kennewick, Wash.; Harrison Ford’s car overheated in Mandan, N.D.; Miley Cyrus broke down in Hollister, Calif. Other celebrities helped by gentle townsfolk after some bad luck include Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson, Adam Levine, Matthew McConaughey and Bruce Willis. There are scads of small towns and suburbs named as the location of these hapless incidents. Needless to say, there is no evidence that any of these celebs had car trouble in any of these places or subsequently praised locals for help.

pomt-09301	Says Crist campaign website "has eliminated all references to our Republican Party."	false	/florida/statements/2010/apr/21/tom-grady/charlie-crist-website-republican-independent/	Now that Gov. Charlie Crist is openly flirting with an independent run for the U.S. Senate, many of his old Republican friends are dashing for the exits. Crist's mentor, former Florida U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, yanked his support on April 15, 2010. House Speaker Larry Cretul, who had been neutral, didn't just endorse Crist's rival Marco Rubio on April 20, 2010, but openly bashed Crist in the process. State Rep. Tom Grady, R-Naples, became the latest Crist backer to jump ship in an e-mail to Crist dated April 20, 2010. Grady, who said Crist convinced him to run for the Legislature, said he was resigning from Crist's statewide finance team and would no longer be the Southwest Florida regional chairman of Crist's campaign. "This evening, as I reviewed your updated campaign website, I noticed a disheartening fact," Grady wrote in an e-mail. "Your website has eliminated all references to our Republican Party, or as you frequently refer to it, the party of Lincoln. "As a long-time personal friend, I suspected you were considering a break from the party when my recent calls went unanswered. This comes at a time when we clearly differ on what it means to be a conservative with a firm belief in less government, less taxing, less spending and more freedom." Crist has said he hasn't made up his mind whether he will continue to run for the U.S. Senate as a Republican, or as an independent candidate with no party affiliation. (He has to decide by April 30th). But is Crist's campaign website already tipping his hand? Indeed, the website, http://CharlieCrist.com, is largely devoid of mentions that Crist is a Republican. That's not unusual -- candidates often don't emphasize their party in hopes that they can attract more broad support. But it's not hard to figure out what party he represents -- at least for now. His homepage has a link to the "Charlie Crist Conservative Record," and his official biography describes his as a "common-sense conservative" who was "Florida's first elected Republican Attorney General." The website includes an electronic button for people to download that says "Conservatives for Charlie Crist": And it still includes a press release from April 8, 2010, in which campaign manager Eric Eikenberg says Crist would run for the U.S. Senate as a Republican, not an independent. The Palm Beach Post went back and found other press releases referring to Crist speaking at Republican events and Lincoln Day dinners, and also commenting on the resignation of his hand-picked Republican Party of Florida chairman, Jim Greer. In a Jan. 5 press release, Crist said: "I call on Florida Republicans to unite behind our common values of less government and more personal freedom and sincerely hope that we can move forward together to ensure statewide Republican victories in 2010." Crist campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul told the Palm Beach Post that "no Republican references have been scrubbed from our website, period." The St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald also asked Crist about Grady's comments. Q: Did you remove any references to the Republican Party from your website, as alleged by Rep. Tom Grady and other Republicans who have withdrawn their support? A: "No." Q: What's your reaction to Grady’s repealed endorsement? A: “So be it.” Looking for additional proof, PolitiFact Florida went to a website called Internet Archive, which stores versions of old websites. But that site hasn't created a moment in time snapshot of CharlieCrist.com since July 30, 2008. Post reporter Michael Bender used another website, ChangeDetection.com, that tracks changes to specific websites and e-mails people when a change occurs. Bender, who says he has been following changes to CharlieCrist.com "for the past couple years," said no reference to “Republican” has been eliminated from the site. We couldn't independently verify Bender's claim because we just started following Crist's website on ChangeDetection.com. But what's even more critical is that Grady, himself, said he has no proof Crist “eliminated” anything from his website. He said it was fair to make the accusation, according to the Post. “This wasn’t a trial,” he said. By contrast, the front page of Marco Rubio's website has images of Rubio and 2008 GOP presidential contender Mitt Romney and features the endorsements of U.S. House Republican Whip Eric Cantor, Cretul and has the message "Will Charlie Abandon the GOP again? Marco is the only Republican we can trust to stand up to Obama, and trust to stay a Republican." But Rubio's campaign biography does not say that he's a Republican. Back to Grady's statement. In rescinding his endorsement, Grady said Crist removed Republican references from his U.S. Senate campaign website. No, there's not a prominent picture of Crist hugging Ronald Reagan on the site, or a big splashy "R" next to Crist's name, but there is still considerable talk about Crist's conservative credentials. It's in his biography, detailed in press releases and on issue statements, and available for viewing on a computer near you. Plus, if you were going to remove reference to the GOP, you would likely also remove the press release promising not to run as anything other than a Republican. There's no evidence the website has changed. We rate Grady's statement False.	None	Tom Grady	None	None	None	2010-04-21T18:06:50	2010-04-20	['None']

pomt-15135	"Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history."	true	/florida/statements/2015/sep/02/jeb-bush/did-donald-trump-propose-biggest-tax-hike-history-/	Republican candidates continue to attack Donald Trump on his past positions, claiming he is not the conservative he says he is today. Jeb Bush picked up the attack by taking on Trump over tax policy. "I cut taxes every year," Bush said at an Aug. 20 rally in New Hampshire. "He’s proposed the largest tax increase in mankind’s history, not just our own country’s history." The next day Bush repeated the basic claim in a fundraising email: "Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history." Seems like something worth fact-checking. Trump’s tax plan in 1999 A spokesman for Bush told us that the former Florida governor was referring to Trump’s 1999 proposal to raise taxes on the rich. Trump, who at the time was considering a run for president under the Reform Party, proposed a one-time tax on individuals and trusts with a worth of $10 million or more. Trump said the one-time tax of 14.25 percent would raise $5.7 trillion and wipe out the debt. Trump said if the rich were having trouble liquidating their assets they could pay off their tax over 10 years. The New York Daily News featured a photograph of Trump with the words, "SOAK THE RICH." Experts at the time bashed Trump’s plan as economically and politically unviable. "I don't think the plan makes much economic sense," said Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute told the New York Times in 1999. "The fact is that most people's wealth that has been built up over 10, 20 or 50 years is wealth that has already been taxed." Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation in 1999 said of Trump’s plan at the time, "The lunacy of this idea is almost indescribable." He raised concerns about the economic consequences including that households would shift assets overseas to try to avoid confiscation. Trump calculated that 1 percent of Americans would pay the Trump tax. He proposed that half the savings would go toward middle-class tax cuts and the other half for Social Security. A spokeswoman for Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, Hope Hicks, wouldn’t tell us if Trump still supports that plan and said that he will release his current tax plan later in September. But in 2011, talk show host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump if he still supported that tax, and Trump said it was no longer viable. "Well, at a time, it would have paid off the deficit. I mean, you wouldn't have a deficit, at that time," Trump said (though he confused debt and deficit). "Unfortunately, the world has changed, today you can't do it. Today, and I'm very strongly against tax increases. And the reason I'm-" "So, you're no longer for that tax?" Stephanopoulos asked. "No, no. I'm no longer for that tax, no," Trump said. Would Trump’s tax have broken records? Many tax experts told us that indeed Trump’s plan would have been record-breaking in terms of revenue, but they said it was never going to happen and lacked major details. "It certainly would have been the biggest ever simply because of its sheer size -- it was trillions of dollars," said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. However, "it’s a totally crazy idea. ... I don't think anybody was taking it seriously -- it was Donald Trump being Donald Trump." The United States’ gross domestic product in 1999 was $9.7 trillion, so if Trump’s tax had raised $5.7 trillion, that would have been 59 percent of GDP, said Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute. Federal tax hikes typically are no more than 1 percent of GDP, Edwards said. "The Bush 1990 hike and Clinton 1993 hike were less than 1 percent of GDP over 5 years — whereas Trump’s tax would have been 59 percent one time in one year," Edwards said. PolitiFact previously has looked into the largest tax increases as a percentage of GDP. Topping the list from 1940-2006 was the Revenue Act of 1942, which was about 5 percent of GDP. Richard Phillips, an expert at the Citizens for Tax Justice research group, which aims to require the wealthy to pay their fair share, said that Trump’s one-time tax proposal can’t be compared to conventional tax reform, which typically refers to taxes collected annually. "His estimate was based on a back of the envelope calculation of total wealth of individuals with over $10 million in assets multiplied by the 14.25 percent rate," he said. "There are very real questions as to whether you could plausibly tax all forms of wealth and whether wealthy individuals would be able to take action to shield large swaths of their wealth from taxation." Additionally, Trump proposed repealing the estate tax and enacting other tax cuts using the revenue that the federal government would save by no longer paying interest on the national debt. It’s not clear how much those tax cuts would have cost and how much of the tax they would offset over time, Phillips said. Our ruling Bush said, "Trump proposed enacting the largest tax increase in American history." Yes, in 1999, Trump proposed a historically large one-time tax increase. Trump said the tax would have raised $5.7 trillion and wiped out the national debt. It would have applied only to the wealthiest Americans. This claim rates True.

pomt-05499	"The bulk of the people who are shot with a weapon — other than these drug gangs taking on one another — end up being shot with their own weapon."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/16/joe-biden/biden-says-most-shootings-happen-victims-own-gun/	In an interview on CBS’ Face the Nation, Vice President Joe Biden was asked about the Trayvon Martin killing in Sanford, Fla. "Do you, on balance, think these laws are good laws?" host Bob Schieffer asked in the April 1, 2012, program, referring to Florida’s "stand your ground" self-defense law and others around the country. Biden said he thinks it’s important to protect Second Amendment rights but expressed skepticism of laws that could result in people putting themselves in harm’s way. He said he’s "not so sure of" the idea that owning and carrying guns makes people safer. He also threw out this claim about gun violence: "You know, the bulk of the people who are shot with a weapon — other than these drug gangs taking on one another — end up being shot with their own weapon." We decided to check that out. Biden’s office pointed us to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which shows that the majority of firearm deaths in the U.S. are by suicide, and most suicides are committed with the deceased's own gun. David Hemenway, a public health professor at Harvard University, looked at 2009 specifically and noted that the CDC figures show 18,735 firearm suicides; 11,493 firearm homicides; and some 554 unintentional firearm deaths. "The large majority of firearm suicides use their own (or the family gun), while the large majority of firearm homicides are shot with someone else’s gun," Hemenway said. So Biden’s statement, in Hemenway’s estimation, is "very likely true" if Biden was talking only about firearm deaths. Statistics that include non-fatal shootings paint a different picture, with more resulting from assaults than from suicides. "The estimates of non-fatal shootings are very rough (estimated from under 100 emergency departments), but the CDC estimates from 2009 are only 3,000 plus non-fatal suicide shootings, compared to over 44,000 assault shootings," he said. Including non-fatal shootings in the study group, Hemenway said, makes Biden’s statement "very likely untrue" because people don’t typically become the victim of assaults with their own guns. Donald Braman, a law professor at George Washington University, also said the statement is "probably technically true but also misleading as most gun fatalities are suicides." "Biden's claim implies that people are having their weapons turned against them by someone else when, in fact, the modal gun death is probably a debt-ridden farmer," Braman wrote in an email. We agree that Biden did not seem to be talking about suicides. He was answering a question about self-defense laws and the danger of people putting themselves in harm’s way. And certainly the Martin killing was unrelated to suicide. "What Biden seems to be saying," Braman wrote, "is that the likelihood that you will shoot someone with a gun you buy in self-defense is smaller than the likelihood that you (or someone in your household) will be shot with that same gun. That is technically true unless you start excluding suicides, etc. -- then I don't know -- and he's got a point: guns most often injure people in the gun owner's household, not an intruder or stranger. "But it is also potentially misleading in two ways. First, it suggests that people who buy guns are more likely to be harmed than protected by a gun they buy. We just don't have good data on that. … Second, it suggests that the harms people are suffering are at the hands of others, when (as I pointed out before) most of the time it is a suicide or suicide attempt." Our ruling Biden said "the bulk" of people who are shot with a weapon are shot with their own weapon. The numbers that back up that statement refer only to fatal shootings, including a high proportion of suicides. CDC figures show, and our experts verified, that the majority of gun deaths are suicides, and the majority of suicides are committed with a person’s own gun or a gun owned by someone in the household. Although the numbers for non-fatal shootings are rough, such assaults typically don't involve the use of the victim's gun, experts told us. Biden cited a true statistic but left out the important detail and context that he was talking only about fatal shootings, which would include suicides. That meets our definition of Half True.

pomt-00402	"Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/04/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-tweet-collins-hunter-i/	President Donald Trump attacked his attorney general on Twitter, blaming the nation’s top lawyer for bringing charges against two Republican lawmakers ahead of the midterm elections. Trump claimed the investigations, which culminated recently in a pair of federal indictments, began during the presidency of his predecessor Barack Obama. "Two long running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department," Trump tweeted. "Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump did not identify the lawmakers by name. He didn’t have to. In the past several weeks, the department has issued indictments against Republican Reps. Chris Collins of New York and Duncan Hunter of California. The two men were among Trump’s earliest supporters on Capitol Hill during the 2016 campaign. Trump’s tweet has been criticized as an attack on both the rule of law, as well as the Justice Department’s generally apolitical posture. Here, we’re interested in whether the recent indictments stem from investigations that began under Obama, as Trump claimed. (We’re not examining the popularity of the congressmen in question.) The Justice Department does not typically confirm the timeline of grand juries, and the department declined our request for comment on this story. Our research is limited to the indictments themselves, as well as public reporting. So far, the available evidence suggests one investigation began during Trump’s presidency. The timing of other is less clear. Chris Collins investigation All public evidence suggests Collins’ investigation began under Trump, not Obama. What’s more, the charges he faces stem from a phone call made in June 2017, months after Trump took office and his pick to lead the Justice Department, Sessions, was confirmed. Collins is accused of insider trading. The charges stem from a phone call he made to his son Cameron to relay closely-held details about an Australian biotech company. Both men held stock in the firm. As a board member of the company, Innate Immunotherapeutic, Chris Collins learned — before it was publicly known — that the company had failed a pivotal drug trial. Had the drug passed the test, it would have offered a lucrative treatment for a certain form of multiple sclerosis. Instead, the public announcement of the negative results caused the stock price to plummet by 92 percent. But before the results became public, Collins called his son, a shareholder, so that he could dump the stock, the indictment says. Timely trades by the father and son, along with a third defendant, allowed them to avoid losses totaling more than $768,000. That phone call took place in June 2017 — months after Trump succeeded Obama. The defendants were indicted Aug. 8 in the Southern District of New York. All three pleaded not guilty. Preet Bharara, who served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 2009 to 2017, until he was fired by Trump, would almost certainly know if the Collins investigation started under the previous administration. "Chris Collins was not an Obama era investigation," Bharara tweeted in response to Trump. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Duncan Hunter investigation The start date of Hunter’s investigation is a bit trickier. Hunter and his wife have been charged with misusing $250,000 in campaign funds to finance personal expenses like family trips. The couple also is alleged to have filed false campaign finance records. Hunter’s behavior generated some attention prior to Trump taking the White House. The Office of Congressional Ethics, a government watchdog established by the U.S. House of Representatives, asked the House Committee on Ethics to look into allegations about Hunter in August 2016. Some of the misconduct he’s since been indicted for also predates the 2016 election. That said, the first news reports that Hunter was under criminal investigation appear to have surfaced in March 2017, during Trump’s presidency. "The Hunter one has probably been pending longer (than the Collins investigation)," said Lisa Kern Griffin, a law professor at Duke University. "Though it’s hard to say whether DOJ ‘opened’ it before or after the election or transition." Hunter’s charges indicate they were issued by a "September 2016 Grand Jury." So is that when the grand jury began investigating Hunter’s case? Not necessarily, say legal experts. "A grand jury usually will work on a lot of matters, and even if this grand jury started in September 2016, it might have been working on other things until the last several months," said Andrew Leipold, a law professor at University of Illinois College of Law. In other words, it’s possible the grand jury began working on Hunter’s case after the election. "You just can’t tell from the indictment," Leipold said. Our ruling Trump said the investigations of two Republican congressmen began under Obama. The jumping-off point for the Collins insider-trading investigation was a phone call that began months after Obama left office. The start date of Hunter’s investigation is a bit trickier. A congressional watchdog looked into campaign finance allegations prior to Trump’s presidency, and some of the misconduct he’s since been indicted for also predates the 2016 presidential election. But the first public reports that Hunter was under criminal investigation appear to have surfaced in March 2017, during Trump’s presidency. We rate this Mostly False.

pomt-02137	Idaho Republican Rep. Mike Simpson is a "liberal" who voted with Nancy Pelosi to "fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes" and "to regulate the sale of firearms."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/07/madison-action-fund/are-mike-simpson-and-nancy-pelosi-politically-alig/	We’ve seen plenty of Democrats called out for voting records that closely align with President Barack Obama and other party leaders. But it isn’t every day that a conservative super PAC claims that an eight-term Republican congressman is closely aligned with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. The Madison Action Fund is claiming just that, running an ad in Idaho linking GOP Rep. Mike Simpson to Pelosi, a frequent target of Republican ire. Here’s what the ad says: "How liberal is congressman Mike Simpson? Simpson voted with Nancy Pelosi to bail out Wall Street. That wasnt enough spending for Mike Simpson, so he joined Pelosi in voting to take more of your money to fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes. Simpson also joined Pelosi in voting to regulate the sale of firearms." (We should note that what’s good for the goose is good for the gander: A group backing Simpson is also running ads tying his Republican primary opponent, Bryan Smith, to Pelosi. We checked that claim separately here). Simpson did in fact vote for the Wall Street bailout, as Pelosi did. But beyond that, the ad gets more dubious. Is Simpson a "liberal"? Despite what the ad suggests, Simpson and Pelosi have very different voting records. In the current Congress, spanning 820 votes, Simpson and Pelosi have voted the same way just 29 percent of the time, according to OpenCongress.org, a website created by the pro-transparency Sunlight Foundation. Still, 29 percent isn’t nothing and some may say, if Simpson was a real conservative, he would vote with Pelosi 0 percent of the time. Maybe, but not every congressional vote is polarized, and even some of the most conservative members of Congress have voted with Pelosi at least on some issues. For instance, no one would confuse Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., for a liberal, yet Bachmann and Pelosi have voted the same way 24 percent of the time since January 2012. Simpson has voted with his party 95 percent of the time. Calling him a liberal and insinuating ideological coziness between him and Pelosi is simply inaccurate. Did Simpson and Pelosi both vote "to fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes"? This is an exaggeration. The Madison Action Fund’s ad cites a House vote from July 10, 2003. (You read that right — this happened 10 years ago.) On that day, the House of Representatives voted to pass an appropriations bill to fund the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, which included money for the National Institutes of Health. An amendment to the bill offered by then-Rep. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., sought to strip funding from five National Institutes of Health research grants. Toomey said one of those grants was a "study on San Francisco's Asian prostitutes and masseuses." Simpson voted against Toomey’s amendment. Pelosi (who represents San Francisco) did as well, and it narrowly failed. But Toomey’s description of the research grant might have warranted a ruling from the Truth-O-Meter were it around back then. The grant was awarded to the University of California San Francisco, the home of the AIDS Research Institute, and studied ways to reduce HIV risks among Asian women. Researchers pinpointed commercial sex workers at massage parlors as a key source of the large increase in HIV prevalence among Asian and Pacific islanders in the Bay area, for whom AIDS was the second-leading cause of death among those aged 25 to 44 in San Francisco in 2001. The researchers interviewed sex workers about their background, education, history of violence from customers, and sexual health, in order to develop programs to improve awareness of drug abuse and STD prevention among at-risk Asian-American popuations. Whether this research should have been selected for funding given the limited pool of money available is a reasonable question to debate, but saying it was to "fund sex study programs of San Francisco prostitutes" fails to factor in the public-health concerns at stake. Did Simpson and Pelosi vote together "to regulate the sale of firearms"? This claim goes even further back. The Madison Action Fund singles out Simpson’s votes on the Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act, a 1999 bill that emerged in the aftermath of the Columbine High School shooting. While on the surface the bill added some background check provisions for gun shows, the measure was more complicated. It included an amendment that actually eased restrictions on firearm purchases at gun shows. That measure, which had strong backing from the NRA and was harshly criticized by President Bill Clinton, passed the House with help from 45 Democrats. Simpson voted for it; Pelosi did not. Clinton called the vote "a great victory for the NRA." But it also included an amendment that was added to require safety locks to be sold with all handguns. The amendment had overwhelming bipartisan support, including from a majority of Republicans. Simpson voted for it, as did Pelosi, and it passed 311-115. The National Rifle Association ultimately urged Republicans to back the entire bill on final passage. Simpson followed the NRA’s lead and voted for the bill. Pelosi didn’t. And it failed 147-280. So ultimately, Simpson and Pelosi were mostly on opposite sides of the fight over this bill. Most importantly, when it came on votes to "regulate the sale of firearms," Simpson voted to loosen restrictions while Pelosi wanted to maintain the status quo. They only voted on the same side on a measure to require safety locks on handguns. Our ruling The ad cherry picks a handful of votes to create the impression that Simpson and Pelosi are in ideological lockstep. But the votes chosen are old, cherry-picked and deeply misleading. Suggesting any substantial alliance between Simpson and Pelosi is ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-04168	Says the Portland Children’s Levy holds its "administrative expenses to less than 5 percent."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/dec/19/dan-saltzman/are-administrative-costs-capped-5-percent-portland/	CORRECTION APPENDED: RACC has a 3 percent cap on programming at schools, not for arts grants administration. This does not change the ruling. Advocates of new taxes for programs know that voters want the money to go to the people the tax is supposed to serve. So, when supporters of a tax levy for children pitched the program in 2002 and in 2008, they made sure to tell voters that administrative costs would be capped at 5 percent of all money received from an increase in property taxes. That means 95 percent of the money goes toward direct services for low-income and at-risk children, or at least, to the programs that serve those children. Portland City Commissioner Dan Saltzman made the same point on KGW’s "Straight Talk" recently. (The statement is about 10 minutes into the interview.) The City Council has voted to put the property tax levy on the May 2013 ballot. In singing the levy’s praises, he said, "And we hold our administrative expenses to less than 5 percent." We wanted to know if the figure is accurate, and if so, what that means. We noticed that the campaign pitching a Portland arts tax this fall also stated that administrative costs would be capped at 5 percent, after startup costs. So clearly it’s trendy number. (Jessica Jarratt Miller, executive director of the Creative Advocacy Network, said in an email that they borrowed the figure from the Portland Children’s Levy.) W e checked the annual audits of the Portland Children’s Levy and confirmed that levy administrators have consistently met the standard of keeping costs at or below 5 percent. For a sense of the dollars, the latest progress report shows that in 2010-11, the fund brought in $12.9 million, bringing the total available to $19.1 million. Of that, $560,000 was spent on administration. That’s 4.3 percent of $12.9 million. Now, we should point out that the administrative cap doesn’t work on an annual basis, according to the levy. If fund administrators don’t use up the entire 5 percent in one year, they can the following year. Which is why in fiscal year 2011-12, revenue was $10.8 million but administration expenses were $565,000, or 5.2 percent. Levy administrators look at the cumulative figure: Spokeswoman Mary Gay Broderick reports that from July 1, 2003, through June 30, 2012, total revenue was $95.7 million, with $4.5 million of the money spent on administration. That comes out to 4.7 percent. Grants totaled nearly $90.2 million. What is an administrative cost? Broderick explains they include all the costs associated with allocating, negotiating and monitoring grants. This includes salaries and benefits for staff, office lease, outside audit, computer costs, office supplies and general overhead, such as access to payroll and city attorney services. Other groups may define administrative costs differently. (The groups that receive grant money from the Children’s Levy use a different marker and the rates are negotiated separately. Generally, administration costs cannot exceed 15 percent of program expenses.) Finally, is a 5 percent cap a norm? We don’t know, and neither does Saltzman. He does not recall how early advocates settled on the figure. "I think the 5 percent came from my belief that we had a pretty high bar to gain public support for investing in kids, and they need to be assured that most of the dollars are going not for our administration but to the programs," he said. We hunted around for some context. The Portland Development Commission, which is the city’s economic development arm, granted $158,000 last year as part of its "Green Features Grant" program. Total staff time to manage the program was $17,000. That’s about a 10 percent administrative rate. PDC granted $569,000 through its "Community Livability Grant" program, with $87,000 to administer the program. That’s about 13 percent of costs. The Oregon Department of Justice tracks charities and nonprofits in Oregon. Management expenses and fundraising made up of expenses in 16 percent in 2009 and 13 percent in 2010. So 5 percent spent on issuing and tracking grants sounds reasonable. Portland’s Revenue Director Thomas Lannom said comparing administrative caps may not even be the most accurate way of gauging efficiency. An outfit like the Portland Children’s Levy needs little to no resources to collect revenue -- it comes out of property taxes -- while the new arts tax will require bodies to collect what is basically a head tax of $35 per adult worker. Lannom explained that voters authorized his office to spend up to 5 percent of revenue to collect the money. The Regional Arts and Culture Council has a separate 3 percent cap on coordination costs. PolitiFact Oregon can’t judge what is the proper amount for administrative costs, but we can say that Saltzman is accurate when he says the Portland Children’s Levy holds its "administrative expenses to less than 5 percent." The statement is True.	None	Dan Saltzman	None	None	None	2012-12-19T06:00:00	2012-11-11	['None']
pomt-14223	"The city of Charlotte passed a bathroom ordinance mandate on every private-sector employer in Charlotte."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/17/pat-mccrory/nc-gov-pat-mccrory-defends-hb2-meet-press/	North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory defended a law striking down a local LGBT anti-discrimination ordinance as a move against government intrusion Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press. The city council of Charlotte, N.C., passed the ordinance in late February outlawing discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender people in the city. Even though the protections were wide-ranging, the law has been dubbed the "bathroom ordinance" because it prohibited businesses from denying transgender people access to the bathroom consistent with the gender they identify with. In response, the North Carolina Legislature held an emergency session a month later and quickly sent a bill repealing the Charlotte ordinance — and prohibiting ones like it — to McCrory’s desk. McCrory’s signature prompted a national backlash from the gay community, businesses such as PayPal and celebrities including Bruce Springsteen. From the beginning, McCrory has characterized the now-defunct ordinance as extreme government overreach in statements, videos and most recently his national interview with NBC host Chuck Todd. "The city of Charlotte passed a bathroom ordinance mandate on every private-sector employer in Charlotte, N.C," McCrory said April 17. "It's not government's business to tell the private sector what their bathroom, locker room, or shower practices should be. Not only the private business, but also the Y.M.C.A. and other non-profit organizations." When Todd pressed McCrory to explain the lack of dialogue ahead of the Legislature’s one-day special session to pass the law, he returned to his talking point: "But again, I don't think government should be telling the private sector what their restroom and shower law should be, to allow a man into a woman's restroom, or a shower facility at a YMCA, for example." Is it true that the Charlotte ordinance would have dictated the bathroom practices of the entire private sector? "The Charlotte ordinance was clearly a mandate on every private business open to the public," Josh Ellis, McCrory’s communications director, told PolitiFact. Unlike his spokesman, McCrory didn’t specify that the "mandate" applies to businesses "open to the public." The distinction is important for this fact-check. Broadly speaking, the Charlotte ordinance expanded existing protections for race, color, religion and national origin to also cover marital and familial status, sexual orientation, and gender identity and expression. The ordinance also struck down a section exempting the YMCA, YWCA and similar dormitories from a law ensuring equal access to services and facilities based on sex. Under the ordinance, it would have been illegal: 1. for the government of Charlotte to do business with anyone who had discriminated against those categories; 2. to deny "the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation" based on those categories; 3. and to make and circulate any statements or signs indicating that public accommodation will be refused based on those categories. Key to this fact-check are the words "place of public accommodation," which refers to any business offering services or goods to the public, per Charlotte’s municipal code. The definition is broad, but not as all-encompassing as McCrory makes it sound. It would have been illegal for places such as stores, hospitals, movie theaters, restaurants and hotels to prohibit transgender customers from using the bathroom or locker room with the gender he or she identifies with, according to a factsheet forwarded to us by city attorney Bob Hagemann. Hagemann also noted that the ordinance only protected customers, not employees. (The ordinance did not include protections for firing or hiring based on sexual orientation or gender identity.) In other words, the ordinance wouldn’t have really impacted businesses that don’t typically deal with customers or patrons in person, such as call centers, manufacturing plants, distribution centers and self-employed workers without office space. What’s more, the ordinance would have specifically exempted establishments closed to the public like private clubs, advocacy and religious organizations with strongly held beliefs like churches or charities, and nonprofits like homeless shelters, according to the factssheet. So what about the YMCA? Hagemann wasn’t sure if the YMCA, as a Christian charity, would have been exempted under the ordinance. "I don’t know enough about how they operate to know whether they would fall under one or more of the exceptions," Hagemann said. Ellis, McCrory's spokesperson, told PolitiFact the governor's office disagrees with Hagemann's interpretation of the ordinance. "The definition does not specifically exclude 'charities' or 'nonprofits.' In fact, the YMCA makes entertainment and recreation (and probably other services) available to the public, which would put it under the definition of a place of public accommodation," Ellis said. "Bottom line, we see the ordinance as applying to the YMCA." The YMCA of Charlotte did not respond immediately to calls or an email for comment. The YWCA of Central Carolinas, meanwhile, currently has a policy of allowing members to use the "the bathroom/locker room that is appropriate for them based on their gender identity" and supports the repeal of HB2. Our ruling McCrory said, "The city of Charlotte passed a bathroom ordinance mandate on every private-sector employer in Charlotte." This is an exaggeration. The ordinance would have applied to place of public accommodation, like hotels and stores and other places selling goods and services to the public. While that is a big category, the ordinance would not have applied to private clubs, nonprofits or organizations with viewpoints that would have been at odds with the law, nor would have it really impacted business that don't deal with customers. The talking point contains an element of truth but exaggerates the scope of the law. We rate his statement Mostly False. Update: After we published this fact-check, we heard back from Josh Ellis, McCrory's spokesman. It has been updated to include his comments. The ruling remains unchanged. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d1960bf-248e-4286-ac92-d47880bff82d	None	Pat McCrory	None	None	None	2016-04-17T18:58:00	2016-04-17	['Charlotte,_North_Carolina']

pomt-04428	Signs letter saying Consumer Product Safety Commission is acting "without consultation or input from the company" to stop the sale of Buckyballs.	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/oct/15/marsha-blackburn/blackburn-letter-claims-consumer-commission-stoppi/	Buckyballs and Buckycubes, tiny rare earth magnets manufactured in China and sold by the Maxfield & Oberton Co. of New York, are intended to be adult desk toys. They’re marketed as "the amazing magnetic desk toys you can’t put down," and have received rave reviews in magazines like Maxim, Wired, Esquire and People. They’ve also been swallowed by children and have been the cause of emergency surgeries. In July, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, in filing only its second administrative complaint in 11 years, charged that their design poses a "substantial risk of injury to the public." U.S. Reps. Marsha Blackburn and Phil Roe, both R-Tenn., and five other members of Congress, wrote to President Obama on Oct. 1, saying the CPSC "is penalizing our nation’s brightest innovators and job creators through excessive and selective enforcement." The congressmen go on to say that they learned of the Buckyballs case during a recent hearing. They say CPSC "overreach and lack of flexibility has virtually eliminated these products and the jobs associated with their sales and distribution." They ask the president to review the case and for the CPSC to continue to work cooperatively with the company. They point out that 2.5 million of the small magnetic cube and ball toys have been sold in the past three years. Then they say that the "CPSC is working, without consultation or input from the company, to eliminate this product by stopping the sale of their products by directly approaching its retail partners and requesting a recall." We asked Blackburn’s communications director, Mike Reynard, for supporting evidence that the agency was acting without consultation or input from the company. After conferring with staffers, Reynard sent a USA Today story indicating the CPSC has been intervening with retailers to end sales of the magnets as it pursues its lawsuit. He said the lawsuit itself showed the agency is "done working with the company." In a followup email message, Reynard wrote: "You can't say you're working with someone when you are actively suing them to kill their product. That might be the administration's idea of a cooperative working relationship but it isn't for most Americans and business owners. CPSC should be working with Buckyballs to resolve any concerns around these limited cases when compared to the 2.5 million units sold. Clearly they have pushed to get this product off shelves as the USA Today story confirms specific vendors who have pulled the product." Roe spokeswoman Tiffany McGuffee said Roe takes the same position. Then we looked at the lengthy letter from Maxfield & Oberton CEO Craig Zucker laying out its case against the CPSC’s actions. It notes the "extraordinary lengths" the company has taken to prevent misuse of its products, including "warnings, education, labeling, retailer sales restrictions and continuous cooperation with the CPSC – right up until literally the moment they turned on us." Zucker’s letter explains the toys went on sale in March 2009 and were originally labeled for use by those 13 and older. When the federal rules for children’s games changed to include those 14 and older, the company entered into a May 2010 voluntary recall of all the toys with the original labeling. It went on to create a "comprehensive safety program" and began labeling the toys with a warning: "Keep Away From All Children." The company also required retailers to agree to rules for placement of its products in their stores, with new signs. It designed a "Magnet Safety" website in March and met with three CPSC commissioners and staff in April to discuss the expanded safety program. The company also created a medical advisory group and, along with its competitors, created the Coalition for Magnet Safety. But on July 10, the commission voted 3-1 to file the administrative complaint after, it said, "discussions with the company and its representatives failed to result in a voluntary recall plan that CPSC considered to be adequate." The CPSC said that, despite the warnings and labeling, people were still ingesting the magnets, sometimes after placing them on tongues or on cheeks to resemble piercings. The CPSC warned that when two magnets are swallowed, they can be attracted to each other through stomach or intestinal walls, resulting in serious injury requiring surgery. CPSC spokesman Scott Wolfson said in an interview that gastroenterologists have said the injuries often resemble "a gunshot to the gut" but without entrance or exit wounds. Wolfson noted that both Maxfield & Oberton and a Denver-based company, Zen Magnets, were sued after they failed to provide adequate suggestions for making their products safer. They were the first such complaints since the Arkansas-based Daisy BB gun company was sued in 2001. "Due to the number of ingestion incidents received by CPSC staff since the 2010 recall announcement and 2011 safety alert, CPSC staff seeks the remedies outlined in the complaint to stop further incidents and injuries to children," the agency said in a statement. Those remedies include stopping the sale of the toys and providing consumers with refunds. Our ruling Blackburn, Roe and their fellow letter writers are concerned that the "nation’s brightest innovators and job creators" are being penalized by an overzealous consumer protection agency. We’ll leave it to others to determine whether the sellers of Chinese magnetic balls qualify as the nation’s "brightest innovators," and will also decline to determine the truth of the letter writers’ assertion that the agency’s first administrative complaint in 11 years suggest "excessive and selective enforcement." Those are opinions, but it is possible to see whether the CPSC failed to consult or seek input from the company. The lengthy record laid out by the company’s CEO establishes there was, in fact, much consultation leading up the agency’s conclusion that the toys are inherently unsafe. We rule the Congress members’ statement False.	None	Marsha Blackburn	None	None	None	2012-10-15T03:00:00	2012-10-01	['None']
pomt-11387	"Homelessness has skyrocketed across California. We have the nation’s highest homelessness rate and the nation’s highest homeless population."	mostly true	/california/statements/2018/mar/27/travis-allen/has-californias-homeless-population-skyrocketed-an/	As California’s affordable housing crisis deepens, so does the state’s related and often intractable problem: homelessness. Candidates for governor made numerous assertions about the scale of California’s homeless population on March 8, 2018 during a housing forum in Sacramento. Here’s how GOP candidate and Orange County Assemblyman Travis Allen portrayed the depths of California’s human emergency: "Homelessness has skyrocketed across California. We have the nation’s highest homelessness rate and the nation’s highest homeless population." The state has wrestled with this topic for decades, but has homelessness really "skyrocketed"? And how does its per capita and overall homeless population compare with other states? We set out on a fact check. Our research We found answers in a December 2017 report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development: The 2017 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress. It includes a state-by-state comparison of homeless populations based on a one-night count in each state in January 2017. The report tallies per capita homeless rates and total homeless populations along with comprehensive sets of demographic data. Sharon Rapport, associate director for California policy at the Corporation for Supportive Housing, described the report as "the most authoritative" resource on the topic. CSH is a national organization that develops housing policy and makes housing loans. She noted the HUD report is a snapshot of how many people are homeless at any given time. Her organization estimates the number of people who are homeless for at least part of a year is two to three times higher than any point-in-time tally. Has homelessness ‘skyrocketed’ in California? The report shows California’s homeless population jumped nearly 14 percent from 2016 to 2017 — to a total of more than 134,00 people. It rose nearly 9 percent over the previous seven years. That’s much different than the national picture. While the national homeless population ticked up about 1 percent in 2017, it remained 13 percent lower than in 2010, according to an NPR analysis following the report’s release. Notably, the rise statewide and nationally in 2017 was attributed to a surge in the number of people living on the streets in Los Angeles and other West Coast cities, at least in part due to a shortage of affordable housing. Compared to the nation’s relatively small increase, Allen is on track when he says California’s homeless population has "skyrocketed." How would Allen tackle the problem? "We need more state run mental institutions," the lawmaker said at the forum. The institutions would offer the homeless substance abuse and psychiatric services, he said, "so they can get back on their feet and re-enter the workforce." This Tuesday, Jan. 26, 2016 file photo Eddie, 51, a homeless man who would only give his first name and lives in a tent on the street in downtown Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel) Does California have the nation’s highest homelessness rate? On this point, Allen is slightly off target. While the 2017 HUD report shows California’s per capita homeless rate is high, it’s not the highest. California has the third highest rate nationally with 34 in every 10,000 people in the state experiencing homelessness. Two states are worse off: New York and Hawaii. New York ranks second with 45 homeless people per 10,000. Hawaii, meanwhile, ranks first with 51 per 10,000. Does California have the highest homeless population in the nation? Allen is again correct on this part of his statement. The HUD report lists California’s total homeless population at 134,278. That’s about one quarter of the national homeless population of 553,742. New York was a distant second with 89,503 followed by Florida with 32,190. "California does have the highest homeless population in the nation according to the (HUD report), but not the highest rate of homelessness. As a state, our per capita rate is amongst the highest, but it is not the highest," Rapport, of Corporation for Supportive Housing, summarized in an email. Our ruling Candidate for governor and state lawmaker Travis Allen recently claimed homelessness has "skyrocketed" in California and that the state has "the nation’s highest homelessness rate and the nation’s highest homeless population." A December 2017 report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is considered the authority on state-by-state homeless counts, and shows Allen got two of his three points correct. California’s homeless numbers jumped nearly 14 percent in 2017 as nationwide levels remained nearly flat, giving credence to his first point. Meanwhile, the report showed two other states, Hawaii and New York, have a higher per capita homeless rate than California’s. Finally, it shows California, indeed, has the highest total homeless population at 134,278, far more than second place New York. Looking at Allen’s statement in sum, he was on the mark twice and only slightly strayed from the facts on the per capita claim. For that reason, we rate his overall statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE: After publication, we received an email from a spokeswoman for Travis Allen.

pomt-10400	"Casualties and deaths are at (their) lowest point since literally the beginning" of the war.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/06/john-mccain/mccain-overstates-good-news-out-of-iraq/	At a town hall event in Nashville, Tenn., Sen. John McCain told the crowd that casualties and deaths in the Iraq war had reached a new low. "So the war in Iraq has been long and hard and tough and the sacrifice that's been made by brave young Americans has broken all of our hearts," McCain said June 2, 2008. "And we know that the war was terribly mismanaged for nearly four years. And I stood up and was called disloyal by Republicans and attacked by Democrats, Republicans and others because I said that strategy didn't work. And I advocated this new strategy (the troop surge), which obviously, according to news reports that casualties and deaths are, are at its lowest point since literally the beginning, and the success is remarkable." Indeed, there were 19 military deaths related to Operation Iraqi Freedom in May 2008, fewer than any previous month of the war, according to casualty reports issued by the Defense Department. We also checked with two independent organizations that track military deaths, Iraq Coalition Casualty Count and GlobalSecurity.org . The former agreed there were 19 deaths in May; the latter had it at 20, but that included a soldier on leave from Iraq who died in a car accident in Chicago. The month with the next-fewest deaths was February 2004, when 21 military personnel died, according to the Defense Department. So McCain was correct about deaths. But what about casualties? Dictionaries define "casualty" as a member of the armed forces lost to service through death, wounds, injury, sickness, internment or capture. The military's monthly casualty reports , however, include only those lost to service through death and combat-related wounds. Statistics on noncombat injuries and illnesses are not available because the military's medical stations are not required to report them, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Les Melnyk said. We stuck to the military's definition of a casualty, because it keeps the statistics, and found McCain to be incorrect. There were 214 U.S. casualties in May 2008. In three prior months of the war, there were fewer: February 2004 (171), May 2003 (92) and June 2003 (177). By "casualties," McCain also might have meant those wounded in action, excluding deaths. By that standard as well he was off — the 195 wounded in May 2008 exceeded the number in February 2004 (150), January 2004 (187), August 2003 (181), June 2003 (147) and May 2003 (55), according to the Defense Department. McCain left himself wiggle room by attributing the claim to "news accounts." However, we could find no news account prior to McCain's statement that said casualties in May were a new low for the war. It's possible that when McCain said "casualties" he was referring to war-related deaths of Iraqis, another common measure of how the war is going. He may have seen one of the many news reports that said Iraqi deaths were down sharply in May. But as far as we could find, no news organization or independent group reported that the number of Iraqi deaths in May was a record low for the war. Iraq Coalition Casualty Count's total was 506, which exceeded the number of Iraqi deaths in both March and April of 2005 (the site does not have monthly statistics prior to 2005). No U.S. government agency tracks Iraqi deaths, Melnyk said. So by any reasonable measure, McCain was wrong to say casualties were at their lowest point since the beginning of the war. But he was right to make that claim about U.S. military deaths. We rate his claim Half True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-06T00:00:00	2008-06-02	['None']

Bill Powers said in his Sept. 27, 2012, "State of the University" address: "On the teaching side, a key indicator of our ‘business plan’ is the number of undergraduate and graduate degrees we confer each year. We confer more PhDs each year than any other university in America except" the University of California, Berkeley, he said. Nearly No. 1 every year? UT spokesman Gary Susswein and Allison Danforth, a campus expert on reporting and analysis, told us UT-Austin’s conferral of 857 doctoral degrees in 2009-10 placed it second nationally to Berkeley, which bestowed 891.

Susswein said that for its count, the university did not fold in degrees in law and medicine. "The reason is very simple," Susswein said in a voice-mail message. "There is no way to do an apples-to-apples comparison. We don’t have a medical school" at UT-Austin. And, he said, Texas A&M University "doesn’t have a law school. Texas A&M has a veterinary school. The University of Illinois has a medical school and a law school. "Within the realm of PhDs," Susswein said, "we’ve all got liberal arts colleges, we’ve all got engineering schools, we’ve all got science schools. So, it’s a more appropriate way to do an apples-to-apples comparison." Minnesota-based Capella University, which provides online offerings, placed third, awarding 841 doctorates, the tabulation indicates. Traditional universities rounded out the top 10: the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor; University of Florida; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; the main campus of Ohio State University; University of California-Los Angeles; University of Wisconsin-Madison; and Stanford University, where 703 doctorates were awarded. Susswein said, too, that two days before Powers gave his speech, the national center posted information reflecting the results in 2010-11. UT-Austin bestowed 801 PhDs that year, placing third nationally behind Berkeley (920) and Capella (819). So, UT was second to Berkeley one year and third the year after. And how about "each" year, as Powers said? At our request, UT followed up by checking the database for the PhDs given out by each institution each year starting in 2003-04 through 2008-09, the year before the one initially stressed by UT. Over the six earlier years, Berkeley ranked first or second nationally in PhDs granted. In 2005-06, UT-Austin placed first nationally, besting Berkeley. In each of the other years, UT’s count placed it third to sixth nationally in PhDs awarded. For outside perspective, we reached Michael McLendon, a Southern Methodist University professor expert on higher education. McLendon said it’s not out of line for any university to compare its total PhDs granted to those given out by other institutions. He said, too, he was unaware of another measure that would give a meaninful glimpse into the productivity of universities at that level. McLendon said a mission of the nation’s public research universities is to create the next generation of scientists, scholars and researchers.The volume of students who achieve PhDs, he said, is an important indicator. UT-Austin, he said, "looks very good." Our ruling Powers said that each year, UT-Austin confer more PhDs than any other U.S. university except Berkeley. That was so in 2009-10 -- and in another recent year, UT awarded even more PhDs than Berkeley. In other years, however, UT ranked third, fourth, sixth, third and fourth nationally in PhDs bestowed as Berkeley ranked first or second. In the end, this speech claim misrepresents the results for each year by cherry-picking how the two public universities finished in one year, and those results were (narrowly) not even the latest available count. UT annually awards many PhDs. But each year of late, its total PhDs awarded has gone up and down compared to outcomes at Berkeley and a few other institutions. Put another way, UT fell short of this proclaimed finish in six out of eight recent years. We rate the statement, incorrectly making UT's tally out to be consistently second-best in the land, as Mostly False.

pomt-13290	Says "Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2016/oct/10/clearpath-action-fund/response-politifact-ohio-super-pac-takes-down-its-/	ClearPath Action Fund, a conservative clean-energy and environmental PAC, cheered U.S. Sen. Rob Portman in a digital ad, calling him a "clean energy champion." The ad said of the Republican senator, "Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed." PolitiFact previously looked into how many Republicans in Congress say they believe that climate change is real, and caused by human activity. The Republican lawmakers we identified who affirm climate change included Rep. Michael Grimm, N.Y.; Sen. Susan Collins, Maine; Sen. Lamar Alexander, Tenn.; Sen. Mark Kirk, Ill.; Rep. Chris Smith, N.J.; Sen. Bob Corker, Tenn.; Sen. John Thune, S.D.; and Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, N.J. Portman didn’t make PolitiFact’s list, so we wanted to clarify his climate change stance. We asked ClearPath Action Fund for the sources they used to champion Portman’s position, and a spokesman sent us three links. The first two were votes on amendments to the Keystone XL Pipeline Act in January 2015 (which was after PolitiFact did its roundup of Republicans who believe in climate change). The climate change amendments were only symbolic gauges of the "sense of the Senate." Portman voted "yea" on the first, introduced by Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, "to express the sense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax." That amendment passed. Portman also voted in support of a second amendment by Republican Sen. John Hoeven, a Keystone bill sponsor, which said that human activity affects climate change, but still supported the passage of the pipeline bill. That amendment fell short of the required 60 by one vote, and Hoeven himself voted against it. So far, so good for ClearPath Action Fund. Here's how one wrong word — "significantly" — pulls the PAC's praise for Portman's record into negative territory. A Democrat, Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, inched the global warming language a step further, calling for a vote on an amendment that stated "human activity significantly contributes to climate change." The adverb represents the crux of the partisan divide over climate change. The word "significantly" was significant enough for Portman to vote against that amendment, along with almost all of his fellow Republicans. Collins, Kirk, Alexander, Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) broke party lines and voted in favor. Portman has explained in interviews that he doesn’t want to qualify the impact that human activity has on the climate because "scientists have different views on that." These word gymnastics are necessary for Portman because of his large constituency in Ohio coal country. Coal-burning power plants provide 44 percent of the electricity used in the U.S., but are the biggest contributor to air pollution, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. "Sense of the Senate resolutions are done for messaging reasons, either in an attempt to move the policy debate, or to provide political cover of some sort. I think you had both types in play with the Keystone vote," said David Jenkins, president at Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship. More recently, Portman voted for an amendment proposed by Graham that stated, "Climate change is real; human activity contributes to climate change," and that "the United States should be a world leader in addressing climate change…(and) Congress has a responsibility to take actions that reduce emissions and combat climate change..." Absent, again, is the word "significantly." But it is in the language of the ClearPath Action ad: "Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed." ClearPath Action’s communications director, Darren Goode, responded immediately to PolitiFact via email, and said the group had made an "honest mistake" by including the s-word. "We have already pulled that video down and will fix it to reflect that," Goode wrote. While ClearPath Action confers "clean energy champion" status to Portman, at least two other environmental groups beg to differ. The National Resources Defense Council has regularly hammered Portman for sponsoring such measures as a budget amendment to allow states to opt out of the 1970 Clean Art Act and Clean Power Plan requirements for cutting carbon pollution. Likewise, the League of Conservation Voters gives Portman a low rating on their scorecard for his voting record on environmentally impactful measures. Our ruling An ad by ClearPath Action said, "Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed." While Portman did vote for a bipartisan bill recognizing climate change as a threat in need of action, that bill did not include the word "significantly." Portman has voted against other amendments when they include the word "significantly," and has voted for amendments that do not quantify how much human activity affects climate change. ClearPath Action has since discontinued the ad, admitted the mistake and pledged to release a corrected version. We rate the original version of the ad Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/67974c57-e2bb-4327-a497-e2db21a126f0	None	ClearPath Action Fund	None	None	None	2016-10-10T14:20:12	2016-09-28	['None']

pomt-03568	The IRS is "going to be in charge of our health care."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/20/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-irs-going-be-charge-our-heal/	Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. is one of a number of Republican lawmakers who have recently sought to link the two longtime targets of conservatives -- the Internal Revenue Service and President Barack Obama’s health care law. In a May 15, 2013, interview with Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren, Bachmann invoked an inspector general’s report critical of the IRS’ scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. She said, "So now we find out these people are making decisions based on our politics and beliefs, and they're going to be in charge of our health care. There's a huge national database that's being created right now. Your health care, my health care, all the Fox viewers’ health care, their personal, intimate, most close to the vest secrets will be in that database, and the IRS is in charge of that database? So the IRS will have the ability potentially -- will they? -- to deny health care, to deny access, to delay health care? This is serious! Based upon our political beliefs? That's why we have to repeal Obamacare. And I still think it's possible." We’ll be looking at a few claims from this exchange. In this item, we’ll look at whether there’s support for her claim that the IRS is "going to be in charge of our health care." The IRS has a number of roles in implementing the health care law -- the agency has posted a list that includes everything from levying additional payroll taxes on certain high-income Americans to taxation of medical devices and brand-name drugs. Its best known role, beginning in 2014, is to confirm that a taxpayer has health insurance and to assess a financial penalty if they do not. (The penalties start at $95 per adult in 2013 and rise to $695 per adult in 2016.) In another fact-check, we discussed another key role for the IRS -- approving subsidies for Americans seeking insurance on the newly created health exchanges. To do this, the IRS will need to check its databases to make sure an applicant is eligible to receive subsidies. But while we noted that any technical failures in carrying out this task could be problematic, it would be a huge stretch to say that this power puts the IRS "in charge of our health care." For one thing, most Americans will not see any dramatic change in how they obtain insurance, since the law leaves in place the existing system of health coverage provided by employers. In fact, in 2010, we chose the claim that the law amounts to a "government takeover of health care" as our Lie of the Year. To claim that one portion of the government -- the IRS -- is going to run health care is even more far-fetched. The IRS will have nothing to do with the nuts-and-bolts provision of health care to Americans. Even among federal agencies, the law puts far more responsibility in the hands of the Department of Health and Human Services. The department’s Web page on the health care law says that "HHS is responsible for implementing many of the health reform changes included in the Affordable Care Act," including "significant roles" for an alphabet soup of HHS offices, including the Administration on Aging, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the Indian Health Service, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The duties of the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the health care law is expansive enough to fill a 5-foot by 10-foot chart, according to an op-ed by Mike Leavitt, who held the office under President George W. Bush. "It puts more power than is prudent in the hands of one person," Leavitt wrote. Dan Kotman, a spokesman for Bachmann, explained her comment by saying that "the Supreme Court ruled that Obamacare only meets the constitutionality standard as a tax, and the entity in the United States that enforces tax policy is the IRS. If you don’t comply with Obamacare’s individual mandate, you will be answering to the IRS. That is clearly the context she’s talking within because she had just said, ‘The IRS, Greta, is the chief enforcer of Obamacare.’" But several health policy experts agreed that’s not the same as the IRS being "in charge of our health care." William McBride, an economist with the business-backed Tax Foundation, said the IRS has been tasked with "a tremendous amount" and that the agency is in "uncharted territory," but he added that he doubts the IRS "will effectively control much of anything related to health care." Other health policy specialists were even more blunt. "Not accurate," said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and who is now a health policy consultant. It’s a "ludicrous statement," said Jonathan Oberlander, professor of social medicine and health policy and management at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Our ruling Bachmann said the IRS is "going to be in charge of our health care." The IRS does play a number of key roles under the health care law, but it’s wrong to say it would "be in charge" of any American’s health care. The IRS won’t oversee interactions between doctors and patients, nor will it play any more of a role than confirming that exchange purchasers qualify for subsidies. Even within the government, HHS plays a much bigger role. We rate Bachmann’s claim False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2013-05-20T12:02:13	2013-05-15	['None']

pomt-12012	Says the Austin metro region "will lead" the nation "with population growth over 50%" over the next 30 years.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/sep/20/john-thomaides/john-thomaides-san-marcos-mayor-says-austin-region/	San Marcos Mayor John Thomaides floated big numbers in a tweet suggesting the Austin area is on pace to outgrow all other places nationally in coming decades. "Metro population will grow by 67 million people over the next 30 years," Thomaides wrote in June 2017. "Austin metro will lead with population growth over 50%." Watch out San Antonio and parts between, Austin's about to bulge worse than the perilous interstate that splits Texas. But hold on: We can’t fact-check whether predictions will come true. In this instance instead, we focused on whether Thomaides, who was elected mayor in 2016, had a solid factual basis for his claim about the Austin metropolitan area’s likely population. Mayor cites economist For starters, Thomaides told us by email that he jotted the information in his tweet while attending a panel discussion including economist Jim Diffley during the 2017 United States Conference of Mayors in Miami Beach. Diffley, who works for IHS Markit, a consulting firm that says it gives clients including governments and banks "next-generation information, analytics and solutions," later confirmed that he’d delivered the numbers--including the firm’s expectation that from 2016 to 2046, metro regions nationally will gain 66 million added residents. Diffley emailed us a May 2017 IHS Markit report presenting the firm’s population-growth forecasts for metro areas coast to coast--including a chart in the report’s appendix stating that from 2016 to 2046, the five-county Austin-Round Rock area’s population will grow 87 percent--surging from 2,059,500 to 3,858,800. The five counties are Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell. That 87-percent forecast shouldn’t seem a shock. In 2014, we rated True a claim that the population of Austin alone had basically doubled every 25 years since its founding. Notably too, the report projects the greater Austin area will grow considerably more than what Thomaides said. As the report headed to print, Diffley told us by email, the firm acted on fresh U.S Census Bureau figures by reaching a new, slightly lower projected 2046 population for the Austin region of 3,780,000 residents, which it lately predicts would be up 83 percent from a new estimate of the region’s 2016 population, 2,064,000. Austin-Round Rock predicted to grow faster than every region? We kept our sights on the report behind Thomaides's claim. That report, we noticed, indicates the Austin area's population increasing far faster than other regions nationally--though not all other regions. Among big Texas metro areas, the report chart suggests the San Antonio area will grow 53 percent, from 2,431,700 residents to 3,727,100 people. Other big Texas metros and their projected 30-year growth rates: Dallas-Fort Worth, 57 percent; Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, 56 percent; McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, 59.8 percent; and El Paso, 30 percent. Nationally, the chart indicates, only three less-populous Florida metros will grow at a greater clip than the Austin area. Per the chart, The Villages will see 96.5 percent population growth, reaching 245,400 residents; Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island will see 88 percent population growth, reaching 694,300 residents; and Cape Coral-Fort Myers will experience 84 percent growth, becoming home to 1,339,000 people. We further inquired how the firm reached its regional projections. By phone, Karl Kuykendall, an IHS Markit regional economist, said that the company maintains econometric models for states and metro area that take into account historical growth including births, deaths and domestic migration--also factoring in economic determinants such as jobs and income changes. Kuykendall, noting the Austin region’s population about doubled from 1990 to 2010 in going from 856,000 to more than 1.7 million, said: "Austin has been one of the fastest-growing areas over the last two to three decades." And, he said, as long as key drivers drawing people to the region "don’t fundamentally change, you can have a lot of confidence" in its 2046 projections. He cited as factors the region’s "highly educated" workforce, attractive cultural amenities and its reputation as a hotbed for technology start-ups and expansions. Geographically too, Kuykendall said, "there’s still a lot of room for growth." Alternate growth scenarios We queried a pair of Austin experts on growth for takes on the IHS Markit projections. By email, Beverly Kerr of the Austin Chamber of Commerce called IHS Markit a solid source. "I don’t think the projection that Austin will be at 3,858,800 by 2046 is too out there," Kerr said. Kerr otherwise noted that Ryan Robinson, the City of Austin demographer, has separately projected the Austin-Round Rock area having a 2045 population of more than 4.3 million, more than doubling an estimated 2 million residents in 2016, a forecast Robinson reaffirmed to our emailed inquiry. Kerr wrote that Robinson assumes the region’s rate of growth decreasing over time, which she said offers "a reasonable middle ground between the aggressive and conservative versions of the state projections." Kerr otherwise pointed out that the state demographer, Lloyd Potter, has said that assuming migration continues at the pace set in 2000-2010, the Austin-Round Rock metro area would be home to 4,651,780 people in 2046--for more than a doubling in residents. If that’s too aggressive an assumption, Kerr noted, the Potter-led Texas Demographic Center also provides a forecast of 3,081,305 residents in 2046, assuming a migration rate half the 2000-2010 rate. That would still be a 60 percent bump from this more conservative scenario’s estimate of 1,930,408 people living in the region in 2016. We also asked the census bureau about forecasts of regional population changes. By email, spokeswoman Virginia Hyer said the agency doesn’t produce metro-level population projections. Our ruling Thomaides said the Austin metro region "will lead" the nation "with population growth over 50%" over the next 30 years. That "over 50%" is actually an understatement, based on what experts including the Texas state demographer predict. And while the report behind the mayor’s claim showed Austin No. 1 in projected growth among similar-sized metro areas, less populous metro areas in Florida were projected to grow at even faster clips. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-02268	Says U.S. Reps. Phil Gingrey and Jack Kingston have "even changed votes to what I voted, multiple times."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/09/paul-broun/broun-says-campaign-rivals-following-his-lead/	To hear one Georgia congressman tell it, he’s the pied piper of some of his colleagues in the U.S. House. "It’s become a joke in Congress how Dr. (Phil) Gingrey and Mr. (Jack) Kingston have been following my votes," U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, R-Athens, told The Daily Beast, a news and lifestyle website. "They’ve even changed votes to what I voted, multiple times. Members of Congress are laughing about it." Broun, Gingrey and Kingston, veteran Georgia Republicans serving in the House, are vying for the same seat in the U.S. Senate this year, along with several other candidates. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out if Broun is correct or not about Gingrey and Kingston following his lead. All three have attempted to claim title as the most conservative candidate in the crowded GOP field. They have voted the same way all but a handful of times since 2013. Broun, though, has been the most vocal of the three men against some GOP initiatives, usually arguing they are not conservative enough. Since 2013, Broun is the only Republican House member from Georgia who has voted with his party less than 95 percent of the time, according to the website Open Congress. Broun has voted along party lines 87 percent of the time. Gingrey and Kingston have both voted along party lines at a 95 percent clip. Broun directed us to a handful of votes among the more than 700 votes taken by the House since the beginning of 2013 to make his case. Through spokesmen, both Gingrey and Kingston said Broun’s claims were absurd. But this fact-check really got interesting when we interviewed another member of Congress who told us a story about a recent vote concerning Broun and Kingston. On March 6, the House was preparing to vote on an aid package for Ukraine when Broun told his seatmate, U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., about his plan to play cloak and dagger in the U.S. Capitol. "I’m voting no on this, but I’m going to wait until the end to see if (Gingrey and Kingston) change their votes once I vote," Massie said, quoting Broun. Gingrey and Kingston voted in favor of the legislation early during the voting period, Massie recalled. With one minute left, Broun followed through with his vote against the bill. As time expired, Massie said he looked up at the electronic board tracking how each member voted and noticed that Kingston voted against the legislation, House Resolution 4152. "Hey, look at the board!" Massie said. "I told you so," Broun replied. Massie said he decided to share his story about the March 6 vote with PolitiFact Georgia after Gingrey and Kingston said that Broun was wrong in his assertion. "To say Paul Broun is misleading would be false," Massie told us. Broun and Kingston did vote no, records show. Gingrey voted in favor of the legislation that day. Video is not allowed of the electronic board that records the votes, so there is no way to see if Kingston first voted in favor of the legislation. Video of the vote tally is permitted, and it shows the Republican vote count changed as the time expired from 195 in favor of the bill and 21 against it to 194 to 22. One more no vote was added to the Republican total after time expired. Massie said Broun’s prediction makes a strong argument about Kingston’s motives. "I cannot tell you why (Kingston) changed his vote, but I can tell you he changed it after Paul Broun voted and Paul Broun predicted it would happen," Massie said. Kingston campaign spokesman Chris Crawford said Massie may have been looking at the vote change of another congressman. "I don’t ever recall him voting for it," Crawford said of Kingston. "I think Congressman Massie is mistaken. Perhaps he mistook something but Jack never voted for that bill." Former Georgia congressman George "Buddy" Darden said some members will change their votes during the 15 minutes they have to vote on legislation. Sometimes, he said, they’ve voted on the wrong legislation. Sometimes, they’re unsure which way they want to vote. Sometimes, they’ll change their vote if an extra vote or two is needed for a bill to pass. Darden, a Democrat, stressed that a member’s vote is not official until it is recorded in the Congressional Record. So did Kingston switch his vote on HR 4152 and did he do it because Broun voted no? "The only person who knows for sure is Jack Kingston," said Darden, senior counsel at the law firm McKenna, Long & Aldridge. About four weeks later, on April 1, the House took another vote on the Ukraine legislation. Records show Broun again voted no, Gingrey again voted yes but Kingston did not vote. Kingston, though, did not vote on other legislation that came before the House afterward, records show. The Broun campaign also directed us to news coverage to support his argument. The first was an article on the popular Washington, D.C., news site, Politico. It was written in March 2013, before Kingston announced he was running for the U.S. Senate. The article was about Broun "yanking much of the congressional delegation to the right and throwing their votes and the support of leadership into a daily flux." The Politico article reported that Kingston admitted that Broun’s rightward leanings were changing his voting pattern. Crawford, the Kingston spokesman, noted that the article "doesn't provide a quote from Mr. Kingston but the impression of the reporter." Politico reported in that article, Broun voted against a procedural motion concerning legislation to keep the government running. The article reported that the "dominoes then began to fall. Kingston and Gingrey ended up voting against both the procedural motion and the resolution itself." Broun’s case against Gingrey focused on news coverage such as the Politico story and a 2013 vote on raising the federal debt ceiling. Broun’s campaign shared a couple of tweets from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Washington bureau account that suggest Gingrey flip-flopped on the debt ceiling vote in 2013 after Broun voiced his opposition to the plan. The first tweet, on Jan. 22, 2013, showed that Gingrey was prepared to vote yes while Broun was the only Georgia lawmaker in the tweet who was planning to vote no. The second tweet, posted on Jan. 23, 2013, showed Broun and Gingrey voted against raising the debt ceiling. Gingrey spokesman Cameron Harley said the congressman’s votes were not being manipulated by Broun’s votes. "The votes Congressman Gingrey takes on the House floor have always been driven by the conservative Georgia values embodied by his constituency and to suggest that they are driven by Congressman Broun is simply false," Harley said. "There are myriad occasions where their votes have differed, including votes on policy critical to protecting Americans from Obamacare's most egregious provisions while Republicans work toward a full repeal. Furthermore, Congressman Gingrey has voted countless times not to raise the debt ceiling -- a hard stance he took long before announcing his candidacy for U.S. Senate. The will of his constituency has always been, and will always be, the only bellwether for his judgement as a public servant." To sum up, Broun said in the article that fellow congressmen Gingrey and Kingston have "even changed votes to what I voted, multiple times." Broun’s case against Gingrey is a matter of perception. In Kingston’s case, it boils down to who do you believe? Broun, Massie or Kingston? It’s a case of "he said, he said." In general, the three candidates have voted the same way all but a handful of times since 2013. Broun needed more examples to prove this has happened multiple times. He may be correct about what happened concerning Kingston and the Ukraine vote, but there’s no way to know for sure. And if Kingston and Gingrey changed votes, there’s no way to know whether they did it because of Broun. Thus, his evidence is thin. Therefore, we rate Broun’s claim Mostly False. Under PolitiFact’s rating system, Mostly False means the claim contains some element of truth, but doesn’t tell the whole story.

pomt-08606	Washington politicians "run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/23/ron-johnson/senate-candidate-ron-johnson-likens-social-securit/	It’s not often that a key platform of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal is compared to Bernie Madoff’s $65 billion Ponzi scheme. But 2010 is anything but a typical election year. Like numerous Republicans, U.S. Senate candidate Ron Johnson has been likening Social Security -- created 75 years ago to provide retirees with a steady income -- to a Ponzi scheme. It’s an eye-catching comparison that has been made by Senate candidates Rand Paul in Kentucky and Sharon Angle in Nevada, among others. Where does Johnson fit in? In a move to head off criticism from his opponent, Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, Johnson put his Ponzi comparison at the center of TV and radio ads that began running Sept. 15, 2010. "I'm going to tell you what Senator Feingold and his allies' next attack against me will be," Johnson says in the radio ad. "They're going to tell you I said Washington politicians have run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme. Johnson goes on to say: "I did say that, and it's true. During his 18 years in the Senate, Russ Feingold and politicians from both parties have raided $2 trillion from the Social Security trust fund. They spent your savings. The money is gone. And what did we get? Bigger government, wasteful spending and an IOU." The television ad is similar, with Johnson instead saying "Washington treats Social Security like a Ponzi scheme." A $2 trillion Ponzi scheme? Now that would be a big-time crime, especially since Social Security affects virtually every American. Indeed, at that size, even Madoff would be green with envy. Let’s start with what the phrase "Ponzi scheme" means. The scheme was named after Charles Ponzi, the Boston con man who in 1920 bilked investors out of about $10 million by promising returns of up to 100% in just 45 days. Ponzi invested little of the cash. Instead, he used it to finance his lavish lifestyle. He kept the scheme afloat by using new money to pay off older investors Think robbing Peter to pay Paul. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission offers a simple definition: "A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that involves the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors." On one level, that sounds like Social Security, which uses taxes on today’s wage earners to fund the retirement checks of millions of Americans. But remember: The SEC also notes that a Ponzi is an "investment fraud." Let’s look deeper, at how Johnson applies the characterization to the Social Security system. Is he going beyond superficial similarities? Here’s what Johnson said at a July 26, 2010 luncheon sponsored by Wispolitics.com, when he was asked about the Ponzi comparison. "What is the most famous Ponzi scheme we most recently heard of?" Johnson asked. Audience members responded Madoff. Johnson went on to say: "What did Bernie Madoff do? .... He took money in from investors. He paid some of the older investors off and he spent the rest of the money. The money was spent, it’s gone." In the next breath he moved on to Social Security and said: "You just tell me how that’s different from a Ponzi scheme." So, Johnson takes it beyond simply saying Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system. He’s invoking Madoff’s name to make his point. Johnson’s campaign manager, Juston Johnson, said neither he nor his boss is "saying the Social Security Administration is a fraud" -- pointing out the candidate wants to fix the system. Asked why the candidate used Madoff’s name, if it wasn’t meant to imply criminal wrongdoing, the spokesman declined to answer. The issue, according to Juston Johnson, is the more than $2 trillion the Senate candidate says was raided from the Social Security Trust Fund. While the Social Security Administration objects to politicians saying the trust fund was raided, spokeswoman Dorothy Clark said in an e-mail that "The Social Security Trust Funds currently holds over $2.5 trillion in interest bearing Treasury securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government." In other words, a giant IOU. The IOU part echoes what Johnson said, but the candidate misses a huge point -- and one that undermines his own statement. A Ponzi scheme is based on a lie. There is a promise that participants will get their money back plus a whole lot more. But the bulk of the money isn’t invested -- it’s generally blown by the swindler. The IOU to the fund, on the other hand, is backed by the full credit and faith of the U.S. government. It must be repaid, with interest -- though doing so may cause the government to borrow even more. Eugene Steuerle, a Social Security expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan economic and social policy research think tank, said the $2 trillion in debt came about because the Social Security system used to run a surplus -- which helped encourage bigger spending by the rest of the government. Said Steuerle: "To the extent that the candidate is arguing (that Social Security) is run like a Ponzi scheme, in the sense that there’s really no significant savings in the system, that’s right." To combat the Ponzi comparisons, the Social Security Administration created a web page in 2009 that looked at Ponzi’s scheme and its own operation. The site acknowledges "a superficial analogy" between a Ponzi scheme and pay-as-you-go programs such as Social Security. But, it argues the "structure, logic, and mode of operation (of Social Security has) nothing in common with Ponzi schemes or chain letters or pyramid schemes." The agency’s conclusion: "The American Social Security system has been in continuous successful operation since 1935. Charles Ponzi's scheme lasted barely 200 days." We figured there were two people who could truly sort out the comparison. Unfortunately, Ponzi died in 1949. And the Federal Bureau of Prisons does not expect the 72-year-old Madoff to be available for public appearances until Nov. 14, 2039. So, we went to the next best person -- Mitchell Zuckoff, who, in 2005, wrote the book "Ponzi's Scheme: The True Story of a Financial Legend." He doesn’t buy the comparison. "The important difference and the fundamental difference is that there is no secret to how Social Security is run," said Zuckoff, who researched the question for a 2009 article in Fortune Magazine. "No one is being misled, no one is taking the money and running, which are fundamental aspects of a true Ponzi schemes." Comparing the two "is a common, and I think deeply misleading suggestion, that is openly used more as scare tactic than to truly illuminate the real issues," Zuckoff said in an interview. In his Fortune piece, Zuckoff wrote: "Social Security is morally the polar opposite of a Ponzi scheme and fundamentally different from what Madoff ... did." So, let’s come back to Johnson’s original statement. The candidate says politicians "run Social Security like a Ponzi scheme." On a superficial level, that is true -- money is taken in from current workers (new participants) and used to pay off obligations to retirees (old participants). The operative word is "superficial." Unlike a Ponzi, Social Security is obligated to pay benefits, a commitment the shysters who run Ponzi schemes do not share. As for those IOUs, the government is required to make good on the money borrowed from the fund -- and to pay it back with interest. What’s more, participants are aware of how the system is operating. It’s all public. In a Ponzi, investors have no clue where their money is going and are told lies by the promoters. We rate Johnson’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14357	Says there are no political prisoners in Cuba.	false	/global-news/statements/2016/mar/22/raul-castro/are-there-political-prisoners-cuba/	Cuba President Raúl Castro criticized the United States’ human rights record — and defended his own — in a joint press conference with President Barack Obama in Havana. At the first official meeting between leaders of the two countries in 50 years, Castro dinged the United States on the lack of universal access to health care, free education and equal pay before he fended off a CNN reporter’s question about political prisoners on the island. "President Castro, my father is Cuban. He left for the United States when he was young. Do you see a new and democratic direction for your country? And why (do) you have Cuban political prisoners? And why don’t you release them?" asked CNN’s Jim Acosta. (He then asked if Castro prefers Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.) "Give me a list of the political prisoners and I will release them immediately," Castro said, according to the White House translation of his remarks. "Just mention a list. What political prisoners? Give me a name or names. After this meeting is over, you can give me a list of political prisoners. And if we have those political prisoners, they will be released before tonight ends." A Miami Herald translation put his response in slightly different words, though Castro’s message is not in dispute: "Give me the list now of political prisoners to release. If there are political prisoners, they’ll be free before nightfall." We thought we’d oblige. The task is complicated, given that human rights groups and dissidents themselves disagree on the definition of a political prisoner and just how many there are. But the notion that Cuba doesn’t have any at all — a notion that the regime has stuck by for decades — is doubtful. A common understanding of the term is people imprisoned for exercising their beliefs peacefully. "If you ask any autocrat in the world, they’re going to say the same thing. If you ask Maduro in Venezuela, if you ask Mugabe in Zimbabwe, Lukashenko in Belarus, Putin in Russia, they’ll all say nobody is in jail for political reasons," said Carlos Ponce, director of Latin America programs at the watchdog group Freedom House. Making a list, checking it thrice A few hours before Obama landed on the island on March 20, Cuban authorities arrested more than 50 Damas de Blanco (or Ladies in White) dissidents who were demanding increased human rights. This round of crackdowns was actually part of a weekly ritual — arrest, release and repeat — and part of the reason why tallying the exact number of political prisoners is so difficult. We compiled counts from several human rights and activist groups, as well as one vetted by Spanish-language network Univision. All together, the groups list 97 current political prisoners, 54 of whom appear on more than one list. On the low end, the human rights group Cuban Democratic Directorate counts 17, Univision named 19. Liudmila Cedeño, an activist with Unión Patriótica de Cuba, the country’s largest opposition group, told PolitiFact that 22 of its members are imprisoned. On the high end, the exile group Cuban American National Foundation lists 47 and the Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba 51. International human rights groups have murkier tallies. Human Rights Watch pins the number at "dozens," citing Cuba-based human rights groups. Amnesty International, meanwhile, recognized seven "prisoners of conscience" who were released in 2015, but none today. (More on this later.) Some experts contend that the lists are bogus, as some include people who would not normally be considered political prisoners. In 2010, for example, the Associated Press vetted a list of 167 political prisoners by Elizardo Sanchez, the head of the independent Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation. About 50 people on the list "were convicted of terrorism, hijacking or other violent crimes, and four are former military or intelligence agents convicted of espionage or revealing state secrets," according to the AP. Even for those who are traditionally recognized as political prisoners, Cuba rejects the term, Salim Lamrani, a Cuba expert at the University of Paris, told PolitiFact. "Cuba’s point of view is the following: People condemned to jail sentences were not imprisoned because they expressed ideas against the authorities but because they accepted money from the U.S. government," he said, adding that he agrees with Castro that Cuba has no political prisoners. Nonetheless, in 2015, Cuba released 53 people the United States named as political prisoners as part of the deal to normalize trade relations, even though the regime had denied their existence for decades, said Ponce of Freedom House. Out of the 97 people in our aggregate tally, here are examples of a few who are most in line with the traditional definition of political prisoner: • Yoelkis Rosabal Flores: A member of the Unión Patriótica de Cuba, he was arrested in May 2014 for staging a protest calling for the release of a fellow UNPACU member. Flores was charged with public disorder and sentenced to four years in jail. • Mario Ronaide Figueroa Dieguez: A member of the Unión Patriótica de Cuba, he was arrested in 2012 for staging a protest and told that he would be released if he left the union. Dieguez did but was rearrested in December 2014 (for reasons that aren’t clear) and sentenced to three years in jail. • Emilio Serrano Rodríguez: A member of the Unión Patriótica de Cuba, he was arrested in February 2015 for alleged "illegal commercial transactions" and currently waiting for a trial. According to the union, Rodríguez had participated in a protest. • Ricardo González Sendiña: A member of Frente de Acción Cívica Orlando Zapata Tamay and the son of Barbara Sendiña, a human rights activist with Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), Ricardo Sendiña was arrested in 2015 for an alleged crime of theft and slaughter of livestock. He was sentenced to six years. Ghosts of gulags past Gone are the days when people were explicitly jailed in Cuba for political opposition. The crackdown is manifesting in different ways on the island today. "Nobody has a clue what is inside the jail system. It’s not clear," Ponce said. Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of Human Rights Watch’s Americas division, noted the regime also cracks down on opposition preemptively by "blocking access to the websites of independent journalists, threatening and detaining people to prevent them from participating in peaceful protests and political meetings, and using an Orwellian law to imprison critics for ‘pre-criminal dangerousness.’ " Ponce and Marselha Gonçalves Margerin, Amnesty International’s advocacy director for the Americas, emphasized that the penal code discourages political opposition indirectly by criminalizing contempt of public officials, public disorder and resistance to officials. Margerin told PolitiFact that just because Amnesty doesn’t list prisoners of conscience in Cuba currently doesn’t mean they don’t exist. The practice is rare as the burden of proof is high and often impossible to meet in a country that Amnesty hasn’t been able to access since 1990, she said. Take Amnesty’s last recognized prisoner of conscience. Danilo Maldonado, a 32-year-old graffiti artist known as "El Sexto," was arrested in early 2015 after painting "Fidel" and "Raul" on two pigs. Amnesty declared him a prisoner of conscience because his court records showed that the nonviolent artists was imprisoned "for the sole reason of his beliefs," said Margerin. For months, Maldonado was detained without any charges against him and released in October 2015. This practice of arbitrary arrests and temporary or short-term detention has become the new way of stifling dissent on the island. "How can you dispute a detention if there are no charges or if the person disappeared for a short period of time?" asked Margerin. The independent Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation reported about 8,600 politically motivated detentions in 2015 and 2,500 from the beginning of the year to March 4, 2016. Why are authorities more prone to short-term crackdowns than long-term imprisonment? For one, it’s cheaper and it’s easier, said Ponce of Freedom House. For another, more and more people are willing to demonstrate. "Every Sunday, they take all the (Damas de Blanco) and all the other groups protesting. They arrest them and keep them for 48 hours and then release them. Then they do it again next Sunday," Ponce said, adding that this is the case for a lot of prominent activists like El Sexto. Activists and experts are cautiously optimistic that Obama’s visit could loosen things up, at least for a couple of days on the island. "(Castro) would be re-enacting a ritual we’ve seen for decades when foreign leaders visit Cuba: A few jail cell doors swing open, but neither the laws nor the system changes," said Vivanco. "Unless the government makes meaningful reforms, the regime can always resume jailing people for their speech and political activity once the visitor is wheels-up." Our ruling Castro said there are no political prisoners in Cuba. Numerous activists and human rights groups beg to differ. While it is impossible to get an exact count, given the opaqueness of Cuba’s criminal justice system and the variations in definitions, there are at least a handful of political prisoners in the country. Castro is really downplaying his regime’s weekly crackdowns on demonstrators who want free expression. We rate Castro’s claim False.

pomt-05086	"Before Act 10, the total cost of public sector employees’ employment was 29 percent higher than that in the private sector. After the act, it’s still 22 percent higher."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/02/ron-johnson/us-sen-ron-johnson-says-public-private-pay-gap-aft/	On the morning after Gov. Scott Walker rolled to victory in the recall election, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) made it clear the battle over public employee pay and benefits is far from over. Appearing on Charlie Sykes’ talk show on WTMJ-AM (620), Johnson cited Walker’s move to curb collective bargaining and make public employees pay more for pensions and health care. He said the measure, known as Act 10, only had a slight impact on the disparities between public and private sector workers in Wisconsin. And Johnson cited a new study to prove his point. Johnson said that even after the changes, "the pension benefits for public sector employees is still four and a half times richer than the private sector, and the health benefits are two times richer than the private sector." He continued: "Before Act 10, the total cost of public sector employees’ employment was 29 percent higher than that in the private sector. After the act, it’s still 22 percent higher." Johnson added this footnote: "I do want to point out … about those statistics that I just spouted in case people want to punch holes in them. That was just a study by Heritage and AEI working together and that does factor in equal educational experience and equal types of job classifications. So this isn’t just because public sector employees are higher educated or have more important jobs. This equalizes that and it’s still 22 percent higher cost." That comparison caught our attention, since no one had highlighted it during the recall itself. We started with the report, since Johnson cited it directly as his source. The report was completed by Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute and Jason Richwine of the Heritage Foundation. The researchers at the conservative think tanks have done numerous studies on public-private pay -- both at the state and federal level -- that show public employees come out ahead in compensation. The paper focused on Wisconsin was issued May 30, 2012, less than a week before the June 5, 2012 recall election. When we asked several experts on public employment compensation for their take on the paper, we ran into a familiar debate between competing political agendas. Indeed, the foes know each other so well, it’s a little like the "Spy vs Spy" comic in Mad magazine. Each time either side issues a report, researchers from the other side try to punch holes in it. Here’s how the debate plays out on this one. The report used a bad comparison: Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, noted the report compares state workers’ compensation to pay and benefits at private sector firms with far fewer workers. He said a state is more properly compared to the state’s largest firms. Such companies, he noted, generally pay better. The comparison is fine: Biggs, one of the authors of the paper, said the size of the companies didn’t skew the results. "We could choose the largest establishment size" -- firms with more than 500 workers "and, so long as you value the pensions right, public employees would still have a large advantage." The report used a bad assumption: Brainard and Jeffrey Keefe, a professor at the Rutgers University School of Management and Labor Relations, argue private sector benefits are understated in the report. Specifically, they say the report uses today’s low interest rates to calculate the value of private sector workers’ 401(k), which magnifies the public-private gap. They argue that the rate of return, 3.67 percent, is based on low-risk U.S. Treasury securities and is less than half of what such funds have historically earned over the long-term through investments in stocks, bonds and so forth. Said Brainard: "The net result is to produce a substantial difference between the current private sector annuity values." The report’s assumptions are valid: Biggs and Richwine said they are trying to treat public and private pensions equally. Using something other than Treasury securities would produce a retirement benefit with far greater risk than found in the public employee retirement system. Said Biggs: "Our approach is consistent with economic theory, with how liabilities are priced in private financial markets, and with the findings of non-partisan government agencies like the Confirmation Budget Office, the Federal Reserve, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (which constructs the National Income and Product Accounts, which are the official 'books' of the US economy)." Keefe said it was impossible to replicate the research using the formula contained in the Biggs-Richwine report. Keefe did his own earlier analysis of Wisconsin public-private pay using data from the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. That report, issued in February 2011 as Act 10 was unveiled, found Wisconsin public employees earn 4.8 percent less in total compensation per hour than comparable full-time employees in Wisconsin’s private sector. That’s compared to the Biggs-Richwine study which put the pre-Act 10 gap at 29 percent. Why did Johnson chose to highlight the study he did? In an emailed statement, Johnson said the study "is a product of two highly respected institutions. That said, I don’t endorse the findings of any specific study, or validate their findings." He added: "No one wants to underpay government workers, but with mounting deficits and debt, we can’t afford to overpay them either. We need to make sure that government sector salaries are benchmarked against those of the private sector. I welcome studies like this one, which help us understand how to set those benchmarks." Our rating Johnson argued the changes included in Act 10 were modest -- public employees still receive 22 percent higher wages and benefits than private sector workers. Johnson cited the work of two researchers for conservative think tanks, but later told us he "doesn’t endorse" the findings of that study, or "any specific study." That underlines what we found: There are different ways to measure the same thing. Indeed, an academic came up with a far different pre-Act 10 starting point when he did his own study in 2011. There certainly appears to be an element of truth in the study, but it’s not as definitive as Johnson presented it on the radio. And credible independent researchers have raised valid questions about the conclusion. We rate Johnson’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-11660	Democratic lawmakers who voted in favor of short-term spending bills "just voted to deport Dreamers."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/09/credo-action/did-democrats-vote-deport-dreamers/	A progressive advocacy group claims Democratic lawmakers have voted to deport so-called "Dreamers," young immigrants in the country illegally. "Democrats who just voted to deport Dreamers. Share to shame Democrats who are enabling Trump’s racism," said an image tweeted Dec. 21 by Credo Mobile, listing the names of 14 Democratic representatives, 17 Democratic senators and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The accusation is jarring after years of congressional Democrats pushing for legislation granting certain immigrants a chance to stay in the United States legally and have a pathway to U.S. citizenship. Contrary to their rhetoric, did dozens actually vote to kick them out of the country? Credo’s tweet came after members of the U.S. House and Senate, including Democrats, voted to continue funding the government short-term, until Jan. 19. The final bill that President Donald Trump signed into public law contained no reference to deportations or Dreamers. But immigrant advocates had urged Democrats to vote against the spending bills if they did not include a legislative solution for Dreamers who are at risk of deportation. Credo’s rationale is voting for a bill that doesn’t benefit Dreamers amounts to voting to deport them. That’s a mischaracterization of the actual content of the bill. DACA program and Congress’ December vote The Trump administration in September rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program created during the Obama administration to prevent the deportation of immigrants in the country illegally who came to the United States as children. This group is often referred to as Dreamers. The government has granted DACA to about 800,000 people, and around 690,000 are currently protected. Despite rescinding DACA, Trump’s administration allowed DACA beneficiaries with permits expiring by March 5, 2018, (about 154,000 people) to apply for renewal in the fall. The vast majority of the 154,000 recipients were granted renewals or have an application pending, but about 21,000 don’t have a renewal pending, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Immigrants who chose not to submit renewal applications may be at risk of deportation based on that decision. (DHS acting spokesman Tyler Q. Houlton tweeted that not all DACA recipients choose to renew, so it does not necessarily mean that immigration officials denied the requests.) DACA recipients with permits expiring after March 5 are set to lose their deportation relief if Congress does not pass a bill to help them out. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., as well as other Democratic senators seeking re-election in 2018, support Dreamers but were not ready to shut down the government in December over the issue. "I will exercise every bit of leverage I can for the Dream Act, but if there is a vote that would lead to a shutdown, that’s where I draw the line," Kaine told the Washington Post. On Dec. 21, lawmakers in the House and Senate approved short-term spending bills in order to prevent a government shutdown. The bill Trump signed into law did not have any provisions related to Dreamers, either to protect or deport them. Since Democrats didn’t force passage of the Dream Act, a bill to benefit Dreamers, some immigrants protected by DACA will be subject to deportation, Credo campaign manager Nicole Regalado told PolitiFact. "We believe it is more than reasonable to assert that any Democrat who voted for December’s CR without any protections for DACA recipients voted to help Trump deport immigrant young people whose DACA status will expire in the coming weeks," Regalado said. However, it’s uncertain that lawmakers could have passed the Dream Act. Trump has said he expects "massive border security" in exchange for a solution for Dreamers, and Democrats have voiced strong opposition to his border wall, among other measures. The Trump administration has emphasized that any immigrant in the country illegally is subject to deportation, though Kirstjen Nielsen, in November during her Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Homeland Security, said DACA recipients whose protection expired would not be an enforcement priority. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the conversation would continue "because it is an emergency." "They kicked the can for the omnibus into January. It’s this year, extended, that’s what it is. It’s the process," Pelosi told reporters, The Hill reported. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., a prominent immigrant advocate, tweeted that Democrats would continue fighting for Dreamers in 2018. His tweet came after confronting Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ahead of the vote, according to the Washington Post. "This fight continues in January & I think Dems are on same page now. Good of the country must outweigh any political calculations, therefore we'll be moving forward on #DreamAct under leadership of @RepLujanGrisham @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer & allies in House & Senate," Gutierrez tweeted Dec. 21. Our ruling Credo tweeted that Democratic lawmakers who voted in favor of short-term spending bills in December "just voted to deport Dreamers." Lawmakers voted to continue funding the government until Jan. 19, but there was no language in the legislation to deport Dreamers. Credo contends that voting for a bill that does not include protection for Dreamers is essentially a vote to deport them. That’s an interpretation of the vote, but not an accurate representation of the content of the bill that was voted on. We rate the statement False.

pomt-14543	Says "Joseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down you, have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/14/ben-carson/ben-carson-flubs-stalin-quote-about-bringing-down-/	Ben Carson invoked one of America’s most notorious foes in his closing statement at the Feb. 13 Republican presidential debate in South Carolina. "I, like you, am a member of ‘we, the people,’ " Carson said, addressing the audience. "And we know that our country is heading off the cliff. Joseph Stalin said, ‘If you want to bring America down, you have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality.’ We, the people, can stop that decline." The problem is that in all likelihood, this is not a real quote from the former Soviet leader. Stalin led the communist nation from the 1920s until his death in 1953, and it is believed that millions died during his regime. Searches for the quote do not turn up in any history books, scholarly works or primary sources. Mostly it’s just social media sharables with the quote text next to a picture of Stalin. Our friends over at Snopes looked into a similar quote and concluded that it’s "highly unlikely that Stalin ever spoke these words." It seems dubious that Stalin would say something like this, as the quote, in a sense, compliments America for its strengths, Snopes noted. We searched through an online Stalin Archive and an online library compiled by the University of Pennsylvania. Our searches came up empty. It’s unclear where this quote originated. The earliest use of the quote Snopes found was in a 1983 letter to the editor in a Kansas newspaper. It’s possible that Stalin said this quote in a speech or in a letter that was never translated into English or never put on the Internet. But the burden is on Carson to back up his words with evidence. If new evidence pops up to the contrary, we’ll revisit this article. We reached out to Carson’s campaign but haven’t heard back. Our ruling Carson quoted Stalin as saying, "If you want to bring America down, you have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality." All signs point to this being a fake quote that has made its way around the Internet. We rate Carson’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-12855	Says Mike Pence said that "allowing rape victims to have abortions will lead to women trying to get raped."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/02/blog-posting/mike-pence-did-not-say-women-would-seek-out-sexual/	An old story that keys off Vice President Mike Pence’s opposition to abortion has raised hackles on the Internet, but almost all of its contents are fabricated. "Mike Pence: ‘Allowing Rape Victims To Have Abortions Will Lead To Women Trying To Get Raped’," reads the headline on a July 17, 2016, story on Politicot.com. The story has been reblogged by several other sites, and has regained popularity on Facebook following Pence’s address at the Jan. 27 March For Life in Washington. It was flagged by Facebook as part of the social media giant’s attempts to stamp out fake news on its site. The post opens by saying Pence, who was governor of Indiana at the time, had signed a restrictive abortion bill. It then goes on to quote Pence as saying the bill didn’t have an exception for victims of rape because "we’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion." To be clear, Pence never said these things. The story originated on a family of websites known for creating stories based on real events, but with made-up details in what it describes as an attempt to be funny. Politicot.com is part of the Newslo network of sites, which we’ve written about before, including one fake story about Pence calling Michelle Obama "the most vulgar first lady we’ve ever had." We rated that Pants On Fire! The site describes itself as a "hybrid News/Satire platform" that focuses on "entertainment." The only indication that the stories might be fake is a "Show Facts" button that highlight what is true, leaving the reader to surmise that the rest of the story is contrived. In this case, what Politicot.com deems as "facts" is limited to the opening paragraph, which noted Pence had "recently" signed a bill restricting abortions. Pence did sign an abortion bill in March 2016 that prevented women from getting an abortion due to the race, gender, or disability of the fetus. Indiana already was one of the most restrictive states in the country for women seeking abortions. The Politicot.com story seems to have been timed to react to Pence being picked as Donald Trump’s running mate on July 15. The site did not respond to our request for clarification. We’ve acknowledged in the past that Politicot.com’s related sites don’t do a good enough job of pointing out their stories are fake, and exacerbate problems by building contrived details upon real news events. This story is no different, and plenty of other sites posted it as truth.

pomt-10771	Clinton "refused repeated requests to meet with the Gold Star Mothers."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/20/chain-email/she-has-met-with-them-four-times/	This rumor started in 2001 after two officials from the Gold Star Mothers, two moms whose children were killed in combat, dropped by Clinton's new Senate office. They did not have an appointment and Clinton was not in the office. A story on the conservative Web site NewsMax reported that the women were unhappy with "the outright shabby treatment shown them by the former First Lady... She and her staff simply refused to meet with them." That claim was picked up in an e-mail that circulated in 2001 and has gotten new life since Clinton became a presidential candidate. The e-mail says that "None other than the Queen herself, Hillary Rotten Clinton ... refused repeated requests to meet with the Gold Star Mothers." Shirley Jones, the legislative chairman for the group in 2001 and one of the women who stopped by Clinton's office, says the e-mail is wrong. She said she sent Clinton a letter requesting a meeting and has since met with her four times. Clinton even sponsored a bill on behalf of the Gold Star Mothers. "As a mother she was very understanding," Jones says. "I felt she was very supportive — and I'm a Republican." The Gold Star Mothers Web site says the allegation in the e-mail is incorrect. "This story passed through several people before being reported by NewsMax on May 26, 2001 and the details were lost ... The NewsMax article did not get the story correct and we deeply regret the misunderstanding about Senator Hillary Clinton." So we give the e-mail a False.

pomt-08201	More than 10 years of free trade "has brought a $2 billion per day trade deficit."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/nov/22/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-cites-daily-deficit-figure-price/	Congress may have no greater trade-agreement foe than Sherrod Brown, the Democratic U.S. senator from Ohio. It’s not that he says selling cars, soap and widgets to foreign consumers is bad. It’s just that some foreign trading partners use their cheap labor and weak environmental and safety standards to sell cars, toys and widgets to Americans at prices that our domestic industries cannot match while, according to Brown, adopting policies that make it hard to sell America’s goods abroad. So Brown was not saddened when negotiations for a South Korean trade deal went sour in November. After all, he said in a news release, more than 10 years of free trade deals have "brought a $2 billion per day trade deficit and the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs -- jobs that should go to Ohio's skilled workers." PolitiFact and The Plain Dealer expended plenty of bytes and ink on the lost-jobs issue during the election season, so there is no need to wade back into it here. Let’s just say that a persuasive case can be made, although the underlying data on jobs is poor. This country can send a man to the moon but it cannot precisely quantify the number of jobs lost or gained to trade. But what about Brown’s other point -- that more than 10 years of trade under the North American Free Trade Agreement and trade relations with China has resulted in a trade deficit of $2 billion a day? Causation of that kind is in dispute, and some experts and data suggest this country’s reliance on oil plays a big role in the trade deficit, with OPEC countries selling $76.4 billion more to the United States than vice versa so far this year. But imbalances with China ($201 billion and counting so far this year) play a bigger role, government statistics show. We will not argue cause and effect here, nor will we tell you not to enjoy low-price consumer goods. We’re merely examining the numbers. They show that the negative balance of trade went from $70.3 billion in 1993, just before NAFTA, to $378.8 billion in 2000, as the United States accepted permanent normalized trade with China, to a record high of $759.2 billion in 2006, according to Commerce Department records. So what of Brown’s precise number, $2 billion a day? Brown is right -- kind of. Or he’s not right, sort of. This drives us nuts too, but as we dug into the subject, we realized that different groups use different measures to describe the size of the trade deficit. You’d think it would be as easy as comparing the value of goods and services exported from the United States with those imported from other countries. So let’s show you some numbers from the Commerce Department using that exact measure. Trade deficit for 2007: $702 billion. For 2008: $698.8 billion. For 2009: $374.9 billion. The recession’s effects were glaring, but even before then the trend was downward, albeit slightly. For January through September 2010, the most recent measurement available, the trade balance was a negative $379.1 billion. Assuming the monthly trends hold through December, this year’s annual trade deficit should reach $500 billion. Divide that by the days of the year and you’d have a daily trade deficit of $1.37 billion a day. That’s 32 percent lower than Brown’s claim of $2 billion a day. But since flush times will return eventually, imports and exports will presumably resume at robust levels, too. So if Brown was referring to the trade deficits that existed before the recession, his statement would be nearly accurate, because the deficit came to an average of $1.91 billion a day in 2008 and $1.92 billion a day in 2007. But it may not be that simple. Trade balances are affected not only by wages, tariffs and the demands of consumers, but also by events beyond the recession such as currency corrections and the value of the dollar. Considering recent currency corrections, annual trade deficits could stay in the range of $500 billion, said William Cline, a senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics. That would make Brown’s $2 billion-a-day figure somewhat high. "It’s a bit of an outdated figure," Cline said.. Yet there’s another way of viewing the data. Figures from the Commerce Department that we reviewed originated from the U.S. Census Bureau’s economic analysis unit (a bureau within a bureau at Commerce). The figures are the government’s official measure of the trade balance, used by the White House, cited in the news media and accepted broadly by economists. Yet the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC, which polices trade matters in the United States, maintains separate data that is used to review tariffs and trade practices. Depending on how one chooses to sort the data, a higher trade deficit can result. Brown’s office told us that his data came from the ITC. So we, too, turned to the ITC, and its staff helped guide us in using its online database. The ITC cautioned that the official figures come from Commerce, but various trade professionals use ITC data to drill down further for other purposes. We drilled. The result: A much higher trade deficit -- as high as $500.9 billion last year, in the depths of the recession, and $800 billion -- averaging $2.19 billion a day -- for 2008. How can one agency have such different figures from another? It’s easy. The ITC, concerned with tariffs, trade laws and trade policy, measures the value of goods -- cars, factory equipment, steel -- but not services. Services represent only a portion of the trade universe, yet they add a sweet spot to the equation. This country had a $132 billion trade surplus in services last year because it exported more in the way of travel, financial services, information services and so forth, than it brought in. Take away those services -- or just look at the ITC numbers -- and the trade balance becomes more bleak. It’s important to remember that when the White House and news reports mention the trade deficit, they are including services as well as goods and relying on the Commerce numbers. Even the ITC stressed this with us. But Brown aides as well as representatives of Public Citizen, a liberal public interest group, and its Global Trade Watch project, say the ITC data can be more relevant in certain circumstances. A state like Ohio exports relatively little in the way of services, for example, so the ITC’s focus on goods may be more pertinent for measuring trade’s impact in Ohio, said Todd Tucker, research director for Global Trade Watch, and Chris Slevin, a Brown aide who previously worked as Global Trade Watch’s deputy director. Even nationally, there is debate as to how much job-creating value can be found in export sectors like financial services and travel, Tucker said. Factories that make things employ a lot more people. Not to complicate this further, but ITC data can be sorted in yet another way, making the trade imbalance appear to be even worse. This occurs when some foreign-made goods are counted as "imports for consumption," an ITC category with an assumption at the port of entry that the goods will be consumed in the United States. The problem occurs, critics say, when these "imports" wind up being shipped back abroad after being stored here temporarily. That gives them a new category on the way out -- "re-exports" -- which is not the same as a simple export of a product made in the United States. So they were counted as imports on the way in, but not subtracted back out as regular exports on their way out. This kind of counting, which defenders say has merit in certain circumstances, results in a higher trade deficit than when every product shipped in is counted as an import, and every product shipped out is counted as an export. By using these other categories in the ITC database, we calculated a trade deficit of $612 billion last year and a stunning $920.6 billion in 2008. These are close to the numbers Brown’s office supplied to us initially, and they support his claim -- and then some. So which figure is right? It’s a matter of legitimate dispute. Global Trade Watch says the larger numbers are more revealing and pertinent in a number of cases, especially when comparing U.S. trade relations with individual countries rather than the entire universe of global trade. The National Association of Manufacturers says that’s nonsense. From "time immemorial," the Commerce/Census data have been used, measuring the total value of goods and services in and the total value of goods and services out, and that’s the only valid way to count a deficit or surplus, said Frank Vargo, the association’s vice president for international economic affairs. "Inside U.S. Trade," a publication for trade policy wonks and attorneys, discussed this at length in a Nov. 12 article. It said that "these different approaches result in widely different numbers when applied to both the global and bilateral deficits, and they have helped fuel and confuse a debate among stakeholders." Global Trade Watch is sticking to its guns, but so is the National Association of Manufacturers. So back to Brown’s $2-billion-a-day claim: Is it accurate? Brown, who has authored a book on what he calls the "myths of free trade," derives his figure from the ITC, and while the ITC cautioned us that the official balance-of-trade measure actually comes from Commerce, it is true that some authorities regard even the outlying ITC numbers as perfectly fine to use in certain circumstances. Yet even if we were to put those numbers aside and only use the Commerce Department numbers, Brown’s figures were close to the mark before the recession. This year is not the best year to measure the normal effects of trade, and no one can predict the future; perhaps the trade deficit will stabilize at a lower number such as $500 billion a year, or $1.36 billion a day. Perhaps it won’t. But based on the historical trends, regardless of which data source is used, we say Brown’s claim is Mostly True.

pomt-01442	"Hospitals have already begun layoffs, a direct result of Republican inaction" on Medicaid expansion.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2014/oct/06/democratic-party-virginia/va-democrats-say-hospital-layoffs-are-direct-resul/	The state Democratic Party is continuing to assail the Republican-controlled General Assembly’s refusal to expand Virginia’s Medicaid program. In a recent news release, the Democrats said "hospitals have already begun layoffs, a direct result of Republican inaction." We looked into the claim, made at the start of a special legislative session in mid-September at which Republicans refused to expand Medicaid eligibility to as many as 400,000 additional low-income and disabled Virginians. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act -- also called Obamacare -- Uncle Sam would pay the entire expansion cost for two years and never less than 90 percent in the future. GOP lawmakers, who control the House and Senate, said they don’t trust the federal government will pay its promised share. Democrats have strongly supported the expansion, arguing, in part, that it would ease losses hospitals suffer from treating indigent patients. We asked Morgan Finkelstein, spokeswoman for state Democratic Party, for proof of the party’s claim that hospital layoffs have begun as a "direct result" of the GOP’s opposition to expansion. She sent us a number of articles and announcements of hospital layoffs and closings in Virginia during the last few years. Here’s the list of layoffs at 13 Virginia hospitals: 50 at three Wellmont Health Systems hospitals in Southwest Virginia in June 2013 140 through the closure of Wellmont’s Lee Regional Medical Center in Southwest Virginia in October 2013 116 at Mountain States Health Alliance, which has hospitals in Tennessee and Southwest Virginia, in January 33 at Valley Health, mainly at Winchester Medical Center, in January 66 at Mary Washington Healthcare in Fredericksburg at the beginning of September The news releases and articles cite the rejection of Medicaid expansion as one reason for the layoffs. But it wasn’t the only reason. The hospitals -- mostly in rural areas -- also blamed declining patient populations and lower Medicare payments. The ACA reduces reimbursements to hospitals for treating Medicare patients -- mostly people 65 and older. Obamacare supporters originally thought hospitals would recoup most of the money through the expansion of Medicaid. But the equation changed in 2012 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could not be compelled to broaden their Medicaid programs. That left an opening that’s allowed Virginia and 22 other states to resist expansion. Several of the Virginia hospitals that had layoffs reported Medicare populations as high as 60 percent. So they’ve been disproportionately hurt by the lowered Medicare reimbursements while, at the same time, unable to tap into extra Medicaid money. For example, Mountain States Health Alliance told the Kingsport Times-News in Tennessee in January that Medicaid expansion would help the system recover $20 million of its expected loss of $30 million every year. Mary Washington Healthcare told The Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg that it’s expecting to lose $31 million in Medicare reimbursements and that the expansion of Medicaid would have compensated for $14 million of the loss. In a news release about closing Lee Regional Medical Center, Wellmont attributed the cause to "reimbursement cuts associated with the Affordable Care Act, extremely low community use of the hospital and a lack of consistent physician coverage." It should be noted that rural hospitals across the country were in financial trouble long before Obamacare became part of our lexicon, facing shrinking patient populations and under pressure to shorten hospital stays. The Office of the Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found in a 2003 report that 208 rural hospitals closed from 1990 to 2000. The report has not been updated. Eight of the 13 Virginia hospitals cited by the Democratic Party have operated in the red during every fiscal year since 2009, according to records from Virginia Health Information. Our ruling The Democratic Party of Virginia says that hospital layoffs have begun as a "direct result" of Republican legislators’ refusal to expand the state’s Medicaid program. The Democrats point to news releases from four hospital systems -- mostly in rural areas -- that have announced staff cuts since June 2013. The systems cited the state’s resistance to Medicaid expansion as one of several reasons for the layoffs. Of greater impact, however, was a reduction in Medicare reimbursements under Obamacare. Several hospital officials said the expansion of Medicaid would have allowed them to offset some -- but not nearly all -- of the loss. It also should be noted that most of the individual hospitals where the layoffs occurred had been in the red since at least since 2009 -- some of them all but losing their patient base. The GOP’s refusal to expand Medicaid came at a tough time for the hospital systems and certainly added to their woes. But saying the layoffs are the "direct result" of the Republicans’ action is an exaggerated claim that ignores deeper factors. The Democratic claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-05912	"Gov. Romney cut off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens who were on Medicaid to save $5 a day."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/01/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-mitt-romney-cut-jewish-nursing-/	Newt Gingrich, campaigning in Florida before the state’s GOP primary, accused Mitt Romney of preventing Jewish nursing home residents in Massachusetts from keeping kosher to save a few bucks. "Gov. Romney cut off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens who were on Medicaid to save $5 a day," Gingrich said in a speech in Tampa on Jan. 30, 2011. "For $5 a day, he said, no, you cannot follow your religious prescription." The next day, as Florida voters headed to the polls, robocalls made an even bolder claim. Gingrich’s campaign confirmed it sent the call statewide Tuesday, though the candidate denied he had heard it. "As governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney vetoed a bill paying for kosher food for our seniors in nursing homes," the robocall said, according to CNN. "Holocaust survivors, who for the first time, were forced to eat non-kosher, because Romney thought $5 was too much to pay for our grandparents to eat kosher." We wanted to know, did Romney "cut off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens who were Medicaid beneficiaries to save $5 a day"? Flashback to 2003 We asked Gingrich’s campaign for support for his claim. Spokesman Joe DeSantis pointed us to a New York Post article from Jan. 27, "Romney rapped for kosher cut." Romney's campaign declined to comment on the specifics of the claim. We dug deeper. Romney was a brand-new governor in 2003 facing a $3 billion budget gap. The year before he took office, a change in the state reimbursement formula for nursing homes removed extra funding for eight kosher homes, said Jeremy Burton, executive director for the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston. One nursing home, the Coolidge House Nursing Care Center in Brookline, Mass., decided in November 2002 that it would have to close its kosher kitchen, the Jewish Advocate of Boston reported. Instead, it would bring in kosher meals from outside — bringing food over from a sister nursing home, catering meals or offering prepacked dishes. Democratic lawmakers wanted to keep nursing homes’ kosher kitchens open. They asked for $600,000 in supplemental funding, an extra $5 a day per kosher diner. "We in the Legislature felt that a nursing home resident that was observant was entitled to that, even in tight fiscal times," said Rep. Ruth Balser, D-Newton, who helped work on the measure. "... People were definitely alarmed, and we took it very seriously." Romney used his line-item veto to scratch the funding, writing that "it unnecessarily requires an increased rate for nursing facilities," the Jewish Advocate reported. "I guess the governor at the time thought it was supplementary or an optional expense we couldn't afford," Balser told PolitiFact. "... "It was his intention to cut them off." But Democrats, who held a majority in the Massachusetts Legislature, "overrode it quickly," Balser said. Nursing homes got their funding. "It never came up again, that I'm aware of," Balser said. Neither Burton nor Balser could confirm that any Jewish nursing home residents lost access to kosher food, nor did we find any other information suggesting that kosher meals were ever eliminated for the nursing home residents. Our ruling Gingrich claimed that as governor of Massachusetts, "Romney cut off kosher meals for Jewish senior citizens who were on Medicaid to save $5 a day." It’s true that one Massachusetts nursing home said in 2002 that it would close its kosher kitchen. But that decision was made based on a state funding decision before Romney took office. And that nursing home still planned to offer kosher meals to its residents — just not from an in-house facility. It’s also true that when lawmakers rallied to provide money to make sure nursing homes didn’t have to make that choice, Romney attempted to veto extra funding, saying it would boost nursing home rates.

pomt-05223	Homosexual behavior "cuts your life by about 20 years."	false	/virginia/statements/2012/jun/07/bob-marshall/bob-marshall-says-homosexual-behavior-cuts-life-ex/	Del. Bob Marshall’s statements about homosexuals have generated plenty of controversy this spring. Marshall, one of four candidates running in Tuesday’s GOP primary for the U.S. Senate, made national news May 15 when he led a successful movement in the House of Delegates to reject the judicial nomination of a gay prosecutor. Among other things, Marshall argued that Tracy Thorne-Begland could not be trusted on the bench to uphold Virginia’s ban on same-sex marriage. Two days later, during an interview on CNN, Marshall again questioned Thorne-Begland’s ability to render fair judgments, saying, "Sodomy is not a civil right." And during a campaign swing in Charlottesville on May 24, a reporter asked Marshall whether gay sex should be protected by the constitution. "The court says it is in certain limited circumstances, but you know what that behavior does? It cuts your life by about 20 years," Marshall said. Is Marshall right that the lifespan of gays is, on average, two decades shorter than heterosexuals? We asked him to provide proof. Marshall, who represents Prince William County, sent us an email citing a study published in June 1997 in the International Journal of Epidemiology. The report, conducted by researchers at the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, examined how HIV affected the mortality of gay and bisexual men in Vancouver from 1987 to 1992. The study found that life expectancy at age 20 among gay and bisexual men in Vancouver was 8 to 21 years shorter than that of all men in the Canadian city. The researchers also said their conclusion probably underestimated the life expectancy deficit among gay and bisexual men because AIDS cases were underreported. But that’s not the end of the story. The report’s authors, in 2001, took exception to conservatives who used their study to condemn the lifestyle of gay and bisexual men. The researchers said circumstances had changed since their study ended in the early 1990s. "If we were to repeat this analysis today the life expectancy of gay and bisexual men would be greatly improved," the authors wrote. "Deaths from HIV infection have declined dramatically in this population since 1996." The researchers, however, did not conduct a new study on the life expectancy for gay and bisexual men. We spoke to Julio Montaner, a co-author of the study and director of the British Columbia Center for Excellence in HIV/AIDs. He said Marshall’s statement is a "gross misrepresentation" of the research. "To use my report to support the notion that gay and bisexual sex is somehow the reason why people die early is misusing the data," Montaner said. Montaner noted that his group’s original report was conducted at a time when the HIV epidemic was poorly controlled and treatments were ineffective. Since then, there have have been great strides in treating the disease and preventing its spread, Montaner said. In British Columbia, annual diagnoses of new infections have dropped from 900 in the mid-1990s to 300 in recent years, he said. Deaths from HIV also have fallen sharply, he said. In the United States, figures from the Centers for Disease Control show that the rate of HIV deaths per 100,000 people peaked at 36.3 deaths in 1995 and fell to 2.7 in 2010, the latest year data is available. Gay and bisexual men remain the group most heavily affected by HIV, according to the CDC. Although they represent 2 percent of the U.S. population, gay and bisexual men accounted for 61 percent of new HIV infections in 2009. Marshall, in his email, listed sent abstracts of other studies saying homosexuals have high rates of suicide attempts and certain types of cancer. Two of the studies cite high number of deaths among gay men from HIV and AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s. "With significant investment in medical resources, homosexuals are living longer than in previous years with their compromised health status, but nevertheless still shorter lives than comparable married heterosexuals who don’t eat up medical resources to the same extent," Marshall wrote. None of the other research Marshall listed proves his point that homosexual behavior today cuts life expectancy by 20 years. Marshall, for example, cited a study by the American Journal of Public Health that examined the mortality of men and women in same-sex marriages in Denmark from 1989 to 2004. It found that death rates among those couples was a third higher than the general population, despite a significant drop among men in same-sex couples. Even so, the report, published in 2009, criticized other published claims that homosexuals have a life expectancy that’s more than 20 years shorter than heterosexuals. "Although further research is needed, the claims of drastically increased overall mortality in gay men and lesbians appear unjustified," the report said. We sought U.S. data on how how life expectancy of homosexuals compared to the rest of the population. But the CDC, which compiles statistics on longevity, doesn’t keep figures based on sexual orientation. Laura Durso -- a public policy fellow at the Williams Institute at UCLA, which researches issues facing lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) people -- said few national population-based surveys in the U.S. inquire ask about sexual orientation. That makes it difficult to compare the life expectancies of homosexuals to heterosexuals, she said. Still, Durso said, reports have shown that LGBT populations face increased certain health risks. LGBT youths in particular have been shown to have a higher rate of suicide, she said. Gay men appear to be at higher risk for anal cancer while lesbians appear to be at higher risk of breast cancer, she said. Our Ruling Bob Marshall said homosexual behavior cuts a person’s life by about 20 years. The research Marshall cites to support his claim is two decades old and was conducted near the height of the HIV epidemic. One of the authors said there have been tremendous advances in HIV treatment over the last 20 years and that Marshall’s statement is a "gross misrepresentation" of the research. The U.S. death rate from HIV was nine times higher in 1990 than it was in 2010, the latest year for the data. Marshall cites a number of other studies that show homosexuals face certain health risks. But none of them focused on the life expectancy of homosexuals, and they certainly didn't conclude that gays die about 20 years earlier than heterosexuals. We rate Marshall’s claim False.

pomt-02825	"The state budget has actually grown by $4.6 billion under" Gov. Scott Walker’s actions.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/nov/24/mary-burke/democratic-challenger-gov-scott-walker-says-state-/	From Madison to Tomah, from Janesville to Milwaukee, as Mary Burke has introduced herself to Wisconsin voters, she tells them about her concern over how much Gov. Scott Walker has increased the state budget. Wait -- don’t Democrats usually rip the Republican governor for his budget cuts? In a Madison interview on Nov. 5, 2013, Burke was asked how she would provide tax relief to the middle class if she is elected governor in 2014. "Well, I think we have to make sure that we are living within the means of our taxpayers and I know people are struggling," the Madison school board member and former Trek Bicycle Corp. executive said on WMTV-TV (Channel 15). "So, we need to balance the state budget, we need to make sure the money that we're spending is utilized well. I'm concerned that the state budget has actually grown by $4.6 billion under this administration, which makes it harder and harder to keep taxes lower." You would think Burke’s figure, which she repeated in a Madison speech on Nov. 20, 2013, could be checked with a simple comparison of two numbers. But you’d be like the guy who proposes to his girlfriend while slipping a ring on her right hand: Well-intentioned, but a little misguided. Burke’s numbers Burke’s phrasing could be taken to mean she was claiming the two-year state budget has grown $4.6 billion since Walker succeeded Democrat Jim Doyle in January 2011. Or that it has grown by that amount at some point during Walker's tenure. Initially, even Burke's own campaign wasn't clear on what she meant. When we asked spokesman Joe Zepecki for evidence to back Burke’s claim, he compared the size of Walker’s first budget, for 2011-’13, to Walker’s second budget, for 2013-’15. He provided a PolitiFact Wisconsin article, which made reference to the first budget being $66 billion; and a reference by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, which said the second budget "authorizes the state to spend" $70.4 billion. But the two figures are apples and oranges: the $66 billion figure for 2011-’13 was for the general fund budget -- operations funded with state revenue; the $70.4 billion for 2013-’15 is an "all funds" figure that includes federal funding as well as $2 billion in borrowing. Zepecki then said his staff had made a mistake and that Burke’s statement actually compared Walker's current budget to Doyle's final budget. Zepecki cited figures from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau showing an increase of $4.6 billion, from $65.8 billion in 2009-’11 to $70.4 billion in 2013-’15. But both of those figures are "all funds" appropriations -- not the general fund budget, which comes from state tax dollars and typically is the focus of lawmakers, the news media and others when talking about the state budget. So, let’s review some other numbers. Other numbers We put Burke’s claim to Robert Lang, director of the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state agency in charge of scoring budgets and other money matters. Lang said that looking strictly at biennial general fund budgets -- the ones funded with state revenue -- Doyle’s final spending plan for 2009-’11 was $62.19 billion and Walker’s current budget, for 2013-’15, is $67.5 billion. That’s an increase of $5.31 billion. Lang also said that whenever his agency is asked to compare biennial spending, it considers not only the budget itself, but any other legislation that becomes law during the two-year period. For example, a $100 million property tax relief law approved under Walker after the 2013-’15 budget was adopted would be tallied. Using that method, Doyle’s final spend was $62.95 billion and Walker’s spend in the current biennium -- as of Nov. 15, 2013 -- is $67.62 billion. An increase of $4.67 billion. So, by the two official figures, Burke’s number claim is on target, or even conservative. But what about the rest of her statement, that Walker is responsible for the growth in the budget? Perspective The growth in Walker’s first budget was driven largely by increased expenditures on Medicaid; in his second budget, the increases were in large part for Medicaid and school aids. Walker's press secretary, Tom Evenson, contended the increase since Walker took office is $4.4 billion -- slightly less than Burke’s $4.6 billion claim -- but said it is misleading to say Walker decided to increase spending by that amount. "These are commitments the state cannot easily back out of and stem from decisions largely made prior to Gov. Walker taking office," Evenson said of the federal- and state-funded Medicaid program. Medicaid costs are driven by many factors, from how many people are eligible for the program to the cost of treatment and what recipients are asked to contribute in co-pays. That's much different than a governor simply deciding to boost spending on various programs. Indeed, the highlights of Walker’s first budget included a nearly $800 million cut from public schools, tax cuts for investors and businesses, and clamp-down on property taxes. His second budget included a $651 million income tax decrease, a two-year university tuition for freeze and an increase in property taxes on the typical home limited to 1% in each of the two years. Our rating Burke said the state budget "has actually grown by $4.6 billion under" Walker’s administration, suggesting Walker had boosted the spending. The figure is accurate, but it is due almost completely to Medicaid costs, not budget decisions Walker made. For a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, we give Burke a Half True.	None	Mary Burke	None	None	None	2013-11-24T05:00:00	2013-11-05	['None']
pomt-12511	"Trump's Cabinet is more white and more male than any first Cabinet since President Ronald Reagan’s."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/26/center-american-progress/true-trumps-cabinet-more-white-and-more-male-any-f/	As President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office come to a close, many people are using the marker as an opportunity to recap Trump’s efforts. While Trump himself views his first chapter as a success, other groups see it differently. The Center for American Progress, a progressive policy advocacy group, took to Twitter on April 25 to air its list of grievances with Trump’s administration. The thread comprised of approximately 100 tweets, with each tweet representing one way that the Trump administration has harmed women and families. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Most tweets criticized Trump’s policies, but some took aim at the administration itself. Like No. 57. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com "Trump's Cabinet is more white and more male than any first Cabinet since President Ronald Reagan’s," reads the tweet. This made us wonder. Is that true? Long story short, this claim is accurate when you compare the percentage of nonwhite males and women combined to the percentage of white males in each cabinet. However, if you look at each factor separately, Trump's cabinet remains the most white, but not the most male. The president’s first cabinets As evidence of this claim, the Center for American Progress’ tweet linked to a New York Times article that reached a similar conclusion about Trump’s first cabinet. The New York Times story was updated on March 10, 2017, and compares Trump’s first cabinet to the first cabinets of former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and of course Ronald Reagan. The analysis was first written when Trump’s cabinet wasn’t fully assembled, so, it assumes Trump’s remaining nominees would be confirmed. The New York Times included R. Alexander Acosta, Trump’s second nominee for labor secretary, and to the best of our knowledge Trump’s cabinet has remained unchanged since this time. It’s worth pointing out that the New York Times analysis included traditional cabinet positions as well as "cabinet-level" positions. Cabinet-level positions have changed over time. (Trump has 24 cabinet members, whereas George H.W. Bush only had 17). "Some positions, such as the United Nations ambassador and the Office of Management and Budget director, are given cabinet-level rank by individual presidents but are not traditionally considered part of the cabinet," the article says. Furthermore, some traditional cabinet positions were created since Reagan took office. For example, the Department of Homeland Security didn’t get created until 2003 and the Department of Veterans Affairs did not exist in its current form until George H.W. Bush’s presidency. For these reasons, the total number of people in each president’s first cabinet varies. So, with those factors in mind, how white and male is Trump’s cabinet? According to the New York Times, 18 of Trump's 24 cabinet members are white males. The only minorities and women in Trump’s cabinet are: • Elaine L. Chao, transportation secretary; • Betsy DeVos, education secretary; • Nikki R. Haley, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; • Linda McMahon, administrator of the Small Business Administration; • Ben Carson, housing and urban development secretary; and, • R. Alexander Acosta, labor secretary. That means 75 percent of Trump’s first cabinet is white males. A smaller percentage of white males were in Obama’s, W. Bush’s and Clinton’s first cabinets based on the same analysis. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The only other president who challenges Trump’s standing is George H.W. Bush, whose first cabinet was 71 percent white male. But Bush had fewer cabinet members, according to the New York Times' article. So, the percentage of nonwhite and women cabinet members combined in his cabinet is higher than Trump’s cabinet. But looking at each demographic individually — white and male — changes the picture. Trump's cabinet has a higer percentage of white males out of any first cabinet since Reagan, but he does not have the highest percentage of males. That distinction belongs to George H.W. Bush whose cabinet was 89 percent male. Females makes up a little more than 16 percent of Trump’s cabinet, but only made up 11 percent of George H.W. Bush’s. You have to go back to Reagan to find a more white and more male cabinet. White males comprised 90 percent of his first cabinet. (It's worth noting Reagan had 17 white males to Trump's 18. Reagan's cabinet is considered less diverse, though, because he had even less people in his cabinet.) The idea that Trump’s cabinet lacks diversity has been widely reported on, especially when confirmation hearings and appointments were being made. During that time, a CNN report noted that Trump's four most influential departments are led by white males, which is a first since George H.W. Bush. Those include former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson (secretary of state), retired Marine Gen. James Mattis (secretary of defense), Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions (attorney general), and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Steve Mnuchin (secretary of the treasury). Our ruling In a tweet, American Progress said, "Trump's Cabinet is more white and more male than any first Cabinet since President Ronald Reagan’s." That claim is based on a credible New York Times analysis that found that Trump’s first cabinet had a smaller percentage of women and nonwhites combined than any president since Reagan. When you look at each demographic separately, however, George H.W. Bush has the most male cabinet. With that in mind, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-03597	"Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers, and the most education funding ever."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/may/12/chris-christie/chris-christie-implemented-merit-pay-teachers-best/	Chris Christie’s earned a top grade for his efforts to reward teachers and fund education in New Jersey, according to claims in a new TV ad. The ad, released May 1 by the group Christie for Governor, cites a number of achievements that have resulted from Christie’s leadership since he took the state’s reins in January 2010. "Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers, and the most education funding ever," a narrator states as scenes from around New Jersey flash in the background. We fact-checked the claims about balanced budgets, taxes and job growth on Thursday. Today we’re looking at the ad’s education claims. Let’s review those claims in more detail, starting with merit pay. Christie’s intent may be to give the state’s best teachers merit pay, but the program is unavailable to the vast majority of teachers in New Jersey’s 588 school districts. So far only Newark has merit pay, which the teachers union approved in November. The three-year pact awards bonuses to teachers earning the classification "highly effective" under a new rating system. The Newark deal is the first of its kind in New Jersey and the nation to base teacher pay on classroom performance, including student progress. In addition, four low-income districts -- Asbury Park, Hillside, Lakewood and North Plainfield -- would be eligible for merit pay through a grant from the U.S. Department of Education’s Teacher Innovation Fund. Rutgers University would administer the nearly $40 million grant over five years to improve educator recruitment, evaluation and rewards programs. The state Department of Education is expected to roll out a teacher evaluation system this fall. So merit pay has been approved for one district in New Jersey, and could eventually apply to teachers in four other districts. That’s not exactly rewarding New Jersey’s best teachers. "Christie’s ad clearly gives the impression that this is a statewide issue," New Jersey Education Association spokesman Steve Wollmer said in an e-mail. It’s worth noting that although Christie supports merit pay for teachers, a bill allowing it has been stalled in the Democrat-controlled Legislature since last fall. The NJEA also opposes merit pay. As for "most education funding ever," Christie’s proposed fiscal year 2014 budget calls for nearly $9 billion in education funding, about $1 billion more than the previous year. State aid to schools would increase $97 million. While no district saw a state aid decrease, many either received a nominal increase of $1 or their funding remained flat. Wollmer agreed that in terms of dollars, the ad’s claim is correct, but points out that there’s more to Christie’s education funding story. "But what he doesn’t mention is that he cut $1.3 billion from state aid in his first year – Withholding $475 million in aid in January, which was the amount that the state’s nearly 600 districts had in total surpluses for unanticipated expenses (a new roof, a bus that needed replacing, an unanticipated special ed placement), and another $820 million in the FY11 budget (which began for schools in September of 2010)," Wollmer said. "Districts cut back dramatically, and 10,000 teachers and staff were laid off, programs were cut, and class sizes increased." The state Supreme Court in 2011 also ordered Christie to increase aid to the now-former Abbott districts by about $500 million. Our ruling A new TV ad for Christie’s re-election campaign claims in part, "Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers, and the most education funding ever." The merit pay claim comes across as being available statewide, but so far, the program only applies to teachers in Newark. Of the state’s 588 school districts, four others could offer merit pay eventually. Also, Christie may have a history of slashing education funding as a way to close budget holes, but the ad’s claim about the most education funding, ever, is correct. We rate this portion of the ad’s claims Half True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2013-05-12T07:30:00	2013-05-01	['New_Jersey']

pomt-06024	"In Connecticut and New York, students at Achievement First schools consistently outperform city and statewide averages."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/15/angel-taveras/providence-mayor-angel-taveras-says-achievement-fi/	Politicians, parents and education officials are wrangling over a proposal by Achievement First to open two charter schools in Providence. Supporters say the charter school operator will be able to better educate poor and minority students. Opponents, however, question some of their teaching methods and worry that charter schools will channel money from traditional city-run schools that are already financially strapped. Providence Mayor Angel Taveras is among those in Achievement First’s corner. In a Jan. 8, 2011, commentary in The Sunday Journal, he pointed to the success of schools operated by the organization in two nearby states. "In Connecticut and New York, students at Achievement First schools consistently outperform city and statewide averages," the mayor wrote. That’s essentially the basis of Achievement First’s pitch. According to test scores, the nonprofit organization says, its schools do better than others in their communities and can even compete with those in affluent communities. Many have waded into this debate already. There are claims and counterclaims about the improvements Achievement First’s schools have made on test scores in Connecticut and New York. We decided to examine the issue ourselves. We contacted Taveras’ office first and asked for data to back up the mayor’s statement. While we waited, we started our own search. We began with Achievement First’s website, which lists test results for all of its schools. But the site averages results for math, reading and writing together, so it’s impossible to get a clear picture of how the schools did in individual subjects. We wanted to analyze precise scores, not averages, so we went directly to the sources for testing data. Both the Connecticut State Department of Education and the New York State Education Department make test results available on their websites. Before we get to the test scores, it’s helpful to have some background on Achievement First, which operates 10 schools in Connecticut and 10 in New York. Its flagship, Amistad Academy, opened in New Haven, Conn., in 1999 with a mission to serve underprivileged children. The school has since expanded and so has the organization’s reach, moving into Hartford, Bridgeport and New York City. Achievement First’s approach includes a longer school day, more days in the school year, strict discipline and a focus on reading and math. Taveras uses the present tense in his claim, so we examined results from the most recent years, 2010 and 2011. Because the 20 schools opened at different times and because Achievement First typically starts each school with a single grade and then expands, testing data varies for each year and each school. For some schools, there is only one year of test results. For others, there is six years of results. In considering test results, we used the percentage of students that meet or exceed the standard. (In Connecticut, this is considered being at or above proficiency.) Achievement First argues that a greater percentage of students in its schools meet the standard or are proficient than state and city averages, so we’ll focus our attention on these results. We’ll look at Connecticut first. All students in grades 3-8 take the Connecticut Mastery Test (CMT), which tests students in math, reading and writing. Fifth graders and eighth graders are also tested in science. All 10th graders take the Connecticut Academic Performance Test (CAPT), which tests them in math, science, reading and writing. In 2010, students in four Achievement First schools were tested on the CMT, totaling 16 classes in six grades. For math, 11 of those classes exceeded the state average for the percentage of students at or above proficiency. Fifteen of the 16 exceeded city averages. For example, of the 51 seventh graders at Elm City College Preparatory Middle School, in New Haven, 92.2 percent were proficient or better. The state average was 87.2 percent and the city average was 75.2 percent. In the other subjects, Achievement First schools didn’t do as well, with only 4 of 16 classes exceeding the state average in reading and 8 of 16 in writing. Thirteen of the 16 classes did better than city averages in reading and 14 of 16 in writing. The 2011 exams followed a similar pattern. Twenty Achievement First classes in four schools took the tests and 12 exceeded the state average on math while all 20 exceeded city averages. In reading, however, only three exceeded the state average while 16 exceeded city averages. And in writing, 10 exceeded the state average while 19 exceeded city averages. For the CAPT, the only Achievement First high school -- Amistad Academy -- outdid city averages in all subject areas in both 2010 and 2011 and all state averages except in reading in 2010. The results so far: students in Connecticut Achievement First schools do well in math, not as well in reading and writing. Now let’s look at New York. Students in grades 3-8 in that state take the New York State Tests in math and English language arts. In 2010, students in four Achievement First schools were tested, totaling 18 classes in six grades. For math, 15 of those classes exceeded the state average for the percentage of students that met the standard or did better. All 18 exceeded the city average. On the English portion of the exam, only 1 of the 18 Achievement First classes exceeded the state average and only 6 of the 18 exceeded the city average. Results for the 2011 exam were similar. Twenty-one Achievement First classes in five schools took the tests and all 21 exceeded the state and city averages on math. In English, however, only seven exceeded the state average and 12 exceeded the city average. Before making our ruling, we should point out that Taveras’ office did eventually send us data that was nearly the same as what we found ourselves. The only difference was that for New York, Taveras’ office compared the results of Achievement First’s schools to district results, not citywide results. We chose citywide results, because in his commentary in The Journal, Taveras made the comparison to city averages. If district results were used, the Achievement First schools would have fared better, especially in English. Our ruling Achievement First schools do outperform city and state averages for math in Connecticut and New York, but the results aren’t as definitive for other subjects. To quantify this, we added up the number of classes that were tested in the two states in 2010 and 2011 and totaled the number of times the class results in different subject areas could be compared with either state or city averages. Here’s what we found: STATE SUBJECT % OF CLASSES HIGHER THAN STATE AVERAGE % OF CLASSES HIGHER THAN CITY AVERAGE New York Math 90 95 New York English Language Arts 21 46 Connecticut Math 66 97 Connecticut Reading 21 82 Connecticut Writing 53 92 Connecticut Science 40 93 In total, for all grades and all subjects in the two states, Achievement First outperformed state or city averages 66 percent of the time. (If the New York district averages provided by Taveras’ office were substituted for city averages, this number would have risen to 70 percent.) Generally, combining all grades and all subjects, Achievement First schools performed better than their home cities, scoring better 83 percent of the time. Compared with state averages, however, they scored better only 50 percent of the time. Achievement First schools also did better on math, scoring higher than state or city averages 87 percent of the time. But in other subject areas -- science, reading and writing -- they had higher averages only 54 percent of the time. Taveras said that Achievement First schools in Connecticut and New York "consistently outperform city and statewide averages." That’s true for math but it’s not true for other subjects. It’s true for city averages but not for statewide averages. In other words, the mayor overstated the case for the charter school operator. We rule the claim Half True.

pomt-15192	Says Patrick Murphy "hasn't passed a single bill out of committee."	false	/florida/statements/2015/aug/18/alan-grayson/grayson-says-murphy-hasnt-passed-single-bill-out-c/	U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson is bringing his brash reputation to bear in his Senate campaign, calling his Democratic primary opponent U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy "ineffective" as a legislator. In an Aug. 12, 2015, statement, Grayson, D-Orlando, offered to help Murphy learn how to legislate. Grayson posted the video for the old Schoolhouse Rock song "I’m Just A Bill" and cited an InsideGov.com listicle that called Murphy one of "the least-effective members of Congress." "Patrick Murphy is one of the least effective members of Congress, in part because he hasn't passed a single bill out of committee," Grayson said in the release. Murphy, D-Jupiter, is competing with Grayson for the Democratic nomination to run for the Senate seat now held by GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio. Murphy has already been attacked by some Democrats for allegedly not being progressive enough, but we wondered whether the second-term congressman hadn’t gotten any bills out of committee. It’s time for us to take our own roll call. Murphy’s law? We’re not going to rate Murphy’s effectiveness as a legislator, because that’s a subjective measure. We’ve also noted time and again that passing bills is not the only way to determine a lawmaker’s effectiveness. There’s simply more to the job, such as writing language that gets included in other bills, proposing amendments, being a co-sponsor, holding hearings or negotiating with other legislators, as well as constituent services. Murphy was first elected in 2012, so he has largely been a freshman with little seniority. He’s also a Democrat, which means he’s in the minority party in the Republican-controlled Congress. Grayson cited an InsideGov article as evidence for Murphy's lack of action, but we found two problems with that evidence. First, the article sticks to a single measure: How many bills a member of Congress sponsored and passed out of committee (that is, having them sent to the House floor for debate) as a percentage of all the bills they introduced. Murphy is listed as having zero during his freshman term. Florida Republicans Richard Nugent and Daniel Webster are on the list, too. The list is stacked with rookies — 21 of the politicians named have served four years or less. It’s also overwhelmingly filled with Democrats, the minority party in the House since 2011. But there are other ways to get legislation out of committee. Murphy’s campaign disputed the list, and pointed out two instances of him getting bill language out of a committee as a freshman: • In May 2013, Murphy introduced HR 1974, a bill that would have changed how the Small Business Administration gave out loans for businesses rebuilding after a disaster. Instead of being reported out of committee, Murphy’s language was attached to HR 4121 as an amendment along with other SBA-related changes and sent from the Small Business Committee to the House. No action was taken on the bill. • In October 2013, Murphy was a co-sponsor and co-author of HR 3329, concerning banking regulations. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., was listed as the sponsor, but Murphy’s campaign noted he and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., managed the bill in the House. In the Congressional Record, Capito credited Murphy for writing the bill with Luetkemeyer. The bill eventually became law. The second problem is that the article didn't look past 2014, so it's out of date. In addition to highlighting several amendments passed on the House floor, Murphy’s campaign said that the House Committee on Veterans Affairs moved HR 456 forward in May 2015. That Murphy-sponsored bill's language amended HR 475 to cover application fees to post-secondary institutions for veterans. HR 456 came during Murphy’s second term, and wasn’t covered by the InsideGov list. Several experts told us the list Grayson is citing isn’t providing a good picture of what lawmakers do. Washington University in St. Louis political science professor Steven Smith told PolitiFact that party-line voting in committees usually keeps Democratic-sponsored legislation from getting anywhere. He called the InsideGov article "disappointing" because of its limitations. "It lists only legislators at the low end of the scale, so we cannot see the majority party bias built into the legislative process and their measure," he said. Grayson, in case you’re curious, passed two resolutions about honoring Rollins College and when high schoolers should learn about the U.S. Constitution during his first term in 2009-10. He also was behind a law passed giving gold medals to astronauts. Our ruling Grayson said Murphy "hasn't passed a single bill out of committee." He cited a source that only looked at Murphy’s first term, not his second. Experts said the source is flawed, and is not a good way to measure how government works. Murphy had a hand in at least two items coming out of committee in 2013: One bill became an amendment, and he co-authored a second that became law. A third bill that Murphy sponsored moved out of committee as an amendment in 2015. We rate Grayson's statement False.	None	Alan Grayson	None	None	None	2015-08-18T18:01:52	2015-08-12	['None']

pomt-05486	"The ACLU has filed a suit to end prayer from the military completely."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/19/chain-email/chain-email-has-no-defense/	So has everyone heard about the big legal case going on in Washington? Not the recent three-day hearing before U.S. Supreme Court about the federal government’s health care law and its controversial individual mandate. We mean the case about the American Civil Liberties Union suing the U.S. military, according to a widely circulated chain email. Loyal PolitiFact Georgia reader Robin Fitch asked us to check out a claim she received in her email. inbox "ACLU has filed a suit to end prayer from the military completely," the email said. "They're making great progress. The Navy Chaplains can no longer mention Jesus' name in prayer thanks to the ACLU and others. I'm not breaking this one. If I get it a 1000 times, I'll forward it a 1000 times! Let us pray...Prayer chain for our Military... Don't break it!" Fitch, who lives in Atlanta, got it from a friend in Columbus. She didn’t believe it. Turns out her instinct was correct. This claim has been circulating for a few years. It may have gotten started in 2006, when a Navy court reprimanded and docked the pay of an evangelical Protestant chaplain. Lt. Gordon J. Klingenschmitt was found guilty of disobeying an order by appearing in uniform at a political protest in front of the White House. He had been critical of the Navy’s policies that he said prevented him from saying "Jesus" in a prayer. In 2009, rumors of an ACLU lawsuit to end prayer completely in the military began spreading through the Internet. That year, PolitiFact swatted down a claim that the ACLU filed a lawsuit to have all military cross-shaped headstones removed. The one was rated Pants on Fire. The article mentioned the prayer claim. A year or so later, websites began debunking the specific claim about prayer in the military. But for the record, we checked with the U.S. military to see if anything has changed since these rumors began. "That’s utter lunacy," said Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale, a Defense Department spokesman. "I’m not aware of any notification from the ACLU toward that end." An ACLU spokeswoman told us the same thing. "This email has been widely circulated, but there is no such ACLU lawsuit of this kind pending, nor do we intend to file one," spokeswoman Molly Kaplan told us via email. "The ACLU vigorously defends the rights of all Americans to practice their faith, and the rights of chaplains to serve our armed forces. Military chaplains are certainly allowed to practice their specific faith when conducting specifically sectarian ceremonies and to serve in non-denominational roles when ministering to service members at-large, according to their training." Let’s hope this false claim doesn’t continue to make the rounds on the Internet or via email. This one is a Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2012-04-19T06:00:00	2012-03-21	['None']

pomt-02968	Milwaukee County has "a parks capital budget that’s bigger than it’s been in the last 10 years."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/23/chris-abele/chris-abele-says-his-budget-improvements-county-pa/	Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele was brimming with optimism and lung power when he addressed the future of Milwaukee County government in an Oct. 1, 2013 speech to the Rotary Club of Milwaukee. In one breath, he unleashed this accounting: "A couple of years ago if anybody had said, ‘Hey in a few years the county will have a higher credit rating than anyone would guess it would have, would have a deficit that’s almost on its way out, would be on its second operating surplus with a surplus number higher than it’s been in years, would have a parks capital budget that’s bigger than it’s been in the last 10 years and is going to catch up on deferred maintenance, has a child-support service department that with less staff is hitting all-time records in the history of the department’ -- If anybody had told you that a couple years ago, people might have said, some people would have said, ‘No.’ Exhale. A Public Policy Forum report in October 2013 confirmed improvements in county finances under Abele, who won election in 2011 when Scott Walker left to become governor. But Abele’s boast about spending on major parks improvements in Milwaukee County was a new one on us. Abele has received plaudits for putting money into long-neglected central-city parks in Milwaukee, but recently drew criticism for proposing closure of two indoor pools at parks where he would replace them with a splash pad or a skateboard park. Has Abele set a new standard for capital improvements in parks countywide? We started with the adopted 2013 budget, because Abele’s office told us his claim referred to that year and because, for reasons we will explain, it was the first year in which Abele had total control over capital spending. Abele’s 2014 budget proposal is awaiting action by the County Board. First stop, the county’s capital budget book. The book contains the official numbers on capital improvements, which in the Parks Department include things such as fixing leaky pools, building new picnic shelters, paving parkways, replacing walkways and other major work. Going back 10 years puts you at 2004, two years into Walker’s tenure as county executive. We found four years with higher budgeted totals than 2013 -- all predating Abele. There is one wrinkle: Under Walker, the county doubled up its borrowing for capital improvements in 2009 and 2010 -- in effect borrowing for four years, including 2011 and 2012 too. That was so it could get federal subsidies to lower its normal borrowing costs, under President Barack Obama’s economic stimulus plan. Adjusting for that by spreading that over four years, we actually found six years in the decade with a higher parks capital budget than 2013. Another way to look at it When we asked Abele spokesman Brendan Conway for backup on the exec’s claim, he provided a 2013 parks capital budget figure that was more than double the amount in the budget book. Conway said it included parks-related projects and major maintenance that is spread around the county budget but not tallied under parks capital because other departments supervise the work. For example: Road construction on a county parkway. Abele’s not the first county executive to pull together the numbers that way. In fact, county finance officials told us it’s a legitimate alternative. But the list itself was a bit too broad. It included, for instance, a tally for countywide sanitary sewer repairs ordered by the state. What’s more, Conway didn’t provide any prior years for comparison. So we asked the county official in charge of capital finance, Pamela Bryant, to use Abele’s method to generate a decade’s worth of numbers. Bryant works for the independently elected county comptroller, Scott Manske. Before running her analysis, she conferred with Abele’s office and they came to an agreement on what to include using the broader method, Bryant told us. Bryant developed two tables that dealt with the "double borrowing" issue in different ways. In one table, 2007 and 2010 parks-related capital spending outpaced 2013. In the other, there were three years in which parks-related capital spending was higher than in 2013. It wasn’t close in two instances. In 2011 (Walker’s last budget) and 2012, the spending was about $4 million to $7 million higher than the $14.8 million in 2013. As we mentioned, that was the first budget over which Abele had total control over capital spending due to the stimulus-related borrowing for 2012. In addition, the 2007 budget was just a shade over Abele’s 2013 mark, though if inflation were factored in, the gap would grow. Our rating Abele told Rotarians that Milwaukee County has a "parks capital budget that’s bigger than it’s been in the last 10 years." By any measure, this claim misses the mark. While Abele’s 2013 budget funded parks capital at a higher level than at least six other budgets in the decade, it’s not close to the leader. We rate his claim False.

pomt-07209	"We in the Democratic Party had no input into the locations of these hearings, nor did we have input into the process."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/06/robert-brown/georgia-democrats-left-out-process-lawmaker-compla/	It’s important, it’s done once a decade, and many observers can’t wait for it to end. It is the spectacle of reapportionment, the process Georgia lawmakers use to decide the boundaries of each district in the state House of Representatives and Senate, and congressional districts. A slight shift of boundary lines could result in changes to how a district votes, thus a lawmaker could lose his or her job and the political tides in, say, the Georgia Legislature could shift on some important issues. Democrats and Republicans often fight over the boundaries like football players during a fumble. Republicans have the advantage since they hold majorities in both chambers of the Georgia Legislature. With such stakes in mind, the leader of the Senate Democrats complained about some aspects of this year’s reapportionment at the first public hearing May 17 in Athens. "We in the Democratic Party had no input into the locations of these hearings, nor did we have input into the process," Brown said. Sen. Mitch Seabaugh, who is co-chairman of the Reapportionment and Redistricting Committee, countered that he has repeatedly asked Democrats for ideas and suggestions. "Legislators have had ample opportunity to give whatever input in the process," said Seabaugh, a Republican from Sharpsburg. So is Brown off base here? Or is he right about Democrats being shut out of the reapportionment process? Reapportionment is based primarily on U.S. census counts taken at the beginning of each decade. For more than a century, Georgia Democrats dominated the process because they held majorities in both chambers of the Legislature and the governor’s office. This year is the first time Republicans will hold voting sway over reapportionment. Democrats and government watchdog groups such as Common Cause Georgia are suspicious of the Republican plan. The GOP has hired a law firm to, said state Rep. Roger Lane, R-Darien, advise them on the legal compliance of the maps. Brown, who was sworn in to office in 1991, said there are many examples to back up his argument about the process. He said that traditionally state legislators are allowed to ask questions at public hearings. This year, he said, they cannot. Legislators also sit in the audience, which gives them less opportunity to take questions from voters during the public hearings. Another problem with the process, Brown said, was the lack of discussion about the committee schedule during the recent legislative session that ended in April. Brown said there was "no planning" during the session. Speaking about a meeting he had in April with Seabaugh and others, Brown said "that is not involving you in the process" since it was a private meeting. Brown said the planning for the public hearings should have been done through the Legislature’s committees. Seabaugh forwarded us two letters he sent to all senators requesting meetings to discuss their districts and the reapportionment process. Seabaugh also said committee leaders asked legislators for potential locations for the public hearings. He wrote a memo on March 4 to senators requesting locations for the hearings and wanted their replies by March 10. Some Democrats in the House of Representatives responded, Seabaugh said. Senate Democrats did not until the list was approved, he told us. Seabaugh said he and Lane, also a co-chairman of the Reapportionment and Redistricting Committee, chose the sites from the cities suggested by lawmakers that "we felt covered the state of Georgia." Sen. Vincent Fort, a Democrat from Atlanta, said some Democrats proposed additional sites for the hearings. He forwarded us a letter from Seabaugh that the committee would not add any locations. "It makes me question whether they are really interested in any Democratic input into the process," Fort said. Seabaugh’s response: "They had a form on their desk. They had an opportunity to participate. I can’t make them fill out a form and hand it in on time." House Democratic Whip Carolyn Hughley of Columbus confirmed to PolitiFact Georgia that lawmakers were asked for suggestions to hold the hearings. But like Fort, she complained about some sites that weren’t selected. She also told us that Seabaugh wrote a letter to lawmakers telling them not to ask or answer questions from the public at reapportionment hearings. "The public hearings are opportunities for us as legislators to hear from the public," Seabaugh wrote. Hughley said that "raises key questions about transparency and fairness." Seabaugh’s letter said it is standard practice for lawmakers not to ask or answer questions at joint committee public hearings. Veteran University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock offered some perspective on Brown’s complaints. "I would take all Democratic screams of outrage with a grain of salt," said Bullock, who contends that Democrats gave Republicans no input into reapportionment a decade ago. We have trouble with Brown’s comment that Democrats had "no input" in location of the hearings because all members of the Georgia Legislature were asked for suggestions of sites. Some of the sites are in largely Democratic terrain such as Atlanta, Albany, Columbus and Macon. As for Brown’s point about being left out of the process, his argument is based on not being asked to speak at the hearings and how Seabaugh has asked other lawmakers for input. Seabaugh did ask lawmakers not to ask or answer questions. Seabaugh has written letters to lawmakers asking them for their ideas or concerns about reapportionment. Brown’s claim and argument ignore some critical facts we believe will give the casual reader a different impression of this issue. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13921	Says Hillary Clinton’s immigration platform would "create totally open borders."	false	/florida/statements/2016/jun/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-would-create-tot/	While Donald Trump vows to build a wall between the United States and Mexico to keep undocumented immigrants out, he says Hillary Clinton has the opposite approach. "She’s pledged to grant mass amnesty, and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders for the United States, totally open borders," Trump said in a June 22 speech. Claiming that Clinton would create "totally open borders" is a serious charge that suggests allowing people to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries. That’s not what Clinton has proposed. Clinton has supported legislation that includes a path to citizenship (with conditions) and included heightened border security. As a candidate, she says she will focus on deportations of criminals. However, some experts argue that "open borders" doesn't necessarily mean no enforcement at all but making it far easier for undocumented immigrants to stay here. Clinton does want to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants, but that’s not the same as getting rid of enforcement. We emailed a Trump spokeswoman twice and did not hear back. Clinton’s immigration platform So if Clinton hasn’t called for "open borders," what does she want to do on immigration? During this campaign, she has called for addressing immigration laws including a path to citizenship within her first 100 days. But she has also called for protecting borders and deporting criminals or those who pose threats. "We need to secure our borders, I’m for it, I voted for it, I believe in it, and we also need to deal with the families, the workers who are here, who have made contributions, and their children," she said in November. "We can do more to secure our border and we should do more to deal with the 11 or 12 million people who are here, get them out of the shadows." This is pretty consistent with her view as a senator and secretary of state. As a senator, Clinton supported changing immigration laws, including supporting immigration bills in 2004, 2006 and 2007, and she co-sponsored the Dream Act, an effort to help young people who emigrated illegally as children avoid deportation. In her 2014 book Hard Choices, Clinton praised the 2013 immigration bill, which included billions for border enforcement over a decade for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. Clinton’s immigration platform does not amount to open borders, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. Open borders existed before 1875, when there were no federal restrictions on emigrating to the country, he said. The United States had immigration restrictions from 1875 to 1924 without a border patrol, which was created in 1924. "Trump may be conflating the term ‘open borders’ with anything less than perfect enforcement of our immigration laws -- which would be a serious rhetorical error on his part," Nowrasteh said. "Trump can’t claim Clinton is for open borders while she has also supported massive increases in border security to better enforce our restrictive immigration laws." Clinton has said she wants to limit deportations to violent criminals, not deport children and end raids and round-ups and go further than Obama for DREAMers and their parents if legally possible. That greatly expands who could avoid deportation in a Clinton White House. Those policies amount to less enforcement to supporters of reduced immigration, including Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, and Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA. "This really is a breathtaking step toward open borders," Krikorian told the Washington Post after the March 9 Miami debate. "If you take that step, it needs to be put in front of the public: Do you think immigration laws are irrelevant unless the illegal immigrant has committed a violent offense or drug crime?" Beck said the term "open borders" is imprecise. However, if undocumented immigrants can "stay as long as you don’t commit a violent crime, that is pretty close to open borders. You don’t have to give amnesty -- you can just not have a threat of deportation and it allows people to stay." Clinton’s aim to reform immigration laws and focus on deporting criminals is not the same as ending enforcement and creating open borders, said David Leopold, past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Trump also fails to acknowledge that Clinton has supported legislation with border patrol measures. "Proposing immigration legislation is a far cry from mass amnesty, and it’s generally accepted that any immigration reform proposal will include background checks, an English requirement, back taxes and fines," he said. Our ruling Trump said Clinton’s immigration platform would "create totally open borders." This is a huge distortion of Clinton’s proposals. Clinton has praised work already done to secure the border, and she said she supported a 2013 bill that would have invested billions more in border security while creating a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants. Her plan calls for protecting the border and targeting deportation to criminals and security threats. Her plan would make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to avoid deportation, but that’s not the same as ending all enforcement.

pomt-14893	"Go look on the West Point website and you’ll see those specific words, ‘full scholarship to West Point.’ So even though it is, you know, given as a grant for anybody who gets in, those words are used."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/08/ben-carson/carson-defends-west-point-scholarship-story/	Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson stuck to his story about being offered a scholarship to West Point after a Politico article blasted him for "fabricating" the account. Carson has highlighted the offer to the prestigious military academy — allegedly made by Gen. William Westmoreland in 1969 when Carson was a ROTC student leader in Detroit — in his books and comments throughout the years. But Carson never applied to West Point nor does Westmoreland’s schedule place him in Detroit at the time Carson said he was, according to Politico. What’s more, there’s no such thing as a "full scholarship" to West Point, as everyone accepted to the five federal service academies receives free tuition in exchange for their service. When asked about discrepancy on ABC’s This Week by host George Stephanopoulos, Carson said the academy itself uses the terminology. "Wait a minute George, go look on the West Point website, and you’ll see those specific words, ‘full scholarship to West Point,’ " Carson said Nov. 8. "So even though it is, you know, given as a grant for anybody who gets in, those words are used. And if a recruiter or somebody who’s trying to get you to come there or trying to get you to do that, those are the very words they will use. It’s on their website." We wondered if the words really are advertised on West Point’s website. We could not reach the military academy. Searching for the "specific words ‘full scholarship to West Point’" turned up no results on West Point’s own website or on Google. The official admissions page also makes no mention of a scholarship of any kind. Instead, it simply notes that tuition, room and board, and expenses are fully paid for those who are selected to attend West Point. The academy’s diversity page, however, states that "this four-year college experience is a fully funded scholarship." Carson’s spokesperson told us that West Point has referred to their benefits as a full scholarship in publications, a point Carson made in a Nov. 8 Facebook post. He uploaded two West Point recruitment ads targeted at African-Americans that contain the word "scholarship," including one from the 1960s, when he was a student. We also found examples of the words "full scholarship" used in publications that are linked on West Point’s website, as well as some old recruiting advertisements: • A dataset from 2014: "At the United States Military Academy all students receive a full scholarship, including room & board and medical- and dental-care are provided by the U.S. Army." • A prospectus from 2012: "As a cadet, you are a member of the U.S. Army and receive a full scholarship and an annual salary of more than $10,000 from which you pay for your uniforms, textbooks, a laptop computer, and incidents." • An ad in a 1991 issue of Black Enterprise magazine: "Each year about 1,400 young men and women take advantage of the opportunity to attend West Point on a full government scholarship, which includes tuition, room and board and medical care. • An ad that appeared in a few issues of Ebony magazine in 1990: "You receive a full scholarship, earn a degree from one of the country’s finest colleges, and build a foundation for a challenging career of service to the nation." The financial benefits to attending military academies have been essentially described as scholarship-like or equivalent to a scholarship by USA Today, a West Point spokesperson in Forbes, and the Naval Academy. But the term "full scholarship" is an inaccurate description, experts told us. The phrase typically refers to a college providing financial aid to allow a candidate to attend a college free of charge, but that doesn’t really apply to West Point’s across-the-board zero-tuition policy, said Antonio Buehler, a West Point alumnus who founded the admissions coaching service Abrome. "No such scholarship is named, every cadet is treated the same and there is an eight-year military commitment after graduation. Hence, not free," Buehler said. The proper terminology is "appointment," said Vu Tran, a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy who runs the Denver-based admissions consulting firm Service Academy Coach. But because that’s not apparent from the get-go, Tran says he can’t fault Carson for using the term loosely, albeit incorrectly. "I can definitely see where parents and students who are beginning the process can misconstrue it to be a scholarship," he said. "But for those who have gone through the admission process and through the nomination process, they would never call it a scholarship." Carson’s use of the words "full scholarship" is even more inaccurate if he’s describing his own experience, experts agreed. Tran told us it’s conceivable a ROTC commander or even a general would encourage a student to apply to West Point, touting the free tuition, but noted that anyone familiar with the process understands that that’s contingent upon nomination and acceptance. "(Carson) would not have been ‘offered’ the opportunity to attend West Point at no cost, like all other cadets, until he applied and received an appointment, which he never did," Buehler said. Our ruling Carson defended his use of the word scholarship in discussing his recruitment to West Point, saying, "Go look on the West Point website and you’ll see those specific words, ‘full scholarship to West Point.’" The military academy has used the words "full scholarship" a few times in admissions literature and advertisements and in one place on its website. However, experts say Carson’s use of the word scholarship doesn’t properly explain the application and appointment process to West Point. Carson’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True. Correction: After this story was published, we found an additional instance of the words "full scholarship" on West Point’s website. The article has been updated to reflect that.

pomt-08932	Karen Handel "would have felt like it was OK to go in and abort" Sarah Palin's son Trig, who has Down syndrome.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/26/melanie-crozier/abortion-group-says-gop-gubernatorial-hopeful-kare/	Now that the Republican gubernatorial runoff is on, some Georgia abortion foes are taking aim at front-runner Karen Handel. Handel placed first in the GOP primary despite Georgia Right to Life's criticisms that she's not pro-life enough. A late endorsement by conservative darling Sarah Palin helped her rocket ahead of opponents. And that's what concerns Melanie Crozier, the director of the Georgia Right to Life's Political Action Committee, Crozier said in a recent article for Politico, an online news site. "[Palin] has a son with Down syndrome, and under Karen Handel’s laws, Handel would have felt like it was OK to go in and abort that child," said Crozier. Crozier added that they plan to back Nathan Deal, Handel's opponent in the GOP runoff. We did a double take. Handel is fine with aborting a fetus that tests positive for Down syndrome? No, she's not, Handel said. Her campaign called Crozier's statement a "cruel and revolting lie." She called on Crozier and GRTL President Dan Becker to step down. We requested to speak with Crozier. Instead, GRTL sent us a press release on their opposition to Handel's views on in vitro fertilization. But Crozier did talk with WSB-TV. In the interview, she apologized for making a statement that was unclear and said she was really criticizing Handel's views on in vitro fertilization. GRTL thinks doctors should create only as many embryos as they plan to implant. Handel thinks that if any are left over, they should be considered for adoption. Crozier has not asked for a correction or clarification on the Politico story, according to its author. GRTL and Handel have tangled before. She, like other GOP candidates, has declared herself "pro-life," but some claim she's not "pro-life" enough. In statewide runs, Handel has consistently opposed abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at stake. GRTL supports only one exception: the life of the mother. Handel has taken hits from GRTL for her views for years, but she has stood her ground. When Handel ran for secretary of state in 2006, GRTL sent out a postcard naming her primary runoff opponent as the race's only true right-to-life candidate. Handel won without the organization's support. GRTL and Handel were at loggerheads again in June, after Becker used the word "barren" to talk about Handel's struggles with fertility and her position on abortion. She has previously talked publicly about how she tried unsuccessfully to have a child for 10 years. And when Palin announced her endorsement of Handel on July 12, GRTL issued a press release to say they were "stunned" because Handel's views on abortion showed she did not cherish the lives of children with genetic disorders as much as she should. Palin's son Trig was born in 2008 with Down syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes physical problems and cognitive delays. In a July 22 interview with Lori Geary on WSB-TV, Crozier tried to clarify the statement she made to Politico. Crozier: "What I’m saying is, if a baby who is created through the process of in vitro fertilization ..." Geary: "Which again, Palin’s was not ..." Crozier: "But we’re saying, if this was the case, and was found to have Down syndrome, Karen Handel is OK with that life being exterminated." Handel's campaign denies this claim as well. "They're making a series of reaches beyond anything Karen believes," said her campaign spokesman Dan McLagan. What Crozier told Politico doesn't stand up to to scrutiny. Neither does her clarification. GRTL failed to provide any evidence whatsoever for the statement that Handel thinks it is fine to abort a child because it has Down syndrome. And the organization failed to explain how it came to its conclusion. The group should have known that they were misrepresenting Handel's beliefs. They've been quibbling with her stances for years. After Handel called for the resignation of GRTL's leadership, the group backed so far off its statement that Crozier claimed she wasn't really talking about aborting children with Down syndrome. Instead, she told WSB-TV, she was really talking about in vitro fertilization. But, as Geary pointed out, Trig wasn't conceived in a test tube. How could the subject apply to him? Crozier made a baseless and outrageous statement. She earns PolitiFact's lowest rating, Pants on Fire.	None	Melanie Crozier	None	None	None	2010-07-26T06:00:00	2010-07-21	['Sarah_Palin']

pomt-12173	"As Governor, Wolf has already proposed more than $8B in tax increases."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/aug/02/paul-mango/truth-behind-new-gop-gov-hopefuls-wolf-nickname-th/	A businessman without political experience using his outsider status to rise to power: It worked for President Donald Trump, and now Western Pa. Republican Paul Mango — a Harvard-educated veteran and former healthcare consultant — will attempt to use it to take the governor’s mansion in Harrisburg. Mango kicked off his campaign in May, running in part on an anti-tax platform. At an event at Lackawanna College in mid-May, Mango called Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf "Thomas the Tax Engine," according to The Scranton Times-Tribune. "He has never met a tax he doesn’t like," Mango continued to reporters. "He has requested almost $6 billion in taxes in the years he’s been in office. We cannot afford any more of Tom Wolf." Mango has repeatedly used that nickname for Wolf, including in a campaign video posted to YouTube on May 18. What’s changed, however, is Mango’s estimate for Wolf’s proposed tax increases: from $6 billion to more than $8 billion during the governor’s time in office. "Governor Wolf is refusing to accept a revenue plan unless it includes tax increases," a July 24 post on Mango’s campaign Facebook page states. "As Governor, Wolf has already proposed more than $8B in tax increases." Has Wolf earned the Tax Engine sobriquet? When contacted about the $6 billion claim in May, a Mango campaign advisor, Matthew E. Beynon of consulting firm BrabenderCox, shared a spreadsheet that showed $5.7 billion in estimated revenue from tax increases and modifications for budget years 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18. The sources listed were Wolf’s executive budgets. While the revenue estimates for years 2016-17 and 2017-18 matched those under the heading "PROPOSED TAX AND REVENUE MODIFICATIONS" in Wolf’s proposed budgets, the estimate for 2015-16 did not. Mango’s campaign estimated 2015-16 revenue at $1.9 billion, while Wolf’s own budget showed the revenue estimate at $4.6 billion. The bulk of that — an estimated $2.4 billion — would have come from an increase in the personal income tax rate and an additional $1.6 billion from a higher and expanded sales and use tax. When asked about the discrepancy, Beynon said, "We based our initial numbers by taking the most conservative estimates that we found." The campaign revised the numbers, he said, to project $8.6 billion in "tax increases" during Wolf’s time in office. That $8.6 billion figure appears to come from combining the positive revenue estimates from tax changes proposed in Wolf’s first three budgets. It falls to an estimated $8.3 billion when tax cuts and modifications that would have resulted in a revenue reduction in budget years 2015-16 and 2016-17 are included. Gina Diorio, director of media relations for the Commonwealth Foundation, said the conservative think-tank would use that $8.3 billion number as the estimate for Wolf’s tax increase requests during his time in office. However, Marc Stier, director of the nonpartisan Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, says it is misleading to look at the proposals cumulatively. Proposed tax changes from Wolf's first budget did not pass and were modified and carried over to the second. The same goes for Wolf's second and third budget proposals, although to a lesser degree. In budget year 2016-17, Wolf proposed $2.7 billion in tax changes. Stier said that’s practically what Wolf asked for during his first budget year when one takes into account the $2.1 billion in property tax relief it would have provided. "That is a tax shift," he said. Hypothetically, if Wolf’s requests for tax increases would have been granted during the first year, there would be no deficit today and therefore no need to increase taxes. "If the General Assembly had enacted [Wolf’s] tax proposals from the first or the second year, there would be no need to enact any taxes this year," Stier said in a follow-up email. "We have a two-year deficit (this year and next year) that approaches $4 billion. If we raised $2.7 billion (or a bit more with inflation) this year and next, we would have $5.4 billion more revenue over two years. Thus there would be no need for new tax revenues." The Commonwealth Foundation’s Diorio said she couldn’t "conjecture what might or might not have been introduced had certain tax proposals passed." When asked about Mango's tax claim, Beth Melena, communications director for the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, said Wolf was working to restore $1 billion in education cuts and was dealing with "a massive budget deficit" when he proposed his first budget. The statement did not directly address the number. Our ruling Mango asserted at a campaign kickoff event that Wolf has requested "nearly $6 billion in taxes" since taking office. His campaign revised that estimate to more than $8 billion, which is approximately the total revenue estimate from tax changes in Wolf’s three budgets combined. But one expert says looking at the proposals cumulatively is misleading, as proposed changes that did not pass were modified and carried over from one year to the next. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-08654	"Over 10 years, (extending tax cuts for the wealthy) would add less to the deficit than Obama added with the stimulus in one year."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/14/george-will/george-will-says-tax-cuts-wealthy-cost-less-over-1/	Two of the most contentious fiscal policy disputes in Washington today have to do with the stimulus bill passed under President Barack Obama in 2009 and the soon-to-expire tax cuts passed under George W. Bush in 2001. During the Sep. 12, 2010, edition of This Week with Christiane Amanpour, conservative columnist George Will compared their relative pricetags. "The president says we can't afford the tax cuts for the wealthy because that would add $700 billion to the deficit over 10 years, which is to say, over 10 years it would add less to the deficit than Obama added with the stimulus in one year," Will said. We decided to see if he's right. First, we'll look at whether the upper-income tax cuts cost $700 billion over 10 years, as Will said. The president's fiscal year 2011 budget categorizes three tax provisions as being targeted to upper-income Americans: expanding the 28 percent bracket and reinstating the 36 percent and 39.6 percent bracket; reinstating the personal exemption phaseout and limitation on itemized deductions for taxpayers with income over $250,000 (for married couples) and $200,000 (for single taxpayers); and imposing a 20 percent capital gains and dividend tax rate for those above those income thresholds. According to the president's budget, ending these three tax breaks would reduce the deficit by more than $678 billion over 10 years. So the reverse -- continuing them -- should cost the government about $678 billion over the same time period. While other calculations have included other factors, we think it's reasonable for Will to use this figure from the president's own budget. And while Will is off a bit on the numbers -- saying $700 billion instead of the actual $678 billion -- the difference between the two figures doesn't undermine the comparison he's trying to make. So let's call this part of the statement accurate. Now, how does the stimulus compare? The updated total cost, as determined by the Congressional Budget Office in August 2010, is $814 billion. (That's up from the initial estimate of $787 billion at the time the bill was passed.) So Will's in the clear? Not really. Just as the upper-income tax cuts are being charged against the budget over several years, so too is the stimulus, as different funding streams are spent and tax breaks exercised. The same CBO report attributed $180 billion in new spending and foregone tax revenues to the 2009 budget, followed by $392 billion in fiscal year 2010 and a cumulative $242 billion over the course of fiscal years 2011 to 2019. The report does not provide updated yearly breakdowns for the period 2011 to 2019, but CBO's analysis at the time the bill was passed showed that the measure would increase the deficit in each year between 2009 and 2015, before reducing the deficit starting in 2016. So it's clear that the funds authorized by the law are not being charged in one year, as Will said, but rather over several years. When we ran this by Will's camp, they e-mailed back that "you have a good point." A final note: Some of our sources noted another difference that undermines the comparability between the tax cuts and the stimulus. The stimulus, whatever one thinks of it, is a one-time charge to the budget. By contrast, the upper-income tax cuts -- at least if most Republicans had their way -- would be permanent, and thus a continuing cost in perpetuity. Because the stimulus is temporary, it adds "only a small amount of interest on the debt in the long run, while permanent extension of the upper-income tax cuts would add a significant amount to the long-term fiscal problem," said James R. Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Ultimately, we feel that Will had a point worth making -- that the 10-year cost of the upper-income tax cuts was lower than the total cost of the stimulus. But he overplayed his hand by suggesting that Obama obligated more in one year than the tax-cut extensions would cost over 10. Hearing Will's formulation, we think a listener would be led to believe that the stimulus is vastly more expensive than the Bush tax cuts, when in fact it is not. We rate Will's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03986	"When the Affordable Care Act was signed, 17 million American children" had a pre-existing condition and were "uninsurable."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/11/tammy-baldwin/sen-tammy-baldwin-says-obamacare-17-million-kids-h/	In what was called her first major speech since becoming a U.S. senator, Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin praised President Barack Obama’s health care reform law and made a conspicuous claim about the law’s impact on children. The setting was a Jan. 31, 2013, conference in Washington, D.C., sponsored by Families USA, a liberal group that pushed for what Obama himself has come to call "Obamacare." Hailing the 2010 law as a victory "70 years in the making," Baldwin recounted the story about how she had no health insurance coverage as a child because she was raised by her grandparents and had a pre-existing condition. "I got better," Baldwin said, referring to her illness, which she said is similar to spinal meningitis, "and my grandparents looked for an insurance policy that would cover me in the future. But they discovered that, because of my illness, they couldn’t find such a policy. Not from any insurer. Not at any price. "Never mind that I had fully recovered from my illness. I had been branded with the words ‘pre-existing condition.’ My story, of course, isn’t significant because it was unique. In fact, it’s significant because it wasn’t unique. When the Affordable Care Act was signed, 17 million American children wore that same brand. ‘Pre-existing condition.’ Uninsurable." When Obamacare became law, 17 million children were impossible to insure because they had a pre-existing health condition? Baldwin’s evidence Baldwin’s staff cited two pieces of evidence to back her claim. One is a White House fact sheet that says that as a result of the Affordable Care Act, "more than 17.6 million children with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage." But that’s essentially a restatement of part of Baldwin’s claim -- without any evidence that the figure is correct or that so many children were uninsurable. Baldwin also cited a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services analysis, the same one Obama cited in March 2012 when he said that because of the reform law, "17 million kids can no longer be denied because of a pre-existing condition." PolitiFact National rated his statement Mostly False. The analysis Obama and Baldwin cited focuses on people who could potentially be helped by the law if they found themselves uninsured in the future -- not on those who actually were uninsured and were blocked from getting coverage by pre-existing conditions today. The federal analysis estimated that between 4 million and 17 million children have some type of pre-existing condition -- which means that like Obama, Baldwin cherry picked by citing the high end of that range. The higher figure also includes cases in which the child isn’t actually denied insurance, but in which the family simply has to pay higher premiums. PolitiFact National estimated, based on the analysis, that 160,000 to 1.1 million of the children with a pre-existing condition were uninsured because of the condition. While those are significant numbers, they are far below 17 million. FactCheck.org also faulted Obama’s statement, finding that the 17 million part of the claim was on the high end. The claim also implied "that these children were previously being denied coverage. But that’s not the case," FactCheck.org said. Baldwin went further than Obama, not implying but declaring that 17 million children could not be insured. Our rating Baldwin said: "When the Affordable Care Act was signed, 17 million American children" had a pre-existing condition and were "uninsurable." It’s possible that as many as 17 million children have a pre-existing health condition, but the figure could be as low as 4 million. And only a fraction of children with a pre-existing condition didn’t have insurance because of that condition. We rate Baldwin’s statement False.

pomt-10927	"Congressman (Ron) DeSantis sponsored legislation to increase sales taxes by 23 percent, hurting families, destroying jobs, devastating tourism"	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/jul/27/adam-putnam/misleading-putnam-ad-twists-desantis-stance-taxes/	With just a month left before the Florida primaries, Republican candidate for governor Adam Putnam accused rival Ron DeSantis of backing a massive tax increase that would hurt Florida’s economy. Set to suspenseful bluegrass music, the ad from Putnam’s Florida Grown political committee warns that a DeSantis-backed sales tax hike of 23 percent would touch everything from the market to the beach. "What would a 23 percent sales tax do to Florida’s economy? If Congressman DeSantis had his way, everything would cost 23 percent more — groceries, gas, home purchases," the ad says. "Congressman DeSantis sponsored legislation to increase sales taxes by 23 percent, hurting families, destroying jobs, devastating tourism." DeSantis did support a bill that proposed introducing a 23 percent federal sales tax, but the ad fails to mention an essential component of the plan: all other federal taxes, including income tax, would be eliminated. A brief history of the Fair Tax Act The ad shows a copy of HR 25, a bill known as the Fair Tax Act. A version of the bill has been introduced in Congress 10 times since 1999, earning support from prominent Republicans Mike Pence and Mike Huckabee. In 2013, 2015 and 2017, DeSantis, representing Florida’s 6th District, co-sponsored the bill. The idea behind the Fair Tax Act is to introduce a 23 percent federal sales tax that would replace other federal taxes. The bill eliminates income, estate, payroll and gift taxes, as well as the Internal Revenue Service itself. Supporters of the tax argue that even though purchasing items would be more expensive, consumers would be able to keep more of their income, and therefore have enough purchasing power to maintain the same lifestyle. Businesses would also save money, which would ideally lead to lower prices and more jobs. Libertarian radio host Neal Boortz, who co-wrote "The FairTax Book," responded to Putnam's ad with a tweet: "If you are having trouble understanding the FairTax, perhaps you ought to comment me. I wrote the book." He followed up, "The Adam Putnam campaign is LYING THROUGH ITS TEETH … and they know it." Critics of the bill say that this would be a regressive tax plan, where poor and middle-class families pay more than wealthy households. The sales tax would apply to every purchase, even essentials like food and shelter, which comprise a larger portion of a low-income earner’s budget. There’s a lot of debate about the best-case and doomsday scenarios that could go down were the Fair Tax to become a reality. The bill might, for example, have a major impact on vacation destinations like Florida, which leans on tourism and its state sales tax. According to Jon Hamilton, finance professor at the University of Florida, higher sales prices would incentivize foreign tourists to visit cheaper destinations instead, like Cuba or the Bahamas. Steve Hayes, Americans for Fair Taxation president, says that the Fair Tax might actually cause prices to go down; because businesses would no longer have to pay payroll taxes, they could afford to cut prices overall. Because the ad is so skimpy on details, viewers could guess that DeSantis will push for the changes of the Fair Tax Act to be applied at a state level. Florida’s sales tax is 6 percent. DeSantis has not pushed for this as a candidate for governor. The plan does not appear in DeSantis’s campaign materials. Spokesman David Vasquez said, "The Fair Tax plan is a federal proposal. He’s running on low taxes and limited regulation in Florida." Our ruling The ad said, "Congressman DeSantis sponsored legislation to increase sales taxes by 23 percent." The ad distorts what DeSantis sponsored in a few ways. It completely leaves out that the same plan would have eliminated almost all other federal taxes. And by only mentioning "sales taxes" in the context of Florida’s economy, the ad creates a misleading impression that DeSantis wants the state’s 6 percent sales tax to skyrocket by that amount. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts, leaving voters with the wrong impression. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12760	"If you're in Texas, you have got to drive 120 miles to get an ID."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/24/thomas-perez/texas-drive-120-miles-voter-id/	During a CNN debate among candidates to chair the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez -- a leading candidate who served as secretary of labor and assistant attorney general for civil rights under President Barack Obama -- emphasized the importance of protecting voting rights. Perez cited efforts, typically led by Republicans, to require voters to show state-issued ID cards at the polls. Democrats say such policies suppress the vote. Republicans say they cut down on voter fraud. "I've spent a substantial portion of my life doing these cases at (the) Department of Justice," Perez said at the debate. "Let me give you some facts and figures. We sued Texas, and we won. And we won, because over a 10-year period, 46 million votes were cast -- zero, count them, zero reported incidents of illegal noncitizen voting, two incidents of in-person voter fraud, (out of) 46 million votes cast. If we weren't on television I would call this a word that begins with a B. I will anyway. It's bunk. And you know what, it's bunk in every other case. And if you're in Texas, you have got to drive 120 miles to get an ID. If you're poor, that is a poll tax." This includes a lot of different claims, but we will look at one aspect. Is it true that you have to drive 120 miles to get an acceptable ID in Texas? The short answer: The vast majority of Texans don’t. Residents of its big metropolitan areas like Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin will certainly have a driver's license office much closer than that. However, for a small percentage of the population, the trip could be that far, or even farther. The source of the talking point The statistic comes from testimony against Texas’ voter ID law, which required voters to show certain forms of a government-issued ID. The law, signed in 2011 by then-Gov. Rick Perry, required voters to show a valid government-issued photo ID, such as a Texas driver's license, Department of Public Safety identification card, state concealed handgun license, U.S. military ID or U.S. passport. When the law was under attack, Texas state Sen. Carlos Uresti, a Democrat from San Antonio, testified that some of his constituents would have to drive up to 120 miles to secure a driver’s license, the Houston Chronicle reported. This bit of testimony appears to have been picked up by federal appellate judges in Washington, who ultimately issued a unanimous ruling striking down the law. During oral arguments, U.S. Appeals Court Judge Robert L. Wilkins asked the attorney defending the law for the state whether the law would be a burden on people having to travel more than 100 miles for a driver’s license. "How does that impact your argument?" Wilkins asked. "Isn’t that unduly burdensome?" John Hughes, the attorney for Texas, said rural Texans are used to driving long distances, according to the Washington Post. "People who want to vote already have an ID or can easily get it," he told the judges. But another judge on the panel, David S. Tatel, said, "The record tells us there is a subset of registered voters who lack ID. We have to think about the economic burden and the fact that minorities are disproportionately poor." He, too, cited the 120-mile drive statistic, the Post reported. And the talking point made it into the ruling in which the appeals court struck down the law. That said, the claim deserves some context. Where would someone have to drive that far? Uresti, the Texas state senator, had testified that the drive could be up to 120 miles for some Texans who live between San Antonio and El Paso -- basically, the lightly populated western portion of the state. So that’s where we focused our attention. We found one newspaper reader who contributed some thoughts on the law to the Dallas Morning News. Kirby Warnock, of the Dallas suburb of Oak Cliff, told the paper that he has family in the Big Bend region, a rural area of west Texas along the Rio Grande. "If a person lives in tiny Imperial, or Terlingua, they have to get a friend or family member to drive them 60 miles and 120 miles respectively, round-trip, just to be able to vote," Warnock said. So we looked at the situation in Terlingua. According to the Texas driver’s license handbook, the closest driver’s license office to Terlingua is in Alpine. According to Google Maps, that is 83.4 miles one way, or about 167 miles round trip. That’s an even longer distance than Perez had said. This shows that there’s at least one place in Texas that would require more than a 120-mile round-trip journey. (Imperial, Texas, for the record, is only 30 miles from Fort Stockton, or a 60-mile round trip, as Warnock indicated.) It’s also worth noting that the 9,145 people who live in Brewster County, Texas -- where Terlingua is located -- are 43 percent Hispanic, which is a bit higher than the state average. Considering that there are no driver’s license offices in 81 of the state’s 254 counties, it’s not hard to imagine that there are other locales beyond Terlingua for which a 120-mile round trip would be necessary to secure a driver’s license. How common would such a long trip be? But just because a 120-mile drive is possible in Texas doesn’t mean it’s common. Most of its 27.5 million people live in metropolitan areas. To get a handle on how many people might be impacted by long trips for a driver’s license, we looked at the 81 smallest-population counties in the state. As it turns out, the population of Texas’s 81 least-populated counties is 343,823, or 1.3 percent of the overall state population. And it’s likely that many of them already have a driver’s license. So the 120-mile threshold is a pretty extreme scenario that affects a tiny slice of Texas’ population. That said, it’s still possible that the law would be a burden for thousands of rural residents living far from a Department of Public Safety office. Our ruling Perez said, "If you're in Texas, you have got to drive 120 miles to get an ID." He has some basis for this statement: The 120-mile figure did crop up in the court case against the law, and we found at least one example of a west Texas town for which the distance was actually even longer. However, Perez not only failed to communicate just how rare this scenario is, but he didn’t even use a basic qualifier like "some people in Texas." Taken literally, he said everyone in Texas has to drive 120 miles to get a license. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True. CORRECTION, Feb, 27, 2017, 11 a.m.: After we published this article, several readers noted that there was a closer driver’s license office to Terlingua than Fort Stockton -- the one in Alpine. We have changed the article to reflect this.

pomt-07789	The federal government regulates the holes in Swiss cheese.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/21/lynn-westmoreland/congressman-calls-out-cheesy-federal-program/	This one smelled cheesy to us. Georgia Congressman Lynn Westmoreland was trying to make a point and brought up a claim that was too tasty to pass up fact-checking. Westmoreland believes the federal government is too heavily involved in regulating American business. The Coweta County Republican offered this up in a Feb. 11 press release after voting for a bill aimed at examining the impact of government regulation on jobs and economic growth. "Over the last two years, the federal government has gotten out of control," he said. "I mean, the government actually regulates how large holes in Swiss cheese can be. That’s just absurd. More government does not mean better government." Does Uncle Sam really regulate the size of the holes in Swiss cheese? Others, like the conservative-leaning Peach Pundit political blog, also wondered about this claim. Were there holes in this story? (Sorry, we couldn’t resist.) The congressman’s office quickly shared a 15-page federal report titled "United States Standards for Grades of Swiss Cheese, Emmentaler Cheese." Emmentaler is a form of cheese. The report refers to the holes in Swiss cheese as the "eyes." On Page 3, the report says the eyes "shall" be ⅜ to 13/16 inch in diameter. Sounds like regulation to us, Westmoreland’s spokeswoman, Leslie Shedd, told us in a telephone interview. We looked for the big cheese at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to explain all of this to us. USDA spokesman Michael Jarvis was our cheese wiz and offered to help. He said that the federal agency has a voluntary program to examine Swiss cheese in a number of categories, including the size of its eyes. Jarvis said cheese manufacturers pay the federal government to examine their Swiss cheese in order to get rated on the USDA’s grading scale. The grades range from A, which is the best, to C. Manufacturers, Jarvis said, do not have to obtain a USDA rating to sell Swiss cheese. He said the practice is similar to countless foods, such as eggs, fruit or even chicken wings. "This is a voluntary program for Swiss cheese standards, which was created at the request of cheese makers and buyers that is paid for by industry, not government," Jarvis said. For the curious cheese lovers, an A grade goes to Swiss that is white to light yellow, smooth, round and firm, with oval-shaped eyes and has just the slightest degree of mold. The cheese industry paid the USDA about $11,000 to grade 3,905,923 pounds of all forms of cheese in 2010, Jarvis said. It invoices the industry for all grading costs, Jarvis said. The USDA could not provide a cost breakdown for grading Swiss cheese. The holes in Swiss cheese come from the microbes or bacteria that are added to the milk that is used to make the product. The bacteria give Swiss cheese much of its distinct flavor, while the carbon dioxide in the cheese creates bubbles that result in the holes that make this food distinct. Shedd, the Westmoreland spokeswoman, defended her boss’s point with several news articles that used the word "regulation" to describe the Swiss cheese grading system. Some of the reports noted the USDA’s argument that it is voluntary. One incorrectly reported that the grading is at taxpayer expense. "While, yes, the company can continue to make Swiss cheese without complying with these specific regulations, failure to garner that USDA seal will absolutely affect their ability to have success," she said. "If you were given the option of two kinds of Swiss cheese and one had the USDA approval and one didn’t, more likely than not, you would select the one with the approval because you would assume that it’s better." The effort by the cheese industry to create Swiss cheese standards dates back to the mid-1940s, said Jarvis, the USDA spokesman. The rules -- including hole, er, eye size -- were last changed in 2001 at the request of the cheese industry, according to an ABC News article provided by Westmoreland’s office. We understand the larger point Congressman Westmoreland was trying to make. His staff recently found the 15-page document about Swiss cheese and thought it was a classic example of government overreach. However, the congressman’s statement gives an impression about Swiss cheese grading that does not completely convey how this works. The Swiss cheese grading is done by the federal government. But this is regulation the cheese industry seeks -- not regulation foisted upon them. We rate the congressman’s claim as Half True.

pomt-06142	"The fact is, over 2.4 million jobs have been lost since the 'Stimulus' bill was signed into law in February of 2009."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/dec/21/steve-southerland/rep-steve-southerland-says-over-24-million-jobs-ha/	U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland's office recently sent direct mail to constituents with a multiple-choice survey, telling them: "Make your voice heard in Washington." The mailer also offered a snapshot of the Panama City Republican's priorities: Create jobs. Lower taxes. Cut government spending. In a note on the back, Southerland explained how those ideas fit together. He begins: "Dear Neighbor, The fact is, over 2.4 million jobs have been lost since the 'Stimulus' bill was signed into law in February of 2009." So, more government spending, fewer jobs. One of those neighbors sent us the mailer, asking us to check the facts. The message Here's Southerland's whole message, under the headline "Listening to you. Working for you." Dear Neighbor, The fact is, over 2.4 million jobs have been lost since the "Stimulus" bill was signed into law in February of 2009. Over 15,800 construction, manufacturing, and retail jobs were lost during August 2011 and overall our country continues to face a 9.1 percent unemployment rate. Higher taxes, record spending, and bigger government have failed to create jobs or boost economic growth. As Congress debates the next steps we must take toward job creation and economic growth, I invite you to fill out the attached questionnaire. Your concerns are of utmost importance to me, and your feedback and suggestions will be the driving force behind my work as your Representative in Congress. Sincerely, Rep. Steve Southerland The jobs The 2.4 million jobs lost figure Southerland cited comes from employment data kept by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Southerland calculated the net change in jobs between February 2009 and August 2011. (We should note that the bureau did revise its estimate down to 2.3 million from 2.4 million.) Also of note: If Southerland included jobs numbers through October 2011 -- which he could have done and still got his mailer out on time -- the net jobs figure would be different. Measuring from February 2009 to October 2011, the net reduction is 1.98 million jobs. That's 18 percent fewer jobs lost since February 2009 than the August number Southerland's mailer used. Still, it's right in thrust — the country has around 2 million fewer jobs since February two years ago. And Southerland's full statement did include a reference to "August 2011," which provides readers additional context. The stimulus If the statement had been, "The fact is, over 2.4 million jobs have been lost since February of 2009," we would be done. Southerland used mainstream stats correctly, even if they were a few months old. But it also included this phrase: "since the 'Stimulus' bill was signed into law." At PolitiFact, when we evaluate statistical claims, we also examine the underlying point. Often, the claim implies blame. The claims have two parts: Were the numbers right? And: Was the politician to blame? Southerland's claim implies the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 didn't help job creation. Later, he explains: "Higher taxes, record spending, and bigger government have failed to create jobs or boost economic growth." What does the evidence say? The most recent report from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, released in July, estimates the Recovery Act "raised employment by 2.4 to 3.6 million jobs relative to what it otherwise would have been." Don't trust White House advisers to evaluate the president's policies? It's not just their handiwork. The March report cited four independent analyses by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and three by private economic analysis companies, IHS/Global Insight, Macroeconomic Advisers and Moody's Economy.com. Estimates ranged from 1.3 million to 2.45 million jobs created or saved. In November, the Congressional Budget Office released the most recent report, estimating that in the third quarter of 2011, Recovery Act policies: • Raised real gross domestic product by between 0.3 percent and 1.9 percent. • Lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.2 percentage points and 1.3 percentage points. • Increased the number of people employed by between 0.4 million and 2.4 million. • Increased the number of full-time-equivalent jobs by 0.5 million to 3.3 million. (Increases in FTE jobs include shifts from part-time to full-time work or overtime and are thus generally larger than increases in the number of employed workers.) So, since the stimulus bill passed through August 2011, 2.4 million jobs were lost. But without it, 2.8 million to 4.8 million people might be out of work, according to the nonpartisan CBO and private economic analysts. Our ruling Southerland's mailer accurately cites government employment data when it says that since February 2009, 2.4 million jobs have been lost. But it misleads when it says those jobs were lost "since the 'Stimulus' bill was signed into law" — even saying later that the approach "failed to create jobs." The reality is that government and independent economic analysts say policies in the Recovery Act salvaged half a million to 2.4 million jobs. Southerland can argue the stimulus wasn't worth what it cost, but it's inaccurate to say it didn't do anything for the economy. On balance, we find his claim Half True.

pomt-15219	Says Jill McCabe "supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2015/aug/10/dick-black/black-says-jill-mccabe-backs-selling-fetal-parts-p/	Undercover videos in which Planned Parenthood officials discuss harvesting fetal tissue appall state Sen. Dick Black, R-Loudoun. A staunch opponent of abortion, Black is seeking to link the controversy to his Democratic opponent this fall, Jill McCabe, a pediatric emergency room physician. McCabe "supports selling late term abortions for bigger body parts," Black tweeted on July 28. He renewed the charge on Aug. 4, tweeting that McCabe "supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable." So we decided to examine Black’s charge. Let’s start with some background. The controversy over fetal parts erupted last month when the Center for Medical Progress, a conservative group that opposes abortion, released a nine-minute video secretly taped during a 2014 lunch with Deborah Nucatola, Planned Parenthood’s senior director of medical services. The center says the tape shows Nucatola talking about performing partial-birth abortions to keep body parts intact in order to "sell" them. The video put Planned Parenthood on the defensive and ignited Republican calls to end federal funding for the group and for investigations into its practices. Planned Parenthood provides a wide array of health services to women -- 97 percent of which are not related to abortions. The organization has denounced the secret taping as a misleading campaign by anti-abortion activists. Officials of the group say fetal tissues are integral to medical research and that the organization does not profit from their sale. Allegations by Black and others that profits were made raise legal questions. Federal law bars clinics from selling fetal tissue for gain. It’s legal, however, for clinics to donate the tissue for scientific research and receive reimbursement for their "reasonable" costs in providing the tissue. Cecile Richards, CEO of Planned Parenthood, has said the organization’s clinics don’t sell fetal tissue for profit but do provide it for research and are reimbursed for their collection costs. In the video, Nucatola discusses fees of $30 to $100 per specimen provided. Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, told PolitiFact National that the fees Nucatola discusses don’t appear geared to making a profit. Many of the sales are made to brokers -- middlemen who process the tissue and then sell it to researchers at significant markups. A vial of highly concentrated fetal liver cells, for example, can sell for about $24,000. The brokers say their prices reflect their high costs of buying medical equipment and employing skilled technicians. Now, let’s get back to Black’s claim that McCabe supports selling fetal tissue for profit. Chris Lore, Black’s legislative assistant, told us the senator’s statement isn’t based on any statement from McCabe explicitly supporting the practice. Instead, Lore said, it’s implicit by the support she’s received from Planned Parenthood.The group has endorsed McCabe and has given her a 100 percent rating. Lore also noted McCabe has been endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia. In addition to those endorsements, Lore noted that amid the controversy, McCabe was quoted in a newspaper saying she still supports Planned Parenthood. "You take those two facts into consideration and it seems her position is pretty clear," Lore said. Lore forwarded a copy of a Loudoun Times-Mirror story in which McCabe was asked about whether she still welcomed Planned Parenthood’s support in the wake of the controversy. "I'm a doctor, and I take care of patients, including women," McCabe was quoted as saying. "Women need health care choices and Planned Parenthood provides that. That's kind of the end of it for me." We contacted Lore a second time for more information. After we spoke with him, Black posted this message on Twitter: "PolitiFact is desperate to give cover to @DrJillMcCabe to give cover for supporting late term abortions. #MediaLies #PPSellsBabyParts." We also reached out to McCabe to see what her position was on late term abortions and selling tissue for a profit. We heard back from Kyle Sutton, her campaign manager. "Jill McCabe does not support late term abortions, but as a doctor she does understand that there are unfortunately circumstances where a pregnancy proceeding to full-term is not in the best health interest of either a mother, or child," Sutton wrote in an email. What about selling fetal tissue for profit? "Jill does not support selling fetal tissue for profit, the same way she does not support any illegal activities, because they're illegal," Sutton wrote. We also asked McCabe if she supports Planned Parenthood providing tissue for research at cost, without a profit. "As a doctor, Jill McCabe understands life-saving medical research," her campaign manager wrote in an email. In an Aug. 1 story in the Washington Post story said McCabe said she had seen the Planned Parenthood videos and found them "concerning." But the newspaper also quoted her saying that "Planned Parenthood is an important organization that provides vital services." Our ruling Sen. Dick Black says McCabe, "supports late term abortions. Larger baby parts are more profitable." McCabe indicates she supports late term abortions in instances when it is "in the best health interest" of the mother or child. She says she opposes the sale of fetal tissue for profit. Black links McCabe’s qualified support for late term abortions to what he says is an effort to profit from the sale of "large baby parts." In effect, he’s accusing his opponent of supporting an illegal practice because U.S. law bans the sale of fetal tissue for profit. It’s incumbent of Black to prove his inflammatory claim and he offers nothing but speculation. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-00795	Says Indiana Gov. Mike Pence "provides zero state funding for homeless shelters."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/06/us-uncut/advocacy-group-compares-gov-pence-jesus-unfavorabl/	Indiana’s Religious Freedom law quickly turned into a political and economic minefield for Republican Gov. Mike Pence. One activist group, US Uncut, took the moment to cast Pence as a man who defended religion while acting in ways that fell short of Christian charity. It posted this image on its Facebook page, which has since been shared nearly 70,000 times, comparing Pence to Jesus: We wanted to look at the claim that Pence provided "zero state funding for homeless shelters." The 2014 Indiana homeless population was 5,971, according to the state’s annual census. Of that population, officials counted 5,568 living in emergency shelters while 403 were found living on the street. Overall, the homeless count was down 12 percent from 2013, officials said. We looked at Pence’s most recent budget and found no money for emergency shelters. Under the line item for homelessness prevention, Pence requested zero dollars in both years of the biennial budget. There is $1.17 million in homeless assistance grants, but those are federal dollars. They come from the McKinney-Vento program administered through the Housing and Urban Development Department. There is also $1 million in mental health services for the homeless, but those too come from Washington. "There has never been state funding directly for homeless shelters or programs," said Brad Meadows, communications director for the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority. Meadows added that towns and cities have the option to spend local money to care for the homeless. However, that would still not be state dollars. Barb Anderson is director of Haven House, a homeless shelter in Jeffersonville, Ind., and a long-time homeless advocate. "We’ve tried to get state funding for shelters for over 25 years," Anderson told PunditFact. "We’ve stayed open, but no one’s taken a salary in four years." So Pence has not requested funding homeless shelters, but it’s worth noting that’s far from unique in Indiana. The state budget ultimately is the work product of the Legislature, not the governor. And the lack of state funding has been consistent under Republican and Democratic leadership. (Indiana had Democratic governors from 1989-2005, before electing Republican Mitch Daniels and then Pence.) Michael Stoops, director of community organizing with the advocacy group National Coalition for the Homeless, told PunditFact that Indiana follows the pattern of many rural and southern states. "They are getting federal homeless dollars and passing them through to the cities and counties," Stoops said. "They don’t spend any of their own money." We contacted staff at Indiana University’s Public Policy Institute and the Indianapolis Coalition for Homelessness Intervention and Prevention, and they, too, could not identify any state money going toward emergency shelters. Indiana’s State Homeless Planning Council says on its webpage that the priority is on "systematically preventing and ending homelessness for those most vulnerable in our communities." The Council writes, "Merely managing homelessness is in no one's best interest." Stoops said many states do put their tax dollars into emergency shelters. That list includes, Colorado, Ohio, Oregon and Florida. "Florida has been doing this since 1989," Stoops said. Our ruling The activist group US Uncut said Gov. Mike Pence provided zero state funding for homeless shelters. While the state budget and summaries from the experts and staffers we contacted confirmed that, it’s really an approach of the Indiana state government more than that of any particular person. Advocates say the state has never funded homeless shelters, a de facto policy that includes the consent of both the Legislature and former Democratic governors. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-13948	"Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world."	true	/global-news/statements/2016/jun/17/david-beckham/david-beckham-says-swaziland-has-worlds-highest-ra/	British soccer star (or footballer if you prefer) David Beckham is a long-time goodwill ambassador for UNICEF. For a decade, he has lent his presence and fame to help the United Nations agency in its work with children around the world. A video posted on Facebook showed Beckham’s visit to Swaziland, a landlocked nation on the border between South Africa and Mozambique that has just over 1 million people. In the video, which has been viewed more than 1.3 million times, Beckham said "Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world." That statistic checks out. Here’s the research behind it. There are two ways to talk about the reach of HIV/AIDS (or any disease for that matter). There’s prevalence, which tells you the fraction of people who are infected with the virus at any particular time. And there’s incidence, which tells you how many new people get infected in a given year. Swaziland tops the rankings for both. UNAIDS, the United Nations group focused on HIV/AIDS, reports that last year, HIV prevalence among adults 15-49 in Swaziland was 28.8 percent of the population -- more than 1 out of 4. The incidence rate was 2.36 per 100 person-years. These charts, drawn from UNAIDS data, back up Beckham’s claim. The CIA World Factbook has the same rankings, although the actual numbers vary a bit. A survey published in 2012 by the Swaziland Ministry of Health found slightly higher rates -- 31 percent prevalence and 2.4 percent incidence -- but that would certainly leave the ranking unchanged. Why so high? Kate Grabowski and Ronald Gray at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told us that a constellation of factors led to what Gray called "an unmitigated disaster" in Swaziland. Researchers debate the relative importance of certain drivers, but a lack of HIV treatment and prevention, as well as migration patterns and social structures all likely play a role. In Swaziland, there are "very high rates of polygamy," Gray said, plus many men work as miners in South Africa and Botswana where prostitution is common. That could explain the high rate, but as far as Swaziland’s top rank among nations, that might have more to do with its small size. Grabowski noted that in some ways, Swaziland resembles other HIV hot spots. "There are other communities that are not necessarily countries which also have high HIV prevalence," Grabowski said. "Unfortunately Swaziland gets highlighted because it happens to be one of those places and it is also a country." Our ruling Beckham said that Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV in the world. Official numbers back that up. Whether you look at how many people are infected with HIV at any moment, or how many new infections emerge in a year, Swaziland is worse off than any other nation. We rate this claim True.	None	David Beckham	None	None	None	2016-06-17T16:00:00	2016-06-10	['None']
pomt-03191	"Every year, more than $40 million are leaving Missouri for the Lone Star State."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/aug/30/rick-perry/dollars-dont-walk-perry-claim-about-missouri-roote/	Do dollars slip from state to state? Texas Gov. Rick Perry suggested as much in a radio ad aired in Missouri as he framed his case for businesses there to slip away to Texas. In the ad, posted online Aug. 21, 2013, Perry said: "Every year, more than $40 million are leaving Missouri for the Lone Star State." (He failed to say, "'Show Me' the money.") To our inquiry, Perry spokesman Josh Havens said the $40 million traces to an online application created by Travis H. Brown, CEO of a St. Louis public affairs and advocacy firm and author of the 2013 book,"How Money Walks." Havens said clicking on Missouri on the app shows that between 1992 and 2010, more than $791 million "was lost to the state of Texas. That equates to more than $40 million each year." We confirmed his figures on the "Wealth Migration" app, which indicates that Missouri lost an average of $1.38 billion in adjusted gross income from 1992 through 2010--with the net loss to Texas alone totaling $791.3 million. As defined by the Internal Revenue Service, adjusted gross income is a person’s gross income minus adjustments. "For most people," according to the app, adjusted gross income "is the starting point in calculating their taxable income" for federal tax purposes. At a glance, then, Perry's math seems to work. But is it accurate to say all those dollars annually leave Missouri for Texas? We failed to connect with Brown, but an analyst with the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation, which researches state and federal tax policy, told us the IRS annually makes available its data tallying changes in adjusted gross income across the country and state to state--also taking into account how many taxpayers have moved from one state to another since the previous year’s filings. For instance, the foundation’s Nick Kasprak said by phone, if a taxpayer in Missouri had adjusted gross income of $30,000 one year and then the next year filed a return from Texas showing $65,000 in such income, the IRS would record that as $30,000 moving to Texas--basing that on the adjusted gross income reported in Missouri in the first tax year. A foundation web page breaks down such IRS data for 1993 through 2010, the latest year of available data. Adjusted for inflation, according to the foundation, Texas netted $862 million in adjusted gross income from Missouri over the 17 years, or nearly $51 million a year on average. By email, Kasprak told us the net difference in raw dollars over the 17 years was $710 million, or an annual average of $42 million. This net shift in Texas’s favor exceeded $40 million in 11 of the 17 years, including every year from 2006 through 2010, as shown on a chart we generated. The year 2005 was the latest one in which there was less than a $40 million difference, according to the chart. The low point: In 2001, the difference was less than $7.4 million. Source: Web interactive, "State to State Migration Data," the Tax Foundation (accessed Aug. 29, 2013) Per Perry’s statement, Kasprak said it would be helpful to clarify that the cited adjusted gross income figures refer to how much money was made by residents of Texas in their previous year living in Missouri. That is not the same, he said, as saying that those exact earnings moved to Texas. "It’s not as if these people are literally carrying sacks of money over the border," Kasprak said. "The only thing that is literally true is that if you add up all income of people who moved from Missouri to Texas versus people who moved from Texas to Missouri, this is the net difference" in the tax year prior to their moves. Another expert, Art Hall, director of the Center for Applied Economics at the University of Kansas, agreed by phone that Perry’s statement reflects only what individuals earned in the state they departed, either Missouri or Texas. "We don’t know if they got a wage increase or wage cut when they moved to Texas or vice versa," Hall said. Regardless, Hall said he considers Perry’s statement in line with the IRS data as adjusted for inflation by the foundation. Our ruling Perry said: "Every year, more than $40 million are leaving Missouri for the Lone Star State." That assessment ties to IRS data on adjusted gross income for 1992 through 2010, but the results are more complex and admittedly clunky than this claim acknowledges. That is, Missouri residents who moved to Texas through those years earned more the year before they moved than all income-tax-filing Texas residents who moved to Missouri in those years. Still, adjusted for inflation, the annual difference averages about $50 million--more than Perry’s unadjusted figure. Then again, this did not hold for every year. In six years--most recently 2005--there was less than a $40 million difference.

pomt-06065	When Georgia tightened its voter identification laws, the state sent a van and photographer to the homes of people who needed photo IDs and made them for free.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/10/phil-gingrey/gingrey-voter-id-van-made-house-calls/	More states are adopting laws that require voters to show photo IDs at the polls, and the Obama administration is crying foul. The U.S. Department of Justice recently announced that it’s challenging a South Carolina photo ID requirement because it discriminates against minorities and the poor. Supporters say the new rules prevent fraud. As the debate intensifies, all sides are turning their attention to one of the first states to say paper identification isn’t enough: Georgia. U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey, a Marietta Republican, said in a recent article on the Fox News website that when the state passed its new rules in the mid-2000s, the state bent over backward to see that it disenfranchised no one. After the state tightened the voter ID laws, it told people, "Look, we will literally send a van and a photographer to the home of anybody that can say they can't get a picture made and a photo ID and we will do it ... at the state's cost and the taxpayer cost and not at the individual cost," Gingrey said in the Dec. 28 article. This was news to us. Since when did bureaucrats make house calls? We asked Gingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber, who told us about the Department of Driver Services’ Georgia Licensing on Wheels, otherwise known as the GLOW bus. Starting September 2005, an aging Blue Bird lumbered across Georgia making voter IDs. The poor got theirs for free. The rest paid $5. The rug was the color of oatmeal, a media report said. A bench was upholstered in vinyl. It was a bit of a junker. Leaky hoses forced the rescheduling of stops in rural Pulaski and Wilcox counties, according to an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. A bad alternator pushed back a visit to Statesboro. A battery problem made the GLOW bus late for a Cherokee County appearance. And the bus service wasn’t nearly as convenient as Gingrey said. It did not go to individual homes. Instead, it stopped at gathering places such as the Augusta-Richmond County Civic Center and the Talbot County Courthouse west of Macon, according to a 2005 schedule. "Appointments cannot be made for individuals," said a 2005 Department of Driver Services press release announcing the service. Still, it was the big bus that could. News accounts said the GLOW bus had the capacity to make as many as 200 cards a day. Yet for the most part, it was the big bus that didn’t. Between Aug. 30 and Oct. 1, 2005, the GLOW bus issued 22 voter IDs, according to Department of Driver Services figures. Today, there are 559 active voter cards statewide that were issued through the department. The bus service was ultimately canceled. Supporters and foes of Georgia’s voter ID law debated why the GLOW bus was such a dud. Then-Gov. Sonny Perdue argued the numbers were proof there was no need for it. Others said the service wasn’t well advertised, or that a single bus couldn’t handle the needs of a large state. Helen Butler, executive director of the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, a civil rights group, told PolitiFact Georgia that the bus didn’t solve the cost problem. While a voter ID card is free, getting the documentation to obtain one isn’t. It can cost $30 for a birth certificate, she said. So yes, the GLOW bus existed. It made voter IDs for free. But the state did not "literally send a van and a photographer to the home of anybody that can say they can't get a picture made and a photo ID," as Gingrey said The GLOW bus didn’t do house calls. It might have made getting a voter ID more convenient. And the fact that few used the bus might bolster Gingrey’s argument that people who want the IDs don’t need help. But this is a far cry from door-to-door service. A wheelchair-bound senior with no car could not apply for an ID from her living room couch, as Gingrey’s claim suggested. A civic group would have to request the van travel to a nearby civic center or courthouse, and an individual would have to trek there to get one. Gingrey’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Gingrey earns a Mostly False.

pomt-01343	Says Charlie Crist could have expanded Medicaid after the health care law passed but didn't.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/22/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-charlie-crist-could-have-expanded-/	To hear Gov. Rick Scott and Charlie Crist tell it, the 2014 gubernatorial campaign isn’t about policy positions, but more about which candidate did less as governor. Take the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion. No, really, someone should take it, because neither governor did. Now each is berating the other for it. "He will not lift a finger to get Medicaid expansion done," Crist said during Tuesday’s CNN debate in Jacksonville. He said Floridians are suffering from the resultant lack of medical care, plus the loss of jobs the expansion has been predicted to bring. Scott answered by first accusing Crist of running up the state’s debt. "And then you want to talk about Medicaid," he said. "You were governor when it passed. Why didn't you get it passed right then? Why didn't you expand it right then?" Say, why didn’t he expand it right then? Could Crist have even done anything about the Medicaid expansion while he was in office? We decided to look into the assertion and find out. How a bill contains a flaw One of the original provisions in President Barack Obama’s signature health care law was to expand Medicaid, the joint federal and state program to cover the poorest of the uninsured. The new Medicaid guidelines covered everyone up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. In Florida, this would have amounted to between 800,000 and 1 million residents getting coverage. The federal government would have paid 100 percent of the costs for the first three years starting in 2014, gradually decreasing to 90 percent by 2020. To get the funds for this expansion, the Affordable Care Act presented states an all-or-nothing proposition: Change state law to cover every eligible resident and get the expansion money, or refuse to comply and lose all federal money for Medicaid. That isn't just the expansion money, that's every dollar for a state's Medicaid program -- billions of dollars every year -- a move critics immediately decried as overwhelmingly punitive. Crist was in the final year of his term in office, prepping for an ill-fated Senate run, when Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010. Florida joined Virginia and a dozen other states in suing the federal government the same day, insisting Washington couldn’t force citizens to buy insurance and protesting the terms of the Medicaid expansion. Elements of the law were slated to take effect in stages (the Medicaid expansion wouldn't take effect for more than three and a half years, until 2014), so many states waited to see what happened with the lawsuit. What’s a governor to do? The Republican-controlled Legislature had already started its 60-day law-making session, so it’s possible Crist could have pushed for compliance with the law then. But considering legislators begin work on bills in the September prior to a session, and given how unpopular the new law was to begin with, this was a pretty unlikely scenario. Also, the state of Florida only creates budgets one year at a time, and too much of the law's specifics were up in the air to be fully addressed in 2010. "I think it would have been difficult, but perhaps not impossible, for Charlie to have moved on the Medicaid expansion, because components of the law were very uncertain with the ACA at that point in his term," Kevin Walsh, assistant political science professor at Broward College, told PolitiFact Florida. The Scott campaign told us Crist could have addressed expansion in a special session. But that's impractical. There was no rush to implement an expansion of Medicaid -- remember, it wouldn't start until 2014 -- and there was little to no chance Republican lawmakers would agree to the expansion even if Crist called them back (at a cost of around $45,000 a day). The idea of creating compliant legislation so quickly wasn’t practical either, experts told us. (A special session Crist called that year to debate offshore oil drilling was ended on a GOP party line vote after 49 minutes.) "Technically, Scott is correct," said Gail Wilensky, senior fellow for the Center for Health Affairs at Project HOPE. "However, since the benefit wasn't going into effect for a couple of years, there wasn't an obvious need to pass legislation immediately." The U.S. Supreme Court eventually ruled on June 28, 2012, that while the federal government could compel people to buy health insurance, it couldn’t threaten to withhold Medicaid money for refusing to comply. That made the expansion a choice for each state. By then, Scott was in office. Most states -- even those that overwhelmingly supported expanding Medicaid -- waited until the Supreme Court decision was final to formally expand their Medicaid programs through legislation. Before this year’s campaign, Crist said little on the Medicaid expansion. In March 2010, he said he was against the Affordable Care Act and favored repeal. In July 2010, he waffled back and forth on repeal but still wanted it modified. And within two hours on Aug. 27, he said both he would have voted for the bill and against it. For the record, Crist now says he is for it. Scott, an opponent of the Affordable Care Act, initially was against the Medicaid provisions, largely because of concerns about added costs for state taxpayers (that 10 percent we mentioned). In 2013 he had a change of heart, but still did not push the Legislature to enact a law for more Medicaid coverage. To this day, Florida has refused the expansion. Crist has floated the idea that he could issue an executive order if elected, in the same vein as Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich. Kasich signed an executive order last year expanding the program, using an obscure government entity called the controlling board. Florida doesn’t have one of those, so it’s unclear if Crist could take similar action. Scott certainly doesn’t think so. "An expansion of Medicaid could not be accomplished on a whim from the executive office," Scott said in October. "It requires legislative action." Our ruling Scott said Charlie Crist could have expanded Medicaid after the health care law passed but didn't. Experts we talked to said that was possible, with an assist from the Legislature, but not at all likely. The law was too new for legislation to be passed during the 2010 legislative session. Even if Crist had wanted lawmakers to discuss it, they would have been hostile to the idea. The state was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the government, and there was no urgency to enact such sweeping change. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-02463	"There are 4.7 percent of Virginians who are minimum wage earners who are over 25 years of age working full-time and trying to raise a family."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/feb/24/mark-obenshain/obenshain-says-few-minimum-wage-earners-virginia-a/	During a recent floor debate, state Sen. Mark Obenshain disputed contentions that raising the minimum wage would ease plight for many poor families. Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, said the recipients of Virginia’s minimum wage of $7.25 an hour are mostly young, single workers. "There are 4.7 percent of Virginians who are minimum wage earners who are over 25 years of age working full-time and trying to raise a family," he said during the Feb. 11 floor debate on a bill that would have raised the wage over two years to $9.25 an hour. The measure passed the Democratic-controlled Senate but died in the Republican-led House, where opponents said raising the wage would force employers to cut jobs. Even so, we were interested in Obenshain’s statistic on minimum wage earners raising families and looked into it. We contacted Jared Walczak, Obenshain’s legislative assistant, and he said there was an error. Obenshain mischaracterized an estimate from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that has nothing to do with the percentage of Virginians raising families on the minimum wage. What the BLS figure tells us is that 4.7 percent of all U.S. hourly wage earners in 2012 were paid at or below the minimum wage. Of an estimated 75.3 million hourly earners, almost 3.6 million received bottom-line pay or less. The agency does not keep track of how many of these earners are raising families. What can we learn about Virginia minimum wage workers? Not much. BLS figures only tell us that an estimated 6.8 percent of hourly workers in the Old Dominion were paid the minimum wage or less. That’s the sixth highest percentage among states, trailing from the top Idaho, Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas. In raw numbers, the BLS estimates 1.8 million Virginians were hourly earners in 2012 and, of them, 123,000 were paid the minimum wage or less. The agency cautions that its estimates may have a large margin of error due to small sampling sizes in some states, particularly small ones. For that reason, it says the estimates of low earners should not be compared to other BLS tables detailing overall employment numbers in each state. Despite Obenshain’s botched explanation of the data, evidence strongly supports the senator’s overall point that minimum wage earners raising families are a small part of Virginia’s workforce. The BLS spreadsheets estimate that roughly half of the people earning minimum wage or less in the U.S. are 25 or older. If that trend applies to Virginia, it would mean about 3.4 percent of hourly workers are minimum wage earners are older than 25. That percentage would drop if the low earners not raising families could be weeded out. Our rating Obenshain said 4.7 percent of Virginians are minimum wage earners older than 25 raising families. The senator’s office acknowledges he garbled a statistic. In fact, no data is kept on the class of people to which Obenshain referred. Obenshain’s overarching point must be considered, however. He was speaking against raising the minimum wage, arguing that the increase would threaten jobs while improving the lot of only a few working families. Our analysis of data that is available strongly suggests that the percentage of Virginia workers supporting families on the minimum wage might be even lower than what Obenshain mistakenly said. So Obenshain stumbled into a credible conclusion. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Mark Obenshain	None	None	None	2014-02-24T00:00:00	2014-02-11	['None']

pomt-00280	Says Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to "allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycare facilities."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/01/congressional-leadership-fund/did-paul-davis-vote-allow-strip-clubs-open-nears-h/	A new ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to protect the GOP Majority in the U.S. House, attacks a Kansas congressional hopeful for an incident at a strip club 20 years ago. You bet we wanted to see if the facts here stood up to scrutiny. Democrat Paul Davis is locked in a competitive race with Republican Steve Watkins in Kansas’ 2nd Congressional District, a seat that includes Topeka, Lawrence and the communities west of Kansas City. The ad targets Davis for his alleged involvement in a 1998 strip club drug raid, where he was found in a dark room with a nearly naked woman. "What’s worse than getting caught at a strip club during a drug bust? Ask Paul Davis." The ad then claims Davis was found in a VIP room with a woman wearing only a G-string. Then it says, "Even worse, after Davis was caught with a stripper, he voted to allow strip clubs to open near our homes, churches, schools and even daycare facilities. Shady Paul Davis can’t be trusted." Here, we are checking the details surrounding the strip club incident, along with the claim that Davis voted to allow strip clubs to operate near places like schools, homes, churches and daycares. The strip club incident The situation involving Davis and a strip club came to light in September 2014 during his bid for governor, which he lost. According to reports, Davis was getting a lap dance in a back room in the late 1990s when cops raided the club in search of drugs. He was not charged with a crime, but police involved in the raid reported he was found in a "compromising position." Davis said he "was at the wrong place at the wrong time." Independence Police Chief Harry Smith later corroborated Davis’ account that the candidate was not involved in any wrongdoing, or, to his knowledge, the focus of an investigation. He said Davis was questioned briefly before being released. Kelsi Browning, a spokeswoman for Davis’ campaign, told PolitiFact that the ad is based on something that happened 20 years ago when Davis was 26. As a new lawyer, she said, Davis went with his boss to meet an "unsavory client" of the law firm. So what about this vote? The ad refers to HB 2107, or the Community Defense Act, which was a 2011 state bill that would have prohibited strip clubs and other sexually oriented businesses from being established within 1,000 feet of the property line of an existing one as well as any schools, churches, public parks, residences, libraries or daycare centers. The bill would have also required semi-nude dancers to remain at least 6 feet away from their customers and for sexually oriented businesses to remain closed from midnight to 6 a.m. Davis was one of 28 Kansas House members who voted against the bill, which ultimately failed in the Senate. The Davis campaign says that the legislation was a perennial bill that rarely made it out of committee. When it first came up in 2010, Davis actually voted for the bill before it was struck down in the Senate. It came up again in the 2011 session, but this time, he voted against it. Critics of the legislation, which included Davis, argued at the time that regulating these businesses was best left to cities and counties. Some also questioned taking the time to focus on the issue when the state was facing a massive budget deficit. In a Lawrence Journal-World story around the time of the vote, Davis, who was the House minority leader, was quoted saying that the Legislature was "probably intruding in areas where we don’t need to be. We’ve got a lot more important things that we need to be dealing with here." Our ruling The Congressional Leadership Fund ad says that Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycares. The ad is piecing together two unrelated issues to draw an unsavory conclusion, while embellishing parts of the story. Davis did not vote to allow strip clubs to open near schools, churches, daycares and the like. He once voted against a measure that would have banned them from opening near these places. He also once voted for the same proposal. The ad’s claim that he was found in a strip club during a drug raid is accurate, but any suggestion he was connected to the drug raid is misplaced. Overall, this claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-04448	Says his deficit plan "made some adjustments to (Simpson-Bowles), and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/11/barack-obama/obama-says-his-plan-made-some-adjustments-simpson-/	Mitt Romney has accused President Barack Obama of essentially missing the bus on the Simpson-Bowles commission’s recommendations to reduce the deficit. Obama shot back that he is in the driver’s seat -- he simply adjusted that commission’s recommendations for his own version of deficit reduction. Here’s the back and forth from the Oct. 3 debate in Denver: Romney: "Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that." Moderator Jim Lehrer: "Do you support Simpson-Bowles?" Romney: "I have my own plan. It's not the same as Simpson-Bowles. But in my view, the president should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it." Obama: "That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan..." Obama’s answer could leave the impression that his own deficit reduction plan simply made "some adjustments" to Simpson-Bowles, and therefore that commission’s recommendations didn’t languish or die. But is that the truth? In this fact-check, we will explore the differences between the Simpson-Bowles recommendations and Obama’s plan. The Simpson-Bowles plan First, here’s a little history on the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction proposal. (We’ve fact-checked claims about it before.) Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform by executive order in February 2010. It included 18 members, split between Democratic and Republican appointees, who were charged with studying the federal budget, "identifying policies to improve the fiscal situation in the medium term and to achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run." In December 2010, the commission released its final report, which included dozens of proposals to cut discretionary spending, reform the tax code and Social Security and rein in health care costs, among other measures. This proposal was named after the panel’s co-chairs, former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and Erskine Bowles, a Democrat and the former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton. The proposal failed to achieve enough "yes" votes from the 18 members to have the proposal sent to Congress. One of the "no" votes was from Romney’s eventual running mate: U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. The members’ rationales for voting "no" ranged from taxes to Social Security to federal spending -- either too much or too little, depending on the dissent in question. The group’s report shows total deficit reduction between 2012 and 2020 would be about $4 trillion. The panel proposed cuts in discretionary and mandatory spending totaling $2.2 trillion and estimated interest savings of $673 billion. The remainder of the deficit reduction total involves new revenues -- a combination of closing tax loopholes and increasing certain types of taxes and other revenue streams. The new tax revenues work out to $995 billion over that period. Experts cite similarities and differences We sent the Romney-Obama exchange to economists, and they summarized some key similarities and differences between Simpson-Bowles and Obama’s plan. Our experts included: Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense; Howard Gleckman, editor of TaxVox, the fiscal policy blog of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center; Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition; Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; Alan Viard of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and Jason Peuquet and Marc Goldwein, both of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Our experts agreed that Obama and Simpson-Bowles shared a general framework that included both tax increases and spending cuts. But beyond that, whether you agree that Obama made "some adjustments" to Simpson-Bowles depends on your definition of "some adjustments." One of our experts -- Gleckman -- described Obama’s wording here as "legalese" or "Talmudic." Other than the general framework, "these plans have very little common," Gleckman said. Many of our experts cited vast differences between the two plans. Viard, who served on the President’s Council of Economic advisers under President George W. Bush, said, "It’s a little misleading for the president to say he merely made ‘some adjustments’ to Simpson-Bowles." It’s no surprise that an appointed commission would recommend more ambitious reform than someone holding elected office -- the commission had the freedom to do that, Viard said. But "if the president had felt it was in his interest to distinguish the two plans he could have easily justified very sweeping language. He could have said my plan is a lot different ... That would have been more credible," Viard said. Let’s summarize some of those key differences: Amount of deficit reduction: Simpson-Bowles reduces the deficit more than Obama. Simpson-Bowles shows a reduction of $4 trillion by 2020 while Obama shows that same amount by 2022. If we add two years to the Simpson-Bowles plan, the reduction rises to $6.3 trillion. Both plans put public debt on a downward path as a share of the economy later this decade but again, Simpson-Bowles goes further, Peuquet said. Peuquet’s Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has published a detailed analysis comparing the plans that shows the differences. Tax reform: "Simpson-Bowles calls for bold tax reform to dramatically reduce tax rates by cutting tax expenditures," said Goldwein, who was an associate director for the fiscal commission the year it released its report. "Though the president gives a shout out to this concept, his plan actually calls for starting with an increase in individual rates for higher earners; and only modest reductions to tax expenditures." Reductions mentioned in the Simpson-Bowles plan include capping deductions for home mortgage interest and taxing capital gains and dividends at the same rates as earned income. Social Security, Medicare and health care: Obama doesn’t include any changes to Social Security, whereas Simpson-Bowles proposed a comprehensive Social Security reform plan, Goldwein said. Obama’s plan includes savings for Medicare, but not as much as Simpson-Bowles. "There are some areas where Simpson-Bowles pursued structural reform – like totally redesigning Medicare’s cost-sharing structure – but the president’s budget instead focused on changes on the margins," Goldwein said. Spending cuts: Obama includes many specific spending cuts that are similar to those in Simpson-Bowles, but some of those cuts are scaled back, while others were already enacted in 2011, said Van de Water, who worked at the Congressional Budget Office for about two decades. Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense said that overall, Simpson-Bowles "was more aggressive in going after federal program spending and reforms to entitlements. ...Obama’s budget is "evolutionary, Simpson-Bowles is more revolutionary." Gleckman summarized the two plans this way: When looking at the the plans from "50,000 feet, yes, they are similar. When you look at them at even 10,000 feet they are very different. When you look at them on the ground they are entirely different." Obama’s explanation Obama’s campaign sent us a statement: "The president has proposed a balanced approach to deficit reduction that takes a framework consistent with Simpson-Bowles, asking for both spending cuts and additional revenues from the wealthiest and closing corporate loopholes." The campaign also cited some of our earlier fact-checks about Obama’s plan. PolitiFact New Jersey evaluated a claim by Gov. Chris Christie that Obama failed to stand up for the proposed solutions by the Simpson-Bowles Commission. We ruled that claim Mostly False. Obama did not fully embrace the commission’s recommendations at the outset, but outlined some deficit reduction measures similar to those proposed by the commission. Even the commission’s co-chairs said so. "We are encouraged that the president has embraced a balanced, comprehensive approach to deficit reduction similar to that outlined in the Fiscal Commission report," Bowles and Simpson said in a 2011 press release. In 2011, we evaluated John Boehner’s claim that Obama "took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas. Not one. Come on! It’s time to grow up and get serious about the problems that face our country." We ruled that False, concluding the commission’s recommendations were sprinkled throughout Obama’s 2011 budget proposals, in recognizable -- if not always in identical -- form. Is Obama’s plan before Congress? The second part of Obama’s claim about this deficit reduction plan was that: "We're putting it forward before Congress right now." After the president releases his budget, lawmakers introduce resolutions about that budget and took votes rejecting it. Technically his plan is still out there -- he has to submit one every year, and it does exist, but there is no indication that Congress will revisit it. Our ruling Obama said of his deficit plan that he "made some adjustments to (Simpson-Bowles), and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan." Obama has presented plans that share the general framework with Simpson-Bowles, but Simpson-Bowles’ plan is more bold. And while Obama’s plan still exists, we don’t expect the GOP-led Congress to pursue it. There are a lot of caveats to Obama’s claim. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-12731	"Three of the 11 most violent cities in the U.S. are in Missouri — St. Louis, Kansas City, and Springfield."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/mar/03/eric-greitens/greitens-takes-crime-statistics-out-context/	The FBI releases its Uniform Crime Report every year. And every year politicians, news outlets and pundits use it to rank cities by their rate of violence, despite FBI cautions against doing so. This year was no different. In his first State of the State address, Missouri Republican Gov. Eric Greitens used the data to make a point: The state has a crime problem. "Three of the 11 most violent cities in the U.S. are in Missouri — St. Louis, Kansas City and Springfield," Greitens said. "And it’s not just in the cities. When you talk to sheriffs, chiefs of police and front line officers around the state, they’ll tell you it’s getting harder to do police work." We wondered if the statistic was true. Were Missouri’s three largest cities also some of the most violent in the country? The limits of comparing cities Taken at face value, the crime reporting data paints a bleak picture of crime in the state. If you were to compare the rate of violent crime for U.S. cities with a population of at least 100,000, Greitens would appear to be on target. In 2015, the most recent year with available data, St. Louis was in first place with a crime rate of 1,817 per 100,000. Kansas City came in 10th place (1,417 per 100,000) and Springfield in 11th (1,355 per 100,000). However, according to Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at University of Missouri-St. Louis, rankings should be taken with a grain of salt. "Crime statistics are simply not accurate enough to, for example, meaningfully distinguish city number five from city number six or seven in a ranking of city crime rates," Rosenfeld said. "But they can be used to compare the crime rates in cities of similar size and demographics." Let’s take, for instance, the 50 largest cities in the country. Detroit, with a population of 673,225, had the highest rate of violent crime, at 1,759 per 100,000. Kansas City fell in 6th place. But St. Louis isn’t even included on that list. The city, which does not include the smaller, suburban cities around the downtown area, is the 57th largest city with a population of 317,095. And Springfield, with a population of 166,860, isn’t anywhere near as large as Kansas City (473,373). Why does this matter? One reason is that any increase in crime has a larger effect on smaller populations than it does on more populous areas. An increase of 200 more violent crimes in Springfield would bump the city up three places on the list. The same hypothetical increase for Kansas City bumps it up one place. Over the last few years, Kansas City and St. Louis have remained around the same spot on the rankings, give or take two or three ranks. Springfield, however, was in the 27th spot in 2012. To Greitens’ credit, if you were to compare these cities to other cities with about the same population, the three have higher than average crime. St. Louis’ crime rate was 2.5 times the average rate of violent crime for cities with a population of 250,00 or more. Kansas City’s was a little under twice the average rate. "Springfield has surprisingly high crime rates," Rosenfeld said. Compared to the average rate of violent crime for cities with between 100,000 and 250,000 people, Springfield had almost three times as much violent crime. Rosenfeld said much of that has to do with poverty. "When you see high levels of poverty, you tend to see high levels of crime," he said. Almost 55 percent of kids in the Springfield R-12 school district qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, a measure of poverty, according to data from the Missouri Department of Education. Because factors like crime and other underlying characteristics vary from city to city, even the FBI says it’s unfair to rank them on a single variable like crime. "Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place," reads an FBI disclaimer. "UCR statistics include only jurisdictional population figures along with reported crime, clearance, or arrest data. Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale." The disclaimer lists several dozen different factors, including economic conditions, citizens’ crime reporting practices and population density. "Cities are considerably different from another based on things like demographics, tourism, commutes," said James Alan Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University. Where does the city end? Because crime doesn’t respect political boundaries, presenting data from a crime-infested area as an exact reflection of an entire city can be misleading. The FBI estimated the St. Louis metro-area population at 2.8 million in 2015, and Kansas City’s was a little more than 2 million. Yet the populations considered in the crime reporting data were 317,000 for St. Louis and 473,000 for Kansas City. One of the problems is the extent to which nonresidents spend time in the city’s center, Fox said. Suburbs have a moderating effect on the data, so crime rate can depend on how many suburbs are included in the city’s jurisdiction. For St. Louis, that appears to be the case. Sam Dotson, the police chief of the St. Louis Metro Police Department, said the Uniform Crime Reporting statistics are "absolutely not" reflective of crime in the region. Unlike almost every major metropolitan area in the country, St. Louis city is independent from its county. In 1877, the two split after a contentious and narrow vote among county residents and city voters, many of whom were tired of the extra tax burden from the county. "When St. Louis city made a decision to separate itself, it was political," Dotson said. "We’re living with the repercussions today." The county crime data has an equalizing effect. If you were to combine the county with the city, St. Louis’ crime rate would fall to around 44 on the list, Dotson said. He did not deny that the city has a crime problem, which he said has everything to do with the city’s level of poverty. "We have crime," Dotson said. "We have too much crime. So does everywhere else. To single us out is wrong." Dotson also disagreed with Greitens’ comments blaming crime on the ability of police departments to perform their job. "Policing has a piece and responsibility," he said. "But police officers can’t fix school systems. Police officers can’t fix the economy. If you want to reduce crime in Kansas City, St. Louis and Springfield, you have to address those issues too." Our ruling Greitens said, "Three of the 11 most violent cities in the U.S. are in Missouri — St. Louis, Kansas City and Springfield." Greitens is basing his comments on high-quality data, but he uses the data in ways that experts recommend against. Experts dispute the reliability of ranking one city against others based on crime rates. Even the FBI, which compiles the statistics, has a policy against the practice. Greitens’ statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-01730	"There has never been an alderman who has defeated an incumbent mayor in the history of this great city."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/06/bob-donovan/bob-donovan-wants-to-go-where-no-alderman-has-gone/	Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan harbors no illusions of a cakewalk to the mayor’s office in 2016. The well-funded and entrenched incumbent, Tom Barrett, appears poised to seek a fourth four-year term. And history’s not on Donovan’s side, the alderman told supporters July 29, 2014, when he announced his bid. "What we are proposing is monumental and also unprecedented," Donovan said. "As a matter of fact to the best of my knowledge there has never been an alderman who has defeated an incumbent mayor in the history of this great city." Milwaukee’s modern-day tendency to return incumbents to office is well documented: it’s been almost 75 years since a mayor fell (Carl Zeidler stunned Daniel Hoan in 1940). But never’s a long time. No alderman has ever dethroned a mayor? To the history books We took up Donovan’s history challenge, looking back to the early days of city government, when aldermen received no salary and worked out of a church and above a livery stable. Milwaukee has elected a "boy mayor" (flashy 29-year-old Sherburn Becker, 1906). It has backed mayors born in Germany, Ireland and France. It voted in a mayor (Zeidler) whose surprising win was engineered by the future writer of "Psycho." The city’s voters have made a mayor of the man who wrote the "Peck’s Bad Boy" books (George W. Peck), and have tapped surgeons, liquor peddlers, judges, congressman, bankers and many lawyers to the post. Democrats are the rule, but a few Republicans have broken through. But relatively few aldermen even have run against an incumbent. The last to try, unsuccessfully, was Rod Lanser in the 1968 primary. Mayor Henry Maier won a third term and served until 1988. The last to win a mayor’s race as an alderman: Emil Seidel (1910), owner of a small pattern shop. Seidel is remembered not for that, but for starting the city’s half-century of mainly Socialist Party mayors. He made a national splash, becoming the first Socialist to run a major U.S. city. But Seidel didn’t defeat a sitting mayor. He tried, but in 1908 lost narrowly to David S. Rose, described by historian John Gurda as "a political prince of darkness who allowed prostitution, gambling dens, all-night saloons and influence-peddling to flourish on his watch" while fighting off criminal charges. Rose wasn’t re-nominated by the Democrats in 1910, and Seidel defeated Republican physician John Beffel ("Dr. Good Government"). Like Donovan, Seidel was fond of meeting constituents in taverns. so much so that "Seidel" became a nickname for a beer mug, Martin Hintz recounts in "A Spirited History of Milwaukee Brews & Booze." Back to Donovan’s claim that since the city charter was signed in 1846, no alderman has defeated a sitting mayor. Echoing Donovan, to the best of our knowledge, he is correct. We examined newspaper archives and the Milwaukee Public Library’s "Milwaukee Mayors" digital collection. We consulted with the city’s Legislative Reference Bureau’s library manager, Eileen Lipinski, Gurda and Milwaukee City Clerk Jim Owczarski. We reviewed races up to the present day. Only a handful of aldermen or former aldermen have advanced to the mayor’s office, and none against an incumbent, Lipinski found after combing through records kept by the non-partisan research agency. A tough challenge What makes the leap from alderman to mayor so tough? After all, there’s only a couple hundred feet separating their second-floor offices in Milwaukee’s 119-year-old City Hall downtown. "Most alderman are very familiar to voters in their districts," offered Donovan. "But not citywide." There’s also a general fear among alderman about taking on any sitting mayor, for fear of losing and suffering retribution in terms of help for their districts, Donovan said. "I’m not accusing the mayor," said Donovan, who intends to run for both mayor and his district seat simultaneously. "That’s always a concern of aldermen. We’re only as good as what we can deliver." Donovan might not find as much comfort from Seidel’s example if he digs into the deep background on the Socialist. Seidel, we found, was elected in 1908 as an "alderman at large," which meant he had a citywide constituency, rather than representing a smaller geographical area. Our rating No Milwaukee alderman has defeated an incumbent to become mayor, according to Donovan. It’s relatively rare for aldermen or former aldermen to run for mayor. It’s even more rare for them to win. And none has ever bested a sitting mayor, experts agree. We rate Donovan’s statement True.	None	Bob Donovan	None	None	None	2014-08-06T05:00:00	2014-07-29	['None']

pomt-02080	"Congress has cut funding, has slashed funding, for veterans' benefits over these last years."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/21/katrina-vanden-heuvel/katrina-vanden-heuvel-says-congress-has-slashed-fu/	Allegations about secret wait lists and delays for veterans seeking care at VA facilities around the country have begun to reverberate in Washington. The controversy stemmed from a variety of reports about lengthy delays that may have contributed to veterans’ deaths, compounded by allegations of efforts to cover up the delays at several VA facilities, including one in Phoenix. By May 21, 2014, the concern had become so intense that President Barack Obama held a news conference following a meeting with Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. Despite calls from some corners for Shinseki’s resignation, Obama did not say the VA secretary was stepping down. A few days earlier, the Sunday morning talk shows addressed the growing VA controversy. One of those who discussed the VA health care troubles on CBS’ Face the Nation was Katrina vanden Heuvel, the editor and publisher of the liberal magazine The Nation. "It's an outrage," vanden Heuvel said. "Those who are involved in these longer wait times must be held accountable, prosecuted to the full extent of the law. But I think we need to step back." She continued, "I mean, Congress has cut funding, has slashed funding, for veterans' benefits over these last years. If anyone should be offering their resignation, maybe the Congress should." Vanden Heuvel's claim is problematic for a pair of reasons. First, she said "veterans' benefits" -- which include disability payments, pensions, survivor benefits and programs like the G.I. Bill and vocational rehabilitation. Those programs are considered "mandatory spending," which means they’re paid by a statutory formula and are not subject to annual budgetary tinkering by Congress. What vanden Heuvel meant to refer to -- based on what she told us and the context of her comments -- was spending for the VA health system. Health system spending is considered "discretionary" spending and under the purview of Congress. But Congress hasn’t "cut" or "slashed funding to the VA health care system. This VA budget summary sheet shows that, far from being "slashed," discretionary spending on the VA has risen each year over the last decade. In fact, on Obama’s watch, the VA’s discretionary budget has risen from $47.8 billion in 2009 to $63.4 in 2014 -- a one-third increase over five years. When we reached out to vanden Heuvel, she acknowledged that the words she had used on Face the Nation made her statement inaccurate. "In the moment, I was not precise with my words and made it sound like Congress cut year-over-year funding, which is not what happened," vanden Heuvel said. Instead, she continued, "I should have said Congress systematically underfunded the VA, in part because they were slashing budgets generally." Vanden Heuvel said her point was that the Department of Veterans Affairs had been underfunded compared to what it should have been getting, and that Congress deserves some blame because it was clear that the agency was grappling with a backlog of old cases even as new claims continued to flood in. (As we were reporting our fact-check, vanden Heuvel posted a column that lays out her argument in greater detail.) Is her point valid? We aren’t able to say what, objectively, would be a proper level of departmental funding -- that’s a matter about which reasonable people can disagree. However, Congress has consistently agreed to to spend less money on the VA than Obama had requested. Since 2010, by our calculations, Congress has agreed to fund about $2 billion a year less, on average, in discretionary spending than Obama had sought. That’s a few percentage points on the president’s proposed budget every year. On the other hand, it’s not unusual for presidents, as a negotiating tactic, to make their initial budget proposal on the high side. And Obama himself eventually signed off on the lower funding levels when he signed the final spending bills. Our ruling On Face the Nation, Vanden Heuvel said, regarding the VA health care allegations, that "Congress has cut funding, has slashed funding, for veterans' benefits over these last years." That’s incorrect, as vanden Heuvel acknowledged to PunditFact. VA health care and "veterans’ benefits" aren’t the same thing, and the pot of money that paid for VA health care has gone up every year. No reasonable definition of "cut" -- much less "slash" -- fits the data, experts told us. We’re rating the claim she made on national television, and we rate it False.

pomt-02113	Human activity is not "causing these dramatic changes to our climate."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/13/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-humans-are-not-causing-climate-ch/	Scientists have been issuing more new reports on the irreversible effects of climate change in recent weeks. Two groups reported on May 12, 2014, that the global sea level will rise at least 10 feet, accelerating to a dangerous pace after the next century. Just a day before those reports were released, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sat down with ABC’s Jonathan Karl on This Week. Talk turned to climate change, where the possible Republican presidential candidate denied a link between humans and the changing environment. "I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it," he said. "And I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it. Except it will destroy our economy." We’ve noted before that Rubio has disputed the basic science of climate change. So when Rubio said human activity isn’t causing changes to the environment, he’s got it all wrong. In this case, Rubio framed his thoughts about climate change as his personal opinion. But the causes of global warming are backed up by thorough research, so we didn’t see room for debate in Rubio’s claim. Rubio’s said before, "I’m not a scientist, man." So PolitiFact reached out to scientists who could explain the facts behind climate change. We've rated similar claims False from Tim Pawlenty and Rick Perry, but we'll rate it again because it's a persistent claim we see year after year. Rubio’s staff didn’t return our request for comment. How our climate is changing Historically, the earth goes through periods of hotter and cooler temperatures. So how do we know global warming isn’t a natural part of this cycle? By taking measurements, said Leonard Berry, director of Florida Atlantic University’s Center for Environmental Studies. "We can measure the fact that the earth is warming. We can measure the fact that the ocean is warming," Berry said. "While geological history shows warming and cooling periods, as far back as we go, none shows the kind of warming and the kind of changes we’re experiencing right now." Scientists trace back this shift to the Industrial Revolution, which began in 1760. Since that period, carbon dioxide rose 40 percent and methane by 150 percent. High levels of these and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap heat at the surface of the earth, warming the planet. By burning fossil fuels, chopping down trees, and using fertilizer, humans have directly contributed to global warming. The connection between increased levels of greenhouse gases and rising temperature has been confirmed by scientists for over a century, said Jennifer Francis, a Rutgers University marine and coastal sciences professor. "There is as much uncertainty about this connection as there is about what will happen when you drop an object," Francis said. "It will fall." The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is also on board with human activity as a cause. They reported that were it not for human impact, the likely effect of natural changes to the environment would’ve been one of cooling, not warming. They cite "very high confidence" that human activities caused a change of course. The U.S. Global Change Research program published a 2014 report on climate change. It doesn’t debate whether human activity causes climate change. Rather, it focuses on what actions to take to lessen its effects. A May 2013 report analyzing all scientific papers that address the causes of climate change showed 97.1 percent of findings that took a position agree that there’s been a negative human impact on the atmosphere. Comedian John Oliver cleverly addressed the debate’s conclusiveness on a recent Last Week Tonight episode by arranging a representative debate between 97 climate change scientists and three deniers. As a politician from Florida, Rubio must contend with research that pegs Miami and Tampa as two of the U.S. cities most likely to be impacted by climate change. Rising sea levels will make them more prone to flooding. "Whatever the cause of climate change, the impacts on Florida are already important and that it would be difficult for responsible people in Florida to ignore that fact," Berry said. Our ruling Rubio said human activity is not "causing these dramatic changes to our climate." An overwhelming majority of scientists agree that humans, by burning fossil fuels, contribute directly to global warming. Not only is Rubio incorrect, but he’s ignoring a mountain of concrete, scientific research. We rate his claim False. CORRECTION: This story was updated on May 15 to clarify that 97.1 percent of the studies that took a position on global warming agreed that there's been a negative human impact on the atmosphere; more than half the studies did not take a position. Also, the story clarifies that the 2013 report looked at studies, not individual scientists.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2014-05-13T16:07:55	2014-05-11	['None']
pomt-13907	"Go look at a Trump product. They’re all made in China."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/jun/27/thomas-perez/tom-perez-erroneously-tags-all-trump-products-made/	U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez says Donald Trump does a fine job of creating jobs - in China. Perez made that dig in an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch shortly before he gave the keynote speech at the Democratic Party of Virginia’s Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner on June 18. "Go look at a Trump product. They’re all made in China," Perez said. No doubt, many Trump products are made overseas, a point the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has acknowledged in debates and interviews. Perez went a few leaps beyond that in saying all Trump products are made in China. So we checked to see whether the secretary is right. We asked Perez’s office for the source of his information. Mattie Munoz, his press secretary at the Department of Labor, said that since his comments were made on private time during a political event, she couldn’t comment. She suggested contacting Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, which in turn forwarded our request to the Democratic Party of Virginia. Emily Bolton, a state Democratic Party spokeswoman, said she couldn’t comment on Perez’s statement but sent us links to a series of articles about Trump products that are made overseas. So we set out on our own window-shopping spree, eying items listed on The Trump Organization’s website and searching for where they are manufactured. We found that many Trump items are made in China, including cuff links, sport coats, shirts, eyeglasses, lamps and mirrors. It’s impossible to get an exact read on what percentage of items are from China, because many items don’t disclose their exact origin. Some listed on Amazon.com and other shopping websites merely say that they’re "imported." We emailed the Trump campaign twice to see what percentage of his products are made in China but didn’t get a response. China isn’t the only country that makes Trump products. The billionaire candidate acknowledged during a June 21 interview on ABC that his company manufactures neckties in China, suits in Mexico, furniture in Turkey, and barware in Slovenia. We found that some Trump ties were made in Indonesia and Vietnam in addition to China. Many Trump shirts were made in Bangladesh, and some sport coats were made in India. If you’re wondering, some Trump products also are made in the U.S., including the candidate’s iconic "Make America Great Again" baseball cap, which is manufactured in California. PunditFact gave a Pants on Fire rating in October to a claim made by Twitter users that the hats were made in China. Here are some other Trump products that we found are manufactured in the U.S.: •bedding comforters, advertised as being "master suite worthy"; •cologne, called "Success by Trump"; •Trump Natural Spring Water, served at Trump facilities. It’s bottled in Willington, Conn. by the Village Springs water company; and •Trump Wine, made on a 1,300-acre estate near Charlottesville. A disclaimer on the winery website says the GOP presidential candidate doesn’t personally own the winery, which is run by his son, Eric. We also found a few Trump suits online that were made in the U.S. Trump has said he’d like to make more products domestically, but the U.S. can’t compete with foreign countries that "manipulate their currencies" to reduce manufacturing costs. Trump’s overseas product lines have become a central campaign issue for Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. In a June 21 speech, she accused the GOP candidate of hypocrisy for outsourcing his own products. Our ruling Perez said Trump’s products are "all made in China." There’s an element of truth to his statement in that Trump clearly relies on China to produce many products -- ties, shirts, cuff links, sport coats, jackets, lamps, eyeglasses and mirrors. That buttresses the labor secretary’s broader point that Trump relies on foreign labor to produce much of his product line. But Perez goes too far in saying all of Trump’s products are made in China. They come from a lot of other places as well.

pomt-04206	The Broward Republican Executive Committee "had the liberal League of Women Voters Guide removed from the Broward Supervisor of Election's website."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/dec/03/broward-republican-executive-committee/broward-gop-activists-claim-we-had-liberal-league-/	It’s not easy being a Republican in Broward County -- home to the largest number of Democratic voters in Florida and a county where registered GOP voters are outnumbered two to one by Democrats. Beyond the numbers, Broward’s liberalism often makes amusing headlines -- from a 2002 gay mayoral candidate in Wilton Manors who said he was attacked for not being "gay enough," to a county commissioner in 2007 who questioned airing emergency warnings on the station that ran Rush Limbaugh’s radio show. It wasn’t a surprise that Democrats swept Broward and helped re-elect President Barack Obama and U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. But the Broward GOP also suffered the loss of two of their most prominent local Republicans: state Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff of Fort Lauderdale who lost after redistricting, and Sheriff Al Lamberti, who lost to Democrat Scott Israel. (They also had the blow of Fox News favorite U.S. Rep. Allen West moving out of Broward to the Treasure Coast and then losing.) Richard DeNapoli, chairman of the Broward Republican Executive Committee, or BREC, wrote a memo to the group listing accomplishments of the past year. Most of those accomplishments were nothing surprising, such as lining up volunteers and distributing thousands of Romney bumper stickers. But one accomplishment caught our eye: "We had the liberal League of Women Voters Guide removed from the Broward Supervisor of Election's website." We wanted to know, did the Broward GOP get the Broward Supervisor of Elections to remove a League of Women Voters guide from its website? And was that guide or is the League itself "liberal"? The League of Women Voters guide First, some background on the Florida League of Women Voters 2012 voters guide. The guide had short biographical sections and statements submitted by Obama and Mitt Romney. It also included bio information on U.S. Senate candidates Democrat Nelson and Republican Connie Mack and questionnaire responses from Nelson. (Mack chose not to answer the questionnaire.) It included a section on the state Supreme Court justices seeking retention, as well as the state’s constitution and a list of voter resources. The longest section was about the 11 proposed state constitutional amendments. The guide included a synopsis of each amendment and a brief explanation about what a "yes" or "no" vote would mean. The guide summarized conflicting viewpoints -- for example about a question on public funding of abortion: "Supporters say this amendment puts the state on even footing with the federal government. Opponents say it is a pre-emptive strike on a woman’s right to make her own health care choices." The guide didn’t just include opposing viewpoints -- it included analysis, such as noting a "yes" vote on a question about the health care law would add language to the state’s constitution that could be found unconstitutional. "Amendment 1 is more of a political referendum than a meaningful change to our Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has upheld the federal government’s right to impose the individual mandate, the legal standing of Amendment 1 is precarious," the guide said. "The passage or defeat of Amendment 1 may have no practical implications other than to send a message that a majority of Florida’s voters are either for or against the individual mandate." The guide didn’t endorse candidates or tell voters which way to vote on the amendments -- but the League did separately come out against the amendments. The guide, funded in part by Wells Fargo and American Express, was developed in conjunction with experts including the Collins Center for Public Policy, said Deidre Macnab, president of the Florida League, in an interview with PolitiFact Florida. League members distributed the guides at events and public libraries. The League did not request that it be linked to on the Broward Supervisor of Elections website, Macnab said. The voters guide on the Broward elections website DeNapoli said he learned the League’s guide was linked to the Broward Supervisor of Elections homepage sometime near the beginning of October. DeNapoli said he called Mary Cooney, a spokeswoman for Broward Supervisor Brenda Snipes, to express his concern. "As soon as you went to the Broward Supervisor of Elections home page it was glaringly right there," DeNapoli told PolitiFact Florida. DeNapoli said his goal was to get the guide off the home page: "If they bury the link (to the League’s website) way into the Supervisor of Elections website, that wasn’t our main concern." Within a day or two, the link was moved off the home page. "I made a decision to remove the brochure from our website after several calls, one of which was from Mr. DeNapoli," Snipes told PolitiFact Florida in an email. She also heard from the conservative news website BizPac Review which reported on DeNapoli’s efforts and then advocated removing the link from the website’s voter education page. When we searched the supervisor’s website on Nov. 27, we could only find the link to the guide if we typed "League of Women Voters" into the website’s search engine. Was the League’s voter guide liberal? So BREC did get the supervisor of elections to move the voters guide to a less prominent spot on its website. But is it accurate to call the guide or the League itself "liberal"? The national League of Women Voters was formed in 1920 from the movement to give women the right to vote, and it continues to advocate for voter education and participation. The Florida League formed in 1939 with the help of women in St. Petersburg and other cities. "But being nonpartisan does not mean we lack opinions, or the willingness to express them. Our opinions are formed after research, study and consensus," states the national League of Women Voters website. "We are passionate advocates – both women and men – who work to influence policy on specific issues by speaking out and putting pressure on our elected leaders." The national League has taken stances in favor of expanded early voting, backing the Affordable Care Act and calling on Obama to do more about climate change. The League also has a history of supporting abortion rights. We asked DeNapoli for his evidence that the League or its guide was liberal. He said he found the guide’s discussion of the amendments "slanted" and noted that the League separately came out against the amendments, and that the Republican Party of Florida supported the amendments (nearly all of them). Macnab said the League wasn’t the only group to oppose the amendments -- the Hillsborough County Republican Party opposed the majority of them. Ultimately Florida voters rejected most of the amendments. Macnab said the League has been consistent in its support of certain issues, but the parties have changed their stances. "We often get tagged with one name or another," she said. "We see it as a pretty age-old political tactic to divert voters’ attention." Our ruling The Broward Republican Executive Committee claimed on its website that in 2012, "We had the liberal League of Women Voters Guide removed from the Broward Supervisor of Election's website." The group’s chairman did contact the Broward elections office to complain about the guide, and the link was moved from the home page. It can now be found through a few clicks by using the search engine, but you have to know to look for it. It’s more difficult to say whether the League’s voter guide or the League itself is "liberal." Some of the national League’s stances on issues -- in favor of more early voting, in favor of tackling climate change and supporting the health care law -- do dovetail with current liberal positions. The League officially considers itself nonpartisan and independent. But the guide didn’t endorse candidates and gave them an equal chance to respond. The committee was mostly correct about getting the voters guide removed from the Broward website, but the guide wasn’t clearly "liberal." We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14297	"Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against a drug price control measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined."	half-true	/california/statements/2016/apr/04/californians-lower-drug-prices/big-pharma-not-king-ballot-spending-california-its/	Big-time spending is expected in the fight over California’s ballot measures this election year. One expert estimates campaigns could dole out nearly a half billion dollars to influence the fate of the dozen or more initiatives expected on the November ballot. Eight have already qualified. They include a measure to overturn the state’s ban on single-use plastic bags; one to raise funds for school facilities; and another that would regulate the cost the state pays for prescription drugs. Campaigns for a dozen additional initiatives, including a proposed tobacco tax hike, are gathering signatures and could qualify their measures later this year. As money pours in for and against these initiatives, a claim by Californians for Lower Drug Prices caught our attention. The campaign is backing a measure on the November ballot that would impose price controls on state prescription drug purchases. Supporters call the initiative the California Drug Price Relief Act. And they say spending by the measure’s opponent has dwarfed all other fundraising. "Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against the prescription drug measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined," Californians for Lower Drug Prices said in a March 21 press release. That campaign is funded by the Los Angeles-based nonprofit AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which offers health services and is often at odds with the pharmaceutical industry. We wondered was its claim about Big Pharma true? Had a group of pharmaceutical companies really outspent all other ballot campaigns, combined? How much did all that spending add up to? We set out on a fact check. Our research Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure is the campaign opposing the ballot measure. It’s the one that is claimed to have outraised everyone by a wide margin. First, we checked to see if it’s contributions came from 27 "out-of-state pharmaceutical companies," as claimed by Californians For Lower Drug Prices. We found the campaign in question is sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturer’s Association of America, an industry group based in Washington D.C. And 27 of the 30 companies that had contributed to it are, indeed, from outside California, according to records on the secretary of state’s website. Johnson & Johnson of New Jersey and Pfizer, Inc., of New York, made the largest single contributions at $5.7 million each last year. Big Pharma is uniquely positioned to influence America’s political system. The pharmaceutical and health products industry spent more than $3.2 billion on lobbying from 1998 through 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington D.C. based nonprofit that tracks money in politics. That was $1 billion more than the next sector, insurance. Also last year, the pharmaceutical industry had nearly 1,400 lobbyists working for it, the center reported. Capital Public Radio / file photo More than everyone, combined? Looking back at the California drug price measure, records show pharmaceutical companies spent nearly $53 million against it by mid-March. It’s a big sum, especially this early in the election year. The total ranks among the top 20 largest sums contributed by a campaign for or against a California initiative, according to the research group MapLight. But as we dug deeper, we found it’s not necessarily more that what’s been spent on all other 2016 ballot measures in the state, combined. It’s not even the highest total raised for an individual measure on this year’s November ballot. Another big money pot The $53 million from the pharma firms is certainly more than what’s been spent on all other ballot measures (about $33 million), but only if you look at what’s been doled out during the 2015-2016 election cycle. What’s missing is the huge sum -- nearly $59 million -- contributed by a California hospitals association over the past three years for a hospital fees measure on November’s ballot. Most of that money streamed in before this election cycle, because the measure was initially intended for the November 2014 ballot. When making its claim about the pharma cash, it appears Californians for Lower Drug Prices missed a big pot of money, said Ned Wigglesworth a Sacramento-based campaign strategist, who is not associated with either side on the prescription drug measure. "The statement (by Californians for Lower Drug Prices) doesn’t appear to be accurate," he said. "When you take a closer look at the (campaign) filings … you realize far more money has been raised." He estimated spending could eventually top $450 million for all measures on this year’s ballot. Representatives for the Californians for Lower Drug Prices campaign said they only looked at the 2015-2016 cycle, and "missed" the early money contributed by the hospital group. Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for the campaign backed by the pharma companies, said the claim about its spending "is an early snapshot," noting it’s expensive to campaign in a state as large as California. But because other campaigns are expected to pour in hundreds of millions of dollars in more spending, she said the claim "ignores the bigger picture. Look at (spending totals) in October." Our ruling Californians for Lower Drug Prices is backing a drug price control measure on the November ballot. In late March, it claimed: "Twenty-seven out-of-state pharmaceutical companies have raised more campaign dollars (against the drug measure) than all other state ballot measures have raised to date, combined." From our research, it’s clear that 27 of the 30 companies backing Californians Against The Misleading Rx Measure are, indeed, from outside California. Together they’ve amassed nearly $53 million, which dwarfs the $33 million spent on all other initiative campaigns during the 2015-2016 election cycle. But what’s also clear is that Californians for Lower Drug Prices did not count a large pot of money, nearly $59 million, collected by a hospital association for a separate ballot measure. It says it simply "missed" these funds because it was focused on the current election cycle. Much of the $59 million was contributed outside the timeframe used to make the claim, but it is money that was gathered to be spent on a November ballot measure. This doesn’t take away from the fact that pharma firms have aggressively spent funds, so much that their totals already are in the top 20 for cash contributed for any California ballot measure. But the omission of the hospital association money leaves out important details that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Half True. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the pharmaceutical and health products industry spent more than $3.2 billion on lobbying efforts in 2015. The industry spent that total from 1998 through 2015. It spent $240 million in 2015, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

pomt-13931	"For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/22/donald-trump/trump-wrong-clintons-refugee-plan-would-cost-more-/	A day after Hillary Clinton gave her list of Donald Trump’s many flaws on the economy, Trump returned the favor. In a speech from New York, he called her a "world-class liar" who has "spent her entire life making money for special interests." Trump delivered a broadside on Clinton’s immigration policies — to him, they represent "mass amnesty" and "open borders" — and blended those faults with her plans for refugees. "Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration," Trump said. "For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America." We asked the Trump campaign where he got those spending numbers and did not hear back. But as you’ll see, whatever number Clinton could conceivably spend resettling refugees come nowhere near what it would cost to rebuild America’s urban centers. The cost of refugees The only numbers we could find for Clinton’s budget plans were $15 million for immigrant integration services (from her campaign website), and $582 million to resettle 70,000 refugees. The second figure comes from an analysis of federal refugee spending by the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures. We used that as one starting point. President Barack Obama seeks to increase the number of refugees accepted from around the world to 100,000. That includes 10,000 Syrian refugees. Clinton has said she wants to take in 65,000 Syrians. If we add her higher number to Obama’s, and we assume she wouldn’t trim his plan, we can estimate a total number of refugees of 155,000. Scaling up the dollar amounts, we can roughly estimate a total cost for her plan of about $1.3 billion. That is about half a percent of the "hundreds of billions" that Trump claimed. We also looked at the Obama administration’s FY 2017 budget request for refugee and entrant assistance. That is a bit under $2.2 billion for 100,000 refugees. When you add in the additional costs for more resettled Syrian refugees, you might get a budget in the neighborhood of $3 billion to $4 billion. The cost of rebuilding inner cities Trump used a term that generally refers to low-income urban neighborhoods. What he meant by rebuilding them is unclear. It could include rebuilding substandard housing, fixing aging water systems, investing in schools and job training, creating an enticing business environment, or any number of aspects of life where low-income communities are lacking. Solomon Greene, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, an academic center in Washington, told us he knows of no comprehensive study that added up the rehabilitation needs of every American city. He did, however, note that alone there is a $26 billion backlog to repair the nation’s public housing. "It’s a very conservative estimate," Greene said. "It only includes public housing, and that’s a small share of the low-income housing stock." Not all public housing is in urban centers, but Greene, a housing specialist, told us that the great majority of it is. New York City alone could use billions of dollars in improvements. The Center for an Urban Future, a research and policy group supported by funders ranging from MetLife to the Child Welfare Fund, estimated that fixing the Big Apple’s aging infrastructure would cost about $47 billion over five years. Researchers at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, an urban planning research center in Cambridge, Mass., found a number of estimates for different urban needs. The Federal Transit Administration estimated in 2013 that it will cost $85.9 billion to bring the nation’s transit systems to a state of good repair. The Council on Great City Schools said facility needs for schools in the 50 largest cities will cost $85 billion. The institute’s director George McCarthy estimated that it would cost $975 million just to demolish abandoned structures in Detroit. We could go further, but the numbers are clear. Barely scratching the surface of the needs of America’s cities, we find a price tag of over $225 billion. Even if Clinton doubled the Obama administration’s funding for refugees, the money would barely make a dent. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton wants to spend hundreds of billions on refugees and for that money, "we could rebuild every inner city in America." Trump’s campaign provided no supporting numbers. Clinton has not said how much she would spend on refugees, but the Obama administration request for FY 2017 is about $2.2 billion. That figure could increase for Clinton, as she has said she wants to take in more Syrian refugees. If it doubles or even triples, it is nowhere near "hundreds of billions." It is also a scant fraction of the price tag to rebuild America’s inner cities. There is no comprehensive tally of what it would take to deal with substandard housing and infrastructure, but we quickly found a backlog of about $225 billion in projects. Trump’s numbers are off by a huge margin.

pomt-05833	A 10-year state program that created 202 jobs at a cost of $247,000 per job was approved by former Gov. Jim Doyle.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/17/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-247000-job-capco-program-was/	Issue No. 1 in Madison: Jobs. Gov. Scott Walker and lawmakers of both parties say the state should be doing more, with much debate centered on proposals to boost companies poised for rapid growth. The idea is for the state to use millions of dollars to "seed" venture capital funds -- pools of money that are invested in young firms with high growth potential. But legislation has been bogged down by a debate over whether or not to use state certificated capital companies, or CAPCOs, to handle the investments. A previous $50 million program, which ran from 1999 through 2008, used three out-of-state CAPCO firms and had disappointing results. A Journal Sentinel analysis determined it resulted in the creation of only 202 new jobs at a cost of $247,000 per job. The Feb. 12, 2012 story said the program was the result of poorly drafted legislation and had minimal state oversight. The headline: "State spent millions for 202 jobs." Facing a near-certain recall election, Walker that day used his Twitter account to highlight the story as a failure of the previous administration, that of Democrat Jim Doyle. (Other tweets included the fact he stopped for ham and rolls after church.) His tweet: "Headline ‘State spends millions for 202 jobs’, missed rest of sentence:, ‘under program approved by Gov Doyle.’" In other words, the poor performing program was created under Doyle. And that’s where the blame should fall, Walker says. Did Doyle approve the plan? The legislation creating the program was introduced in 1997 and passed and signed into law the following year -- not by Democrat Doyle, but by then-Gov. Tommy Thompson, a fellow Republican now running for a U.S. Senate vacancy. Doyle didn’t take office until 2003, five years after the CAPCO bill was signed. Indeed, the proposal had bipartisan support. It was authored by Democratic state Sen. Gwen Moore, now a congresswoman from Milwaukee. Among the 89 members of the state Assembly who voted in favor of the bill March 25, 1998: Walker himself. Walker’s tweet gained a broader audience the following day. WTMJ radio talk show host Charlie Sykes picked up on the topic and in a three minute segment linked Doyle to the CAPCO program five times. He called it "a Jim Doyle idea," and said the program was "one of Jim Doyle’s signature venture capital bills." In an email, Sykes acknowledged that the program was created under Thompson. And he pointed out that Walker had tweeted on the subject the day before. We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie to explain the tweet, but he didn’t respond. Our conclusion In the wake of a story about poor jobs results of a state-sponsored program, Walker sought to pin the blame on his predecessor, Jim Doyle. But he was off by five years, two governors -- Thompson and successor Scott McCallum -- and one political party. As governor, Doyle didn’t have anything to do with approving the CAPCO bill. But as an Assembly member, Scott Walker did. Pants on Fire.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2012-02-17T09:00:00	2012-02-12	['Jim_Doyle']

pomt-15237	"I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole … to a $2 billion surplus."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/06/john-kasich/kasich-i-took-state-ohio-8-billion-hole-2-billion-/	During the Republican presidential debate on his home turf of Cleveland, Ohio Gov. John Kasich touted his economic record in the state. Repeating a claim he has often made -- including on his campaign website -- Kasich said, "I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole … to a $2 billion surplus." We decided to take a closer look. An $8 billion hole? There’s an argument for $8 billion, but there’s also an argument for something closer to $6 billion, according to a deep dive by the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2011. The $8 billion figure is rounded up from a $7.7 billion gap between spending and expected revenues. It was an initial estimate from January 2011, based on the assumption made several months earlier that there would be no new revenue growth. However, revenues did grow as the economy rebounded that year, reducing the gap to between $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion -- a calculation that Kasich’s budget director, Tim Keen, agreed with "conceptually" in a 2011 interview with the newspaper, though he took issue with some of the methodological details. Whatever the number, Kasich avoided a potential misstep when he spoke of this in the debate as a "hole" rather than a deficit, since Ohio, like most states, cannot run an actual budget deficit. The $8 billion gap is more accurately described as a projected shortfall rather than a deficit. A $2 billion surplus? This figure is clearer. The state’s Office of Budget and Management reported in July 2015 that the state’s "rainy day fund" had a little more than $2 billion in it, up from effectively zero when Kasich took office in 2011. Does Kasich deserve credit? It’s not unreasonable to give Kasich some credit for the state’s improving economic fortunes -- he is a governor, after all, and he forged the state’s fiscal policy in concert with the Legislature. But it’s important to remember that he took office at the very beginning of the national economic recovery, and as the national economy has improved, so has Ohio’s. When Kasich was inaugurated in January 2011, the unemployment rate in Ohio was 9.2 percent -- exactly the same as the national rate. Today, the national unemployment rate is 5.3 percent and the rate in Ohio is 5.2 percent. So Kasich’s timing has been fortunate. Our ruling Kasich said, "I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole … to a $2 billion surplus." It’s possible to argue over whether the initial amount should be $6 billion rather than $8 billion. But Kasich didn’t pull that figure out of thin air, and it certainly was high by historical standards. He also used the term "hole," which is more appropriate than "deficit" would have been. Meanwhile, the $2 billion figure seems solid. Still, it’s worth noting that Kasich spoke a little grandly when he said that "I" did it, since the state’s fiscal improvement got a big assist from the national economic recovery. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2015-08-06T23:32:04	2015-08-06	['Ohio']

pomt-10478	Obama served on a board with former Weather Underground member William Ayers and "that relationship with Mr. Ayers on this board continued after 9/11."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/16/hillary-clinton/obama-served-on-board-with-ayers/	A little-known relationship in Sen. Barack Obama's past — one that had been buzzing in mostly conservative circles for months — took a very public turn Wednesday night during a Democratic debate in Philadelphia. It relates to Obama's relationship with William C. Ayers, a onetime member of the Weather Underground, a leftist fringe of the 1960s antiwar movement. Known as the Weathermen, the group was responsible for bombings of the New York City police headquarters in 1970, of the Capitol building in 1971 and of the Pentagon in 1972. During the debate, moderator George Stephanopoulos asked Obama about his relationship with Ayers, as part of a discussion about Obama's patriotism. "An early organizing meeting for your state Senate campaign was held at his house and your campaign has said you are 'friendly,' " Stephanopoulos said. Stephanopoulos quoted a New York Times story, published Sept. 11, 2001, in which Ayers was quoted as saying: "I don't regret setting bombs. I feel we didn't do enough." Asked Stephanopoulos: "Can you explain that relationship for the voters and explain to Democrats why it won't be a problem?" Obama downplayed the relationship. "This is a guy who lives in my neighborhood, who's a professor of English in Chicago who I know and who I have not received some official endorsement from," Obama said. "He's not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis. "And the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8 years old, somehow reflects on me and my values doesn't make much sense, George." Sen. Hillary Clinton then piled on. "I also believe that Senator Obama served on a board with Mr. Ayers for a period of time, the Woods Foundation, which was a paid directorship position. And, if I'm not mistaken, that relationship with Mr. Ayers on this board continued after 9/11 and after his reported comments, which were deeply hurtful to people in New York and, I would hope, to every American, because they were published on 9/11, and he said that he was just sorry they hadn't done more." We need to point out that it was merely a coincidence the remarks were published in the New York Times on Sept. 11 and they had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks that day. They were referring to activities by the Weather Underground in the 1970s. Deborah Harrington, president of the Woods Fund, a philanthropic organization in Chicago, said Obama was a director from 1994 through 2001. That overlaps Ayers' time as a director by three years. It also means Obama served with Ayers for the final months of 2001, after Ayers made his comments to the New York Times. Ayers, now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago (not English as Obama stated), is still on the seven-member Woods Fund board. In 2001, Ayers wrote a book, ''Fugitive Days'' — he called it a memoir — in which he wrote that he participated in the bombings of New York City police headquarters, the Capitol building and the Pentagon. But in a review of the book, the New York Times noted that Ayers coyly noted that some of the book was fiction. Last week, Ayers defended the September 2001 comments on his blog stating: "I'm sometimes asked if I regret anything I did to oppose the war in Vietnam and I say: No, I don't regret anything I did to stop the slaughter of millions of human beings by my own government." Obama has minimized his relationship with Ayers. Campaign finance reports show Ayers donated $200 to Obama's re-election campaign in 2001. In the spirit of fairness, we should note that just before leaving office, President Bill Clinton pardoned Susan L. Rosenberg who, according to a New York Times story in 2001, was "a onetime member of the Weather Underground terrorist group who was charged in the notorious 1981 Brink's robbery in Rockland County that left a guard and two police officers dead." But as for Clinton's comments about Obama's relationship with Ayers, we rate them True.

pomt-03431	Says 97 percent of food stamp benefits "are paid in the proper amounts to people who are really eligible."	true	/texas/statements/2013/jun/25/pete-gallego/pete-gallego-says-97-percent-food-stamp-benefits-r/	Opposing Republican-proposed cuts in food stamps, U.S. Rep. Pete Gallego suggested the program doesn’t waste money. After airing qualms about cutting "things that work well" during a May 15, 2013, meeting of the House Agriculture Committee, the Alpine Democrat said some government programs have high error rates, but error rates for food stamps, meaning the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, "are only 3 percent... Ninety seven percent of SNAP benefits are paid in the proper amounts to people who are really eligible." Food stamps, which help beneficiaries buy groceries, often stir strong claims. In March 2013, PolitiFact in Washington rated Pants on Fire the declaration that 70 percent of the program’s funding went to its employees. The broadest calculation of SNAP administrative costs topped out at 5 percent of its costs. In December 2012, PolitiFact Ohio rated as True a claim that growth in food stamp participation had trailed increases in unemployment, while in August 2012, we rated as True a claim that one in seven American families is on food stamps. According to the Agriculture Department, a record 46.6 million residents participated in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2012, up from 44.7 million the year before and 40.3 million in fiscal 2010. As of March 2013, more than 1.6 million Texas households were enrolled. Fraud concerns Food stamp fraud occasionally draws attention, too. A Feb. 6, 2012, Reuters news story quoted Kevin Concannon, U.S. Department of Agriculture undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services, as saying that fraud at that time accounted for 1 percent of food stamp benefits, while costing the government $750 million a year. "This is $750 million that isn't being used to provide food to individuals and families, and that issue isn't lost on us," Concannon said. The story said the program's "biggest step forward in fraud prevention came in 2004, when the government replaced paper coupons with plastic cards that are loaded electronically like debit cards." Concannon also said the program was adding high-tech strategies to its enforcement quiver, the story said, among them plans to work with social media firms and a data mining company to root out abuse. The agency has a website to solicit food-stamp fraud tips. "While administrators work to reduce payment errors," the story said, "the USDA is collaborating with state agencies to investigate recipients suspected of committing fraud or misusing benefits. It also will seek tougher penalties for stores engaged in trafficking. Trafficking generally takes the form of users ‘selling’ their benefits for roughly 50 cents on the dollar to brick-and-mortar retailers or to individuals found via websites like eBay or Facebook." Basis of claim Gallego’s claim did not speak directly to trafficking scams. But are 97 percent of food stamp benefits paid in proper amounts to eligible residents, as he said? By email, Gallego spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña attributed the percentage to research by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal, Washington, D.C.-based think tank. In a blog post revised May 16, 2013, the center said the House committee-approved version of the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013, which Gallego and committee members were discussing when he spoke, would cut SNAP by almost $21 billion over the next decade, eliminating food assistance to nearly 2 million low-income people, mostly working families with children and senior citizens. The center said in a May 10, 2013, blog post: "Only 3 percent of SNAP benefits represent overpayments, meaning they either went to ineligible households or went to eligible households but in excessive amounts. SNAP achieved its lowest error rate on record in fiscal year 2011, with a national overpayment rate of just 2.99 percent (see graph). The underpayment rate that year was 0.81 percent. Thus, the net loss to the federal government — the amounts lost through over­payments minus those saved by underpayments — was only 2.2 percent." An accompanying graph, which we show below, was headlined: "SNAP Error Rates Are at an All-Time Low." Also, the center said, relatively "few payment errors reflect dishonesty or fraud. The overwhelming majority result from honest mistakes by recipients, eligibility workers, data entry clerks, or computer programmers. States report that almost 60 percent of the dollar value of overpayments and almost 90 percent of the dollar value of underpayments were their fault, not recipients’. Much of the rest of the overpayments resulted from innocent errors by households that had trouble navigating SNAP’s complex rules." Government data Information posted online by the Agriculture Department tracks with the center’s blog post, stating that in the fiscal year that ran through September 2011, 2.99 percent of SNAP benefits were overpayments and 0.81 percent were underpayments. Wyoming had the highest share of overpayments that year, at 7.63 percent, and Alaska had the lowest, 0.53 percent, while 2.63 percent of SNAP payments in Texas were overpayments, according to the information. Overpayments were more prevalent in previous years, annual department reports indicate, though the incidence dropped each year after fiscal 2006, when overpayments accounted for 4.82 percent of benefits. In fiscal 2000, in contrast, SNAP overpayments accounted for 6.51 percent of its benefits. By email, Agriculture Department spokeswoman Elena Gaona told us information on overpayments of SNAP benefits in fiscal 2012 are due to be released by the end of June 2013. An independent analysis Separately, we contacted Kay Brown, an analyst who has studied the food stamp program for the General Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress. Brown said by telephone that she has "no problem" with Gallego’s wording in that the government does assess whether the proper amounts are paid to eligible recipients. Brown also said told us improper payments caused by participants’ failures to report required, complete or correct information, such as household income and composition, don’t necessarily indicate attempts to cheat, though for a May 5, 2005 GAO report, "we could not determine the percentage of payment errors that involve participants intentionally withholding information." Nationally in 2003, the report said, "about 5 percent of all payment errors were referred for fraud investigation. Data are not available, however, to determine what percentage of these error cases resulted in disqualifying participants because of fraud." The report said that almost two-thirds of food stamp payment errors were caused by government caseworkers, usually when they failed to keep up with reported changes or make mistakes applying program rules. Some one-third of payment errors were caused by participants’ failures to report required, complete or correct information, such as household income and composition, the report said. Our ruling Gallego said 97 percent of food stamp benefits "are paid in the proper amounts to people who are really eligible." We are mindful this claim did not speak to misdeeds that can occur once someone receives food stamps. Setting that aside, nearly 3 percent of such payments were overpayments in fiscal 2011, the latest year of available data, and nearly 1 percent were underpayments, according to the government. That’s a total of about 96 percent. Gallego’s statement comes close enough. We rate it as True.	None	Pete Gallego	None	None	None	2013-06-25T10:00:00	2013-05-15	['None']

pomt-06274	Says Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that "if he has a nuclear weapon he will use it to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. He will use it against the United States of America."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/23/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-iran-has-threatended-launch-/	Responding to a hypothetical question about whether the United States should support an attack against Iran by Middle East-ally Israel, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann noted that Iran already has announced plans to strike Israel. "They've stated, as recently as August just before President (Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad came ... to the U.N. General Assembly. He said that he wanted to eradicate Israel from the face of the Earth," Bachmann said during the Nov. 22, 2011, CNN debate. "He has said that if he has a nuclear weapon he will use it to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth. He will use it against the United States of America." The claim from Bachmann isn’t new -- she said something similar during an Iowa campaign event in October. But is it correct? The genesis appears to be an hourlong August interview Ahmadinejad gave to Al-Manar TV, a network based in Lebanon. This is a link to the interview. Ahmadinejad’s comments appear to be translated from Persian into Arabic. We could not find a copy of the entire interview that had been translated in English, but there are a few English-language news reports that translate selected comments from the Iranian leader. We reached out to Bachmann’s campaign but did not hear back. The website Haaretz.com, an online edition of an Israeli newspaper, quoted Ahmadinejad as saying Iran was determined to eradicate Israel. The website wrote: "Iran believes that whoever is for humanity should also be for eradicating the Zionist regime (Israel) as symbol of suppression and discrimination," Ahmadinejad said in an interview with a Lebanese television network, carried by ISNA. "Iran follows this issue (the eradication of Israel) with determination and decisiveness and will never ever withdraw from this standpoint and policy," the Iranian president added in the interview with the Al-Manar network. In both quotes Israel is included in parentheses, which means Ahmadinejad never said the word. The "ISNA" the report refers to is likely the Iranian Student's News Agency. We should also note that there has been some concern over how Ahmadinejad’s statements have been translated into English. In 2005, several sources reported Ahmadinejad as saying Israel should "be wiped off the map." However, several experts believed Ahmadinejad’s actual comments to be inflated. "Ahmadinejad did not say he was going to wipe Israel off the map because no such idiom exists in Persian," Juan Cole, a Middle East specialist at the University of Michigan told the New York Times. "He did say he hoped its regime, i.e., a Jewish-Zionist state occupying Jerusalem, would collapse." For this fact-check, we’re not saying these most recent comments are translated accurately, or inaccurately. We’re simply saying you should read them with a note of caution. However, where Bachmann misstepped was by accusing Ahmadinejad of saying he planned to use a nuclear weapon against Israel or the United States. Iran and Ahmadinejad have maintained that they are not pursuing nuclear weapons, and that they are only pursuing nuclear energy. Here’s how Ahmadinejad put it during an October interview with CNN. "We have already expressed our views about nuclear bombs. We said those who are seeking to build nuclear bombs or those who stockpile, they are politically and mentally retarded. We think they are stupid because the era of nuclear bombs is over," he said. "Iran, for example, should continue its efforts and tolerate all international treasures only to build a nuclear bomb or a few nuclear bombs that are useless? They can never be used? And is not capable of confronting with the U.S. nuclear arsenals? The overall budget of our national atomic energy agency is $250 million, and the whole budget is aimed at peaceful activities. "But the government of the United States only allocated $80 million for rebuilding the nuclear bombs. I think Iranians are clever enough to see that with this limited amount of money, $250 million, we are not able to be at war with the other side." Many westerners, and most Republicans, think Ahmadinejad is lying. Ahmadinejad has said that he believes the U.S. government orchestrated the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to "reverse the declining American economy and its grips on the Middle East in order also to save the Zionist regime." He also has criticized the United States abducting Africans and turning them into slaves, has said some European countries are still using the Holocaust to "pay ransom" to Jews living in Israel and said the United States economy relies on waging wars and selling weapons. But we’re focusing on Bachmann’s actual statement during the Nov. 22 debate. She paraphrased Ahmadinejad as saying, "He has said that if he has a nuclear weapon he will use it to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth. He will use it against the United States of America." Ahmadinejad has said some tough things about the United States and Israel, but we find no evidence that he has said he would use a nuclear weapon against either country. In fact, he has maintained Iran has no interest in building one. We rate this claim False.

pomt-00534	On timing of announcement for president.	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/19/scott-walker/scott-walker-changes-marker-when-hell-announce-201/	For months, Gov. Scott Walker has said enacting a new state budget is so important that he would not announce whether he will run for president until one is in place. Along the way, Walker has expressed confidence -- with fellow Republicans in control of both chambers of the Legislature -- that the two-year budget will be adopted by June 30, 2015. That’s the end of the state’s fiscal year, though if lawmakers miss the deadline, spending simply continues at current levels. Unlike the federal government, there is no shutdown. But in recent days, GOP lawmakers have struggled to reach agreement over transportation funding, a proposed new arena for the Milwaukee Bucks and other matters -- putting the June 30, 2015 deadline in jeopardy. Walker, meanwhile, is eyeing July 13, 2015 as a potential presidential announcement date, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported. And now Walker is saying his marking point is -- and has long been -- the end of the fiscal year, not the date work on the budget is completed. What gives? Time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter, which tests whether a politician has changed position on an issue. Our requisite reminder: It does not measure whether any change is good or bad policy or politics, only whether the candidate has been consistent. A recent chronology of Walker’s statements on the budget and a presidential announcement show he has repeatedly said any presidential announcement would only come after work on the budget is completed -- that is, the Legislature approves a budget and he signs it: April 22, 2015: Walker says while visiting a business in Grand Chute, Wis.: "I won't make any decision until after the budget's complete." May 7, 2015: The Associated Press reports Walker said he would make no announcement "of any kind" about running for president until after the state budget is signed. May 17, 2015: Walker says on CBS’ "Face the Nation" he’ll announce whether he’s formally jumping into the race after he completes work on the state budget. May 30, 2015: Campaigning in New Hampshire, Walker says: "For us, we have yet to make an announcement. We’ll do that after our budget is done, at the end of June." June 3, 2015: Walker tells "Fox & Friends" about a 2016 presidential bid: "I haven't made an announcement yet and won't until after the budget's done at the end of this month." Contrast that with what Walker told reporters June 18, 2015 in Ripon, Wis. When asked about his 2016 announcement plans, Walker told reporters: "For us, my goal has always been to get through the end of the budget year which ends June 30th. We'll see after that. Sometime in July is a pretty good time." That’s a change -- something immediately picked up on in the media. When we asked Walker campaign spokeswoman AshLee Strong about the change in Walker’s statements, she said by email: "As the governor has said, he is optimistic an agreement will be reached in the coming weeks. When we have a public announcement, we will let you know." Our rating Walker has repeatedly said he would not make an announcement on whether he’ll run for president until after work is complete on the 2015-’17 state budget -- with his hope being that the budget would be in place by June 30, 2015, the end of the state’s fiscal year. Now with that deadline in jeopardy, Walker is changing what he said. He claims he always wanted to merely get past the June 30, 2015 deadline before announcing his plans for 2016. In other words, Walker no longer is saying a budget has to be in place before he’ll make his announcement. For that reversal of position, we give Walker a Full Flop.

pomt-04563	Says that "you can’t destroy the guns purchased in a (gun) buyback program as the city (of Memphis) wants to do."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/sep/26/stacey-campfield/campfield-claimed-memphis-destroy-guns-buy-back/	Colorful State Sen. Stacey Campfield seems to court controversy, particularly in his blog, Camp4u. So it was no real surprise when he took a reproachful tone in blog posts on Sept. 11 about the "gas for guns" program announced the day before by the City of Memphis and the Memphis Police Department. The city held a press conference on Sept. 10 to announce that on Sept. 15, it would conduct an event in which it would give people a $50 Mapco gas card plus two tickets to a Memphis Grizzlies basketball game for turning in a gun. The idea was to get guns off the streets, and 497 guns were exchanged for the cards and tickets at the event. The city said most of the guns would be "destroyed." "I don’t think they can do that," Campfield wrote in his first blog post on the gas for guns program, adding that "…the point of this post is that the city is saying they intend on destroying the guns they buy. I may be wrong but didn’t we change the law to say they have to resell the guns now?" The senator cited the Tennessee legislature passing a bill in 2010 regarding what local law enforcement can do with guns but acknowledged he might be wrong with exactly whether it applied to gun "buyback" programs similar to the Memphis initiative. Nearly an hour later, Campfield posted a second item that sounded as if he had verified that the city’s program could not destroy the guns as it intended. Under the headline "Sorry Memphis," the senator wrote: "I was right. The city of Memphis/Memphis PD is wrong (I know, a real shocker). As I recalled, you can’t destroy the guns purchased in a gun buy program as the city wants to do. They have to be re sold (sic) to a licensed gun dealer. Someone should alert them. I would hate to see our law enforcement in violation of the law." Clearly, somebody was firing a dud, so we decided to look into the matter. Campfield was recalling the 2010 law that prohibits local law enforcement from destroying certain guns, but his recollection was a little off on which guns. Tennessee Code Annotated 39-17-1317 governs the disposition of "confiscated weapons" only, and the 2010 amendment to the statute removed destruction of guns as an option for confiscated guns, unless they are certified by local police as "inoperable or unsafe." But otherwise, after a confiscated gun is no longer needed for evidence, local law enforcement may ask a court to declare it contraband. "Any weapon declared contraband shall be sold in a public sale or used for legitimate law enforcement purposes, at the discretion of the court." The law goes on to say how the gun must be sold -- a public auction or through a private gun dealer. When the 2010 amendment was briefly discussed in the legislature, its sponsors said it was sought by the National Rifle Association. The NRA in fact posted on its website an alert encouraging its members to urge then-Gov. Phil Bredesen to sign it into law. He did. Campfield linked to the NRA’s 2010 alert in his blog post, but even the alert made note that the law applies only to confiscated guns: The bill "would prohibit the destruction of confiscated firearms and require them to be auctioned off or sold to a federally licensed firearms dealer," it said. But can guns voluntarily surrendered by people to the police – even if in exchange for cash or gasoline debit cards or pro basketball tickets – be considered "confiscated" under the law? Ultimately, that may be a question for the courts if anyone challenges the legality of the program, but our dictionary says "confiscate" means "appropriated by the government; forfeited; deprived of property by confiscation," and "to seize as forfeited to the public treasury; to seize by authority." Memphis believes its program is within the state law, city spokeswoman Mary Cashiola wrote in an email to The Commercial Appeal: "The firearms collected during Saturday’s Gas for Guns event will be turned in voluntarily by citizens. . . . The Memphis Police Department will take possession of the exchanged weapons and will handle these weapons in accordance with State law." The state attorney general’s office does not appear to have rendered a legal opinion on the statute, so we turned to Nashville lawyer John Harris, a gun advocate who founded the Tennessee Firearms Association. Harris told us in an email hat he doesn’t believe the law prohibits Memphis from destroying guns obtained through the gas for guns initiative. "As I understand it, TCA 39-17-1317 only applies to weapons that were ‘possessed, used or sold in violation of the law’ and, based on that use, ‘confiscated by a law enforcement officer and declared to be contraband by a court of record exercising criminal jurisdiction.’ The prohibition on the destruction of such weapons under this statute (with limited exceptions) thus only applies to those weapons that were specifically ‘confiscated’ and ‘declared to be contraband’. I do not think that the statute would apply on its face to firearms ‘buy back’ programs conduct by state or local agencies." Harris did say, however, that he believes the "intentional destruction of functional weapons violates the spirit of the law" and that he anticipates that the TFA will seek to close the buyback loophole. "While it might appear to be ‘politically correct’ to destroy legal items with material value, it’s foolish and government should not be doing foolish things," he said. Contacted by PolitiFact on Sept. 20, Campfield said he had already changed his mind on his blog post, after speaking with legislative lawyers. "For buybacks, it is different than for guns confiscated. The way it was originally written it would have covered buybacks. But when I had legal look at it, I don’t think it covers buybacks. All the early stuff I had said, no they can’t do it." Our ruling It is PolitiFact policy to take into account when someone later acknowledges an original claim was somehow incorrect. Often, those statements are made during live interviews, but in this case Campfield took the time to write up and post not one but two items onto his blog declaring that it would be illegal for Memphis to destroy guns purchased in a buy-back program. Campfield hadn’t altered his blog post as of this writing. We give him a ruling of False.	None	Stacey Campfield	None	None	None	2012-09-26T10:59:46	2012-09-11	['None']

pomt-13517	Says Alex Jones "said that the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there."	true	/texas/statements/2016/sep/01/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-correct-austins-alex-jones-said-no/	Suggesting connections between right-wing hate groups and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton brought up talk-show host Alex Jones, a Texas-based pro-Trump conspiracy theorist who runs InfoWars.com. Jones, Clinton declared Aug. 25, 2016, "even said, and this really just is so disgusting, he even said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there. I don’t know what happens in somebody’s mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that." The same day, Jones disputed Clinton’s statement, telling viewers of his Austin-based program that Clinton "lied, not only to the U.S. but the world... that I say that no children died at Sandy Hook and they were all actors. I’ve never said any of those things." A moment later, Jones went on: "They can’t find anywhere where I have said that I know the kids killed at Sandy Hook were actors or that it didn’t happen" and furthermore, he said, he’s been criticized by conspiracy theorists who maintain the Sandy Hook events were fake--"because I don’t buy into that." We were curious who was right, so we put Clinton’s statement to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. First, this background: 20 children and six adults died at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Dec. 14, 2012, at the hands of gun-carrying Adam Lanza, 20. Lanza had killed his mother at home before the school shooting, and then killed himself at the school as officers closed in. After her speech, Clinton’s campaign offered as backup to its claim about Jones and Sandy Hook part of its background paper quoting a June 23, 2016, story in the New Yorker magazine. The story said Jones incidentally had Trump on his program hours before the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings and Jones then "praised Trump, claiming that ninety per cent of his listeners were Trump supporters, and Trump had returned the favor, saying, ‘Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down,’" the story said, going on to say Jones had historically insisted various national tragedies were inside jobs and, reporter William Finnegan wrote, "Jones believes that no one was actually hurt at Sandy Hook — those were actors." An embedded link in the story points to a video snippet likely excerpted, we determined, from the second hour of Jones’ Jan. 13, 2015 show in which Jones was asked by a caller if he thinks that after Sandy Hook, there’s a "new level of sophistication" to authorities planting "flimsy evidence" on sites that "get everybody talking, going in the wrong direction" after incidents. Jones replied: "Yeah, when you’re trying to decipher cloak and dagger dirty tricks, it’s pretty hard to do. It’s just that then you learn that they were funded by western funding. Then you learn that it was the same (inaudible) connection, underwear bomber. Then those are big red flags that they were patsy provocateurs. The classic MO has been followed. "And then yeah, it kind of becomes a red herring to say the whole thing was staged--because they have staged events before. But then you learn the school had been closed and reopened, and you’ve got video of the kids going in circles in and out of the building, and they don’t call the rescue choppers for two hours, then they tear the building down and seal it, and they get caught using blue screens and a email by Bloomberg comes out in a lawsuit where he’s telling his people to get ready in the next 24 hours to capitalize on a shooting. "Yeah, so, Sandy Hook is a synthetic completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured. I couldn’t believe it at first. I knew they had actors there, clearly, but I thought they killed some real kids. And it just shows how bold they are, that they clearly used actors. I mean they even ended up using photos of kids killed in mass shootings here in a fake mass shooting in Turkey -- so yeah, or Pakistan. The sky is now the limit. I appreciate your call." Also, a web link below the video excerpt led us to check on Jones’ Dec. 28, 2014, episode in which the host, responding to a caller, called the Sandy Hook incident "a giant hoax." Jones elaborated: "The general public doesn’t know the school was actually closed the year before." Also: "They don’t know they had kids going in and out of the building as a photo opp." And, Jones said on that show: "But it took me about a year with Sandy Hook to come to grips with the fact that the whole thing was fake. I mean, I couldn’t believe it. I knew they jumped on it, used the crisis, hyped it up. But then I did deep research--and my gosh, it just pretty much didn’t happen." We found a little more Jones’ commentary. In a Sept. 24, 2014, episode of the show, Jones cited a story on the InfoWars webpage that day headlined, "FBI says no one killed at Sandy Hook." Jones then said, "According to FBI crime statistics at FBI.gov, no one died in 2012 in Sandy Hook. It shows no homicides in that town." By email, we tried to ask InfoWars staff about Jones’ comments and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Clinton said Jones "said that the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there." Clinton didn’t nail Jones’ wording. But the Austin broadcaster said quite clearly long before Clinton spoke that the day’s tragic events featured actors and also "pretty much didn’t happen." We find this statement True.

pomt-08667	"Senator Jeff Plale saved my job" -- and some 300 others at Bucyrus International.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/13/american-federation-children/wisconsin-state-sen-jeff-plale-saved-300-jobs-bucy/	The race between state Sen. Jeff Plale (D-South Milwaukee) and Milwaukee County Supervisor Chris Larson may be the hottest legislative contest in Sept. 14 primary. And that doesn’t even include what the candidates themselves are saying. The district, which stretches from Milwaukee’s blue-collar south suburbs to the city’s affluent east side, is heavily Democratic. But it has a sharp ideological split and Plale is again facing a challenge from the left, based on his support of private school choice and his role in killing a state global warming bill, among other issues. One outside group is attacking his voting record, another has come to his defense and voters have been buried in a pile of direct mail pieces featuring competing claims. On the pro-Plale side, the American Federation for Children-- a group that supports the Milwaukee private school voucher program -- is touting Plale’s role in retaining jobs at Bucyrus International, a maker of mining equipment and an important employer in his district. Former Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen, a Republican, heads the group’s state operation. One direct-mail piece features a photo of Wynn Sandahl, identified as a 12-year Bucyrus employee, on the cover with this quote: "It’s the honest truth. Senator Jeff Plale saved my job." It says on the back, "Milwaukee County almost lost 300 jobs. Then Senator Jeff Plale stood up for our community," and inside notes as a result "300 workers just like Wynn Sandahl still report for work everyday at Bucyrus." That’s some personalized constituent service. But what role did Plale, a state legislator, have in an issue that turned on the Obama administration and the U.S. Export-Import Bank? Export-Import banks are trade promotion agencies that provide financing for projects that, collectively, generate billions of dollars in business and stimulate economies. In this case, the U.S. Export-Import bank, funded by Congress, initially declined to support a $917 million loan to an India-based power company, which planned to use about $600 million to buy mining machines from Bucyrus. After the rejection, Bucyrus CEO Tim Sullivan started calling a host of local business leaders and elected officials to put pressure on the bank to overturn its decision. At stake, he said, were up to 1,000 company jobs, 300 at the South Milwaukee plant -- work that would go instead to an overseas supplier of the equipment. Among those Sullivan dialed was the state senator who represents South Milwaukee, Jeff Plale. A state legislator, of course, has little -- if any -- influence over a Washington agency that handles international trade matters. But having local officials line up with Bucyrus was important, said Tim Sheehy, president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce. "The list of folks who were helpful includes Sen. Plale," said Sheehy, who also credited U.S. Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold, both Democrats; U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Janesville), and Gov. Jim Doyle and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. As for Plale, Sheehy said: "He did more than his fair share in terms of helping." What did he do? A check of more than a dozen Journal Sentinel stories about the mining equipment deal found no mention of Plale. Plale told PolitiFact Wisconsin he attended a June 30 rally timed to coincide with a visit by Obama to Racine. Plale said he also called a contact in Chicago who he said was "close to (Obama chief of staff Rahm) Emanuel" and told the person -- whom he would not name -- that the Bucyrus matter was an important for his district. He asked that the message be forwarded to Emanuel. "Whether he did that or not, I don’t know," Plale said. The morning of June 30 -- hours before the president arrived in Racine -- the Export-Import Bank indicated that it would reconsider its decision. Although the matter won’t be settled for certain for weeks, the bank took another step in August 2010 that will allow the Bucyrus equipment sale. So, the jobs aren’t yet saved, but it appears they will be. Of course, the job the American Federation for Children is concerned about now is Jeff Plale’s. To support its claim, the only thing the group cites in the literature is a commerce association report on the impact of the deal, which says 1,000 jobs could be affected when suppliers are considered. That report makes no mention of Plale. So did Plale save the job of Bucyrus employee Wynn Sandahl and some 300 others, as the group claims? Plale did what was asked of him as a local lawmaker to pressure the Obama administration and the bank. But so did many, many others.

pomt-08048	"We are one of only two states to have eight consecutive months of declining unemployment. Twenty-one states had increased unemployment last month. Ours went down."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/03/ted-strickland/gov-ted-strickland-correct-about-improvements-ohio/	Gov. Ted Strickland said he figures at some point over the next few years voters will compare his leadership with that of incoming governor John Kasich, once Kasich has spent some time in office. "I don’t fear that comparison," Strickland said. Why? Because the Democratic leader insists that while he lost his bid for re-election in November to Kasich, he believes he has laid the foundation for Kasich to reap some success off of Strickland’s work. Take for example, joblessness. Kasich hammered Strickland during the campaign for the state’s double-digit, above-the-national-average unemployment rate. But in an exit interview with The Plain Dealer, Strickland said that his administration had begun to reverse that negative trend just in time for Kasich to now claim the credit. "We are one of only two states to have eight consecutive months of declining unemployment," Strickland said in the interview on Dec. 20. "Twenty-one states had increased unemployment last month. Ours went down." Politifact Ohio wanted to know if the outgoing governor had his facts right, particularly given how hard Kasich and the Republicans hammered him for the economy during the election. As it turns out, the governor is right on both accounts, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the U.S. Department of Labor. Ohio and Illinois are the only two states that have shown a drop in unemployment — typically by one-tenth of a percentage point, but a drop nonetheless — for every month from April through November. December figures are not yet available. And, indeed, unemployment increased in 21 states in November compared to October, according to the labor statistics seasonally adjusted figures, further highlighting Ohio’s gains. In fact, Ohio’s unemployment rate in November was 9.8 percent, drawing even with instead of hovering above the national average for the first time since December 2002, according Ohio Department of Job & Family Services Director Douglas Lumpkin. The national average increased in November from 9.6 to 9.8 percent. Five other states also have either shown a decline or stagnation since April from month to month but no increases in its unemployment rate: Michigan, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Vermont and Wisconsin. But only Ohio and Illinois have produced consistent drops. Strickland said the lower unemployment figures mean more people are finding work, a testament to his leadership. "Its not an accident," he told The Plain Dealer. "It is because I and my administration have managed the affairs of this state carefully and conservatively." Only time will tell whether the trend continues. If it does, will Strickland get the credit for laying the foundation, as he says, or will Kasich get the political clout from an improving jobs picture in Ohio? Either way, we rate Strickland’s statement True.	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2011-01-03T06:00:00	2010-12-20	['None']

pomt-10055	To give the proposed economic stimulus plan some perspective, "if you started the day Jesus Christ was born and spent $1 million every day since then, you still wouldn’t have spent $1 trillion."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/03/mitch-mcconnell/stimulus-plan-more-million-day-jesus-christ-was-bo/	In a CBS Face the Nation interview on Feb. 1, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky, sought to put the proposed economic stimulus bill into some sobering perspective. "You know, this is huge money," McConnell said. "This is — someone said the other day that, if you started the day Jesus Christ was born and spent $1 million every day since then, you still wouldn’t have spent $1 trillion.” The bill isn't that expensive yet — the House version is estimated at $819 billion — but the Senate is expected to add new programs and additional tax cuts that could increase the cost significantly. Both chambers are expected to keep the total pricetag under $1 trillion. We'll save you from counting zeros on your online calculator and give you our quick and dirty assessment of whether his analogy is right. First, a starting point. Biblical scholars may quibble about the actual birth date of Jesus Christ, but we're going to go with the fairly commonly accepted theory that it was around 4 B.C. That's right, it would mean Christ was actually born "Before Christ." Add that to Anno Domini time, and you come to 2012 years since the birth of Christ. So here goes our math: 2,012 times 365 (yes, we are aware there are leap years ... don't be like that) times $1,000,000. A: $734 billion (give or take a few hundred million). The stimulus package is actually short of $1 trillion too, $819 billion. But that's still more than a million bucks a day since the day Jesus was born. We find McConnell's staggering stat to be True.

pomt-07739	The stimulus bill "promised to keep unemployment under 8%."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/feb/28/george-allen/george-allen-says-barack-obama-promised-stimulus-w/	Republican U.S. Senate candidate George Allen doesn’t like President Barack Obama’s economic record or the stimulus bill. "Two years ago today, President Obama signed into law a $800 billion jobless stimulus bill that promised to keep unemployment under 8 percent," said Allen in a Feb. 17 statement. "Instead the American people have endured 21 consecutive months of 9 percent or higher unemployment, 2.6 million jobs have been lost, and our nation’s debt has hit a record-setting $14 trillion." On Monday we checked Allen’s claims about unemployment and job losses, rating them True. This piece examines his assertion that the stimulus "promised to keep unemployment under 8 percent." Allen, a former governor and U.S. senator, is not the only Republican peddling the claim. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and conservative pundit George Will have made similar statements. So did Virginia’s Eric Cantor, now House Majority Leader, back in July 2009. PolitiFact has ruled that they had their facts wrong. Allen’s are wrong, too. Obama warned upon taking office that if "dramatic action" were not taken, "the unemployment rate could reach double digits," with the recession lasting years. But neither we, nor our colleagues at PolitiFact’s Washington, D.C. bureau, could find evidence of anyone in the administration making a public pledge along the lines of "if we pass the stimulus, we promise unemployment will stay below 8 percent." We asked Allen’s campaign for the source of the candidate’s claim that that it was "promised" the stimulus bill would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. Katie Wright, Allen’s director of communications, pointed us to a Jan. 9, 2009, report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Other Republicans have also cited this as their source for past claims. Their report projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The study included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus, unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. As we all know now, the unemployment rate went higher. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and was at 9.4 percent in December. It fell to 9.0 percent in January. But what we saw from the administration in January 2009 was a projection, not a promise. And it was a projection that came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." There's also a footnote that goes with the chart that states: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action." That’s not a promise. It is an estimate and an admission that these predictions may not be accurate. And the administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong. In a July 2, 2009, interview, Romer said on Fox: "None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January. I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated." In January 2009 the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus. So, is the fact that unemployment rose, even as the stimulus unfolded, proof that it has failed? President Barack Obama has said, and many independent economists agree, that the stimulus has created more than a million jobs and kept the unemployment rate from going even higher than it has. In fairness, not every economist agrees with that. But there is an inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting. And how can you ever prove that if the unemployment rate got to X percent, it would or would not have gotten a point or two higher if not for the stimulus? The implication of Allen's comment is that a rising unemployment rate in 2009 proves the stimulus didn't work. Many economists don't agree -- and argue that without the stimulus, unemployment would have been worse -- but it's difficult to empirically prove one way or the other. The White House claimed the stimulus would improve the employment picture and applied that to the baseline for projected unemployment going forward. Allen and other Republicans argue Obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. The administration never characterized it that way. True, it’s projections were off, but the report contained plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had "significant margins of error" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a guarantee on an upper limit on unemployment. Allen is recycling a claim that should go to the dump.

pomt-07688	In the past decade, K-12 funding has grown six times faster than the rate of enrollment.	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/08/bob-mcdonnell/gov-bob-mcdonnell-says-education-funding-grew-six-/	On Feb. 24, PolitiFact Virginia rated as True a statement by Gov. Bob McDonnell that public education funding over the last decade grew six times faster than enrollment. We based that ruling on raw state budget and K-12 enrollment numbers. Subsequently, several readers pointed out that we did not factor in inflation. They were right, inflation accounted for most of the imbalance between increases in education and gains in enrollment. So we are changing our rating to Half True because there is some validity to McDonnell’s claim but his numbers are out of context. And we are providing a new analysis, which appears below. In the closing days of this winter’s General Assembly session, Gov. Bob McDonnell unsuccessfully tried to build support for a $50 million cut in public education funding. The governor told the Richmond Times-Dispatch, in a story that ran Feb. 20, that K-12 education funding has grown six times faster than enrollment over the last decade. We graded McDonnell’s math. His data was compiled by Dan Timberlake, Director of Virginia’s Department of Planning and Budget. Timberlake told us he decided to compare budget levels from the 2002 fiscal year with those currently allocated for the 2012 fiscal year, which will begin July 1. Timberlake said he measured three major, state-generated sources of education dollars: Virginia’s general fund, lottery proceeds and the Literary Fund. His figures did not include federal money and a few very small funding sources. General fund revenue primarily comes from income taxes on individuals, though it also includes some sales tax revenue, contract fees, and profits from the state-run liquor stores. The money pays for general services such as schools, public safety and health. Lottery funds, which were pulled from the general fund fund in 2007 and siphoned directly to education, provided $430.2 million to education last school year. The Literary Fund gets revenue from criminal fines, fees, and forfeitures, unclaimed property; unclaimed lottery winnings and interest on low-cost loans that are used for school construction projects. State funding from these three sources was $4.01 billion in the 2002 fiscal year and is slated to be $5.47 billion in the 2012 fiscal year. That’s an increase of 36.2 percent. Next Timberlake tracked student enrollment in the state’s public schools, and so did we. Enrollment grew from 1,147,673 in the fall of 2001 (which is in the 2002 fiscal year) to a projected level of 1,220,523 in the fall of 2011. That’s an increase of 6.3 percent. So education spending grew 36.2 percent while student numbers grew 6.3 percent. That would make the spending increase just shy of six times larger than the enrollment increase. But there’s a catch to these numbers: inflation accounted for most of the increase and McDonnell did not factor it into his equation. When your stir in the 22.5 percent rise in the national consumer price index over the last decade, you end up with a 13.7 percent inflation-adjusted increase to education spending. That’s slightly more than double the rate of enrollment growth. You get a similar result when consider the 23 percent inflation rate over the decade in Southern states, where the Bureau of Labor Statistics includes Virginia in its regional calculations. Unfortunately, BLS does not measure inflation in individual states. Why did new funding outpace enrollment over the last decade? Charles Pyle, director of communications for the Virginia Department of Education, said much of the money was needed to pay for Standards of Learning mandates the state set for public schools, including an algebra readiness initiative and early-reading program. Pyle said funding has also increased for pre-school initiatives that serve children not covered by the Head Start program. And he said major investments have been made to upgrade technology in schools. Additional funding has also been directed towards resource teachers in elementary schools and English-proficiency instructors. A closing note: The General Assembly ended up approving a $75 million increase for public schools before adjourning on Feb. 27. Let’s review. The governor claimed state K-12 funding grew six times faster than student enrollment during the past decade. According to the Virginia Department of Planning and Budget, education spending from state sources has climbed 36.2 percent in the past 10 years. During that period, the number of K-12 students in Virginia has climbed 6.3 percent. So McDonnell is technically right, but his claim is misleading. When you consider inflation over the last decade -- which the governor did not -- new spending slightly more doubled growth in enrollment. Much of that increase came from new Standards of Learning requirements that McDonnell strongly supported as a legislator. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-08678	"I’m the only one who's fought against developers draining the Everglades!"	false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/10/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-not-lone-defender-everglades/	In his first television ad of the general election, released on Sept. 7, 2010, U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek tries to distinguish himself from his fellow Senate hopefuls, Republican Marco Rubio and the independent candidate, Gov. Charlie Crist. The clip opens with Meek stepping into an airboat and zipping around the Everglades – an image that screams Florida. In his first claim on the 33-second video "Only One," Meek boasts of being "the only one who's fought against developers draining the Everglades!" The ad goes on through a litany of claims: "The only one against drilling before and after the BP spill. The only one against privatizing Social Security. The only one who's pro-choice, who took on George Bush, who's fought for middle-class tax cuts, against high credit card fees, and to raise the minimum wage." Such a wealth of fact-checking opportunities! We decided to start at the top, saving the Everglades. It seemed like such a bold claim that it warranted a closer look. We asked the Meek campaign to show us the proof that its candidate could lay claim to such bragging rights. Meek spokesman Adam Sharon noted that the Democratic contender had voted in favor of a 2007 bill that set aside funding for water resource construction and improvement projects, including $687.07 million for Everglades restoration. The Meek campaign also cited $135 million that Meek helped secure for Everglades Restoration in fiscal years 2009. These measures are clearly pro-Everglades but do they do much to keep developers out of the Everglades? We didn't see anything in the bills, and neither do others. "It has nothing to do with any restrictions on development in Florida," said Kirk Fordham, chief executive officer of the Everglades Foundation in Washington, D.C. Clearly, Meek is referring to his actions on federal legislation, and it isn't exactly a fair comparison. Former House Speaker Rubio and Gov. Crist aren't in the same position to vote; after all, they aren't federal lawmakers. "They didn't vote in the same body so you can't compare their voting records," said Fordham. Just as we had asked the Meek campaign to show us how he single-handedly stopped developers from draining the Everglades, we asked Crist and Rubio whether they've done anything to help the Everglades. Crist spokesman Danny Kanner quickly pointed to the governor's 2009 bid to buy out U.S. Sugar Corp. and convert its 180,000-plus acres to reservoirs and pollution-treatment marshes. The original plan with its $1.75 billion price tag has since been scaled back to $197 million and 26,800 acres, but a new deal gives the South Florida Water Management District options to buy all or part of the land for up to 10 years. Everglades advocates such as Fordham and Thom Rumberger, chairman of the Everglades Trust in Tallahassee, also point out that Crist has made key appointments favorable to the environment. Fordham noted how Crist -- compared to his developer-friendly predecessor, Jeb Bush -- appointed pro-environment types to the governing board of the South Florida Water Management District including Shannon Estenoz, Sandy Batchelor and Kevin Powers. Crist has also received some green recognition, including a "Champion of the Everglades" award in 2008 from Audubon of Florida. As the Meek campaign was quick to point out, Crist signed Senate Bill 2080 in 2009, which stripped the water board's authority over issuing consumptive use permits and gave it to the board’s directors, a move that prevented the public from making decisions on who gets water, how much and from where. "Everglades restoration depends on reducing the quantity of water taken from the environment," Audubon of Florida said in a statement May 21, 2009, that urged Crist to veto the bill. Still, "It would be hard to argue that Meek has a superior record to the governor," said Fordham, a major backer of the U.S. Sugar deal. "I know Crist has a pretty solid record on protecting and restoring the Everglades." For his part, Rubio voted when he was in the House in favor of a 2008 bill that authorized issuing bonds for Everglades restoration. It also doubled the maximum annual issuance amount from $100 million to $200 million. "The real work on the Everglades was being done at that time on the Senate side," said Eric Draper, executive director of the Audubon of Florida. "The House was more in a position of going along. I would characterize (Rubio) as going along, not as providing leadership." For Meek to claim he is the only one among the three to stop developers from draining the Everglades is decidedly not true. The Meek campaign cited bills he backed as evidence that he was pro-Everglades, but neither of the two bills stopped developers from draining the Everglades. Similarly, Crist and Rubio have also taken steps to back measures that support Everglades restoration. So we rate Meek's statement False.

Amanpour asked her guests if the plans in Wisconsin were "shared sacrifice." "Where is the sacrifice going to be borne the most? And is it equitable?" Amanpour asked. Donna Brazile, a Democratic strategist, said it wasn’t. "Just like the tea party went out there and grabbed the microphone, what you have is grassroots people out there saying, ‘No more,’ no more budget cuts on the back of working people," Brazile said. "The governor has proposed tax giveaways to corporations." "We're trying to balance the budgets on the backs of the poor and the middle class, and that's why workers are standing up for their rights," she said a little later in the program. The word "giveaway" is a loaded term for tax cuts, but we feel it’s fair to fact-check whether Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has proposed tax breaks for corporations while advocating budget cuts for public workers. Walker’s budget proposal asks state workers to pay more for their pensions and health insurance, which reduces take-home pay. But it also sets significant limits on collective bargaining power for most public sector unions, which has enraged union members and sparked protests at the state capitol. We next looked to see if Walker has proposed tax cuts for corporations. We found Walker has already signed bills that cut taxes for corporations. Walker signed a law on Jan. 31 that says that companies that relocate to Wisconsin will not have to pay corporate taxes for two years. The law stipulates that the company must move at least 51 percent of the workers on its payroll or at least those who account for $200,000 in wages. Walker also signed into law a bill that gives small tax breaks to companies that create jobs. It’s debatable whether these could fairly be considered "giveaways," since they are intended to reward companies for creating jobs. But Walker proposed additional tax breaks for business during the campaign for governor. PolitiFact Wisconsin documented those promises on PolitiFact’s Walk-O-Meter, a database of Walker’s campaign promises. That includes reducing taxes on employers and repealing the "combined reporting" requirement for business taxes, a measure that increased tax revenues and was approved in 2009. "If you elect me as your next governor, I’ll get government out of the way and lower the tax burden so Wisconsin business owners and factories can create 250,000 jobs and 10,000 businesses in our state by 2015," said Walker during the campaign. We also found that Walker told the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce during the campaign that he supported efforts to repeal the corporate income tax. Though it’s a fine distinction, we should note that we were not able to find statements from Walker proposing a repeal, so it’s not a promise listed in the Walk-O-Meter database. Brazile said, "The (Wisconsin) governor has proposed tax giveaways to corporations." The tax breaks he signed into law were linked to job growth, which means they were not necessarily "giveaways." But he has proposed lower taxes for all businesses. And he’s supported those tax cuts even in the face of a tight budget, saying they would lead to job growth. Because Brazile gets Walker’s basic position on business taxes right -- he wants them lower -- we rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-03106	"We’ve used (generally accepted accounting principles) here in this building the last two years."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/22/dale-kooyenga/accountant-says-state-using-tougher-accounting-sta/	Dale Kooyenga is a certified public accountant, though he says if he’s at a party, "accounting is not on my top 10 list of fun things to talk about." But as a Republican member of the Assembly, Kooyenga is plenty happy to discuss the accounting arts as part of the "CPA Caucus." When the group dug into the University of Wisconsin System’s books and publicized what members considered an overly large reserve fund, Gov. Scott Walker and GOP lawmakers wound up reducing the system’s budget increase. As a result, when Kooyenga talks accounting at the Capitol, people listen. Even when -- perhaps especially when -- he’s commenting on something as dry as Wisconsin’s poor national ranking on budget deficits as measured by "generally accepted accounting principles." Those principles, known as GAAP for short, are a core issue when it comes to how state government spends tax dollars. Kooyenga says adopting the principles would rule out "games," "deceptive accounting practices" and "gimmicks" that hold back the state’s credit rating and enable lawmakers to saddle future generations with unsustainable financial obligations. On Sept. 18, 2013, Kooyenga cited GAAP after hearing a state investment board official laud the fully-funded status of the state pension fund in testimony before the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Finance. "Before we applaud ourselves, there’s a reason that Wisconsin has a 100 percent funded pension system but we have the fourth-highest GAAP deficit in the country," Kooyenga said, mentioning a couple of the aforementioned accounting gimmicks. "So I hope we can work on that over time -- which we have." He concluded: "We’ve used GAAP accounting here in this building the last two years." That last phrase is worth checking, because the back-and-forth over budgets is heating up as we approach the 2014 gubernatorial race. Gov. Scott Walker actually campaigned on GAAP as an issue in 2010, contending that then-Gov. Jim Doyle had falsely claimed the state’s budget was balanced. He promised to balance the budget not only by the usual Madison standard, but also under the GAAP scorecard -- and to do it in every budget, just as local units of government do. State lawyers long ago said the constitutional requirement to balance the state budget could be done mostly on a simple cash basis -- not the accrual method called for by GAAP. And that’s been just fine with the political set in Madison. Why? Lawmakers and the governor would have to cut $2 billion to $3 billion more from the budget to fully balance under the more stringent GAAP standards. That $2 billion to $3 billion represents the "GAAP deficit." And it’s been in that range most years since 2002. So, how has GAAP been applied in recent years? Talk of change aside, the fact remains that neither party and no governor -- including Walker -- has balanced the budget without a GAAP deficit since the state started tracking it in 1990. We gave Walker a Promise Broken when his first proposed budget (2011-’13) not only left a GAAP deficit intact, but increased the size of it, to $3 billion. The governor’s second budget (2013-’15) went even further the other way, estimating a 29 percent increase in that deficit. Those facts put Kooyenga’s claim into a hole right off the bat. Neither budget was prepared using GAAP or balanced by those principles. And Kooyenga supported both budgets. Kooyenga’s case We spoke with Kooyenga and checked the long history of GAAP deficits and found an element of truth in his claim, which is vague enough to leave it open to some interpretation. Kooyenga referred to the "last two years," 2011 and 2012. That coincides with his first two years in office and with Walker’s first two-year budget. Looking just at the final adopted version of that budget, it turns out that some tangible GAAP progress was made. That’s mainly because after Walker submitted his spending plan, a new revenue estimate gave lawmakers another $600 million to play with. Lawmakers chose to use a big chunk of the windfall to pay some big bills left behind from Doyle’s days -- a move that cut significantly into the GAAP deficit. We now know, based on actual results, that the first year of that budget (2011-’12) saw nearly an $800 million drop in the size of the GAAP deficit. It was the first drop in eight years, though it still left a long ways to go to be fully balanced under GAAP. As for year two, we won’t know the results until the books are closed on 2013. But experienced forecasters in the independent Legislative Fiscal Bureau and at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance say the GAAP deficit is very likely to shrink again. Walker and his Republican legislative allies have rejuvenated the state’s rainy day fund, and fund balances are running well into the black, both of which are positive factors in driving down the GAAP number. That, Kooyenga told us, is in part what he was referring to when he said "we’ve used GAAP." The "we" in his statement, he said, refers also to the CPA Caucus. That caucus has publicly tracked and reported how budget decisions look under GAAP. And Kooyenga went door to door in the Assembly to get bipartisan support for a constitutional amendment requiring the use of GAAP principles. That measure passed the Assembly in 2012 but died in the Senate. Still, the state continues to use accounting maneuvers such as manipulating the timing of huge aid payments to local governments and schools into future fiscal years. Such moves help elected officials balance the budget on paper -- but run afoul of GAAP. Those maneuvers were in the final version of the 2011-13 budget. Our rating Kooyenga said "We’ve used (generally accepted accounting principles) here in this building the last two years." State officials, including Kooyenga and his caucus, have partially "used" significant moves to improve the GAAP deficit picture, and they have increased public awareness of it. But those principles certainly haven’t been fully put to use; not even close. Most of the GAAP deficit remained after those two years. And left unmentioned by Kooyenga is that much of the progress in decreasing it is projected to be reversed in fiscal 2014 and 2015. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-00708	Says Baltimore police are "trained by Mossad and Shin Bet."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/29/nation-islam-research-group/nation-islam-group-says-israeli-security-trained-b/	We’ve seen plenty of claims in recent days about the unrest in Baltimore. One that caught our attention was a tweet from an account associated with the Nation of Islam. It read, "#Baltimore police trained by Israel Mossad & Shin Bet. More planned." The Mossad is Israel’s foreign intelligence service and the Shin Bet is its internal counter-intelligence agency. They roughly correspond to the American CIA and FBI. So, are the Mossad and Shin Bet working with Baltimore police? No. Nation of Islam researchers included a link in their tweet that sent us to a page on the Baltimore County Police Department website. While county police were called in to assist during the riots, they are not the city police. The link includes no information or evidence that county police were trained by Mossad and Shin Bet. What that website says is that county police offered optional training for officers interested in a martial art called Krav Maga (pronounce ma-GAA). Krav Maga does have a strong connection with Israel. It was developed by the Israeli Defense Force in the earliest years of the country’s existence. It emphasizes quick and debilitating counter attacks in one-on-one combat. The instructor mentioned on the Baltimore County webpage was Jon Pascal, who had spent 15 years with the Los Angeles County Police Department. There is nothing to suggest that Pascal is a Mossad or Shin Bet agent. Krav Maga combines elements of wrestling, boxing and jiu-jitsu. The introductory sessions focus on stripping a knife or gun from an armed attacker, escaping chokeholds, restraining holds, and delivering blows that incapacitate an attacker. Elementary training in Krav Maga is not uncommon among American police departments. A local news report from Pittsburgh, Pa., featured officers from the Pittsburgh and Mt. Lebanon, Pa., police departments. An instructor with Krav Maga Maryland lists among his clients officers from Baltimore City, Montgomery, Howard and Prince George’s counties, as well as the Maryland State Police and the Capitol Police. According to that Maryland group, over 400 law enforcement agencies have used some level of Krav Maga training since 1981. We tried to reach Nation of Islam Research but no one answered at the phone number listed, nor did we get a reply to a message sent through the Nation of Islam website. Our ruling The Nation of Islam Research group said that police in Baltimore had been trained by Mossad and Shin Bet. The source they cited referred to optional training in Krav Maga for the wrong police department and listed a trainer who gained experience in Los Angeles. There’s no evidence of any training ties to Israel. This claim is utterly unproven. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-07448	An Internet sweepstakes cafe is "a legitimate business that has been vetted and found to be completely legal in the state."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/apr/20/peter-nehr/internet-sweepstakes-cafes-gambling-loophole-or-il/	A Pinellas County legislator is at odds with his local sheriff over whether an Internet sweepstakes cafe the lawmaker has opened is against the law. State Rep. Peter Nehr's business, Fun City Sweepstakes sells phone cards. But as the St. Petersburg Times reported on April 20, 2011, for every $1 a person spends on a card, they also get 100 sweepstakes points to use at one of the business' 45 desktop computers. The computers can simulate the spinning images of a casino slot machine. You spin, and win, or lose. If you win, you can collect the winnings from the cashier. Pinellas County Sheriff Jim Coats says he believes the sweepstakes businesses constitute gambling. "As far as I'm concerned, they are illegal," Coats said. But Nehr disagrees. "This is a legitimate business that has been vetted and found to be completely legal in the state," he told the Times. "I'm entitled like anyone else to open a legal business to earn money for my family." Nehr sounded so sure about his business -- saying that it "has been vetted and found to be completely legal" -- that we wanted to check it out. Our analysis concludes the law is murkier than Nehr lets on. Let us explain. Gambling is currently illegal in Florida except in places where it is specifically permitted -- dog and horse tracks and on Indian land. Nehr's business, and others like it across the state, operate not as gambling businesses but instead offer promotions for purchasing a service. Nehr says it's like McDonald's restaurants that sell sodas with a scratch-off, or Monopoly tickets. But in the case of Fun City Sweepstakes, Nehr gives customers who purchase a phone card an opportunity to win a casino-style sweepstakes game. In 2007, the police chief of Cedar Grove, near Panama City, wrote to then-Attorney General Bill McCollum about a similar sweepstakes parlor to ask whether the business was violating state gambling laws as set out in state statutes. McCollum responded, basically, that it's not clear. "The machine or device that is the subject of your inquiry may be a gambling device within the scope of section 849.16, Florida Statutes. Moreover, the sweepstakes involved may be a lottery. Both of these enterprises are illegal in the State of Florida. Gambling activities may not be disguised as a 'game promotion' under the terms of section 849.094, Florida Statutes, in an effort to avoid the criminal sanctions attendant to violations of Florida's gambling laws," McCollum wrote. "In sum, it is my opinion that a determination of whether a particular game or contest violates the provisions of Chapter 849, Florida Statutes, is initially a determination that must be made by local law enforcement based on the particular facts of each case. If the Tel-Phone (the game specifically cited in the Cedar Grove case) game does contain an element of chance inherent in the machine which determines the outcome of the game, the game may be characterized as a slot machine within the meaning of section 849.15, Florida Statutes. However, this office recognizes that the ultimate determination of whether Florida's gambling laws may have been violated must be made by local law enforcement agencies." The ambiguity has left law enforcement and prosecutors in a tough spot. The fundamental question: Is it worth the time and effort and resources to prosecute a business that may or may not be breaking the law? So members of the Florida Legislature are considering legislation that would ban the type of business altogether. Rep. Scott Plakon, R-Longwood, has sponsored HB 217 to prohibit the use of simulated gaming for promotional purposes. (His bill is moving through the committee process, while a Senate companion has yet to be heard.) A legislative analysis of the bill provides an excellent overview of the issue. The analysis of the bill says there are questions over the legality of the sweepstakes games, and that different counties have handled them differently. Seminole County, for instance, passed an ordinance to ban all simulated gambling devices -- though that ordinance is being challenged as an unconstitutional limitation on free speech. Other counties, including Baker and Leon, have considered ordinances that ban the games. There have been just a few cases involving Internet sweepstakes cafes brought to court. And no one has been found guilty of gambling charges. In Marion County, the owners of an Internet sweepstakes cafe like Nehr's were found not guilty on gambling charges in October 2010, the Ocala Star-Banner reported on Oct. 18. "We're going to see if the State Attorney gets the message," said Kelly Mathis, the Jacksonville attorney who represented the sweepstakes cafe owner. "They (prosecutors) put on their best case, and they still can't show there was a violation of criminal law." Other cases in Marion and Sumter counties were either dismissed, or prosecutors decided against pursuing a conviction. In an April 2011 case in Brevard County, the state dropped felony gambling charges against an Internet sweepstakes cafe owner in exchange for the business owner agreeing to plead no contest to a misdemeanor count of not properly advertising her sweepstakes promotion. No case has been reviewed by an appellate judge. Where does this leave us? Nehr said his Internet sweepstakes cafe is "a legitimate business that has been vetted and found to be completely legal in the state." Yes, it's true that no one has been found guilty of a crime for running a business like Nehr's, and some in the Legislature are trying to make the games explicitly illegal. But that doesn't mean the games themselves have been found to be completely legal. McCollum, the former attorney general, issued an opinion saying they might be illegal, and many think that, in fact, they are. There's no doubt the business was created in a way to work around existing gambling laws. The question is whether it successfully operates within a loophole, or comes too close to illegal gambling. Either way, it's a stretch for Nehr to say the operation has been vetted and is completely legal. So we rate this statement Half True.

pomt-02812	"Republicans have proposed dozens of (health care) solutions designed to help control costs and improve quality."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/26/ron-johnson/johnson-said-republicans-have-proposed-dozens-solu/	As Republicans continue to score points bashing the early struggles of President Barack Obama’s health care reform law, the common refrain from Democrats is to claim their GOP counterparts lack an alternative. It has fit neatly into their characterization of Republicans as the party of "no." For their part, Republicans have consistently said that’s not the case. "Throughout the health care debate, Republicans have proposed dozens of solutions designed to help control costs and improve quality — without surrendering control of your personal health care decisions to nameless bureaucrats in Washington," said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., during the Republican national address Nov. 17. The question of how Republicans would replace Obamacare has come up before, and it will remain a major part of the argument over the law’s future throughout the 2014 midterms. There’s a big difference between no solutions, as Democrats surmise, and dozens, as Johnson claims. So who is right? We decided to investigate. How we got here We asked Johnson’s office to provide evidence of the "dozens of solutions" Republicans have put forth. His staff sent us a list of 24 Republican proposals released over the years, starting with President George W. Bush’s call for health reforms in 2007. At this point, let’s pause for some important political and parliamentary realities. In 2009 and 2010 when the health care law worked its way through Congress and onto Obama's desk, Republicans were in the minority in both the Senate and House. During the initial debate, Republicans circulated many ideas and put forth many bills. None of them gained enough support within the GOP to become a clear conservative alternative to Obamacare, and even if they had, it was unlikely Democrats would go along. Republicans had even less interest in capitulating with Democrats and working with them on the Affordable Care Act. Not a single Republican voted for the final version Obama signed into law. We reviewed the list of legislation Johnson’s office sent us. With a handful of exceptions, the bills are partial or full retreads of each other and share similar ideas. Some actually include provisions of Obamacare, such as allowing young people to stay on their parents’ plans or making it harder for insurance companies to drop people with pre-existing conditions. Johnson’s camp said the Republican senator doesn’t necessarily support all the proposals, but they show that Republicans have been active players in the debate. We reviewed Johnson’s list of 24 proposals. We found the ideas in them tend to fall along the following six lines: Tax incentives A bevy of proposals provide tax breaks or credits to incentivize the uninsured to purchase coverage on the individual market and make it cheaper for those already with coverage. One put up by the Republican Study Committee with more than 100 cosponsors would give a $7,500 deduction to individuals and $20,000 to families. To pay for the deductions, that bill would also eliminate a long-standing tax break on employer-provided insurance. So while some new faces would get insurance on the individual market, the out-of-pocket expenses would likely go up for many Americans, especially those who get good coverage through work. Another bill from Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., gives a tax credit of $5,000 to families at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, about $47,000. Both proposals aim to improve the affordability of insurance for low-income individuals, and while it could shift the cost curve down for some people, it would not dramatically transform the cost of care. Allow insurance companies to sell policies across state lines Right now, insurance companies may not sell a policy in multiple states. Republicans want to open up the borders, saying it would increase competition and allow market forces to push down prices. Opponents caution that insurance companies will flock to states with the loosest regulations and sell policies from there. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted savings of about $12 billion from 2007-15, but most experts did not believe it would dramatically impact the cost of insurance or entice more people to sign up. The CBO predicts it would mean cheaper premiums for healthier individuals and more costly insurance for those who have health issues and are already paying a lot. That’s the opposite goal of health care reform. Tort reform Tort reform would change statutes regarding medical malpractice lawsuits, which Republicans say lead to frivolous claims and legal costs. It saves money, but it’s nothing to write home about. In 2010, the CBO said modest reforms, such as capping noneconomic damages at $250,000 and punitive damages at $500,000, would save $54 billion in federal spending over the next 10 years. Such a move would also reduce medical liability insurance and eliminate some threat of lawsuits that push doctors to prescribe unnecessary medical tests, decreasing overall health care costs by 0.5 percent. Health savings accounts Health savings accounts allow individuals to set aside money from each paycheck, before taxes, for future medical care. Republicans hope health savings accounts encourage individuals to be frugal and conscientious spenders on their health care, which would drive down the overall costs. But an expansion would cost the federal government $4.7 billion in lost revenue. Creation of high-risk pools Republican plans have called for about $25 billion to support states that create high-risk pools for sicker patients who have a hard time getting coverage on the individual markets. We’ve talked to experts in the past who have said that’s probably not enough to make it a viable option for the states or the consumers, since the insurance would have to be heavily subsidized to make it cost-effective. Allow trade associations and small business to purchase insurance as a group Since at least 2000, Republicans have pushed for something called Association Health Plans, which allow some small businesses to pool together and buy insurance as a group. However, this would impact a small portion of the population and just 600,000 of the 47 million uninsured people would gain coverage, according to the CBO. A larger pool would lower rates for small business employees already purchasing coverage and healthy individuals. But it would also mean higher premiums for most other insured individuals "because a disproportionate share of enrollees with lower-than-expected health care costs would leave the regulated market to obtain insurance through an AHP, thereby increasing the average expected health care costs of those remaining in the regulated market," the CBO said. About quality While some of these proposals could shift the cost curve down, nothing we came across would directly impact quality of care, as Johnson claimed. We ran the list by a panel of experts as well, and many of them agreed. "Johnson may be exaggerating a bit numerically, but the more important point is that the Republican plans would do next to nothing to improve quality, extend coverage, or control spending growth," said Henry Aaron, a health policy expert at the Brookings Institute. William Dow, a professor of health care economics and head of the University of California Berkeley Division of Health Policy and Management, largely agreed. "There is little here that would improve quality," he said. "Some could have minor effects on controlling costs." Our ruling Johnson said, "Republicans have proposed dozens of solutions designed to help control costs and improve quality" of health care in the United States. Republicans have circulated quite a few bills and ideas over the years, but there is almost nothing in most of the GOP proposals that directly addresses quality of care. As far as costs, most of the proposals have winners and losers. Some of the bills would make health care more affordable for certain individuals, and tort reform and the expansion of health savings accounts could bend the cost curve down slightly. Elements of Johnson’s claim are at least partially accurate, but in the aggregate, the plans are far from substantial. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-07777	Hitler "abolished unions and that’s what" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is "doing today."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/22/lena-taylor/wisconsin-state-sen-lena-taylor-d-milwaukee-says-h/	Some explosive rhetoric followed the political grenade that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker lobbed Feb. 11, 2011, when he proposed rolling back collective-bargaining rights for public employees as part of a budget-repair bill. Much of it, we have found, missed the mark. Wisconsin doesn’t have a budget deficit, it’s on track for a surplus: False. Walker’s proposal would leave collective bargaining for public employees "fully intact": Pants on Fire. Madison protests against the plan have led to riots: Pants on Fire. Now comes a statement comparing the Republican governor to one of history’s most evil despots. "The history of Hitler," Wisconsin state Sen. Lena Taylor told a reporter on Feb. 15, 2011, "in 1933, he abolished unions, and that’s what our governor’s doing today." The Wisconsin Republican Party said it videotaped the Milwaukee Democrat’s statement and a similar one she made the same day at one of the many Madison rallies called to protest Walker’s plan. Signs at some of those demonstrations compared Walker to Hitler, but Taylor’s claims stand out. The eight-year state lawmaker, who lost a bid to unseat Walker as Milwaukee County executive in 2008, also wrote Feb. 17, 2011, on the Twitter social networking website: "LIKE HITLER in 1933, WALKER is busting unions." So, is Walker trying to abolish unions in the manner Hitler did? We asked Taylor for evidence. In an e-mail, she cited several points that she said show Walker has a "legislative goal of union busting in the coming years, if not in this (legislative) session." Taylor pointed out that Walker’s budget-repair bill -- which contains the collective bargaining changes -- limits public employee unions to negotiating wages, not fringe benefits and other matters, and requires them to be re-certified each year through employee votes. Taylor also pointed out that as a state lawmaker, Walker supported right-to-work legislation, which prohibits unions from negotiating contracts with employers that require employees to pay union dues or fees. To be sure, the bill curtails collective-bargaining rights, and many opponents say it would effectively cripple unions that represent state, local government and public school employees. It does not, however, "abolish" unions as Taylor claims. Indeed, some public employee unions -- those covering public safety -- are exempt. And it does not affect private-sector unions, which are created under federal law. In defending her statement about Walker, the only reference Taylor made to Hitler’s actions was that he abolished German unions on May 2, 1933. Let’s look more closely at what Hitler did that year. Reviewing a transcript of the opening statement of the chief U.S. counsel in the Nuremberg Trials, we found the Nazis: Seized all funds of labor unions and arrested union leaders, sending them to concentration camps. Ordered that no workers organizations, except ones created by Hitler, would exist. Replaced collective bargaining with Hitler-appointed "trustees" to regulate the conditions of all labor contracts. So, Hitler abolished all unions and collective bargaining by decree, not with legislation. And he used force to liquidate the unions that did exist. The sheer scope of all of Hitler’s actions, not just those affecting unions, led the Jewish Community Relations Council of the Milwaukee Jewish Federation to condemn "the hyperbolic use of Nazi and Holocaust references" by protesters in the budget repair bill debate. While some protesters outside the Wisconsin Capitol have used images of the German dictator, the more pervasive cry has been chants of: "This is what democracy looks like." Indeed, the changes in Madison are the direct result of Wisconsin voters making a historic change in who controls state government -- turning over the governor’s office, as well as control of the Senate and Assembly, to Republicans. In response to Walker’s targeting of collective bargaining, groups are considering recalling some of the GOP senators, while other groups are eyeing a recall of Democratic senators. That, too, is part of the democratic process. And Taylor and the other Democrats who went to Illinois to prevent a Senate vote on the bill have not been brought back to Madison by force. They argue they are simply using a tool available to them in the democracy. Let’s return to the statement. Taylor said Hitler abolished unions "and that’s what our governor’s doing today." Walker has not proposed abolishing any unions. His budget-repair bill would prohibit some government workers from joining unions and it would curtail the collective bargaining rights of most public employees. But Walker cannot order any of the changes; they would have to be approved by the Legislature, put in place by voters in November 2010. Hitler, by fiat, not only ended all collective bargaining, he abolished all unions, seized their funds and sent their leaders to concentration camps. Taylor’s comparison is ridiculously extreme. It deserves our most extreme rating: Pants on Fire.	None	Lena Taylor	None	None	None	2011-02-22T13:13:59	2011-02-15	['Wisconsin', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']

My opponent will raise them."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/04/john-mccain/obama-cuts-taxes-for-some-though/	In his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minn., presidential nominee John McCain made the case for his candidacy. His speech highlighted personal biography and policy positions. At times it made contrasts between McCain and Democratic nominee Barack Obama. "We believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of Americans," McCain said. "Government that doesn't make your choices for you, but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself. I will keep taxes low and cut them where I can. My opponent will raise them." McCain is partially right that Obama will raise taxes. Obama intends to roll back the Bush administration's tax cuts on people with incomes of $250,000 for couples and $200,000 for singles. McCain, on the other hand, wants to leave the Bush tax cuts in place for all income levels. But Obama's proposals also include a number of tax cuts for people who make less than those amounts. Obama advocates eliminating income taxes for seniors with incomes less than $50,000. He also proposes a $1,000 tax credit on income for working families ($500 for singles), to offset payroll taxes. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group, has extensively analyzed both candidates tax plans and published a report on their findings. "The Obama plan would reduce taxes for low- and moderate-income families, but raise them significantly for high-bracket taxpayers," the report concluded. "By 2012, middle-income taxpayers would see their after-tax income rise by about 5 percent, or nearly $2,200 annually. Those in the top 1 percent would face a $19,000 average tax increase — a 1.5 percent reduction in after-tax income." Given this analysis, McCain abbreviates Obama's plan too much. Obama's tax plan includes tax cuts for many. We rate McCain's statement that Obama will raise taxes to be Half True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-09-04T00:00:00	2008-09-04	['None']

Don’t worry about his fellow Republican rivals, Christie said, worry about the Democrats and Hillary Clinton, who is "coming for your wallet." "If anybody believes the stuff they heard from that Democratic debate a few weeks ago, there’s nothing for free," Christie said. "What they forgot to tell was that they’re going to raise your tax rates to 70 or 80 percent in order to provide all of that stuff." Several of you asked us to look into whether Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley want to hike up taxes to 70 or 80 percent. The Christie camp told us that it’s been widely reported that Sanders "doesn’t flinch" over returning to a 90 percent top marginal tax rate. But that’s not the same thing as a tax increase of 70 or 80 percent for the average taxpayer (Christie earned a Pants on Fire for his statement last debate that Sanders wants a 90 percent rate for ordinary Americans). Nor does that prove that Clinton and O’Malley also want a tax rate, top marginal or otherwise, of 70, 80 or 90 percent. None of the three Democrats have released formal tax plans, but spokespeople for Clinton and Sanders said Christie’s statement is "ridiculous" and "completely false." Tax analysts also told us that there’s nothing in what Clinton, Sanders and O’Malley have said so far that suggest rates that high. The tax plans Here’s what each candidate has proposed so far, according to analysis by the free market-oriented Tax Foundation and the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, as well as our own research: Clinton’s tax plan Sanders’ tax plan O’Malley’s tax plan • Makes the higher education tax credit permanent and creates a credit for out-of-pocket health care costs • Repeals the Cadillac tax in the Affordable Care Act • Creates medium-term capital gains rates between 24 and 39.6 percent (current short-term rate is 39.6 percent and long-term rate is 20 percent) • Creates a 15 percent tax credit for companies that share profits with workers • Creates a high-frequency trading tax • Eliminates carried interest loopholes • Raises the top marginal income tax rate from 39.6 percent to above 50 percent • Creates a net investment income surtax of 10 percent • Raises capital gains and dividends tax rates to the level of income taxes • Raises the top estate tax rate from 40 percent to 65 percent (estates under $3.5 million would be exempt) • Repeals the Cadillac tax in the Affordable Care Act • Raises the payroll tax of 12.4 percent to 12.8 percent • Eliminates deferral on foreign income • Creates a $20 per ton carbon tax • Creates a financial transaction tax • Creates a Wall Street speculation tax • Eliminates the cap on Social Security taxes • Repeals the Cadillac tax in the Affordable Care Act • Creates a financial transaction tax Compared to the Republicans’ tax plans, the Democrats’ proposals are less detailed and make minor changes to the current system, said the Tax Policy Center’s Roberton Williams. He and other experts emphasized that no Democrat has offered a detailed tax plan with specific rates, let alone rates as high as Christie says. "It does not seem likely that the Democratic candidates intend to levy very high rates on the median American household," said Scott Greenberg, an analyst with the Tax Foundation. "Christie’s claim is more of a statement of ‘there’s no such thing as free lunch,’ " observed Bill Smith, the managing director of the tax consulting firm CBIZ MHM, adding, "But I don’t think any of one of (the Democrats) in their wildest dreams would raise taxes to 70 or 80 percent across the board." Not exactly ‘your tax rates’ Both Greenberg and the Williams pointed out that it’s plausible that the Democratic candidates would increase the rate on top earners. But that’s not the same thing as raising "your tax rates to 70 or 80 percent." "It may be necessary to raise top individual tax rates to levels such as 70 or 80 percent to fund Democratic candidates’ spending proposals without increasing the deficit or taxing middle- and low-income Americans," he said, referring us to a Wall Street Journal analysis of the price tag of Sanders’ proposals. As we’ve previously noted, Sanders has said he doesn’t think a top marginal tax rate of 90 percent would be too high. And he’s specifically proposed to raise the top rate from its current rate of 39.6 percent to above 50 percent. In other words, for individuals making more than $400,000 a year (roughly the threshold for the top 1 percent of incomes), any amount they make above $400,000 would be taxed at 50 percent. The income earned below $400,000 is taxed at lower rates. Sanders has also proposed to raise the top estate tax to 65 percent, which would affect estates worth more than $1 billion (there are 537 individuals with that much wealth in the United States today). Again, both of those top rates would affect just a tiny fraction of Americans. Sanders’ proposal to increase the federal payroll tax from 12.4 to 12.8 percent would hit everyone — but that’s nowhere near 70 or 80 percent. Clinton and O’Malley, for their parts, haven’t said anything specific about raising income or estate tax rates. But like Sanders, their proposals would mostly affect the wealthy and still not at the levels Christie is suggesting. Take for example, Clinton’s proposal to raise taxes on capital gains, the profits that come from selling an asset like a stock or property. In 2014, 42 percent of these investments, about $305 billion out of $722 billion, came from the top 0.1 percent, reported PolitiFact Virginia. Currently, the short-term rate is 39.6 percent (the same as income), but it decreases to 20 percent once you’ve held on to that stock for longer than a year. Clinton’s plans adds four additional brackets for investments held between one and six years. The highest rate proposed by Clinton, 39.6 percent, still doesn’t come close to Christie’s purported 70 or 80 percent. Our ruling Christie said the Democrats plan "to raise your tax rates to 70 to 80 percent." We understand the spirit of Christie’s statement, but that doesn’t make it accurate. None of the three Democrats running have proposed raising rates to 70 or 80 percent for the average taxpayer or is it likely that they will. Christie is exaggerating the rate hikes proposed by the Democrats, the amount of people they’ll affect or both. We rate Christie’s claim False.

pomt-13755	Says Ted Cruz "never denied" his father was photographed with Lee Harvey Oswald.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/jul/22/donald-trump/pants-fire-claim-ted-cruz-never-denied-father-phot/	Donald Trump, fresh off triumphantly accepting the Republican presidential nomination in Cleveland, surprisingly revived an explosive unfounded tale related to someone with no chance of beating him in November. The day after the 2016 Republican National Convention, Trump said his vanquished Republican rival, Sen. Ted Cruz, had never denied that his father was in a 1963 photo with Lee Harvey Oswald, who went on to assassinate President John F. Kennedy that November. At a rally, Trump initially told supporters he doesn’t want the backing of Cruz, whose convention speech two days earlier drew boos for not including a Trump endorsement; the Texan did offer congratulations. Next, Trump resurrected his unconfirmed claim about Oswald and Rafael Cruz, the senator’s father, possibly knowing one another. Trump said: "All I did is point out the fact that on the cover of the National Enquirer there was a picture of him and crazy Lee Harvey Oswald having breakfast. Now, Ted never denied that it was his father. Instead he said, ‘Donald Trump.’ I had nothing to do with it. This was a magazine that frankly, in many respects, should be very respected." In May 2016, PolitiFact found incorrect and ridiculous--Pants on Fire--Trump’s claim that Cruz’s father was with Oswald before Kennedy’s assassination. There was no evidence the man next to Oswald in the black-and-white photo published in the Enquirer was the elder Cruz. Notably, facial recognition experts advised that no such match could be made; meantime, historians found no corroborating records. The Enquirer never said how it determined the man in the photo with Oswald was Rafael Cruz. Could it still be that Sen. Cruz never denied his father was in the photo? To our inquiry on this point, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out a statement the Cruz campaign gave to the McClatchy News Service in April 2016 at the time the photo in question was printed on the Enquirer’s cover. The Cruz campaign’s communications director, Alice Stewart, said then: "The story is false; that is not Rafael in the picture,"according to the Miami Herald’s April 22, 2016 news story. Stewart’s "not Rafael" declaration appears to have gotten play. We found it in stories or web posts on the McClatchy website and for the conservative web network The Blaze plus in the International Business Times, on the FactCheck.org fact-checking site and on sites for Yahoo! News, The Hill, Gawker, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. Trump first cited the Enquirer article during a May 3, 2016, telephone interview with the Fox News program, Fox and Friends. Later that day, at an Indiana campaign event, Cruz spoke to reporters, saying: "This morning Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Let’s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position, this is just kooky." Cruz said the Enquirer "just spread lies, blatant lies" and described the article as "this idiotic story about JFK." Also, on May 3, 2016, Ben Jacobs, political reporter for the Guardian, tweeted a statement regarding the claim that Jacobs generally attributed to the Cruz campaign. It said: "It’s embarrassing that anyone would enable Trump to discuss this. It’s a garbage story and clearly Donald wants to talk about garbage." The same day, Rafael Cruz told ABC News in a TV interview that the links insinuated between him and Oswald were "ludicrous." "I was never in New Orleans at that time," he said. Our ruling Trump said the day after the Republican convention that Cruz "never denied" his father was pictured with Oswald before Kennedy’s assassination. This spring, Cruz called the National Enquirer story "lies." Earlier, a Cruz camp spokeswoman said outright the elder Cruz wasn’t in the published photo. That's far enough from "never denied," it makes Trump's claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-03308	"I was filibustered."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/jul/29/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-ohio-says-he-was-once-filibustered/	Whew. We almost lost the filibuster. We’re being facetious, of course, because most Americans go through life happily without knowing -- or necessarily needing to know -- the rules of the United States Senate. But for those who care about the art of blocking nominees or killing legislation, today’s fact-check is for you. "I was filibustered." That statement comes not from Richard Cordray, the newly confirmed director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after a long filibuster (hang on, we’ll get to the definition), but from one of the U.S. senators who helped block him: Ohio’s Rob Portman. Portman, a Republican, made the statement to reporters during a conference call on July 11, when Cordray’s inability to get an up-or-down confirmation vote was coming to a head and Senate Democrats threatened to change the filibuster rules. As the Cordray matter came up, Portman reminded reporters, "I was filibustered." Really? We knew that Portman, then a House of Representatives member representing the Cincinnati area, had some difficulty when President George W. Bush nominated him to be the United States trade representative in 2005. But we did not recall anyone standing in the Senate well reading a phone book or "War and Peace" or speaking for hours to block Portman’s confirmation vote. Nor did we recall a long cloture fight -- a battle to win 60 votes, or a three-fifths majority, to end debate. These are what generally come to mind when the word "filibuster" (which comes from a Dutch word meaning "pirate," according to the Senate) is used. In Portman’s case, there was no floor battle. Rather, several weeks after Portman’s March 17, 2005, nomination, a single Democratic senator, Evan Bayh of Indiana, told the chamber’s leaders that he thought Bush was way too lax with China’s trade abuses and so he was placing a "hold" on Portman’s nomination as Bush’s trade ambassador. Bayh said at the time that before he could let the nomination move forward, he wanted a vote on a bipartisan bill to impose duties on subsidized imports from China. He and other senators, including Republicans, saw China’s practices as a violation of international trade laws. "I decided to take this step because I cannot sit idly by while American workers and companies continue to be victimized by foreign countries who violate our trade agreements with impunity," Bayh said at the time. A hold is one of the informal, gentlemanly traditions of the Senate. It works like this: Senator A says he will not confirm Nominee So-and-So because he is displeased with the nominee’s agency, has a problem with the president’s plans for that agency or thinks the nominee is ill-suited for the job. So he informs the majority leader that he is placing a hold on the nomination. And just like that, the Senate puts the nomination aside, like some unpleasant piece of business it just isn’t going to deal with. Sometimes members of the president’s own party will place holds, like when Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown put one on the nominee to head the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. because of concern over how Delphi Corp. retiree pensions were handled during the 2009 General Motors bankruptcy. President Obama ultimately used a recess appointment to get the nominee, Joshua Gotbaum, in office, and then the Senate agreed to confirm him with a regular vote. But in the case of Portman, it was a Democrat protesting a Republican. You might ask why senators from the Republican Party, who at the time comprised a majority, didn’t just demand a vote and override Bayh’s objection. But that’s just not the way the Senate normally does things. Besides, that would have almost certainly led to public debate and a cloture fight, which senators often have tried to avoid on cabinet nominations (present Senate climate excepted) because it takes up valuable floor time. Furthermore, Republicans had 55 seats in that particular Senate, and failure to get the 60 votes for cloture can be embarrassing to the nominee and the president, potentially weakening both politically. A hold can avoid all that while having the same effect of blocking the nominee -- and often doing so a lot more quietly. And that is exactly what happened in the case of Portman. The hold lasted barely two weeks. Portman, Bayh and others talked throughout this period and came to an understanding. Senate leaders agreed to hold a hearing on the China trade bill Bayh wanted. And Portman agreed that as trade ambassador, he would conduct a top-to-bottom review of China’s practices. Bayh dropped his hold. In the end, Portman was confirmed on a "voice vote," in which senators said "yea" or "nay" without their individual votes being recorded.. So had Portman been filibustered? We went to the Congressional Research Service for a definition of filibuster, and this is what one of its recent reports (May 31, 2013) said: "Filibustering includes any use of dilatory or obstructive tactics to block a measure by preventing it from coming to a vote." In a report the next month (June 26, 2013), the Congressional Research Service said, "Although a ‘hold’ has no formal procedural force under Senate Rules, it may represent an implicit threat to filibuster that may discourage the majority leader from bringing the matter to the floor." That seemed broader than the Hollywood version of a filibuster. Take, for example, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," in which Jimmy Stewart’s character, the idealistic Sen. Jefferson Smith, held the floor by talking for 23 hours to halt Senate action. Bayh’s hold certainly was unlike Wendy Davis’s recent filibuster in Texas over that state’s abortion laws. The Texas state senator spoke for 11 straight hours, although she was ultimately unsuccessful in keeping Texas from passing tougher abortion restrictions. But Bayh’s hold and what are thought of as more traditional filibusters had one thing in common. That is, the Bayh-Portman standoff officially ended not only as a result of negotiations but also because Majority Leader Bill Frist soon said it was time to put this to a vote and move on. Frist filed a petition for cloture, which started the clock toward a 60-threshold vote. Portman’s Senate staff pointed this out to us, as did Sarah Binder, a Brookings Institution senior scholar and George Washington University political science professor. Binder has written extensively about filibusters and Senate stalling tactics. With a cloture vote looming to end the standoff, Bayh settled on the terms he wanted and dropped his opposition. A cloture vote, and the attendant debate leading up to it, was avoided. "That filing of the cloture motion is decent evidence in this case of the majority leader treating Bayh's hold as a threatened filibuster," Binder said in an email. Just to make sure we understood the nuance of all this, we contacted another expert, University of Miami political scientist Gregory Koger. Koger is the author of "Filibustering: A Political History of Obstruction in the House and Senate," and, like Binder, one of the nation’s experts on the filibuster and Senate rules. "The short answer is yes," Koger said. "I would consider a hold tantamount to a filibuster if it’s a threat of delay for strategic purposes." That is, he would consider it a filibuster if the senator placing the hold wanted something -- in this case, tougher trade enforcement. "If you’re using it so you can extract concessions, that to me is the same thing as a filibuster," Koger said. Bayh got concessions. He dropped the hold. So with all this in mind, how does Portman’s claim rate on the Truth-O-Meter? The hold on Portman got nowhere near the attention of the Cordray nomination, or of Wendy Davis’ efforts in Texas. And although Koger said a hold is tantamount to a filibuster when used to extract concessions, CRS described it as "an implicit threat to filibuster." Binder similarly said that "we often call Portman-like episodes a threatened filibuster: ‘If you go forward, I will block it.’" This additional information clarifies a generally accurate claim, so we’ll stop filibustering and follow the rules of PolitiFact: If a claim is generally accurate but needs additional information, it is Mostly True.

pomt-04826	Says Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan "want to turn Medicare into a voucher system."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/16/barack-obama/does-paul-ryan-want-turn-medicare-voucher-program/	In their attacks against Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, the Obama campaign and Democratic allies have been repeating a familiar word: vouchers. During a campaign event in Davenport, Iowa, on Aug. 15, 2012, President Barack Obama said, "I’ve strengthened Medicare. I've made reforms that save millions of seniors with Medicare hundreds of dollars on their prescription drugs. We're closing the doughnut hole. I've proposed reforms that will save Medicare money by getting rid of wasteful spending in the health care system. Reforms that will not touch your Medicare benefits. "And Gov. Romney and his running mate have a different plan. They want to turn Medicare into a voucher system. That means seniors would no longer have the guarantee of Medicare -- they’d get a voucher to buy private insurance. And if it doesn’t keep up with costs, well, that’s the seniors' problem. It was estimated that Gov. Romney's running mate, his original plan would force seniors to pay an extra $6,400 a year." We wondered whether Romney and Ryan really "want to turn Medicare into a voucher system." "Voucher" is a word Democrats have used over the years to criticize a variety of Republican privatization proposals, such as efforts to help private schools. Republicans don't like the word and try to avoid it. Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant specializing in "message creation and image management," boasts on his website that he "moved the public debate from ‘school vouchers’ to ‘opportunity scholarships.’" In the context of Medicare, Republicans prefer to call it "premium support" -- the one Ryan himself has used from day one when talking about his own proposals. A Romney-Ryan spokesman told us the campaign considers it a "premium support" plan, not a voucher plan. Both sides are acting in self-interest, said Ben Zimmer, executive producer of the Visual Thesaurus and Vocabulary.com and language columnist for The Boston Globe. "I can understand Republican willingness to embrace this alternative term, just as I can understand Democratic eagerness to remind voters of the dreaded ‘v-word’ at every turn," Zimmer said. In this item, we will sort through the claims and see whether it’s reasonable for Obama to call the Romney-Ryan plan for Medicare a "voucher system." We'll start with the dictionary. Merriam-Webster defines a voucher as "a written affidavit or authorization … a form or check indicating a credit against future purchases or expenditures; a coupon issued by government to a parent or guardian to be used to fund a child's education in either a public or private school." Ryan’s plans The initial Ryan plan that used "premium supports" was released in early 2011 and was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate, where Democrats called it radical and argued that it shifted too much of Medicare’s financial burden to beneficiaries. Under Ryan’s original plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. This would have affected people who today are under 55 only. The private plans would comply with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Ryan has since offered updated versions of the plan, the first in conjunction with Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and then as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. Ryan’s most recent plan is similar to his original one, with one key difference. The newer version allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they can use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based in part on the second least-expensive plan available on the exchange. But note that Obama said, "Gov. Romney and his running mate have a different plan." Is the most recent Ryan plan also official policy for the Romney campaign? In an interview with a Green Bay, Wis., television station on Aug. 15, Romney said, "Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical -- it's probably close to identical." Based on this, we’ll evaluate Obama’s claim based on the most recent Ryan plan. A history of ‘premium support’ When Ryan unveiled his plan, Democrats poked fun at him for avoiding the term "voucher." At a hearing on the plan, Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., said, "My Republican colleagues don't like the sound of ‘voucher’ to describe their plan, so they've made up a new term called ‘premium support.’" Actually, that term has been around since a 1995 paper co-authored by two health policy experts, Henry Aaron, of the Brookings Institution, and Robert Reischauer, a former Congressional Budget Office director who was then at Brookings. "Premium support" also was used in a Medicare overhaul proposed by the bipartisan Breaux-Thomas commission in 1999 and in the 2010 Rivlin-Domenici proposal from the Bipartisan Policy Center. Each of these proposals had somewhat different details, but what they broadly shared is changing Medicare from a program in which the government pays the bills directly to one in which the government gives money to the beneficiary, who spends it on an insurance plan. In their 1995 paper, Aaron and Reischauer proposed that Medicare "pay a defined sum toward the purchase of an insurance policy that provided a defined set of services" -- an approach they billed as a "middle ground" between a separate national health care system for the aged and a "pure voucher system" within a "lightly regulated marketplace." Aaron -- who no longer supports the idea of premium support, saying the cost-control provisions of President Barack Obama’s health care law serve the purpose he intended -- reiterated in a blog post earlier this year that there are several key differences between a voucher program and premium support. For a proposal to qualify as premium support, Aaron wrote, it’s crucial to peg the beneficiaries’ payment to the actual rise in health care costs so people don't end up having to pay more because of inflation. Voucher plans that don’t do this "are virtually guaranteed to become increasingly inadequate," he wrote. So does the Ryan plan meet the definition of premium support? While his original plan was pegged to overall consumer prices, the most recent Ryan plan is pegged to the lower end of health care premiums. That’s closer to the Aaron-Reischauer definition than his first plan was, though the fact that it’s tied to the low end rather than average costs suggests that payment size could still lag typical health care prices. The notion that there’s a substantive difference between "premium support" and "vouchers" receives some support from free-market supporters. Michael Tanner, a health care analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, said that the original Ryan plan, "leaned more toward a voucher," whereas Ryan’s second plan was "clearly premium support." Robert Moffit, a health policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, agrees with Aaron that there’s a distinction between "voucher" and "premium support," though he draws the opposite conclusion, arguing that the Obama campaign’s use of the term "voucher" is not justified, since the Ryan plan includes more regulation than for, say, airline vouchers for food and drink. Looking at linguistics The differences between vouchers and premium support may matter to health-policy professionals, but not necessarily to a general audience. And while the 1995 Aaron-Reischauer paper may have offered a detailed definition for "premium support," language tends to evolve over nearly two decades. In recent years, the definitions of "premium support" and "vouchers" have become almost indistinguishable, with plans such as Breaux-Thomas and Rivlin-Domenici using "premium support" to describe policies that weren’t identical to those from the 1995 paper. Reischauer made this argument when he told PolitiFact that he thinks the Obama campaign "is on firm ground" using the term "voucher." Even more convincingly, the 1995 paper didn’t say that premium support wasn’t a voucher -- it said that it wasn’t a "pure" voucher. This means that "premium support" may be seen as just one type of voucher, not the opposite of a voucher. Aaron told us he agreed with that reasoning. Take away the requirements listed in the 1995 paper, he said, "and you have a bare-bones voucher." Adhere to these requirements, he said, "and you have premium support. That means, I think, that premium support is a type of voucher." Our ruling We agree that in the world of policy wonks, there are distinctions between "vouchers" and "premium support," having to do with the type of inflation adjustment used and the degree of marketplace regulation imposed. Compared with his original plan, Ryan’s most recent plan does move closer to fitting the definition of pure premium support. But substantively, it’s still somewhere in between the two approaches. But the Romney-Ryan approach pretty much matches the dictionary definition of "a form or check indicating a credit against future purchases or expenditures." We think that describes the general way Ryan's plan would work. For a political discussion aimed at voters rather than policy wonks, we think Obama’s use of the term "voucher" is close enough to earn it a rating of Mostly True.

pomt-14923	Says a question about his financial skills at the CNBC debate included "discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents."	false	/florida/statements/2015/oct/30/marco-rubio/debate-rubio-calls-tally-financial-mishaps-pack-di/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio waved off a question about his economic smarts during the latest Republican presidential debate, saying stories about his personal financial decisions weren’t worth discussing. At the Oct. 28, 2015, debate in Boulder, Colo., CNBC moderator Becky Quick asked Rubio how qualified he felt to guide national fiscal policy when he’d had so many money problems himself. "Sen. Rubio, you yourself have said that you've had issues. You have a lack of bookkeeping skills," Quick said, quoting Rubio’s 2012 book An American Son before listing several examples. "You accidentally inter-mingled campaign money with your personal money. You faced foreclosure on a second home that you bought. And just last year, you liquidated a $68,000 retirement fund. That's something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties. "In terms of all of that, it raises the question whether you have the maturity and the wisdom to lead this $17 trillion economy. What do you say?" she asked. Rubio’s response was to dismiss all of Quick’s examples as partisan smear tactics. "Well, you just listed a litany of discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents, and I'm not gonna waste 60 seconds detailing them all," he said. He then went on to detail his blue-collar upbringing with immigrant parents. The response made us pause, because we wondered what had been "discredited" about Rubio’s widely reported financial mishaps. In this context, "discredited" means the things Quick said are not true or accurate. Rubio’s campaign did not respond to our requests for comment, but we’ll take them one at a time and explain what happened: "You accidentally inter-mingled campaign money with your personal money." Years before Rubio became speaker of the Florida House of Representatives in 2006, he created two political committees to pay for travel and other expenses. A 2010 Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald investigation found he failed to disclose paying $34,000 in expenses, including $7,000 to himself. He paid his wife Jeanette, who was treasurer of one of the committees, $5,700 for "gas and meals." Rubio also gave relatives another $14,000 and charged $51,000 in travel expenses to his own credit cards. Speaking of credit cards: In 2005, the Republican Party of Florida gave him an American Express for expenses. Rubio charged thousands of dollars’ worth of restaurant meals while his meals in Tallahassee were being covered by taxpayers as part of being in the state House. Rubio routinely used the party’s card to pay personal expenses, which he later repaid. Those included a rental car, repairs to his personal vehicle, flights to Tallahassee, a family reunion trip and paver work to his home. In all, he spent more than $100,000 between November 2006 and November 2008. He didn’t release disclosures prior to that. The Florida Commission on Ethics in 2012 dismissed a citizen complaint that had been filed during Rubio’s 2010 Senate campaign. Rubio wrote in his book that the expenses were the result of simple mix-ups. "For example, I pulled the wrong card from my wallet to pay for pavers," he wrote. Another time, "my travel agent mistakenly used the card to pay for a family reunion in Georgia." "Each time, I identified the charges and paid the costs myself, directly to American Express. The Republican Party of Florida didn't pay a single one of them. Nevertheless, in hindsight, I wish that none of them had ever been charged." Quick’s description of these events is accurate. "You faced foreclosure on a second home that you bought." In 2005, Rubio bought a house in Tallahassee with then-state Rep. David Rivera for $135,000. The pair used the home while in town on state business. Foreclosure proceedings on the Tallahassee house were started in 2010 when Rivera, then Florida House budget chairman and running for Congress in Miami, failed to make mortgage payments for five months. The loan had been structured for interest-only payments on an adjustable rate mortgage until April 2010. Rubio and Rivera stopped paying the loan in February because of a dispute over how much the payments would be after April. In June 2010, Deutsche Bank filed a lawsuit for $136,000, prompting Rivera to make a hasty payment for the missing months. Foreclosure proceedings were stopped. Rivera later became entangled in ethics investigations and Rubio has kept some distance from him. They sold the house in June 2015 for $117,000. It’s worth noting that the foreclosure proceedings didn’t proceed, but Rubio did "face" them on a second home. "And just last year, you liquidated a $68,000 retirement fund. That's something that cost you thousands of dollars in taxes and penalties." Rubio disclosed in May 2015 he had cashed out a tax-advantaged retirement account on Sept. 1, 2014, closing an American Bar Association account for the cash infusion. "It was just one specific account that we wanted to have access to cash in the coming year, both because I'm running for president, but, also, you know, my refrigerator broke down. That was $3,000. I had to replace the air conditioning unit in our home," Rubio told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. "My kids all go to school, and they're getting closer to college and school is getting more expensive. And then when you're running for president, we just wanted to access the sum of that cash." Because of the way most traditional IRAs are structured, Rubio was able to put money into the account without paying taxes. When he closed the account, by law he would have likely had to pay both income taxes and a 10 percent penalty, a move financial advisers usually do not recommend. Taxes and penalties could have ranged from about $24,000 to as high as $30,000, but it’s unclear how much he paid. Quick’s description here, too, is accurate. Our ruling Rubio said the premise of questions about his financial skills are "discredited attacks from Democrats and my political opponents." He was responding to examples Quick gave when asking if he was prepared to oversee the nation’s economy as president. She listed troubles Rubio had experienced with campaign bookkeeping, foreclosure proceedings and liquidating an IRA at severe tax penalties. All of these events happened and have been well-documented. It’s not accurate for Rubio to refer to the issues as "discredited," whether his opponents have used them to attack him or not. Quick was not making things up nor shading the facts. We rate Rubio’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6a595865-463d-4975-981a-4e8332b0611d	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-10-30T14:55:07	2015-10-28	['CNBC', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-09261	A letter from BP to the Minerals Management Service "actually recommends improvements and specific recommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change them."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/02/lamar-mckay/bp-letter-mms-urges-reduced-regulation/	The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig continued to spew oil into the Gulf of Mexico as Lamar McKay, chairman and president of BP America, appeared on ABC News' This Week to answer questions. McKay said BP was doing everything it could to plug the well and mitigate the impact of the oil slick as it moved toward land. He also said he believed equipment failure was the likely cause of the explosion and subsequent spill. This Week host Jake Tapper asked McKay about BP's safety record and its response to the Minerals Management Service's recent efforts to increase regulations on oil rigs. "Just a few months ago, a BP executive protested proposed new safety regulations for oil rigs, writing to the government that quote, 'while BP is supportive of companies having a system in place to reduce risks, accidents, injuries and spills, we are not supportive of extensive proscriptive regulations.' Will BP continue to fight and lobby against safety regulations?" Tapper asked. "Well, I would characterize the letter you're talking about slightly differently," McKay said. "That letter was in response to the government's request for input on safety regulations that the MMS was looking at. The rest of the letter actually recommends improvements and specific recommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change them. So we're not fighting anything about safety. Safety is the number one priority. We're going to figure out what happened here, and that is going to help the MMS and help ourselves and help the industry get safer, so we're not fighting anything about safety." We wanted to fact-check McKay's description that "the rest of the letter actually recommends improvements and specific recommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change them." On June 17, 2009, the Minerals Management Service proposed rules to require oil and gas operators to develop and implement "safety and environmental management systems" for offshore drilling. In essence, the new regulations would require oil companies to create more documentation about their safety procedures and share them with workers and inspectors. The agency said it had reviewed the incident reports for offshore accidents and determined that four areas contributed the most to accidents: • Hazards Analysis, which means minimizing "the consequences of uncontrolled releases of oil and gas and other safety or environmental incidents"; • Management of Change, which means documenting and analyzing new procedures such as the addition of new equipment or modifications to existing equipment; • Operating Procedures, requiring written safety procedures; • Mechanical Integrity, to ensure that equipment is "designed, fabricated, installed, tested, inspected, monitored, and maintained in a manner consistent with appropriate service requirements, manufacturer's recommendations, and industry standards." BP responded to the proposed regulations in a letter dated Sept. 14, 2009, the day before the commenting period closed. The company said the new rules were unnecessary because "the industry's current safety and environmental statistics demonstrate that the voluntary programs ... have been and continue to be very successful." McKay is right that after BP gives its opinion that the new rules aren't needed, it then offered a number of changes to proposed rules. But on This Week, McKay gave the impression that BP was seeking additional, safer regulations. In fact, the letter is a plea for the company to have less regulation. We compared BP's suggestions for changes to the MMS regulations. Some of the suggestions are for language changes or technical fixes. But we found that in many cases, BP was suggesting changes that would give the company fewer responsibilities or more flexibility under the proposed rules. Here are a few examples: On Hazards Analysis, BP suggested language to make it clear that BP doesn't have to develop procedures for third-party companies. It also said it shouldn't have to develop analyses for property damage if the damage doesn't affect worker safety or the environment. For Operating Procedures, BP suggested language so that all employees would not have access to all safety procedures, but only to documentation that specifically apply to their jobs. On Mechanical Integrity, BP objected to language that required equipment to meet manufacturer's recommendations or specifications. A company's own specifications should be sufficient, the letter said. "Many of our inspection and testing requirements, while meeting regulations, are risk based in approach," the letter said. On regular safety audits, BP said that audits should occur based on "performance and risk rather than a prescribed schedule." Overall, the ideas in BP's letter point toward limiting the impact of new rules and making them apply to more narrow circumstances. McKay told Tapper that, "The rest of the letter actually recommends improvements and specific recommendations around safety regulations should they choose to change them." This gives the impression that BP was trying to work with regulators to make the safety regulations better, to make conditions safer. But most of what the letter suggests are ways to make the regulations less of a burden for BP. Certainly this is an "improvement" from BP's perspective, but we don't see how it makes safety "the number one priority." So we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-02539	Says David Jolly "lobbied on a plan" by Rep. Paul Ryan that would turn Medicare into a voucher program.	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/feb/06/alex-sink/david-jolly-lobbied-plan-turn-medicare-costly-vouc/	Alex Sink’s campaign for Pinellas County’s open U.S. House seat continues to pile on Republican rival David Jolly’s lobbyist past. The latest attack has been that the Dunedin native lobbied on radical changes to Medicare. A campaign commercial released on Jan. 25, 2014, features a voiceover detailing Jolly’s financial windfall from his work in Washington. It goes on to say, "Jolly even lobbied for a group committed to privatizing Social Security and then lobbied on a plan to turn Medicare into a costly voucher program." Did Jolly lobby on Medicare vouchers? This is a significant charge, since the district ranks eighth in the nation for population over 65 -- those eligible for Medicare. It’s also turning into a favored Democratic attack against Jolly, implying that he favored a plan to alter the program. We decided to investigate. The Ryan budget Jolly was a longtime aide and general counsel to the late Rep. C.W. Bill Young, whose death triggered the March 11 special election. Later, Jolly worked as a lobbyist from 2007 to 2012, first for Van Scoyoc Associates Inc., then for his own firm, Three Bridges Advisors. One of his clients at both firms was Free Enterprise Nation, a pro-business, anti-regulation advocacy group founded by Jim MacDougald, who is now Jolly’s campaign finance co-chairman. A Nov. 2009 lobbying disclosure form (with spelling errors) shows Jolly worked on behalf of Free Enterprise Nation for "Health Care reform, Social Security Reform, Paycheck Fairness Act and other labor related issues and initatives; Taxpayer proection, and Small business." His campaign confirmed the disclosure referred to a meeting with Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the former vice presidential running mate for Mitt Romney. Ryan has written several budget proposals that support restructuring Social Security and Medicare. Ryan’s plan was first submitted to the House as "The Roadmap for America’s Future" in 2008 and again in 2010. The proposal called for Medicare to be replaced with a government payment to beneficiaries to buy private insurance instead. These payouts were called subsidies or "premium support" by supporters and "vouchers" by detractors. The plan was reintroduced in 2011, 2012 and 2013, when they were passed by the Republican-led House but not the Democratic-controlled Senate. So the budget proposals have never been enacted. PolitiFact has considered whether the Ryan version of Medicare was a voucher system, and found the claim was Mostly True, though a more expansive version of the Democratic claim -- that proposals like Ryan’s would "end Medicare" -- received PolitiFact’s 2011 Lie of the Year. The Jolly campaign at first said Jolly didn’t actively lobby either way to get Ryan’s budget proposals passed. Then they said he opposed the part of the plan that would change Medicare. Jolly was there to "advocate for transparency of the out-year obligations of Social Security and Medicare" and "transparency and protecting promises made to beneficiaries," said Jolly campaign spokesman Sarah Bascom. On a Dec. 8, 2013, edition of Bay News 9’s Political Connections, Jolly himself said "there was a lot of good in the Ryan budget." But Jolly also said he believed the budget wasn’t the proper approach to some problems. "I think we have to be careful on the Ryan budget for a couple of reasons," he said on the show. "Entitlement programs — Social Security, Medicare — we know what that means to the community here. I have said from the very beginning, we have to protect the promises that have been made, to everybody." Vouching for Jolly None of Jolly’s disclosure forms for his work with Free Enterprise Nation list Medicare as a topic. Nonetheless, the Sink campaign inferred that if Jolly was discussing "Health Care reform" with Ryan, and Ryan’s budget proposal was a topic, then Jolly had lobbied on the voucher plan. Experts we spoke to said the term "Health Care reform" was broad enough to include Medicare, since disclosure forms only require topics and not specifics. The caveat is that Sink’s attack would imply, to most reasonable people, that Jolly was in favor of the voucher plan, not against it. Experts on lobbying said that if Jolly was at a meeting where the Ryan budget was discussed, that counts as lobbying. Brett Kappel, an attorney for Washington, D.C., law firm Arent Fox who specializes in lobbying, said that according to the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995, being paid for any discussion of a piece of legislation with a covered government official is an act of lobbying. "It doesn’t matter whether you’re for or against it," Kappel said, adding that even though Ryan’s budget proposal was a not technically a piece of legislation -- budget resolutions do not get sent to the president to be signed, as normal bills do -- it qualified as an item covered under disclosure guidelines. "There are a lot of gray areas in the rules," he said. "This isn’t one of them." It also doesn’t matter if Jolly’s sentiments about the budget were his or those of his client, Free Enterprise Nation. "He’s representing his client," Kappel said. "If he didn’t know his client’s position, he shouldn’t have said anything." Finally, Jolly himself said in a Feb. 3, 2014 interview with Tampa Bay TV station WFLA, that he had lobbied on the budget proposal. "A federal lobbying registration filing for a client simply says that this bill was discussed, so yes, I met with Paul Ryan, at the time that he was writing the Ryan budget," Jolly said, again specifying the conversation was about projecting future costs of Social Security and Medicare. "So what I talked to Paul Ryan about was transparency of the out-year debt, and as he’s wrestling with reforms, making sure that’s included. Now, all that appears on the filing is that I Iobbied on the Ryan budget, so they have taken that and they can play with it however they want." Our ruling One of Sink’s campaign commercials claims that Jolly "lobbied on a plan" by Ryan that would turn Medicare into a voucher program. She’s suggesting that a meeting with would-be Medicare reformist Ryan on behalf of Free Enterprise Nation had to be advocating for the congressman’s plan to alter the face of the retiree health insurance program. Jolly’s campaign acknowledged that Jolly had attended a meeting on an overall budget proposal that included changes to Medicare, and under the law, that is enough to count as lobbying. But Jolly’s camp says he didn’t support Ryan’s potential changes to Medicare, and we can’t contradict that. More importantly, neither can Sink. Democrats used vague language that a reasonable person would assume meant Jolly was promoting the voucher portion of the proposal, when Jolly says he was critical of it. There’s a lack of evidence to tie Jolly specifically to that part of the Ryan budget plan, even though he did lobby on the legislation and was discussing Medicare. Sink is leaving out important context as she tries to harness a hot-button issue. We rate her claim Half True.

pomt-13716	"John McCain’s chief economic adviser during the ’08 race … estimated that Trump’s promises would cause America to lose 3.5 million jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/27/tim-kaine/dnc-tim-kaine-says-even-republicans-think-donald-t/	It’s not just Democrats who think America would suffer under a Donald Trump presidency, said Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine. Take it from "John McCain’s chief economic adviser during the ’08 race who estimated that Trump’s promises would cause America to lose 3.5 million jobs," said Kaine, a senator from Virginia, in a speech on the third night of the Democratic National Convention. Kaine was referring to a blistering analysis of Trump’s economic proposals published by respected financial firm Moody’s Analytics. When the report first came out in June, Hillary Clinton also jumped on the fact that an adviser to a former Republican presidential candidate had produced such a critical report. But Trump responded to say: Not so fast. Mark Zandi, Moody’s chief economist and the report’s lead author, actually supports Clinton and President Barack Obama. So who is this guy? Zandi is a well-respected economist, and politicians and economists on both sides of the aisle like him. His latest report, which is sharply critical of Trump’s policy proposals, is a methodical examination that looks at three possible scenarios: one where Trump’s proposals are adopted in full, one where they are adopted on a smaller scale, and one that envisions a compromise with Congress. (Moody’s says a similar report about Clinton’s proposals is forthcoming.) Assuming that Trump’s proposals are adopted in full, the analysts do, in fact, estimate that the economy will be "significantly weaker," and there will be a 3.5 million drop in jobs, as Kaine said. "Under the scenario in which all his stated policies become law in the manner proposed, the economy suffers a lengthy recession and is smaller at the end of his four-year term than when he took office," the report says. "By the end of his presidency, there are close to 3.5 million fewer jobs, and the unemployment rate rises to as high as 7 percent, compared with below 5 percent today. During Mr. Trump’s presidency, the average American household’s after-inflation income will stagnate, and stock prices and real house values will decline." Though others might take issue with some aspects of his findings, the purpose of this fact-check is not to cast doubt on the quality of Zandi’s Trump report or his work generally. We have quoted him as an expert source on the economy in previous stories. Rather, Kaine is using Zandi’s Republican credentials as a former McCain adviser to make the point that even Republicans think Trump’s proposals would be bad for the economy. But it turns out he is leaving out an important piece of information that leaves a giant hole in that particular line of argument — notably that Zandi has donated the maximum amount of $2,700 to Clinton’s primary campaign. Beyond this presidential cycle, Zandi has donated to a variety of Democrats going back to 2007. Zandi confirmed to PolitiFact that he is a registered Democrat. In the 2008 presidential race, though, he did support Republican candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. He donated more than $2,000 to McCain’s campaign, and he was one of several economists advising McCain in an official capacity. But Zandi definitely wasn’t McCain’s chief adviser, as Kaine said, and has called his role in the campaign "very modest." Zandi was a Democrat back then, too, but he told the Wall Street Journal he is "eclectic" and that he has done work for members of both parties, a point he has since reiterated. After the 2008 election, though, Zandi turned out to be an important asset to the Obama administration. Zandi told us he wasn’t an official adviser to Obama or the White House, but he has produced research concluding the Obama administration’s response to the 2008 financial crisis was a success. And he was on Obama’s short list to regulate the Federal Housing Finance Agency, though he didn’t get the job. We asked Zandi what he would tell people who question whether his report on Trump is neutral, given his sizeable donation to Clinton and past connections with Democrats. "We used the same model of the economy we use for all our studies," he said. "And the study is completely transparent. Moreover, the approach we took is the same approach the (nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office) takes when evaluating similar fiscal policy proposals. I'm very interested in hearing substantive critiques of our work." Our ruling Kaine said "John McCain’s chief economic adviser during the ’08 race … estimated that Trump’s promises would cause america to lose 3.5 million jobs." The Moody’s report concluded that Trump’s economic proposals, if adopted in full, could cost 3.5 million jobs. And Zandi was a donor and economic adviser to the McCain campaign. But he was not the chief adviser, and this isn’t the full picture of his political affiliations. As it turns out, Zandi is a registered Democrat and donated the maximum amount to Clinton’s primary campaign. Zandi is a well-respected economist, and we are not in this fact-check casting doubt on the credibility of his Trump report or his work generally. He has advised and worked on issues for politicians on both sides of the aisle for many years. But to identify Zandi only as a former adviser of McCain leaves out a lot of the story about Zandi’s political affiliations. We rate Kaine’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/097b24d4-9ee7-492a-abbe-ea4ea40bd86f	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-07-27T22:49:48	2016-07-27	['United_States']
pomt-10586	"Every billion dollars we spend on highway construction results in 47,500 jobs. But the fact is the average American is sitting in traffic 38 hours a year."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/31/mike-huckabee/his-numbers-are-old-or-just-wrong-/	Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has sometimes strayed from Republican orthodoxy during his long-shot bid for the GOP nomination, most notably when it comes to economic issues. He often touts his success in Arkansas improving the state's transportation infrastructure, so it was no surprise on Jan. 30, 2008, when he argued that highway spending would be a better means of stimulating the economy than the rebate checks that President Bush and Congress have in mind. "Every billion dollars we spend on highway construction results in 47,500 jobs," he said during the Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. And while Americans may love the thought of a $600 check from the government – as the House passed as part of its economic stimulus bill this week – they also would thank their government for reducing traffic congestion. "The fact is the average American is sitting in traffic 38 hours a year," Huckabee said. Huckabee is on well-trod ground here. But in the first case, he's using data so old that it can't possibly be true anymore. In the second, he misstates the results of a prominent study. Huckabee's not alone in arguing that $1-billion in highway spending equates to 47,500 jobs. The equation has been widely cited in recent years by officials of the U.S. Department of Transportation, members of Congress and transportation advocacy groups. Unfortunately, the study that made the finding is now 12 years old, 13 if you figure the data used was from 1995. The study was published in 1996 by the Federal Highway Administration. And in actuality, the author – economist Thomas P. Keane – found that $1-billion in federal spending created 42,100 jobs – 7,900 in direct highway construction, another 19,700 in related construction industry jobs and another 14,500 in unrelated jobs sparked by the construction, including everything from vendors who sell coffee to the workers to teachers who instruct their children. Advocates of highway spending have used the data to argue that $1-billion in federal spending would typically be matched by $100-million in state matching funds, tacking on the remaining 5,400 jobs cited by Huckabee. But the Transportation Department has never updated its findings and inflation has surely cut into the jobs that $1-billion, or even $1.1-billion, would create, says Frank R. Moretti, director of policy and research at TRIP, a Washington nonprofit group that advocates for policies to reduce traffic congestion. "You would anticipate wages have been impacted over the last 13 years," he says, reducing – potentially significantly – the amount of jobs created. Likewise Huckabee slips up a bit in citing a Texas Transportation Institute study examining the number of hours Americans spend stuck in traffic each year. The institute's September 2007 "Urban Mobility Report" found that congestion causes the average peak period traveler to spend an extra 38 hours in traffic each year. However, the average peak period traveler isn't the same as the "average American" that Huckabee cited. In fact, only about 60 percent of Americans travel during the 8 hours a day that the institute defines as the "peak period" – between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. in the morning and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. during the evening rush. Senior citizens, stay-at-home parents, small children and the unemployed are among the 40 percent that typically don't. If they were factored in – thereby calculating how much time the average American spends in traffic – the 38-hour figure would likely drop into the 25-hour range, says David Schrank, a co-author of the report. So Huckabee's facts are off, though not egregiously. His first error is in relying on the U.S. Department of Transportation, which continues to cite a 12-year-old statistic. The second misstatement is an exaggeration of a study. We rate both statements, therefore, as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Mike Huckabee	None	None	None	2008-01-31T00:00:00	2008-01-30	['United_States']
pomt-14951	"Since 2001, higher education in the state has been cut or allowed to erode ... by 35 or 40 percent."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2015/oct/23/chris-koster/koster-mostly-right-about-erosion-higher-education/	As Attorney General Chris Koster eyes the 2016 race for Missouri governor, he’s pushing to share the ballot with a political twofer: a ballot proposal that would increase Missouri’s lowest-in-the-nation tobacco tax, which would pay for a boost in the state’s higher education spending. Speaking Aug. 20 at the Missouri State Fair, Koster, a Democrat, reiterated his support for the increasing the cigarette tax, telling the Columbia Daily Tribune: "Since 2001, higher education in the state has been cut or allowed to erode … by 35 or 40 percent." Do those numbers add up? It takes a bit of college-boy math. The top line About three-quarters of the state’s higher education budget comes from the general revenue fund. The rest of the money mostly comes from the 1 cent education sales tax and other state funds. (The federal government also chips in some money — this year it was a little under $3.7 million, or 0.2 percent, of the total higher education budget.) The average annual inflation rate between 2001 and 2015, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, was 1.918 percent for Missouri and Illinois. Inflation rates vary across the country, and the Federal Reserve calculates the inflation rate by region rather than by state. In fiscal year 2002, higher education was allotted $1,153,954,522. After adjusting for inflation — which compounds year over year — that’s equivalent to $1,505,546,464 today. In the most recent budget, for fiscal year 2016, $1,266,819,566 is set for higher education in Missouri. That’s a 15.9 percent decrease, short of what Koster said. The bottom line If you only look at dollars, though, you miss the effect of Missouri’s surging college enrollment, Koster spokesman Andrew Whalen told PolitiFact Missouri. In fall of 2001, Missouri’s public colleges and universities enrolled 143,656 full-time equivalent students. By 2014, enrollment had risen to 184,305 students. That’s a 28.3 percent increase in students. (This year’s totals aren’t in yet, but enrollment peaked in 2013, when Missouri counted 185,514 full-time equivalent students in its public institutions of higher education.) It’s hard to say exactly how much money is spent on each student across the state because each school receives money directly from the General Assembly. That money is counted in the appropriations for the Department of Higher Education — but since the department doesn’t dictate how that money is used, the department doesn’t track how much of it each institution spends, spokeswoman Liz Coleman said. But we can still get a rough per-student funding estimate by dividing the department’s budget by the number of full-time-equivalent students. Here’s the math: In 2001, Missouri spent $10,480.21 per student, adjusting for inflation. Assuming this year’s enrollment totals track near 2014’s (and there’s anecdotal evidence suggesting it’s not too far off), that would mean the state now spends closer to $6,873 per student. That’s a 34.4 percent decrease in higher education funding per student. There are a few caveats here: Students aren’t directly impacted by every dollar spent by the Department of Higher Education. For instance, the department also operates the Missouri State Historical Society, and some money also goes towards operating expenses for the department itself. The department funds scholarships, some of which go to students at private schools. And schools also draw funding from outside the appropriations process, from sources such as tuition, donations and endowments. So, the exact amount of money spent on each college student is a squishy number. But we can still confidently track how much the state contributes — which, in the context of raising the tobacco tax, is the essence of Koster’s statement. Our ruling Koster said that since 2001, higher education funding has been cut or eroded by 35 percent to 40 percent. The legislature hasn’t technically cut higher education funding over this time; nominally, the state has actually spent $100 million more on it. But that’s not enough to keep pace with inflation. And when you factor in skyrocketing enrollment numbers, the amount of money the General Assembly has budgeted to spend on a per student basis has indeed "eroded" by about as much as Koster says it has. Even though Koster’s statement is pretty close, it needs additional information and clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Chris Koster	None	None	None	2015-10-23T15:42:40	2015-08-20	['None']

pomt-10235	Sarah Palin "has more experience than Barack Obama."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/02/fred-thompson/palin-does-not-exceed-obama/	Experience has been a popular issue this campaign season, and we checked many facts during the primaries that hinged on experience, because candidates often touted their own resumes and implied that those of their competitors didn't stack up as well. The experience issue came roaring back to the 2008 campaign after John McCain picked Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate. The Sunday after the Palin announcement, Republican Fred Thompson defended the choice on CNN's "Late Edition." "She's been in public service for about 13 years now, state and local government," Thompson said. "She is a reformer. She has experience not only in politics but in life. She's a mother of five children, and from an infant to a young man going into the military. And she has more experience than Barack Obama. So I think as long as we can continue to compare her experience with the presidential nominee of the Democrats, we're going to be in pretty good shape." For comparison purposes, it's interesting to note that Palin and Obama are close to the same age. Palin is 44 and Obama is 47. Palin graduated from University of Idaho in 1987 with a major in journalism and worked as a sport reporter for about two years. She married her husband in 1988 and co-owned small businesses with him (a commercial fishing operation and an snow machine and all-terrain vehicle business). In 1992, her political career began when she won election to the Wasilla (prounounced wah-SIL-uh) city council. In 1996, she ran for the mayor of Wasilla and unseated the incumbent by a vote of 617 to 413, according to press reports. Wasilla has a strong-mayor form of government. The mayor breaks ties on the city council and acts as the city administrator. When Palin took office in 1996, the pay was $68,000. In 2000, Wasilla had a population of 5,469, according to the 2000 U.S. Census. It is located near the city of Anchorage. During her tenure as mayor, Palin focused on increasing funding for basic infrastructure. During her bid for re-election in 1999, the Anchorage Daily News reported that Palin "counts among her successes the recently opened Fred Meyer store, the passage of a $5.5 million road and sewer bond, and the near halving of property taxes from 2 mills to 1.2 mills, the equivalent of an $80-a-year drop in taxes on a $100,000 home." Palin also cut the budget of the city's museum, and all three of the museum's employees quit in protest. Terms limits prevented her from running for mayor again in 2002. Instead, she ran for Alaska lieutenant governor and lost. In 2003, Gov. Frank Murkowski appointed her to the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, where she served about a year before leaving the commission and blowing the whistle on fellow Republicans for conflicts of interest and conducting campaign work on public time. In 2006, she ran for governor, defeating the incumbent Murkowski in a primary and then winning the general. She took office on Dec. 4, 2006, and will have held office for two years a month after Election Day. So to summarize Palin's experience: Four years as a city council member, six years as a mayor, one year as a conservation commissioner, and two years as governor. That's 13 years total. Barack Obama, meanwhile, was a state legislator for eight years and will have been a U.S. Senator for four years. He also worked as a civil rights attorney in Chicago for four years after graduating from Harvard Law School. That's 16 years. We want to count experience that seems relevant to holding political office, so there are some things we're not counting here that the candidates' supporters might argue we should. We're not counting part-time work. That means we're not counting Palin's small business experience, nor Obama's teaching at the University of Chicago Law School nor his part-time legal work while he was a state senator. We're also not counting the time Obama has spent writing his two books. We're not counting experience that seems tangential to holding higher office, so that excludes Palin's time as a sports reporter and the three years Obama spent in his early 20s as a community organizer (even though Obama often invokes his coomunity organizing as good experience for higher office). We're also not counting the approximately eight months Obama spent organizing a statewide voter registration drive in Illinois in 1992. Finally, we're not differentiateing the years of experience on the basis of size of government. Obama, as a legislator, represented significantly more people than Palin did as Mayor of Wasilla. Obama's state senate district included about 212,000 people compared to Wasilla's approximately 6,000. As a U.S. Senator, Obama represented the Illinois statewide population of about 12.8 million, while Palin as governor represented about 670,000. Keep in mind that back in 1992, opponents derided Bill Clinton as the governor of a small state -- Arkansas, population 2.8 million -- and it didn't dim his vote-getting ability. But getting back to Fred Thompson's statement, we find that Palin is not more experienced than Barack Obama. We rate her having 13 years relevant experience to his sixteen years, and this doesn't consider the difference between municipal and state government, which would work toward Obama's favor. Thompson would probably argue that we should not count Obama's experience as a civil rights attorney, but legal work does seem directly applicable to creating and enforcing the nation's laws, particularly civil rights law. Finally, Thompson might argue that Palin's experience as governor should overrule Obama's experience as senator because it is executive, statewide experience as opposed to legislative experience. But if we granted that, then Palin would also be more qualified than Joe Biden and John McCain, because neither of them have gubernatorial experience, either. We find Thompson's statement that Palin is more qualified than Barack Obama to be False.	None	Fred Thompson	None	None	None	2008-09-02T00:00:00	2008-08-31	['Sarah_Palin', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-07328	"(Bill) Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/may/12/george-lemieux/lemieux-says-nelson-voted-billions-earmarks-such-b/	A new Web ad from the campaign for former Sen. George LeMieux takes on Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida over the issue of earmarks and specifically ties Nelson to perhaps the most infamous earmark ever, the so-called Bridge to Nowhere. A narrator in the ad, called "The Choice," says, "Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere. LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all." We're going to split this claim into two fact-checks. In this item, we are looking at the first half, about Nelson's record on earmarks. But we encourage you to also look at our companion fact-check on LeMieux's claim that he "never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all." (It's not as black-and-white as the ad suggests). The claim that "Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere," is backed up in the ad with a reference to Senate Roll Call Vote 264, Oct. 20, 2005. That is the vote on a Highway Reauthorization Bill, which included $225 million for an Alaska bridge to connect the tiny city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport. The project was derisively nicknamed the Bridge to Nowhere by a government watchdog group and became a national symbol of federal pork-barrel spending. Nelson voted in favor of the highway bill, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, 93-1. To be clear, this was not an up-or-down vote on the Bridge to Nowhere. The bill included $286.5 billion through 2009 for highway, mass transit, safety and research programs. The Alaska bridge was less than a tenth of 1 percent of total spending in the bill. We couldn't find any evidence prior to the vote that Nelson had an opinion about the Alaska bridge one way or the other. In a press release that year, Nelson touted the fact that there was $8.6 billion in the bill for Florida road projects, including widening Interstate 75 from Fort Myers to Naples; constructing the Interstate 4 crosstown connector in the Tampa Bay area; improving I-4 alternate routes in Orlando; and widening the bypass around Tallahassee. However, Nelson did have an opportunity to specifically eliminate funding for the Bridge to Nowhere when U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., proposed an amendment that would have redirected $125 million in funding for the Alaska bridge toward reconstruction of a New Orleans bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina. That amendment failed 82-15, and Nelson was among those who voted against it. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., for a similar vote. Obama and others said they voted against the Coburn amendment not because they agreed with funding for the Bridge to Nowhere, but because they felt it was wrong to single out one state's pork project without eliminating them for all the states (or, they feared their pork projects might be on the chopping block the next time). Incidentally, the Bridge to Nowhere never did get the money. A congressional committee directed the $225 million earmarked for the Gravina Island bridge to the Alaska Department of Transportation to spend the money as it saw fit. Although Alaska officials still could have decided to spend it on the bridge, ultimately the price tag for the project ballooned and the money was spent elsewhere. But back to LeMieux's claim that Nelson voted for "billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere." "He did," said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks federal earmarks. "He supported bills, along with many other senators, that had billions of dollars of earmarks in them." According to an analysis by Taxpayers for Common Sense, the highway bill in question included more than 6,000 earmarks at a cost of more than $24 billion. "Whether they were 'wasteful' or not all depends on who you talk to," Ellis said. "But along with the the rank and file, he (Nelson) has certainly been someone who actively participated in the earmarking game. I wouldn't put him in the pantheon of earmarkers, but he certainly played the game." We've docked politicians before for stretching the truth by claiming their opponent supported the Bridge to Nowhere simply because they voted for that highway bill in 2005. But this ad paints with a broader brush, criticizing Nelson for voting for billions of dollars worth of earmarks such as the Bridge to Nowhere. Nelson may not have specifically supported the Bridge to Nowhere project, but there's no question he voted in favor of a bill that was known to include billions of dollars worth of road project earmarks, some of which Nelson had requested for Florida.

pomt-03951	Says of a failed cloture vote on nominating Chuck Hagel for defense secretary: "This is not a filibuster."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/18/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-said-move-delay-hagel-nomination-not-f/	Some Republicans in the U.S. Senate aren’t very happy that their old colleague, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, has now been nominated to be President Barack Obama’s defense secretary. Some don’t like what he said about the Iraq war. Others think he did a bad job at his confirmation hearings. Still others want to use the nomination to get more information out of the Obama administration about last year’s attacks on American diplomats in Benghazi, Libya. So when majority leader Harry Reid of Nevada brought the Hagel nomination to the floor on Feb. 14, 2013, for a procedural vote known as "cloture," he couldn't muster enough votes. Cloture requires 60 votes, and enough Republicans opposed the move so that cloture failed. Reid complained that Republicans were obstructing for political reasons. "We know how the tea party goes after Republicans when they aren’t conservative enough," Reid said. "Is that something they need to have on their resume: I filibustered one of the President’s nominees? Is that what they want?" Not so, Republicans replied. "This is not any attempt to kill this nomination. This is not a filibuster," Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in the floor debate. "I realize it is the headline the majority leader would like the newspapers to write." Rather than trying to kill the nomination, Cornyn said, senators simply wanted more information. "There are reasonable requests being made on this side for additional information," Cornyn said. "I hope and trust information will be provided in the next few days. When we come back from the recess, we will have another vote and another opportunity for senators to express themselves." So Reid said it was a filibuster; Cornyn said it wasn’t. Which is it? Defining the filibuster Our first step was to determine exactly what a filibuster is. It’s not specifically defined in Senate rules. Still, the U.S. Senate’s own website has this to say: "Using the filibuster to delay or block legislative action has a long history. The term filibuster -- from a Dutch word meaning ‘pirate’ -- became popular in the 1850s, when it was applied to efforts to hold the Senate floor in order to prevent a vote on a bill." The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, a widely respected arm of Congress that prepares research for members, recently issued a detailed report on the filibuster. "Filibustering includes any use of dilatory or obstructive tactics to block a measure by preventing it from coming to a vote," said the report published by the service on Nov. 29, 2012. Hollywood’s version of the filibuster -- think Mr. Smith Goes to Washington -- is one senator standing alone on the floor and talking, talking, talking. Actually, a speech isn’t necessary to conduct a filibuster. The hallmark of the filibuster instead is that it forces a requirement for 60 votes rather than 51 to approve or move forward on a measure. Hagel’s confirmation, like most other measures, will require only a simple majority if and when it gets to a vote. Yes, it’s a filibuster Several experts we spoke with said the failed cloture vote does constitute a filibuster. "There's no single formal definition of a filibuster. The simplest version is that a filibuster occurs when a minority blocks a Senate majority from acting," said Sarah Binder, a political scientist and author of Stalemate: Causes and Consequences of Legislative Gridlock. "Probably a more accurate definition involves ‘intent’: A minority blocks a Senate majority from acting with the intent of derailing the measure (or nomination)." Binder said she thought cloture vote on the Hagel nomination was a filibuster: "The GOP actions against Hagel constitute a filibuster because the majority has been prevented from getting to a vote on confirmation." Steven S. Smith, a professor of political science at Washington University in St. Louis, agreed. "Jargon gets in the way. Minority obstruction is the key concept. Minority obstruction occurred here," he said. Another filibuster expert, Gregory Koger of the University of Miami, said it was a filibuster: "In the modern Senate, ‘holding’ a nomination and forcing the majority to shut off debate using the cloture process is a filibuster. Under the rules of the Senate, nominations require a simple majority for approval. It is incorrect to suggest that a 60-vote threshold is normal, natural, or common." In Cornyn’s defense Cornyn emphasized that the Hagel cloture vote was an attempt to get more information, not kill the nomination outright. And, it was Reid who chose to schedule the cloture vote when he did, before senators were satisfied, Cornyn said. "This was the majority leader's choice, which was his prerogative, and the White House's choice. We could have done this differently," Cornyn said. Cornyn’s office told us that on the day of the cloture vote, it had been 38 days since Hagel was nominated, not an unusually long time for a nominee to be under consideration. The staff also pointed us to comments from senators saying they expected Hagel would get a vote after the Senate returned from recess. In the book Defending the Filibuster: The Soul of the Senate, Richard A. Arenberg and Robert B. Dove defend the filibuster as a moderating force and a check on executive power. The filibuster, they write, has a historic role "as a protection of minority rights and a force for consensus building." We asked Arenberg whether he thought the Hagel case was a filibuster or not. He said it was a complicated case. "The majority leader clearly wanted to have the vote prior to the impending recess, at least in part for tactical reasons," he said. "Republicans who oppose the nomination want the nomination delayed until the day after the recess in order to seek answers to additional questions, but also to allow opponents time to marshal further opposition. " Traditionally, senators would work out requests for more time among themselves, without needing a cloture vote, he said, but that didn’t happen this time. "It's hard to characterize this as a classic filibuster and in a sense, it does come closer to what is typically termed a ‘hold,’" Arenberg said. "Of course, holds don't exist in the Senate rules and have their roots in senatorial courtesy. There's not too much of that (courtesy) in this circumstance. In the end, answering the questions rests on an analysis of the motivations of those seeking delay and what you believe about the duration of the delay which they seek." Filibustering cabinet nominees In Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Sen. Jefferson Smith is looked upon as a hero for conducting a filibuster. But in our review of the news coverage of the Hagel nomination and recent reports on the filibuster, we can’t help but note that "filibuster" has come to have a distinctly negative connotation, synonymous with political obstruction. Adding fuel to the fire here is that presidents usually get their cabinet nominees confirmed. While some nominees withdraw under political pressure before a confirmation vote, it’s rare for a nominee to make it to the floor and lose, much less be filibustered. The Washington Post recently reviewed the history of filibustering cabinet nominees and concluded that no nominations had failed because of an actual filibuster. Our ruling Cornyn said the failed cloture vote on Hagel was "not a filibuster." In fact-checking this statement, we’re swayed by definitions of filibusters that say it’s any move to prevent a measure or nomination from coming to a simple majority vote. The failed vote of Feb. 14 clearly delayed Hagel’s nomination from moving forward. Whether a filibuster itself is a positive assertion of minority rights or a negative instance of obstruction is in the eye of the beholder. Still, the definition of a filibuster is not precise. Making things more complicated is that Cornyn and others have said they intend to allow a vote on Hagel’s nomination in the near future. Overall, we rate Cornyn’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-02785	The "priorities" of more than three-quarters of Americans are to increase the minimum wage, create a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and require background checks for gun buyers.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/06/al-sharpton/sharpton-peoples-priorities-raise-minimum-wage/	Liberals like to claim that Republican policies are out of step with the views of most Americans. The Rev. Al Sharpton drew on some polling results to argue that point on his MSNBC show Politics Nation. Sharpton teed up his attack with an excerpt from a floor speech by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Boehner: House Republicans are listening. The Senate, the president continue to stand in the way of the people's priorities. Sharpton: The people's priorities? Let's take a look at some of those priorities. 76 percent want an increase in the minimum wage. How about focusing on that? 77 percent want a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. There's a priority you should focus on. And nearly one year after the Newtown tragedy, 89 percent support background checks. We see two facets to Sharpton’s claim. First, do better than three-quarters of Americans support a higher minimum wage, a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and enhanced background checks for gun-buyers? And second, are these "the people’s priorities"? On the first question, Sharpton largely has it right. For starters, he’s correct about how the congressional GOP’s stance contrasts with that of Americans as a whole. Republicans, with some help from a few Democrats, stymied a Senate bill to require background checks for sales at gun shows and over the web. Most congressional Republicans oppose raising the minimum wage. The idea of a path to citizenship divides the party, but opposition to it is significant and passionate. And Sharpton also has pretty good support for the notion that three-quarters of Americans back each of the three policy positions he cited. Sharpton had a graphic with the poll results and at the bottom were the sources: Quinnipiac University, Gallup and CBS. We reached out to MSNBC to get the specific polls they used but did not hear back. Here is what our research turned up. Sharpton’s claim Quinnipiac Gallup CBS 76% increase minimum wage NA 76% 69% 77% path to citizenship 57% 87% 77% 89% gun buyer background checks 89% 83% 88% By and large, the polls Sharpton cited back up his claim. On raising the minimum wage and background checks, he chose the highest percentage, but certainly with the latter, all of the results are in the same range. On the matter of citizenship for illegal immigrants, he chose the middle value. There was some variation in the way the polls asked their questions. On the minimum wage, Gallup asked about raising it to $9 an hour, while CBS simply asked if it should be raised and gave no dollar amount. On a pathway to citizenship, Quinnipiac was the outlier because it didn’t include the details of paying fines, waiting 10 years and other conditions before citizenship would be possible. (We’ll get into why that matters below.) On gun background checks, all three asked pretty much the same question. We also looked at other polls to see if they were in line with the ones Sharpton used. The results were mixed, possibly because some polls worded the question differently. We’ve marked those with an asterisk. Claim NBC/WSJ Pew Bloomberg ABC/WP 76% increase minimum wage 58%* 70% 77% path to citizenship 65%* 74% * 58%* 89% gun buyer background checks 81% 67% * What we glean from these polls is that support for raising the minimum wage might not be as strong as Sharpton said, but a healthy chunk of the public is behind it. The question on the NBC/Wall Street Journal survey was relatively complex. Pollsters asked people to assess whether they thought increasing it would be good because it would reduce poverty and spur growth, or bad because it would hurt small businesses and make it harder for low-skilled people to find jobs. That definitely was not as simple as asking whether the minimum wage should go up to $9 an hour, as most of the other polls did. Looking at background checks for gun buyers, we again see broad support. The ABC/Washington Post asked people what they thought about the Senate’s failure to pass a background check bill, a change that makes the responses more difficult to compare. Immigration is the thorniest topic and here’s where how the question was asked seemed to make a big difference. Both Bloomberg and NBC/Wall Street Journal put the question two ways. When they simply asked if people supported a pathway to citizenship, support stood at 46 percent in the Bloomberg poll and 52 percent in the NBC/Wall Street Journal survey. When they added details about applicants paying fines, passing a criminal background check and waiting 10 years, opinions sharply spiked towards approval. With the Bloomberg poll, support jumped to 74 percent. In the other, it went to 65 percent. Adding those policy details matches the question to the language in the Senate immigration bill. Where Sharpton’s summary fails to capture an important dimension is on the second part of our inquiry -- do these positions represent the public’s "priorities"? The reality is that these polls test the public views one issue at a time, and they don’t tell us where voters rank those issues in importance compared to other issues. There is a poll that tackles that question head on. The Pew Research Center for People and the Press has been looking at public’s policy priorities since 1994. The latest findings, from January 2013, show a very different picture than what Sharpton presents. Out of 21 issues, strengthening gun laws and dealing with illegal immigration rank near the bottom at 19 and 18 respectively. Pollsters didn’t ask specifically about the minimum wage. However, improving the job situation ranked second and helping the poor and the needy ranked ninth. It’s possible that raising the minimum wage would fit into those issues but the poll is otherwise silent on this point. Our ruling Sharpton said the "priorities" of more than three-quarters of Americans are to increase the minimum wage, create a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and require background checks for gun buyers. Polling generally backs up his claim about how Americans view those three issues, though there’s some variation in the polls, often depending on how the question is worded. However, it does not seem that these issues are "priorities" for the American public, as Sharpton claimed. In fact, he used the word three times in the space of a few sentences. So we give that part of the claim significant weight. We rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Al Sharpton	None	None	None	2013-12-06T15:23:50	2013-12-04	['United_States']

At the rally, the Rhode Island Democrat said more than 40 percent of sales nationally are made without background checks, according to a story in The Providence Journal. That 40-percent figure is mentioned often. Just two days before the Providence rally, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand cited it in an interview on MSNBC. President Obama also mentioned it when he outlined his gun-control proposals last month. Several PolitiFact affiliates have examined variations of the claim over the past year. PolitiFact National first checked a similar statement in July 2012 from New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. PolitiFact National initially rated the claim Mostly True but re-examined it after the Newtown shootings and, based on additional reporting, changed the ruling to Half True. For this item, we will summarize research done by PolitiFact affiliates, supplemented by our own reporting. First, a little background. Since 1994, federally licensed gun dealers have been required to verify that a buyer has not been convicted of a serious crime, declared mentally incompetent or is blocked for any of about 10 reasons. But the law doesn’t apply to private sellers at gun shows, flea markets, or people who post firearms for sale on the Internet. In those sales, there is no requirement for a background check, and no one needs to file any paperwork. So do those private sales account for 40 percent of all gun transactions? The source of that figure is a 1997 National Institute of Justice study, done by professors Philip Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, who examined data from a 1994 telephone survey about gun ownership. The survey, which sampled 2,568 homes, asked owners an array of questions, including how many guns were in the house, what they were used for, how they were stored and how they were obtained. Of the 2,568 households surveyed, 251 people answered the question about the origin of their guns. Cook and Ludwig found that 35.7 percent of that group reported obtaining their guns from somewhere other than a licensed dealer. (That has been rounded up to 40 percent.) In addition to the relatively small sample, there were other issues with the survey. Some respondents weren’t entirely sure whether the seller was a licensed dealer. In some cases, when the respondent skipped the question, the researchers made a judgment call. The study, conducted by respected researchers, may have been the most reliable information in its time. What’s less clear is how reliable its findings are today. The National Rifle Association, which opposes tighter gun controls, does not dispute the method or findings of the study but says the 40 percent claim is a misinterpretation by gun control advocates. In January 2013, Politifact National asked Cook, one of the study’s authors, what he thought about the 40 percent figure being referenced so frequently in the current gun-control debate. "I’ve been amazed at how much interest there’s been in it. It’s been lying there dormant for 20 years," he said. So is it still a reliable estimate of secondary market gun sales? "The answer is I have no idea," Cook said. "This survey was done almost 20 years ago. … It’s clear there are a lot of transactions that are not through dealers. How many, we’re not really clear on it. … We would say it’s a very old number." Other scholars had similar views. "I don’t see how anyone could know that number," James Jacobs of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law, told PolitiFact National. One expert, David Kopel at the University of Denver law school, said he doesn’t think the figure was ever accurate because of what the survey actually asked. On the other hand, three gun experts contacted by PolitiFact affiliates had different views. "The 40 percent seems about right," said Robert McCrie, of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. University of Central Florida Prof. Jay Corzine, who has attended and studied gun shows in Florida, says that, based on his observation, no more than 15 to 20 percent of sales at gun shows occur without a background check. But when you add in other private sales, the 40 percent figure is "probably accurate" and "a very good figure to use." Gary Kleck, a Florida State University professor whose research has provided the foundation for less restrictive concealed carry laws, said conditions in the gun market haven’t changed much since the 1997 study was done. Kleck says the 40 percent estimate is "probably still reasonably valid today." But he further argues that this fact shouldn’t guide new policy, because the problem is not how legal, background-checked purchasers are obtaining guns, but how criminals are. We e-mailed links of the previous PolitiFact rulings to Cicilline’s office and asked whether the congressman had any new information to budge the Truth-O-Meter. Richard Luchette, Cicilline’s communications director, responded in an e-mail noting that the figure came from the National Institute of Justice. "As I'm sure you know, this is the most commonly cited statistic and most current report used by gun violence prevention advocates because there are a number of restrictions currently written into law that have prevented additional research from being performed on this issue," he said. "We can go back and forth parsing this figure and looking at what other organizations have to say about it but I think you're missing the larger point," Luchette said. "Our country has a serious problem with gun violence, especially with mass shootings." He said, "Cicilline will remain focused on doing everything he can to address this problem." Our ruling U.S. Rep. Cicilline said that more than 40 percent of gun sales nationally are made without background check. Cicilline accurately quoted a figure that comes from a 15-year-old study, based on data that’s almost 20 years old. Clearly, many gun sales are made without background checks. There’s no current, reliable data to estimate what percentage of sales are made that way and experts disagree on whether the 40-percent figure is still valid. We rate Cicilline’s statement Half True.

pomt-08330	"We have empowered state insurance commissioners to review the rate hikes that are taking place in states. And in some states like North Carolina, they have already used it and rolled back premium increases by 25 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/28/barack-obama/obama-said-states-have-new-power-review-insurance-/	In an interview on The Daily Show on Oct. 27, 2010, President Barack Obama took issue with host Jon Stewart's contention that the price control measures of the health care law won't take effect until 2014 when the health care exchanges are created. "But up until that point, there's really nothing in this bill that doesn't allow these insurance companies to raise rates," Stewart said. "Not true," Obama retorted. "In fact, what we have done is we have empowered state insurance commissioners to review the rate hikes that are taking place in states. And some states, like North Carolina, they've already used it and rolled back premium increases by 25 percent." There's a lot packed into the hundreds of pages of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the issue of empowering states to limit rate hikes hasn't gotten much press, so we decided to take a look. First off, not every state's insurance commissioner has the power to regulate rate hikes. And many of those who do lack the resources to provide meaningful oversight. But as Obama said, the health care law seeks to address that. In all, the health care law provides states with $250 million over five years to help "by improving how states review proposed health insurance premium increases and holding insurance companies accountable for unjustified premiums increases." In August, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced the first allotment of that money: $1 million each in grants to 45 states and the District of Columbia to help states "crack down on unreasonable health insurance premium hikes." According to an Aug. 16, 2010, press release from HHS, "These Affordable Care Act grants will be used to help improve the oversight of proposed health insurance premium increases, take action against insurers seeking unreasonable rate hikes, and ensure consumers receive value for their premium dollars. For too long, insurance companies in many states have increased health insurance premiums with little oversight, transparency, or public accountability. Health insurance premiums have doubled on average during the last 10 years, much faster than wages and inflation, putting health coverage out of reach for millions of Americans and business owners. Today, just 26 states and the District of Columbia have the authority to reject a proposed increase that is excessive, lacks justification or otherwise exceeds state standards. Many states that have the authority lack resources to exercise it meaningfully. This lack of authority and resources for states has unfortunately contributed to unjustified premium increases in some states." While many states used the money to hire personnel -- such as actuaries -- to help them scrutinize proposed rate increases, 15 states used some of the money to pursue additional legislative powers to review and regulate rate hikes. "Will it be enough?" asked Betsy Imholz of the nonprofit Consumers Union. "That remains to be seen." Robert Hunter of the Consumer Federation of America said the health care law doesn't automatically grant regulatory power to states that don't already have it, as Obama's comment implies. The reality, he said, is that most states don't have the authority to regulate proposed premium increases. "It varies from state to state," Hunter said. "Some insurance commissioners don't want to take on the insurance companies. Others don't have the regulatory authority to do it." In the states that don't have regulatory authority, he said, "the most they can do is jawbone." That means they can try to persuade insurance companies to limit rate increases, but they don't have the power to enforce it. Nor is he convinced the measures in the health care law will encourage all states to step up their efforts. "Most of the insurance commissioners are incredibly weak," Hunter said. "We'd be lucky if a third of the states do anything." North Carolina, the state referenced by Obama, is one state that has done something. On Sept. 20, 2010, the North Carolina Department of Insurance announced that it had approved rate adjustments to some Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina plans. The insurer had sought a 6.97 percent increase in premiums for Blue Advantage policies; but the department only approved a 5.37 percent increase (which will save policyholders $14.5 million). That's a 23 percent decrease in the proposed rate hike -- very close to Obama's claim of 25 percent. The North Carolina Department of Insurance noted it was the lowest Blue Advantage rate increase in four years. So Obama was close to the mark with the example he cited in North Carolina. As for the claim that the health care law "empowered state insurance commissioners to review the rate hikes," that's mostly accurate. The law did not expressly empower every state to regulate rate hikes, but it provided resources to states to do more meaningful reviews of proposed rate increases, and it provided money for 15 states to seek regulatory power. And so we rate Obama's claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-10-28T19:16:28	2010-10-27	['North_Carolina']

pomt-13892	"If you are a member of union, your median weekly income is roughly $200 more than if you are a nonunion member, and that doesn’t include benefits."	true	/virginia/statements/2016/jun/29/thomas-perez/tom-perez-says-union-members-earn-median-200-week-/	U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez says a union job is a ticket to the middle class. "If you are a member of a union, your median weekly income is roughly $200 more than if you are a nonunion member, and that doesn’t include benefits," Perez said in an interview with the Richmond Times-Dispatch, prior to headlining the Democratic Party of Virginia’s Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner on June 18. We wondered if Perez’s figure is correct. Mattie Munoz, a spokeswoman for the labor secretary, said the information comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which which tracks the earnings of union and nonunion workers. The bureau examines "median" earnings - the halfway point at which 50 percent of workers make less and 50 percent of workers earn more. In 2015, the median weekly earnings for people who are a member of a union was $980, according to the bureau’s most current figures. For nonunion members, the median weekly pay was $776. That’s a $204 difference and in line with Perez’s claim. Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution, told our colleagues at PolitiFact National in a 2014 story that unions typically do a better job of raising wages for workers with less-than-average education than they do for those with higher levels of education. Someone who has a doctoral degree, for example, probably wouldn’t get as much of a pay bump from being in a union, but they might have better job security as well as better health and retirement benefits than their nonunion colleagues, Burtless said. Another table from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which further breaks down the pay disparity among specific occupations, shows that unionized workers in some professions earn less than their nonunion colleagues. In the architecture and engineering fields, for example, workers in a union last year had a median weekly pay of $1,393, but that was outpaced by nonunion workers who earned $1,427 each week. Federal employees who are in a union earn a median weekly pay of $1,058, while those not in a union earn more: $1,159 each week. But for other government employees, the story is different, with unions typically leading to larger paychecks. Across the country, state employees in a union earned a $988 median weekly salary, while nonunion workers earned a median $867. Unionized local government workers earned a median weekly salary of $1,043, compared with nonunion local government employees who earned $783 a week. This isn’t the first time Perez has made this claim, although he’s changed the wording. PolitiFact National in 2014 noted that the labor secretary said the "average" union member makes $200 more than a nonunion employee. That was rated Mostly True, since the figures involved instead are a tally of the "median" weekly pay rather than "average" pay. Our ruling Perez said that a union member’s median weekly income is about $200 more than someone who is not in a union. His figure, on the whole, holds up, although there are some professions that are exceptions. But Perez clearly was talking in general terms. So we rate his statement True.

pomt-12562	"Wisconsin’s economy is in the best shape it’s been since 2000."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/apr/13/scott-walker/possible-re-election-run-looms-scott-walker-says-w/	A boast Gov. Scott Walker made in his weekly radio address on March 23, 2017 sounded like one he’ll repeat -- if he runs for re-election in 2018, which is widely expected. After his standard, "Hi, Scott Walker here" greeting, the second-term Republican declared: "Wisconsin’s economy is in the best shape it’s been since 2000." It’s a bold, broad claim. Is it right? The measures On the radio, Walker backed his claim with one of his favorite statistics -- the state’s unemployment rate. It had just dropped to 3.7 percent in February 2017, the lowest since November 2000. Though important, the unemployment rate is but a single measure of the economy. When we asked for any other information to support the claim, his staff primarily cited declines in overall tax burden, income taxes and property taxes, saying "a competitive tax environment sets the stage for economic growth and simply allows households to keep more of their own money." But taxes are more a measure of the health and size of government, not how well the economy is doing. Indeed, when we asked six Wisconsin economics professors for advice on how to evaluate Walker’s claim, none cited any tax-related measure. With guidance from the experts and other sources, we settled on these six measures: Unemployment rate Labor participation rate Average weekly wages Average income for top earners vs rest of the population Gross domestic product per capita Poverty rate We’ll address them two at a time. Unemployment and employment See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Unemployment rate: Percentage of people in the labor force -- the civilian population ages 16 and older -- who are unemployed. Unemployment in Wisconsin was low in 2000 and it’s low again. The rate generally rose from 2000 to 2003, then dipped from 2003 to 2008, before peaking at around 9 percent in the second half of 2009 and early 2010. Since, then has steadily declined. Walker was correct in saying that the 3.7 percent rate in February 2017 was the lowest monthly rate since November 2000. (It was as low as 3.2 percent in January and February of 2000). Labor participation rate: Percentage of the population that is either working or actively seeking work -- excluding people such as college students and retirees. The labor participation rate is important because it takes into account people who are unemployed plus so-called discouraged workers -- those who are unemployed and not looking for work. The figures show labor participation in Wisconsin is declining. During 2000 and into 2001, the rate generally rose a bit, hitting 73.3 percent in March 2001. But since then, it’s been on a downward slope, hitting 68.3 percent in February 2017. That means fewer people are in the workforce. The takeaway: Unemployment backs Walker’s claim; labor participation does not. Wages and income See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Real average weekly wage: What a person (in the private sector) is paid for working, adjusted for inflation, including not only regular wages but pay such as bonuses. Wages in Wisconsin have generally been on an upward trend. The figures are reported quarterly, but since they tend to vary by season (summer vs winter, for example), we looked at annual numbers. On that basis, the average weekly wage rose from 2000 to 2004, and then rose and fell until 2011. Since then it’s been on the rise, hitting $896 in 2015, the last year for which annual data are available. That’s higher than any year going back to 2000. Income distribution: How much more income is earned by people near the top of the scale versus the rest of the population. Income includes not only wages, but also money from sources such as investments and welfare benefits. In Wisconsin, the gap between people near the top of the income scale and the rest of the population is growing. We compared the average income of a person in the top 10 percent versus a person in the bottom 90 percent -- in other words, people near the top versus the rest of the population, taking inflation into account. In 2013, the latest data available for this comparison, the annual income for the average person in the top 10 percent was $234,916. That’s 6.7 times more than the average income in the bottom 90 percent, which was $35,102. That ratio has generally increased since 2000, when it was 6.0. The takeaway: Average wages back Walker’s claim, since they’re up; but income distribution doesn’t, given that the gap is growing between the relatively few people on the top end of the scale and everyone else. Productivity and poverty See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Real GDP per capita: Total value of goods and services produced, divided by the population and adjusted for inflation. Gross domestic product per person in Wisconsin, taking into account inflation, rose from 2000 to 2006, dropped from then until 2009, and has been on the rise since. The latest figure, for 2015, showed real GDP at $46,893 per person -- higher than any previous year going back to 2000, when it was $41,911. Poverty rate: Percentage of people below the official poverty threshold. Poverty is calculated based on a person’s income from sources such as wages, Social Security and child support, as well as from "cash" government benefits such as public assistance and unemployment insurance. The poverty threshold for 2015, the most recent year available for this comparison, was $12,082 for a single person and $24,257 for a family of four. In Wisconsin, the poverty rate has trended upward. The 2015 rate was 11.4 percent. That’s higher than every year going back 2000 except for two (12.4 percent in 2004 and 13.1 percent in 2011). The takeaway: GDP helps Walker’s claim; poverty does not. Summing up As we’ve noted in previous fact checks, governors have some impact on a state’s economy, but many other factors, including national trends, are at work. In this instance, Walker didn’t explicitly take credit for what he says is a better economy, though he implies it. The economists we consulted see some improvements and some declines in how Wisconsin’s economy is now compared to 2000. "The economic portrait of Wisconsin since 2000 is mixed at best," said Lawrence University’s Merton Finkler. "Clearly, the Wisconsin economy is not as dynamic as some others, such as Minnesota's. Part of the reason is that it has done a relatively poor job of encouraging startup enterprises, which tend to grow employment faster than larger and older firms." Said Andrew Reschovsky at the University of Wisconsin-Madison: "A growing economy is characterized by rising real per capita GDP and rising real wages. This growth is to be expected, and reflects increased labor productivity over time. Although Wisconsin’s economy is larger now than it was in 2000, the fact that the poverty rate is higher and that there is growing income inequality indicates that the benefits of our growing economy have gone mainly to those with the highest incomes." Our rating Walker said: "Wisconsin’s economy is in the best shape it’s been since 2000." The latest figures for the unemployment rate, wages and gross domestic product support Walker’s claim. But the figures for labor participation rate, income and poverty do not. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.

pomt-10767	"I brought down crime more than anyone in this country -- maybe in the history of this country -- while I was mayor of New York City." -	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/22/rudy-giuliani/updated-the-turn-around-started-before-rudy-did/	At the Oct. 21, 2007 debate at the Republican Party of Florida's convention in Orlando, Rudolph Giuliani worked a favorite theme, that his record of cutting crime in New York makes him a top choice for president. But as he has before, he overstated his achievement. "I brought down crime more than anyone in this country -- maybe in the history of this country -- while I was mayor of New York City," Giuliani said in Orlando. The statement was similar to another that we checked. In an interview with The New Yorker magazine published Aug. 20, 2007, Giuliani claimed that he reversed New York's crime trend. "I mean, we took a city that nobody believed could be turned around with regard to crime, and really did turn it around. That's not like a political slogan. We really did it," he told the magazine. Both statements have elements of truth, but don't tell the full story. Violent crime in New York actually began falling three years before Giuliani became mayor in 1994, and property crime started falling four years before. He didn't "turn it around." Nor was New York unique in its crime trends. Many big cities enjoyed similar decreases in crime throughout the 1990s. Depending on the type of crime, in fact, other cities had sharper drops than New York. And the major U.S. city with the steepest decline in violent crime? San Francisco, where it fell by 64.5 percent from 1993 to 2001, compared with 55.6 percent in New York. Meanwhile, independent studies generally have failed to link the tactics of the Giuliani administration with the large decrease in crime rates. Rather, many criminologists believe the decline in New York, as in Chicago, Miami, San Francisco and elsewhere, was the result of a complex mix of social and demographic changes, including a break in the crack cocaine epidemic, an improving economy, and longer prison terms for career criminals. Giuiliani's push for better policing tactics and policies were likely part of it, but not to the extent he claims, experts say. His numbers do look good, and the decline in crime rates sure picked up speed when he was in charge: After falling about 12 percent from 1990 to 1993, violent crime dropped 56 percent over the next eight years. But most big cities, and the nation as a whole, followed a similar pattern: A slow fall beginning around 1990 or 1991, followed by a sharp drop over the next decade. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03526	Says 13 Texas universities "have announced or implemented a $10,000 degree."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/may/31/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-13-texas-universities-have-announc/	Texas’ governor threw out a challenge in 2011 that some in higher education said was impossible to meet. Two years later, Rick Perry says it’s underway. A May 17, 2013, press release from Perry’s office said, "The governor has renewed his challenge for institutions to offer bachelor's degrees for $10,000 or less, including books. So far, 13 institutions have announced or implemented a $10,000 degree." Perry first called for such degrees in his Feb. 8, 2011, state-of-the-state address. Public skepticism included a claim from the chairman of the Travis County Democratic Party that "nobody in higher education believes that is even possible," which we rated False, finding not only disagreement but existing $10,000 degrees in Texas and elsewhere. In 2012, the Austin American-Statesman reported on nine programs that universities had already announced or identified in response to Perry’s challenge. The Aug. 5, 2012, news story said that most of the programs relied on scholarships, financial aid and students amassing credit hours in advance at a lower-tuition institution or for free in high school. Also, few included the cost of books in the $10,000 price tag, the story said. In 2013-14, the average annual full-time tuition and mandatory fees at a Texas public university are estimated at $7,600, with books and supplies averaging another $1,200, according to Dominic Chavez, a spokesman for the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Put another way, the average four-year tab for tuition, fees, books and supplies, provided these estimates do not change, would be $35,200. So, how many institutions have made $10,000 degree programs a reality since 2011? Perry spokesman Josh Havens emailed us a list of 13 universities: University of Texas at Arlington University of Texas of the Permian Basin University of Texas at Brownsville Tarleton State University Texas A&M University-Commerce Texas A&M International University Texas A&M University-San Antonio Texas A&M University-Texarkana Angelo State University Sul Ross State University University of Houston-Clear Lake University of Houston-Downtown University of Houston-Victoria Chavez emailed us descriptions of each program compiled from news reports and schools’ announcements. We verified information with each university’s representatives or website and got more details. While we confirmed that each university has a program that offers a degree or degrees with a price tag of $10,500 or less, here’s the big catch: Seven require students to earn up to 87 college credit hours elsewhere and don’t include those costs in the sticker price. (Two require 75 community college hours but include that cost in their price tag.) The UT-Arlington program, for example, is a partnership with two local school districts in which students earn 24 hours of college credit in high school, move on to get an associate’s degree at Tarrant County College and then finish their bachelor’s degree at UTA. If they manage all that and keep a 3.25 grade point average while getting the associate’s degree, spokeswoman Kristin Sullivan told us, they will get a scholarship that pays all UTA tuition and fees over $10,000. So, only four universities offer programs where students can start with no hours and earn 120 hours at the university for $10,500 or less. And one of those is an online-only degree that can range from $5,000 to $14,000 depending on how many hours a student can get credit for based on work and other experience (at A&M-Commerce). Also, the online A&M-Commerce program is the only one of the 13 that covers the cost of books. Some of the 13 programs offer limited choice or very specific degrees, such as the bachelor’s in information technology with an emphasis on information security at Texas A&M-San Antonio. Others give wider choices -- for example, any degree offered at UT-Arlington. The two programs that require community college but include that tuition in the sticker price: UH-Clear Lake: 75 hours at a community college and 45 hours at the university -- costing a total $10,014 to $10,372, depending on the college attended and including $3,835 in Pell grants -- for a bachelor of applied science in early childhood education, health care services or information technology. UH-Downtown: The same 75/45 split of hours and $3,559 in Pell grants (that’s the average Pell amount awarded to UHD students) yield a cost of $9,116 to $9,801, depending on the college attended, for a bachelor of applied arts and science degree in applied administration or a bachelor of science degree in interdisciplinary studies. The four programs in which students can amass up to 120 hours entirely from the university that will be issuing their diploma: UT-Permian Basin: For bachelor of science degrees in chemistry, computer science, geology, information systems or math, students in the university’s Texas Science Scholar Program pay "$10,000 in tuition and fees for the four-year curriculum," not including books, according to the program’s web page. A&M-Commerce: Up to 120 online hours result in a bachelor of applied science degree in organizational leadership. Students can submit equivalent experience for up to 90 hours of those credits, according to Mary Hendrix, vice president of student access and success. That variability means the cost "will range from $5,000 to $14,000," including books, Hendrix told us by email. Angelo State: Qualifying students can get a $5,000-per-year scholarship that reduces tuition and fees to $9,974 for a bachelor of interdisciplinary studies degree, according to an Oct. 3, 2012, press release. Texas residents with certain scores or better on one of two college admissions tests (27 on the ACT or 1220 on combined SAT) qualify for the program and the scholarship. University spokesman Tom Nurre said the cost does not include books, and noted transfer students can join if they have a 3.5 or better grade point average. UH-Victoria: By getting scholarships and completing college in three years, students can earn a $9,999 bachelor’s degree in English, history, communication, psychology, Spanish or criminal justice, said a Jan. 11, 2013, press release. That assumes a UHV scholarship for $1,845 a year plus "the average Pell grant of $3,593 per year"; other scholarships can "help defer costs of books and living expenses." Our ruling Perry said 13 Texas institutions had announced or implemented a $10,000 degree. That count draws on a state-researched list. By our analysis, however, only four programs offer degrees earned entirely at the university whose name is on the diploma for $10,500 or less. Two more universities expect students to attend community college first but pay a total of $10,372 or less at both institutions. That leaves seven universities that expect students to earn their $10,000 degrees after corraling up to 87 college credits in other ways that presumably cost additional money. Several also require students following the $10,000 degree plans to have income-based Pell grants or to qualify for other scholarships. These realities are more complicated than the governor suggested. We rate his statement, which has an element of truth, as Mostly False.

pomt-05282	Says new figures he released showing Wisconsin job gains for 2011 are "the final job numbers."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/may/24/scott-walker/recall-battle-wisconsin-gov-scott-says-new-figures/	A day after Gov. Scott Walker announced statistics indicating Wisconsin had gained jobs in 2011 -- not lost them, as earlier numbers showed -- he touted the new figure in a TV ad, saying: "The government just released the final job numbers. And, as it turns out, Wisconsin actually gained -- that's right, gained -- more than 20,000 new jobs during my first year in office." We’ve rated Mostly False Walker’s claim in the ad that 33,200 jobs have been added during his watch when you add the new 2011 figure to monthly numbers for 2012. While both sets of numbers are the most up to date, they are gathered differently and cannot be added in this manner, and they were presented without critical facts. We’ve also rated False a claim by Democrat Tom Barrett -- Walker’s challenger in the June 5, 2012 recall election -- that Walker was "cooking the books" and had "dreamed up" the 20,000 figure. It’s a real number the state submitted to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. But there is another question tied in to both statements: Are the 2011 figures Walker announced three weeks before the election "the final job numbers" as he said in the ad? His claim suggests, despite the controversy that ensued after his announcement, that the new figure has been reviewed by the federal government and is complete. The 20,000 figure -- a precise figure of 23,321 appears on the screen in the ad -- comes from a quarterly jobs count involving about 95 percent of Wisconsin employers done by the state. The day Walker announced the figure the state reported job numbers for the final quarter of the year to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is the official jobs scorekeeper. But just submitting the count does not make it final. BLS will review the quarterly count and possibly adjust it before releasing a figure in late June 2012, some three weeks after the recall election. That’s when an official jobs lost or added figure for 2011 will be, well, official. Walker himself has acknowledged it’s unusual for a state to release its quarterly job count before BLS does it officially, although BLS has said states are free to do so. Walker didn’t respond to our request for comment on his claim. But his own Department of Workforce Development, which submits the jobs data to BLS, notes that BLS won’t issue an official figure for 2011 until the end of June. Our rating Walker said new figures he released indicating Wisconsin added more than 20,000 jobs in 2011 are "the final job numbers." But the count won’t become final until after it is reviewed by the federal government. We rate Walker’s statement False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2012-05-24T19:02:00	2012-05-16	['Wisconsin']
pomt-13185	"Wikileaks also shows how John Podesta rigged the polls by oversampling Democrats, a voter suppression technique."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/25/donald-trump/trump-absurd-claims-podesta-rigged-polls/	Two weeks away from the Nov. 8 election, Donald Trump is behind in the polls. According to him, it’s because the Hillary Clinton campaign tampered with them. "Wikileaks also shows how (Clinton campaign chairman) John Podesta rigged the polls by oversampling Democrats, a voter suppression technique," Trump said at a Oct. 24 rally in St. Augustine, Fla. "And that’s happening to me all the time. When the polls are even, when they leave them alone and do them properly, I’m leading. But you see these polls, where they’re polling Democrats -- ‘how’s Trump doing’ ‘oh he’s down’ -- they’re polling Democrats!" We were curious about Trump’s charge of bogus polling. Trump is wrong that Wikileaks shows Podesta rigging the polls against him. He’s referring to an email obtained by the hacker group from Clinton’s 2008 (not 2016) campaign on what appears to be internal polling (not public ones published by media organizations). And oversampling in this instance means polling more people in a specific demographic group for analysis -- not ignoring Republican voters to suppress their votes. In short, oversampling is a common polling technique and not, as Trump says, one of "voter suppression." The email, one of thousands of Podesta emails released by Wikileaks, is a January 2008 exchange between Democratic strategists and employees of the Atlas Project, a political polling and data firm. Atlas sent over 98 pages of polling and media recommendations that includes several recommendations to oversample minorities, independent voters and Democrats in certain states. Experts told us the technical term for this is "stratified disproportionate sampling," but most pollsters use "oversample" as a shorthand. It’s done not to skew the polls, but to gauge the attitudes of specific demographic groups, who would not be a statistically large enough group to analyze if sampled randomly. For example, in a national sample of 1,000 eligible voters, only 12.5 percent, or 125, would be black. To accurately gauge black attitudes on certain issues, a pollster may oversample 500 black eligible voters (four times more than the random sample). Then, in analyzing the full sample, the sample of blacks would be assigned a weight of 0.25 to represent the overall population. "If the analysis of the group is done separately, it is simply a large sample of that group. If combined with all respondents the oversample is weighted down proportionately so that the overall sample is representative of the population as a whole," said Charles Franklin, the director of Marquette Law School Poll. "This is a standard procedure and does not mean the weighted sample gives disproportionate weight to the oversampled group." The Pew Research Center explained that it, for example, oversampled Hispanics for an in-depth look at the U.S. Hispanic population in June 2016. Analysts then weighted Hispanics when looking at the overall population to have both "more precise estimates when looking at Hispanics specifically" and also "the correct distribution when looking at the sample as a whole." Roger Tourangeau, president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, pointed out that monthly federal surveys on unemployment do the same. To get an accurate understanding of joblessness in Wyoming, pollsters would need to call a number of Wyoming residents disportionate to the number of people in the entire country. Trump’s overall charges of skewed polls is "nonsense," Tourangeau said, "Nobody wants to produce a biased assessment and look like an idiot (on Election Day). Why would people deliberately get it wrong? It’s business suicide." Our ruling Trump said, "Wikileaks also shows how John Podesta rigged the polls by oversampling Democrats, a voter suppression technique." A leaked email shows the Clinton campaign of 2008 consulted data firm that suggest oversampling in what is likely internal polling. The term refers to a common technique used by pollsters to analyze demographics groups more precisely than possible in a random sample.

pomt-15090	Pediatricians have cut down on the number and proximity of vaccines because they recognize there have been "too many in too short a period of time."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2015/sep/17/ben-carson/ben-carson-says-pediatricians-realize-need-cut-dow/	CNN’s Jake Tapper noted that a backlash against vaccines was blamed for a measles outbreak in California. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has linked childhood vaccines to autism despite the medical community debunking that myth. During the second GOP debate, Tapper asked Ben Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon who now lives in West Palm Beach, if Trump should stop making such a claim. Carson said Trump should look at the evidence, noting that there is "extremely well-documented proof that there’s no autism associated with vaccinations." Carson then turned the subject to the scheduling of vaccines: "But it is true that we are probably giving way too many in too short a period of time. And a lot of pediatricians now recognize that, and I think are cutting down on the number and the proximity in which those are done, and I think that’s appropriate." Are pediatricians cutting down on the number and proximity of vaccines? As for Trump’s claim about autism, as PolitiFact has noted before, decades of epidemiological research have demonstrated autism rates do not increase when vaccines are introduced to a population. We contacted Carson’s campaign to ask for his evidence and did not get a reply. Vaccines Doctors follow a childhood vaccination schedule prepared by the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Children may receive as many as 24 immunizations by their second birthday and may receive up to five injections during a single doctor’s visit, according to a 2013 paper by The Institute of Medicines of the National Academies. That vaccine schedule is also supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control. More than 90 percent of children entering kindergarten have been immunized with recommended vaccines in accordance with this schedule. But some parents have sought to delay vaccines or reduce the number given per visit, while others have rejected them entirely, despite recommendations by the scientific community. That’s not a good idea, according to the report. "Delaying or declining vaccination has led to outbreaks of such vaccine-preventable diseases as measles and whooping cough that may jeopardize public health, particularly for people who are under-immunized or who were never immunized," wrote researchers. The researchers also concluded that there is "no evidence that the schedule is unsafe." The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a press release in 2013 stating that it agreed with the paper’s conclusion. After the Republican debate, it issued a new statement in support of vaccines: "Claims that vaccines are linked to autism, or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature. It is dangerous to public health to suggest otherwise," wrote Karen Remley, executive director of the academy. Despite the scientific consensus, pediatricians are facing pressure from parents to delay vaccines. A survey of 534 pediatricians done for the American Academy of Pediatricians in 2012 showed that 93 percent reported that within a typical month some parents asked to spread out the vaccinations. The vast majority thought these parents were putting their children at risk for disease but thought they would build trust with the families if they agreed to the request. While there is anecdotal evidence that some pediatricians have acquiesced to parents’ requests to delay vaccinations, that decision is not rooted in public health or science. "There is no evidence that pediatricians 'recognize' that we give too many vaccines in too short a time," said Mark Schleiss, division director of pediatric infectious diseases at University of Minnesota. "Far from it. ... There is no evidence at all that spacing vaccines out or changing the schedule would improve health or help children." Eugene R. Hershorin, chief of the division of general pediatrics at the University of Miami, pointed to what happened a decade ago when England and Japan delayed the DTaP vaccine, a combination vaccine used to prevent diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. "There was a tremendous increase in the incidence of pertussis in both countries, leading them to re-institute the schedule immediately," he said. Our ruling Carson said pediatricians have cut down on the number and proximity of vaccines because they recognize there have been "too many in too short a period of time." Leading medical organizations have concluded that the scheduling of vaccines -- including multiple ones at once -- is safe. While there is evidence that some parents ask pediatricians to delay vaccines, that’s a decision based on parents’ wishes and isn’t based on scientific evidence. There is no evidence that pediatricians are cutting down the number and proximity of vaccines based on any conclusion by them that there have been too many in too short a period of time. Carson has provided no evidence to support his claim. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2015-09-17T14:43:40	2015-09-16	['None']
pomt-03669	"Why is President Obama unnecessarily delaying your flight? FAA could cut other spending."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/26/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-faa-could-cut-funds-avoid-furloug/	With frustrated travelers tapping their feet in the nation’s airports this week, politicians responded with alarm to flight delays brought on by federal budget cuts. Beginning Monday, April 22, 2013, furloughs of air traffic controllers began to take effect under sequestration, a deficit-reduction measure that bluntly cuts federal agency budgets. The furloughs triggered flight delays around the country as the FAA scaled back the number of planes that could take off and land because the agency had fewer controllers to direct them. U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., joined the criticism that the FAA is maximizing the budget cuts’ inconvenience on travelers. "Why is President Obama unnecessarily delaying your flight? FAA could cut other spending," Cantor tweeted on April 23, 2013. The FAA has said it made all the cuts it could but sequestration still leaves no option but to furlough employees. So who’s right? We decided to check it out. Cuts & furloughs We looked into a similar claim from Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood before the sequester took effect. The Obama administration and federal agencies were warning that flight delays would result. Sequestration is forcing the FAA to carve $600 million from its budget, and LaHood said furloughing air traffic controllers was the last step after every other cut has been made. But air traffic controllers make up a big chunk of the FAA’s workforce: 15,000 of its 47,000 employees. "We’re looking at everything possible; and everything possible that’s legal, we will do," he said at the White House. That includes cutting travel, cutting overtime, freezing hiring, canceling conferences and reducing contracts. So what exactly is legal to cut? The Budget Control Act of 2011, the law authorizing the sequester, says "each non-exempt account within a category shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the baseline level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate a breach within that category." (That clause comes from a similar deficit control law from 1985, the first time "sequestration" was implemented.) It means, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget, that sequestration "must be applied equally at the program, project, and activity level within each budget account." That’s why officials and politicians call sequestration a blunt instrument. "The sequester language does not allow us to move funding from account to account, and we simply can’t make the required cuts without facility closures and furloughs," DOT spokesman Justin Nisly told PolitiFact in February. A $474 million FAA grant? Cantor’s tweet included a link to a Wall Street Journal editorial criticizing the Obama administration for flight delays and spending decisions. It pointed to a $474 million grant program posted this week on DOT’s website that promises to "make communities more livable and sustainable." "How about awarding grants to the control towers at Hartsfield and O'Hare?" the editorial said. Nisly said the grant program "was specifically designed by Congress as a rigorous competition to fund projects that have a significant impact on the nation, a region or metropolitan area. The program has been wildly popular, and the DOT has received more than $105 billion in applications for only $3.1 billion available. Each round of TIGER involves a detailed application and a thorough review of the merits of each project." Merits aside, FAA grant programs are entirely excluded from sequester cuts. "Under the rules of the sequester, the airport grant program was exempted, as were all grant programs ... of the Department of Transportation. What that means is that it falls disproportionately on the operating side of the budget," FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told a House subcommittee this week. The editorial also mentioned $500 million the agency is spending on consultants. But FAA officials have said that money pays, not for consultants, but for contracts that support the air traffic control system, including telecommunications and weather radar. As we were working on this report, the earth moved a little under this issue. Five days into the furloughs, the Senate unanimously passed a bill allowing the FAA to move funds around and end furloughs. The House approved the legislation a day later. (Cantor voted for it.) As of this writing, it awaits Obama’s signature; he is expected to sign it. "Congress just passed legislation that now enables the FAA to have the flexibility it needs to make less disruptive changes, so clearly there was something in the law that was posing a problem," said Clifford Winston, an economist with the Brookings Institution. Our ruling Cantor said flights were being delayed unnecessarily because the FAA could have cut other funds before furloughing air traffic controllers. But the law authorizing sequestration states that cuts must be applied equally. Given that the FAA is a huge federal agency tasked with cutting $600 million, to say there is no wiggle room is a stretch. But sequestration does not allow elimination of entire programs or departments to spend the money on in other areas, such as paying air traffic controllers. What’s more, the fact that Congress was compelled to act to give the FAA that flexibility undercuts the argument that the agency could have moved funds around all along.

Numerous tweets, made on Sept. 11, 2017, and more so over the previous several days, suggest the Janesville Republican has no idea what the minimum hourly rate of pay is in his home state. But that’s not really what went down. Live interview On Sept. 7, 2017, Ryan was on a live webcast interview with the New York Times before an audience in Washington, D.C. The newspaper described it as "the first in a provocative new TimesTalks D.C. series." At one point, Jonathan Weisman, deputy Washington editor for the Times, asked: "What’s the minimum wage in Wisconsin right now?" Ryan immediately said, "Seven --" then looks upward, apparently trying to recall the rest. Then he says: "What is it? Seven and t--." Perhaps he was starting to say twenty-five, or some figure in the twenties. At that moment, there’s a response from the audience, Ryan looks to the audience and correctly says: $7.25. So, if Ryan didn’t know the rate exactly at that moment, he certainly was in the ballpark. Wisconsin’s $7.25, by the way, is the same as the federal minimum wage, both of which have been in place since 2009. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, as of July 1, 2017, Wisconsin and Iowa were among 14 states with a minimum wage at $7.25 per hour. Twenty-nine states, plus the District of Columbia, had higher rates, with D.C.’s being the highest, at $12.50. The federal rate applies in states that have minimum wage laws at rates below the federal rate, or that have no minimum wage law at all. For the record, a Times news article said Ryan made it clear in the interview that he opposes legislation to change the federal minimum wage, saying: "For every wage you raise, you actually end up losing jobs. You end up destroying jobs." Our rating Tweets say: "Paul Ryan doesn't know what the minimum wage is in Wisconsin." Asked the amount in an interview, Ryan didn’t give a complete answer until he heard what a member of the listening audience said. But he had immediately started his answer by saying "Seven," and seemed on the verge of adding 25 cents, or some figure in the twenties, before the audience member interjected. That’s when Ryan correctly said $7.25. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-13288	Says "Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers’ rights set up what amounts to a sweatshop in Haiti."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/11/donald-trump/trump-mangles-facts-clinton-and-haiti-jobs-project/	Hillary Clinton is facing criticism for her role in facilitating the creation of an industrial park in post-earthquake Haiti that has been accused of displacing farmers and failing to live up to rosy job creation projections. Among the charges, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Clinton pushed aside regulations to create sweatshop-like conditions. "Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers’ rights set up what amounts to a sweatshop in Haiti," Trump said Sept. 6, 2016. Clinton, as secretary of state, certainly lauded the project as part of a plan to revitalize Haiti following the devastating earthquake in 2010, and the U.S. government financially supported it. But did she help a company create a sweatshop? The evidence is thin. The Caracol Industrial Park In 2010, Haiti’s leaders unveiled a plan to spur growth beyond the capital city of Port-au-Prince. One project that emerged was to build an industrial park on the country’s northern coast a little over a mile from Caracol Bay. It was going to bring tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, government officials said. Getting it off the ground took a collaboration among the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the government of Haiti, and a South Korean clothing maker, Sae-A Trading. Sae-A, under the name of S&H Global, would be the anchor tenant of the new industrial park, producing clothes for clients such as Target and Walmart. Bill and Hillary Clinton, champions of that vision, came to the park’s grand opening. In fact, both of them lobbied hard for the project. Bill Clinton in his role as special envoy to Haiti pushed for expanded garment making. Sae-A said Clinton herself invited the company to build a factory at the industrial park. The U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $170 million to support the industrial park by building a power plant and improving the port. "What is happening here in Caracol is already having ripple effects that will create jobs and opportunities far beyond this industrial park," Hillary Clinton said at the Caracol opening ceremony. But that really hasn't happened. The industrial park has been beseiged by criticism of millions of dollars wasted, displaced farmers and sluggish job growth. Today, four years, later, total employment is about 8,100. (The State Department told us after publication that new data show the facility now employs about 9,400 people.) That's the background. Now, we'll look at the specifics of Trump's claim. Clinton's role in environmental and labor rules Trump said Clinton "set aside environmental and labor rules" to make the project a reality. The Trump campaign pointed to an article that appeared in the New York Times. That report cited environmentalists decrying the placement of the industrial zone near a sensitive marine habitat. The U.S. Treasury Department abstained from voting on the project due to concerns over the limited environmental impact studies that had been prepared. That's not the same as Clinton setting aside rules, and people involved with the project said Clinton played no role. Charles Krakoff, managing partner of the consulting firm Koios Associates, created the environmental impact report in an assessment for the government of Haiti and the Inter-American Development Bank. Krakoff told us that the Haitians, the development bank and USAID pressed for a quick turnaround, and he agrees that his firm did not produce a full long-term analysis. But he said he did address the immediate impacts and laid out the sort of studies needed later. The Inter-American Development Bank followed through. It commissioned a more comprehensive study in 2014, which was completed in August 2016. "Environmental standards were not changed for this project," Krakoff said. USAID produced a separate environmental impact study for the power plant alone. Importantly, Krakoff said the key decision to place the industrial park in Caracol was made by the government of Haiti not Clinton. Whatever environmental issues that raised flowed from that point forward and Clinton played no role. "We told them two other locations would be better, but the government wanted it in Caracol," Krakoff said. "The Haitians and the Inter-American Development Bank had more say in this project than the United States." Sae-A's record on workers' rights Clinton, as we already said, did play a part in getting Sae-A to Haiti, and Sae-A does not have a perfect record with workers. The company had a significant dispute with the union at a factory in Guatemala. The AFL-CIO accused it of anti-union repression including "acts of violence and intimidation." Sae-A ultimately abandonned that Guatemalan factory. But, in 2008, the International Trade Union Confederation highlighted the company as one of only three in Guatemala that had unions at all and met with union representatives weekly to discuss working conditions. We found an academic article that accurately described an episode when Sae-A managers at one plant in Guatemala used police to intimidate union organizers. The researcher cited a WikiLeaks cable from 2005 as proof, but failed to note that the cable went on to say that when the government and the company found out what happened, it fired all the managers involved and reinstated the workers with back pay. In Nicaragua, a 2013 investigation of a clash between union supporters and non-union workers found that Sae-A did nothing to prevent the unrest. So, the evidence that Sae-A violated workers rights is limited. The company had a dispute with its unions in Guatemala and allowed a fight to break out between union and non-union workers in Nicaragua. Is Sae-A running a sweatshop? Many factories in Haiti are subject to six-month inspections by Better Work Haiti, a project of the International Labor Organization. The latest assessment raises a few points of concern, but nothing that would in any way meet the definition of sweatshop conditions. On the contrary, the report lists several strengths, including providing "free, first-class education to the workers’ kids." The company provides paid sick and maternity leave, which according to the company, has been used in 6,336 and 220 cases respectively in 2016. There are three unions in the factory representing about 30 percent of all workers. Safety and health conditions passed muster in the assessment. The issues raised were isolated, or due more to workers not using safety equipment (ear plugs) that the company gave them (and trained them on why they should use them.) Inspectors and the company have a dispute on the legal definition for holiday, sick and maternity leave pay that has been referred to the government for resolution.Of workers who are paid based on how much they produce, only 41 percent make the government’s target minimum wage, which suggests much improvement is needed, although the inspectors did not say this made the company non-compliant with the law. Pay is a point of broader concern. The advocacy group Worker Rights Consortium issued a report in 2013 that accused Sae-A of "ongoing theft of legally-earned wages." But when we asked the executive director if this met the criteria of operating a sweatshop, he declined to comment. The AFL-CIO also failed to respond to questions about Sae-A. Our ruling Trump said Clinton "set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers’ rights set up what amounts to a sweatshop in Haiti." There is no evidence that Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules and Trump exaggerated about the record of the South Korean company in question. We rate this statement Mostly False. Correction Oct. 12, 2016 Sae-A closed the Guatemala factory where it had a dispute with a union. A previously version of this fact-check incorrectly said Sae-A left the country entirely. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4e6663b3-a536-4892-b9a6-79688568959f	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-11T09:00:00	2016-09-06	['South_Korea', 'Haiti']
pomt-06192	A database police use to look up wanted suspects excludes certain warrants issued by Atlanta Municipal Court.	true	/georgia/statements/2011/dec/12/city-atlanta/city-criminal-database-lacks-some-warrants/	The handling of a police traffic stop involving Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed’s brother raises questions about power, politics and ethics. What has the Truth-O-Meter spinning is a more practical concern: crime databases. When police stopped Tracy Reed on Oct. 28, he had an open warrant for failing to appear at a traffic court hearing three weeks earlier. Reed could have been arrested on the spot. Yet when an officer ran his name in the Atlanta Police Department’s criminal database, the warrant never popped up. A police major let Reed go. This was no fluke, according to a recent city of Atlanta news release about its internal investigation on the stop. Police may rely upon the Atlanta Criminal Information Center database to find out whether someone has a warrant, but in certain cases, it can’t tell them. "Atlanta Municipal Court bench warrants are not included in the Atlanta Criminal Information Center [ACIC] database," the Nov. 28 release said. Bench warrants are arrest warrants initiated by a judge, often when people fail to appear in court. We PolitiFact Georgia scribes squinted our eyes and read the sentence twice. If these arrest warrants aren’t in the system, how do police know whom to haul to jail? We talked to Atlanta police, reviewed existing policies and statutes, contacted court officials, and looked at investigative reports to find some answers. And yes, there is a hole in the city’s criminal database. In case you missed the controversy, Reed ran into trouble Oct. 28 after an Atlanta police officer stopped him for driving with an expired tag, according to a city internal investigation. Even though Reed drove with a license suspended since 2006, the patrolman’s superior let the mayor’s brother go. Running a criminal history database is a complex operation. The information is sensitive and the stakes are high. If the people who enter the data get it wrong or don’t enter it in time, an officer might come face to face with a dangerous felon and not even know it. A person could be jailed for a crime he didn’t commit. That means police can’t do something as simple as make a phone call or send an email to put a warrant in the system, state and local law enforcement officials told us. Only specially certified employees may enter the information into the computer, and they may do so only after receiving the proper documentation. When Atlanta police obtain warrants as part of their investigations, agency policy gives investigating officers 12 hours to hand-deliver the paperwork to the APD team that updates the criminal database. But when an Atlanta municipal judge issues a warrant because someone fails to appear in court, no one hands this paperwork over for entry in the city’s database, police spokesman Carlos Campos told PolitiFact. In fact, these bench warrants are not entered into any local, state or national database, according to the city’s investigative report. Georgia law doesn’t require it, said Shirley Andrews, who helps run the state’s criminal database for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The state attorney general designates what minor offenses must be in the system. Bench warrants for failing to appear in Municipal Court are not on it. This is a problem, Atlanta Police Chief George Turner told investigators. "[T]he truth is, there are thousands of folks that are warranted by Municipal Court warrants. But there’s no way, not to my knowledge, on how to deal with it," Turner said, according to a transcript of his interview. The head of a state professional organization for prosecutors said he has heard that other jurisdictions are wrestling with the issue. Officers or dispatchers could telephone the Atlanta court to check for open warrants, Turner told investigators, but it’s closed on Friday, the day Reed was stopped. Police and court officials told PolitiFact they’ve been working on this problem for months but need funding to solve it. Atlanta Municipal Court bench warrants are not included in the ACIC database, as the city’s news release said. In fact, Atlanta’s police chief estimates that thousands of people with open warrants aren’t in there. We find the city’s claim True.

pomt-08783	"Seventy bills [Kendrick Meek] authored, not one of them has passed."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/20/jeff-greene/greene-says-meek-0-70-bills/	UPDATE: We first published this item on Aug. 13, 2010, and rated Greene’s claim Half True. We received a number of complaints urging us to take a second look. We assigned a new reporter and editor and re-reported the claim with additional research on all the bills and resolutions Meek has proposed. In the end, we reached the same conclusion on the rating, Half True, and are posting the newer version of our report. Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Jeff Greene says the poster child of the do-nothing Congress is a do-nothing congressman named Kendrick Meek. "Since he has been in the House the last eight years, his track record in authoring bills is 0 in 70. ... 70 bills he authored, not one of them has passed," Greene said during a televised Orlando debate on Aug. 10, 2010. Meek, a member of the U.S. House for eight years, said his ideas have been incorporated into laws and it's misleading to consider only the bills he sponsored as a scorecard of his time in Congress. We'll explore Meek's retort in a moment. But first, is he really 0-for-70 in passing bills like Greene claims? First a little Schoolhouse Rock moment. Greene, in his claim, is talking about bills. Bills, as you know, become laws. A member of Congress proposes a bill. That bill is then usually referred to a series of committees or subcommittees, where it is debated and possibly altered. If it passes out of committee, it is heard by the House or Senate, depending on who authored the bill. If it passes one full chamber, it then goes to the other. More debate. Maybe more amendments or alterations. More votes. If it passes both houses of Congress, it then goes to the president. You can probably guess, but most bills don't get this far. The president can then sign the bill into law, or veto it. If a bill is vetoed, Congress can come back and override the president's veto by a two-third's vote of both chambers -- making the bill law without the president' signature. We're not trying to go all fourth grade on you here, but we need to make the distinction about bills, because Congress passes things all the times that aren't bills. End Schoolhouse Rock moment. The Library of Congress tracks federal legislation (meaning bills and other things) through a system called Thomas. The site also allows users like us to search each session of Congress for legislation Meek sponsored. The website includes information about whether or not the legislation came to a vote and was signed by the president. In his four terms in the U.S. House, Meek sponsored a total of 80 pieces of legislation, according to Thomas -- 35 in the current Congress, the 111th, 23 in the 110th Congress, 12 in the 109th Congress, and 10 in the 108th Congress. Of the 80 pieces of legislation, none were specifically enacted into law. Two Senate versions of Meek bills were signed by the president. The bills were both non-controversial. H.R.1361 and Senate companion S.111 directed the Secretary of Interior to conduct a resource study of the Miami Circle archaeological site. It was signed into law on Oct. 3, 2003. H.R.2538 and Senate companion S.1904 renamed a courthouse in Miami after Wilkie D. Ferguson, Jr. It was signed into law on May 7, 2004. Another 71 bills, designated appropriately with an H.R. prefix and a number are not law, and are either awaiting action or died in committee. The other seven pieces of legislation are called simple resolutions, designated with the prefix H. Res. and a number. Simple resolutions are not laws. They are adopted by the House and included in the Congressional Record. That's it. Of those seven simple resolutions, we should note that Meek sponsored three that passed, a resolution recognizing the armed service response in Haiti, a resolution commemorating Haitian soldiers who fought for American independence, and a resolution recognizing Rafael Jose Diaz-Balart. So out of 73 bills Meek sponsored, two are now law. The Greene campaign contends, however, that Meek shouldn't get credit for the two Senate versions that passed instead of the House version, hence their 0-for-70. The Meek campaign says Meek simply took up the Senate versions out of expediency or for some other reason. We think the overall difference of opinion is minor -- neither bill was controversial and whether Meek was 0-for73 or 2-for-73 isn't all that critical. What we think is worth noting is the collaborative way that bills become law. Any single bill is often the collective work of many. In some cases, entire bills become amendments to other bills that pass. Bills also must be reconciled between the Senate and the House -- the courthouse bill and the Interior study being a perfect example. PolitiFact has looked at bill sponsor figures before, after Barbara Boxer was accused of passing only three bills in 18 years. Back then, Norman Ornstein, a Congressional expert and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called the metric meaningless. "There is no good, strong, objective, consistent way to measure productivity as a legislator," Orstein told us. Agreed, said Clay Shaw, a Republican who represented a South Florida Congressional district for nearly 25 years. A lot of times a chairman of a committee will take another member's bill and rewrite it and put his own name on it, Shaw said. "If you have an appropriation, you try to get the appropriations committee to do it for you," Shaw said. Meek's campaign said many of his ideas were incorporated into other bills that became law. For instance, Meek filed a bill to accelerate the income tax benefits for charitable cash contributions for the relief of victims of the earthquake in Haiti. His bill was referred to a House committee in January 2010. A related bill with the same goal, filed by Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Rep. Charles Rangel, was passed into law later that same month. And in 2005, Meek filed a bill that would allow duty-free treatment for apparel assembled in Haiti. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act passed with similar language the following year, though Meek was not a sponsor. We looked into a few different accounts of Meek's legislative accomplishments. CQ's Politics in America 2010 edition noted that Meek has become "one of the House's swiftest-rising young Democrats," and noted his prominent assignment to the Ways and Means Committee, which handles health care, tax and trade policy. CQ said Meek previously served on the Armed Services panel, where he pushed for a deadline to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq. And, "in February 2009, he responded to the public furor over Bernard L. Madoff -- who pleaded guilty to a vast Ponzi scheme that bilked investors of billions of dollars -- by introducing a bill to provide tax relief to individuals harmed by the investment scam based on paying early investors money from later ones," CQ wrote. The bill never made it out of committee, but the Internal Revenue Service changed some of its rules in March to provide victims some tax relief. A July 25 profile of Meek in the St. Petersburg Times described Meek's record this way: "He has been the primary sponsor of more than 70 bills and nothing major has passed. ... And yet, most House members toil for years without passing a substantial piece of legislation. Victories are achieved by attaching ideas to other bills, usually bearing the names of committee chairs, or plying other channels." Ruling on a statement like Greene's can be tricky. He said: "Since (Meek) has been in the House the last eight years, his track record in authoring bills is 0 in 70." Of the 73 bills we found through the Library of Congress' Thomas website, Meek either passed none or two out of the 73 depending on whether you count the Senate companion bills. That, by itself, might rate a ruling of True or Mostly True. But the claim neglects to properly detail how Congress works and might give voters an unrealistic impression of Meek's time in Congress. While Meek may have not passed significant legislation, that's not necessarily a measure a Congressman's effectiveness. We define Half True as a statement that is "accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context." We think that's about right in this case. Greene has his number just about right, but leaves out those Schoolhouse Rock details of how a bill becomes a law. We rate Greene's claim Half True.

pomt-01416	"In the last year, Wisconsin ranked third in Midwest job growth."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/09/scott-walker/walker-sticks-to-claim-on-Midwest-jobs-growth/	On Aug. 25, 2014 the Scott Walker campaign launched a TV ad that featured the governor saying this about the July employment numbers: "Well, the latest job numbers are in and Wisconsin created more private-sector jobs than Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Ohio, and Illinois. That means we ranked third in the Midwest." We rated that Mostly True. The ranking among the 10 states was right, but only if you use the raw number of jobs added instead of the more revealing percentage growth. Well, now that summer has turned to fall, there’s a new batch of monthly jobs numbers out, with August being the latest month available. And a new Walker TV ad makes the same claim comparing midwestern states over the last 12 months: "The truth? In the last year, Wisconsin ranked third in Midwest job growth." Is the ranking still right? No. The ad sent us back to the best source of federal employment data, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Walker is using the monthly data for his comparison. This time around, Wisconsin has dropped a spot. Wisconsin ranks fourth out of 10, not third, both in raw jobs growth and in percentage change from August 2013 to August 2014. In the new rankings, based on preliminary August numbers, Wisconsin (1.2 percent growth for the year) trailed North Dakota (No. 1 rank nationally with 5.3 percent growth), Indiana and Minnesota on percentage change. Same story on the increase in the raw number of jobs over the year: Wisconsin came in fourth among 10 states. That put Wisconsin’s rank nationally at 32nd. In the new ad, Walker discloses in an on-screen graphic that he’s using the July-to-July figures. But that text runs counter to his spoken claim of "in the last year." Defending the new ad, the Walker campaign said that the July data is final, revised estimates in contrast to the preliminary August data. But we note that in the campaign’s earlier ad, Walker didn’t hesitate to use the preliminary July data and use it to round out the "latest" one year period when it showed the ranking was third. Rating switch Walker himself clearly knew better. On Sept. 19, the governor sent out this tweet from his personal account after the new numbers came out: "WI is 4th in the Midwest for private sector job creation & % growth (CES BLS Aug 2013 - Aug 2014)." His campaign, which is airing new TV ads frequently, had plenty of time to absorb the August jobs report (released Sept. 18, 2014) before putting out his new ad (released Oct. 8, 2014). We’ve taken a similarly dim view of numerical maneuvering by Democrat Mary Burke’s campaign. In August, we rated True a Burke claim that Wisconsin was "dead last" in the Midwest based on a three-year time span coinciding with the first three years of Walker’s term. But when Burke made a similar statement in September and framed it around the latest numbers showing the drop, we rated her claim False -- a rating Walker highlights in his new ad. She cited accurate data -- Wisconsin ranked last in the Midwest from March 2011 to March 2014. But that period was out of sync with the start of Walker’s term. In her claims, Burke has been using quarterly jobs data, which is more reliable than the monthly data but lags significantly. Notable in that rating: For the most recent 12-month period by that measure, Wisconsin no longer ranked last of 10 states. It ranked 8th of 10 states. Our rating In a new TV ad, Walker says "the truth" is that "in the last year, Wisconsin ranked third in midwest job growth." That’s old news. The updated ranking is fourth, closer to middle of the pack, something the governor knew before his ad aired. We rate the claim False.

pomt-03518	On restoring voting rights to non-violent felons.	full flop	/virginia/statements/2013/jun/03/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-u-turns-restoring-voting-rights-non-vio/	For years, Virginia Democrats have been trying to make it easier for non-violent felons to regain their civil rights after they’ve paid their debts to society. But Democrats cried foul last week when Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, the Republican nominee for governor, endorsed the cause. "Like many other legislators, I fought...for years on automatic restoration of rights legislation while Ken Cuccinelli and his extreme allies opposed us," said state Sen. Donald McEachin, D-Henrico. "Now it has become convenient for him to suddenly do an about face on this issue." Charniele Herring, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said Cuccinelli, as a state senator last decade, consistently opposed legislation that would have allowed the automatic restoration of voting rights for non-violent felons who completed their sentences. "If Ken Cuccinelli really believed in automatic restoration of rights for people who pay their debt to society, he had every opportunity to prove it with his vote," Herring said. Cuccinelli, during a May 28 news conference, acknowledged his position has evolved. We pulled out our Flip-O-Meter to gauge the scope of his change. Virginia felons face one of the toughest laws for restoring civil rights in the nation. Under the state constitution, the only way for them to regain voting rights is to get permission from the governor. As a senator, Cuccinelli opposed four resolutions and one bill that would have allowed Virginians to vote on a constitutional amendment that would have empowered the General Assembly to automatically restore voting rights to non-violent felons. Cuccinelli voted "no" in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2009. Now, let’s return to this year. On Jan. 14, the attorney general testified in favor of a constitutional amendment for automatic voting restoration that was subsequently killed by a House subcommittee. On May 28, Cuccinelli called on Virginia to make it easier for non-violent felons to regain voting rights and released a report, put together by an advisory group he appointed, on ways to do that. "Many people in our communities have committed certain lower level, non-violent offenses in the past that are felonies; they completed their sentences; paid their fines, their court costs, their restitution, served their time and gone on to live law-abiding lives," Cuccinelli said during a news conference. "I believe we need a simpler way for those individuals who want to return to their place in our society to be given a second chance and regain their civil rights that were lost through a felony conviction." Cuccinelli acknowledged, "When I was in the Senate, I wasn’t very supportive of the restoration of rights. I thought of it as a part of the punishment for being a felon." But the attorney general said he has grown increasingly concerned about what he called "felony creep" -- the trend of state politicians passing laws that elevate to felonies non-violent crimes that should remain as misdemeanors. He questioned, for example, whether someone stealing $200 should be charged with a felony as mandated in Virginia. Brian Gottstein, spokesman for the attorney general, said while in the Senate, Cuccinelli voted for two unsuccessful bills that would have raised the dollar amount at which a theft becomes a felony. Cuccinelli also gave another reason for his change. "...I felt rights restoration was good for society overall, because it could potentially reduce recidivism and because I’m looking for ways to make re-entry work." So the record shows Cuccinelli changed his position on voting rights restoration and the attorney general acknowledges it. We rate it a Full Flop.

When it hit $16 trillion for the first time on Sept. 4, 2012, Sen. Rob Portman called it "a dangerous milestone" and "troubling evidence that our nation is headed in the wrong direction." In an attempt to put $16 trillion in terms everyday people can get their arms around, he also released a list of items showing how that much money stacks up -- such as "$16 trillion in $1 bills would cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times." Sixteen trillion is a lot of kapusta -- but is it enough to carpet the countryside and turn Ohio green? Just for fun, PolitiFact Ohio decided to survey the landscape We got data from Portman staff's and checked the math. Here’s how it works out. A dollar bill has 16.0254 square inches. (It measures 2.61 inches by 6.14 inches.) Sixteen trillion dollar bills multiply to an area of 256,406,400,000,000 square inches. That translates to 1,780,600,000,000 square feet (after you divide by 12 squared, or 144). The area in square footage equals 63,870 square miles (after you divide by 5,280 squared, or 27,878,400). That would cover Ohio's total area of 44,825 square miles 1.42 times -- or nearly 1.5 times. We ran the numbers again, using the land area of 40,860 square miles that the federal Census Bureau gives Ohio. Sixteen trillion singles would cover that area almost exactly 1.5 times.

pomt-12678	"There’s not one public study, and by public study I mean a study available to the public, that has looked at using the product Kaput to poison feral hogs."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/mar/16/will-herring/feral-hog-meat-businessman-says-there-are-no-publi/	A Texas meat processor who questions a government-approved bait that kills feral hogs charges there’s no public research on the product. Will Herring, owner of the Hubbard-based Wild Boar Meat Company, which makes hog meat into pet food, has said he fears the product’s active ingredient--warfarin, long known as a rat poison and human blood thinner--will damage his business. Also, Herring said: "There’s not one public study, and by public study I mean a study available to the public, that has looked at using the product Kaput to poison feral hogs," a comment we spotted in a March 6, 2017, news story in the San Antonio Express-News. A note: Public studies of particular pesticides don’t appear to be mandatory. An Environmental Protection Agency web page about registering pesticides says only that the "company that wants to produce the pesticide must provide data from studies that comply with our testing guidelines" without mention of whether the studies must be public or, say, conducted independently. That web page also says that before registering a product, EPA develops risk assessments evaluating the potential harms to humans, wildlife, fish, and plants, including endangered species and non-target organisms plus any possible contamination of surface water or groundwater from leaching, runoff and "spray drift." Still, Herring persuaded a state district judge to issue a temporary order putting a hold on state rules approving Kaput’s use by state-licensed pesticide applicators and state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, filed a proposal barring the state from registering any lethal pesticide, including warfarin, for feral hog control unless a state agency or university performs and publishes a scientific study weighing the pesticide’s environmental and economic effects. Both moves happened after Sid Miller, the Republican state agriculture commissioner, announced the Texas Department of Agriculture would issue rules limiting Kaput’s sale and use to licensed individuals. When we inquired, the state agency emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that Colorado-based Scimetrics, the company poised to vend Kaput, fielded $136,854 in research grants from TDA from 2013 into 2017. All told in 2016-17, the sheet indicates, the agency awarded $802,500 to fight feral hogs; that counts funds awarded to counties, universities and other agencies. Feral hogs can be fearsome nuisances. Nationally, as many as 750,000 are harvested annually, yet how they ravage rural and suburban lands remains a problem--and Texas is home to more than 2 million of them. No public study? We asked Herring how he reached his conclusion about no public studies. By phone, he told us that he didn’t find specific studies of the product in online searches nor, he said, did Genesis Laboratories, the Colorado-based company that developed the product, provide a study at his firm's inquiry. We also reached Richard Poché, Genesis Labs' president, who conceded that no Kaput study has been formally published. He said, though, the company completed a study in Texas in 2015 submitted under the title "Field efficacy of a warfarin bait used to control feral hog populations" for consideration by the Wiley-published Wildlife Society Bulletin, which describes itself as a journal for wildlife practitioners that effectively integrates cutting-edge science with management and conservation, and also covers important policy issues, particularly those that focus on the integration of science and policy. By email, the bulletin’s editor, Kansas State University’s David Haukos, confirmed that study was submitted. In March 2017, Haukos told us: "The manuscript is currently undergoing peer-review; therefore, no decision has been made concerning publication." Poché said by phone the 2015 study was followed up by another in 2016 with a third study underway in 2017, each one based on feeding the Kaput product to feral hogs. Both of the first two studies, he said, decimated exposed hog populations in North Texas study areas; he noted too the bait uses only one-fifth of the warfarin found in conventional rat and mouse baits. We asked for a copy of the 2015 study. By email, Poché said that remains "confidential business information," and that releasing it before publication would leave his company with no control of where it ends up. Poché otherwise provided two of his own March 2017 PowerPoint presentations on Kaput along with the printed program for the April 2016 International Wild Pig Conference program in Myrtle Beach, S.C. A section of the program, "Feral hog control using a new bait," evidently describes a Scimetric study. It opens: "An EPA Experimental Use Permit was obtained to conduct a field trial using a novel bait to control feral hogs. The product, 12-years under development, was used to determine the efficacy against feral hogs on test sites 50 miles east of Plainview, Texas. Two paraffin bait formulations were tested, containing 0.005% and 0.01% warfarin. Hog activity was monitored pre- and post-treatment using trail cameras near feeders, VHF and GPS transmitting equipment, and bait consumption." Next, the summary says: "Bait was applied in modified commercial feeders with heavy lids. Baiting initiated on June 1 and terminated June 30, 2015. After the 30-day exposure period efficacy on the 5-km treatment plot baited with 0.005% warfarin was 100%, 98.6%, and 97.8% using radio-tracking, trail camera images, and bait consumption. Efficacy on the 0.01% warfarin bait plot was not as effective. Ninety-seven non-target searches were conducted during the treatment and post-treatment phases to examine for mortality, for which none were found," an indication other animals weren’t killed by the bait. The text closes: "The low warfarin concentrate bait proved effective in eliminating wild hogs while posing minimal exposure to non-target wildlife." The longer of the PowerPoint presentations includes a slide stating that warfarin was approved as a rodent-killer in 1948 and as a human drug six years later. The presentation also has several slides titled: "Field Efficacy of a Feral Hog Bait Containing 0.005% Warfarin," with a subtitle indicating the slides refer to research in North Texas from 2015 into 2017. Images include feral hogs wearing GPS collars or tagged for tracking by radio. One slide summarizes the research results by different methods of making hog counts: SOURCE: Presentation, "Where we’ve been and where we’re going with Warfarin for controlling wild pigs," March 1, 2017, Richard Poché, Genesis Labs (received by email from Poché, March 9, 2017) Company: No independent research ‘necessary’ Poché, asked if independent research makes sense before Kaput goes commercial, emailed: "Not necessary. We do research under what is called Good Laboratory Practices, which is required by the EPA. No one can match the quality and integrity of the work." According to an EPA web page, the agency conducts audits to ensure companies developing pesticide products comply with those practices. EPA registration Our search of EPA’s web site led us to a Jan. 3, 2017, agency document indicating that on Jan. 3, 2017, Kaput Feral Hog Bait was registered with the agency under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. "Registration is in no way to be construed as an endorsement or recommendation of this product by the Agency," the document further states. "In order to protect health and the environment, the Administrator, on his motion, may at any time suspend or cancel the registration of a pesticide in accordance with the Act." Also, the document says, the product is "conditionally registered" in accord with section 3(c)(7)(a) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act; the section says the EPA administrator may conditionally register a pesticide if the pesticide is "identical or substantially similar" to a registered pesticide and approving the registration wouldn’t "significantly increase the risk of any unreasonable adverse effect on the environment." Another agency web page says: "If EPA finds that the pesticide meets the standard for registration, but there are outstanding data requirements, the Agency may, under certain circumstances, grant a ‘conditional’ registration pursuant to FIFRA section 3(c)(7). However, before granting a conditional registration, EPA must determine that, although an application lacks some of the required data, use of the pesticide would not significantly increase the risk of unreasonable adverse effects on people or the environment during the time needed to generate the necessary data." We asked Poché about "outstanding data requirements" with Kaput, as mentioned generally by the EPA. By email, Poché said a "1-year storage stability study" for Kaput has been submitted to the EPA. Poché unpacked: "An EPA-registered pesticide requires stability of the chemical in the formula available to the public. The product is stored in the marketing container on the shelf at room temperature over a one-year period. The bait is analyzed every 3 months for the warfarin concentration. That analysis is done at the beginning and at 3, 5, 9, and 12 months after manufacturing. The goal is to ensure the bait is good after 1 year and the concentration of warfarin is plus or minus 10% of what the EPA label requires. In our case the concentrations were within 1% of the label requirements," Poché said. Over a couple days, we did not draw an EPA response to Herring’s claim. Otherwise the National Pesticide Information Center, which partners Oregon State University with the EPA, responded to our inquiry by pointing out a 1991 EPA "fact sheet" on warfarin that states the EPA evaluates pesticides by obtaining from producers a "complete set of studies showing the human health and environmental effects of each pesticide. The Agency imposes any regulatory controls that are needed to effectively manage each pesticide's risks," the sheet says. State intends limits Miller, the state agriculture commissioner, is a former legislator who authored the Texas law enabling hunters to shoot at feral hogs from helicopters. At the TDA, spokeswoman Jennifer Dorsett responded to our inquiry about the absence of public studies of Kaput. Dorsett said by email: "Kaput is an entirely proprietary product, so studies on the Kaput Feral Hog Bait are owned by the company and you would have to contact them directly to see if they will release them to you." Also by email, TDA spokesman Mark Loeffler stressed that while the state agency helped fund Kaput research, its role is generally limited to cataloging pesticides approved by EPA, including Kaput, though Miller applied his authority to make Kaput "state limited use," to be sold by licensed dealers and used by licensed applicators, Loeffler said. "We do not do state-paid studies of proposed pesticides," Loeffler wrote. "We are not required to do lengthy study of a product because we have little discretion to reject or deny" registrations, he said. Dorsett otherwise provided a document listing a dozen reports on poisoning feral hogs, issued from 1987 through 2002, including seven titles specifying "warfarin," we tallied. Dorsett said the agency’s toxicologist, Michael Hare, used the reports as references in evaluating Kaput as a state-limited-use pesticide. Dorsett told us relevant research also has involved the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service, which says it has officials in nearly every county demonstrating "the latest technology and best practices to improve the state’s food and fiber system." We didn't hear back from the service. Loeffler added that Miller has personally drawn on a 1995 post about warfarin’s history as a rat poison and its toxicity to animals put out by universities teamed in the Extension Toxicology Network. Excerpt: "Warfarin is only slightly dangerous to humans and domestic animals when used as directed, but care must be taken with young pigs, which are especially susceptible." Also, the post says, warfarin--which is insoluble in water--poses no threat to aquatic organisms and is "practically non-toxic" to game birds, with chickens "relatively resistant." Our ruling Herring said there’s no public study of Kaput, the product that might soon be available in Texas to attack feral hogs. There’s no public study of that EPA-registered product, we confirmed. But a 2015 study submitted to a science journal would become public if it’s accepted for publication. Also, the effects on feral hogs of warfarin, Kaput’s active ingredient, has been explored in published studies. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-02409	When it comes to transportation funds, Georgians spend more in taxes and on red tape than they get back from the federal government.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/07/tom-graves/congressman-pitches-new-plan-transportation-fundin/	A Georgia congressman says there’s one major roadblock to states having more money to fund transportation projects: Uncle Sam. U.S. Rep. Tom Graves, a Republican from North Georgia, believes some federal regulations are driving up the costs of transportation here and across the nation. One part of his argument put PolitiFact Georgia on the road in search of whether his complaint is true. Georgia, like most states, is a "donor" state when it comes to federal transportation funding, the congressman said. "They spend more in taxes and on red tape than they get back," Graves said in his speech, explaining his definition of donor states. Graves says Georgians pay more money in gas taxes than the state receives from the federal government for transportation projects once you figure in the "red tape" from two key federal regulations that have an impact on road construction costs. In the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, 2012, records show Georgia paid nearly $1.2 billion into the Federal Highway Trust Fund Highway Account and received nearly $1.27 billion from the fund. That would appear to put Georgia in the plus category. But Graves says the irksome regulations of the Davis-Bacon Act and the National Environmental Policy Act add huge costs for the state. Those costs turn the positive into a negative, he said, moving Georgia into the donor category. Graves and U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, have put together a solution they call the Transportation Empowerment Act. It would gives states greater authority to determine transportation needs. The legislation would also lower the federal gas tax over the next five years from 18.4 cents per gallon to 3.7 cents per gallon. The states, then, could make up the difference in any way they like — replace the gas tax, put in toll roads, create a new consumption tax such as T-SPLOST. The federal highway act is up for reauthorization this year, and the two lawmakers hope to race past competing plans with their proposal and get enough votes for adoption. Graves said in a recent speech that Georgia is projected to get an 84 percent rate of return this budget year for transportation projects because of these policies. John Donnelly, a spokesman for the congressman, said Graves’ 84 percent estimate is conservative. "It is important to note that our calculation is actually generous because it includes the general fund subsidies as well. If we simply calculated the rate of return without a subsidy in play (i.e. gas taxes paid in vs. transportation spending attributable to gas taxes going back to Georgia), we'd be closer to 70 percent. If we then accounted for red tape in that calculation, we'd be closer to 56 percent," Donnelly said. So are the Davis-Bacon Act and NEPA a drain on federally funded transportation projects? The Davis-Bacon Act has long been a source of angst amongst conservatives and some business groups. It requires contractors and subcontractors to pay laborers and mechanics working on nearly all federally funded projects at least the locally prevailing wages. It was created in 1931 to prevent employers from hiring cheaper labor during the Great Depression, and it has been amended several times. The wages are determined by the U.S. Department of Labor. A team of four researchers from Suffolk University looked at the impact of the Davis-Bacon Act. In 2008, they released a study that found it costs U.S. taxpayers an additional $8.6 billion annually and adds 9.9 percent to construction costs. The study found federal officials calculated the prevailing wages by using numbers "dictated" from construction unions that are "biased upwards." "Union workers earn a median weekly income of $833, compared to $642 for nonunion workers. The practice of basing the prevailing wage on a small minority of workers who have, on average, weekly earnings that are almost 30 percent higher than other workers guarantees that the reported wage is anything but the prevailing wage," the study found. U.S. Labor Department officials have said independent studies show the Davis-Bacon Act does not increase government contracting costs. "The prevailing wage reflects the wage paid to construction workers in the local area — union or non-union. Moreover, Davis-Bacon Act designation does not inherently increase government contracting costs, as shown by a number of independent studies," Nancy Leppink, who was head of the Wage and Hour Division for the United States Department of Labor, wrote in a blog post in 2011. Our inquiries to the Labor Department were directed to an official who did not respond to telephone calls and emails for comment. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote in a 2012 report that wages for highway and heavy construction projects under the Davis-Bacon Act were higher than federal employment statistics about 60 percent of the time. The report did not calculate the difference. The report did note that the salary gap between union and non-union workers has decreased in recent years. It also noted the percentage of union workers in construction had decreased between 2000 and 2008. The CRS also noted another point: Federal projects may require workers to have more advanced skills. Thus, they may earn higher salaries. The National Environmental Policy Act, which became federal law in 1969, requires an environmental review for all highway and construction projects under the purview of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Critics say NEPA slows construction, raising project costs. Graves’ office sent us a 1997 report by researchers at North Carolina State University who found NEPA increased construction costs by 9 percent. Federal officials found several problems with the report. First, they said only 19 of 50 state transportation departments responded to it. Second, of the states that replied, the additional costs were less than the 10 percent. We also wondered whether the study, more than 16 years old, was too old to be considered for serious discussion. Graves’ camp followed up by sending us a 2006 Federal Highway Administration report that environmental costs for some construction projects averaged 4 percent and averaged 8 percent in some case studies. Our conclusion: Again, Graves says Georgia spends more in gas taxes and red tape than it gets back from the federal government. He says wage and environmental regulations add huge costs for the state. And studies show he has an interesting argument. Do these regulations result in Georgia getting a net result of less money back than it collects from gas taxes? It could be, but there’s no definitive data that show what the specific impact is in Georgia. Until we see some research specific to Georgia, we believe Graves’ claim requires some caution. With these caveats, we rate the Graves' claim Half True.	None	Tom Graves	None	None	None	2014-03-07T06:00:00	2014-03-07	['None']
pomt-05921	Savannah is home to "the fastest-growing port in the nation."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/jan/31/casey-cagle/lt-gov-makes-big-claim-about-savannah-port/	For more than a year, Georgia leaders have spoken about the importance of deepening the Port of Savannah as a way to boost the state’s economy. The state has invested $136 million toward such work in the past three years, and leaders are lobbying the federal government for additional funds to deepen the Savannah port to prepare for the megasized container ships that will traverse the Panama Canal by 2014 and look for ports along the East Coast to dock. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle offered up a piece of information to emphasize the importance of this effort during a speech to the Atlanta Press Club. Savannah, he said, is home to "the fastest-growing port in the nation." True? PolitiFact Georgia set sail to find out whether Cagle is right. Others, including U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, have made similar claims. But PolitiFact Georgia found news reports stating that the port in Wilmington, N.C., is the nation’s fastest-growing port. Cagle’s office sent us a graphic from the Georgia Ports Authority showing the Savannah port is receiving more imports and exports than 10 large American ports. Unbeknown to us, there are all sorts of annual reports and statistics about the approximately 360 ports in the United States. Some track the annual value of items that come through the ports. Some track it by the amount of containers that are imported and exported at the ports, measured in 20-foot equivalent units, or known as TEUs. There is also port data measured in metric tons (about 2,200 pounds) or short tons (2,000 pounds). The Georgia Center of Innovation for Logistics, a state agency that works to find solutions to challenges encountered by shipping and transportation entities, measures growth by TEUs, saying it is the standard used internationally. It provided us a chart showing the average annual growth rate at the Savannah port between 2000 and 2010 has been 11.5 percent, more than any of what they said are the nation’s 10 largest ports. Houston’s port was second at 5.5 percent. Overall, the numbers show Savannah is home to the nation’s fourth-largest port. "The Port of Savannah, from container volume, is the fastest-growing in the United States," said Page Siplon, a spokesman for the center. The Georgia center’s number is similar to TEU data compiled by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Research and Innovative Technology Administration, or RITA. Savannah’s average annual growth rate was 11.5 percent between 1995 and 2009, the data show. Its chart included the top 10 ports. Savannah had the highest percentage growth between 1995 and 2009 and since 2000. The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration also keeps port data in metric tons. Between 2003 and 2010, the Norfolk, Va., port had the fastest average annual percentage growth rate among midsize and larger ports. Savannah was second. Between 2006 and 2010, Norfolk was first again. Wilmington was second among ports with more than 5 million metric tons. Ah, but that’s the problem, Siplon says. While Wilmington’s port handled 6.1 million metric tons in 2009, Savannah’s port handled 29.7 metric tons that year. There’s no reasonable way to compare some ports, he says. "It’s not a fair representation," Siplon told us. The American Association of Port Authorities, an Alexandria, Va.-based organization that helps promote ports in the Western Hemisphere, said the RITA data does not include military containers or containerized cargo shipped domestically between U.S. ports. The AAPA also collects container data on ports, through TEUs, and shared it with us. It showed Savannah with the highest percentage annual growth rate in the past five and 10 years among the 16 ports that currently handle more than 500,000 TEUs a year. Several ports that handled smaller annual TEUs -- such as Boston, Mobile, New Orleans and Wilmington -- had higher percentage growth at times in recent years. The AAPA numbers show the Savannah port had the largest container increase in TEUs of any U.S. port since 2006. The largest U.S. ports, such as New York/New Jersey and Los Angeles, had larger container increases since 2001 and in the U.S. DOT data. We note that the ports in Los Angeles and New York/New Jersey are already two or three times larger than Savannah’s. "Savannah is the fastest-growing port among larger ports," said Jeff Humphreys, director of the University of Georgia’s Selig Center for Economic Growth, who frequently tracks data on ports. "Obviously, there are smaller ports that will have the biggest change." Among the big dogs of American ports, it appears the Savannah port is the nation’s fastest-growing port. But some smaller ports could argue that they are growing at a faster rate. Experts are also careful to say Savannah is the nation's fastest-growing container port. PolitiFact Georgia thinks the lieutenant governor has a strong argument, but we must include the caveat of some of these smaller ports. We rate Cagle’s statement as Mostly True.

pomt-10020	"I don't do earmarks. I've never done one. I'm not going to do one."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/16/john-boehner/rep-john-boehner-earmark-free/	When House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, urged President Obama to veto the $410 billion omnibus spending bill because of all the earmarks in it, he spoke from particularly high ground on the issue. "I don't do earmarks," Boehner said in a news conference on March 12, 2009. "I've never done one. I'm not going to do one." Indeed, that's what he promised back in 1990 when he was first running for Congress. He often says he told voters, "If you are electing me to raid the federal treasury on your behalf, you're electing the wrong guy." For eighteen years, Boehner says he hasn't wavered. A strict earmark-free record would put him in rare company, so we decided to check it out. "He hasn't taken any," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group that doggedly tracks earmarks. "He has bragged about that long before this ever became a big deal, and he's right." We reviewed press coverage of Boehner since he was elected and couldn't find any either. We did find several instances where local officials pushing for various highway projects ran up against Boehner's hard line. In an article in the Dayton Daily News in 2002, one official lamented that his area would have difficulty getting federal money for a highway project because of the congressman's policy. "If you're looking for a congressman to go after a bunch of earmarks, he's not your guy,'" said Bryan Bucklew, vice president of the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce. It's a principled stance that hasn't always sat well with fellow Republican legislators who believe in earmarks, either. But Boehner has stuck to his pledge. In May 2008, he told the Wall Street Journal, "It might have been the best decision I ever made." Yet despite his personal ban, Boehner has never argued for earmarks to be eliminated completely. "I don't think I want to hold all my colleagues to that same standard," Boehner said in a Fox News Sunday interview on Feb. 5, 2006. "There's an appropriate place for some of these earmarks, but we need less numbers of earmarks and more transparency and more accountability. Members' names ought to be associated with them. They ought to be visible. And members ought to have a chance to see these before they become law." This year, Boehner was joined in eschewing earmarks by other House Republican leaders: Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia and Conference Chairman Mike Pence of Indiana. But in the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., sponsored or cosponsored 53 earmarks worth $75.5 million, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense. All told, TCS counted more than 8,500 disclosed earmarks in the omnibus bill, coming to $7.7 billion. Together with $6.6 billion in disclosed earmarks in the three 2009 spending bills that passed in the fall, earmarks for the year come to $14.3 billion, which is $500 million less than earmarks last year. As is the custom, Republicans, as the minority party, got about 40 percent of them. Of the 178 Republican House members, only 39 did not have earmarks in the omnibus, according to TCS. Three Democrats did not accept earmarks. As for Boehner, he can rightfully claim he hasn't ever asked for or taken an earmark. We rule his statement True.

pomt-15328	Says because of his actions, Wisconsin "property taxes today are lower than they were four years ago."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/15/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-property-taxes-are-low/	In announcing his run for president, Gov. Scott Walker made a boast about property taxes that both highlights his record in Wisconsin and contrasts it with other governors who are competing for the Republican nomination. "We lowered taxes on individuals, on employers and property owners," Walker said a few minutes into the July 13, 2015 speech (fact-checked here). "Property taxes today are lower than they were four years ago. "How many other governors can say that?" Walker made the property tax claim again the next day in Nevada and it seemed destined to become a talking point in South Carolina, Georgia, New Hampshire and Iowa as he made his first campaign swing as an announced candidate. Implicit in Walker’s statement is that not only are property taxes down, but they are lower as a result of his actions. So let’s see if that’s accurate. An earlier claim Walker made a similar claim during his State of the State speech in January 2014. He said that because of "tax controls" he and the GOP-run Legislature had put in place, property taxes on a typical home in 2014 would be lower than in 2010, which was the year before he took office. We found the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau had projected that the 2014 property tax bill for a median-valued home taxed at the statewide average property tax rate would be $2,954. That was $9 lower than in 2010. (Actual tax bills weren't sent out until December 2014.) The fiscal bureau regularly does such estimates, and they are routinely cited by politicians of both stripes. But it’s important to note they are an illustration -- some people's property taxes went down, some went up. Even if your home value was right at that statewide average, your tax bill might have been higher due to various factors, including levies in individual communities. In the earlier fact check, we found that tax and spending restraints Republicans put on local governments and schools were crucial in the decrease in the hypothetical tax bill, but that a drop in home values also played a role. We rated that claim Mostly True. So, Walker's earlier claim was based on a projected figure for 2014. We now have the tax collection numbers for 2014, as well as fiscal bureau projections for 2015 and 2016. New claim -- one measure In Wisconsin, according to the fiscal bureau, local governments rely on property tax revenue more than the U.S. average. And in comparison to other states, Wisconsin property taxes have been among the highest in the nation since at least 1970 (ranking 13th in 2012). We went to the fiscal bureau’s latest tally of the estimated property tax bills, which was produced in May 2015. Tax year Estimated property tax bill for a median-valued home 2010 $2,963 2011 (Walker takes office) $2,953 2012 $2,943 2013 $2,926 2014 $2,832 2015 (projected) $2,824 2016 (projected) $2,821 So, there have been four straight years of declines in the hypothetical example during Walker's first four years in office. (The projections for 2015 and 2016 indicate it will be six straight years). The 2014 bill -- the most recent year for which property tax bills have been issued -- was $131 lower than in 2010. That’s more than the $9 reduction that had been projected when we last looked at this topic. As we noted in the earlier fact check, while the decreases are modest, they represent a significant turnaround. From 2006 to 2010, the typical bill increased by $230. But there are other ways to evaluate Walker’s claim. Other measures The nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance provided us net property tax levies (the amount of property taxes levied after all credits were provided), as well the net levies as expressed as a percentage of personal income; the percentage is sometimes referred to as the tax burden. Tax year Net property tax levy Net property tax levy as percentage of personal income 2010 $9.34 billion 4.24% 2011 (Walker takes office) $9.35 billion 4.02% 2012 $9.43 billion 3.88% 2013 $9.54 billion 3.84% 2014 $9.32 billion 3.63% The figures show that although the net property tax levy increased during each of Walker’s first three years in office, it dropped in 2014 to lower than it was four years earlier. And considering net property tax levy as a percentage of personal income, the rate in 2014 was lower than in each of the previous four years. The alliance told us that the 3.63 percent figure for 2014 is the lowest since 1946. The reasons As we found in our earlier fact check, the main reason property taxes are down is the limits Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature put on school districts and other local governments to levy taxes. Since then, in 2014, the Republicans boosted state aid to technical colleges by $406 million, resulting in the schools reducing their property tax levies by the same amount. At the same time, housing values continue to be a factor in holding down property taxes. The fiscal bureau has noted that housing values statewide, after declining from 2009 through 2013, rose by 1.7 percent in 2014. But the recovery in the housing market isn’t complete. Our rating Walker said that because of his actions, Wisconsin "property taxes today are lower than they were four years ago." Measured three different ways, the statistical part of the claim is numerically accurate. And Walker’s measures to limit local property tax increases have played a major role. But the lower taxes are due in part to declines in housing values that have only partially recovered. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-02580	"Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/29/barack-obama/obama-says-every-four-minutes-another-american-hom/	President Barack Obama touted his energy strategy during his State of the Union speech. He called for safe extraction of natural gas, reducing our dependence on foreign oil and setting new standards for trucks -- and he shined a spotlight on solar power. "It’s not just oil and natural gas production that’s booming; we’re becoming a global leader in solar, too," Obama said. "Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can’t be outsourced." That timetable sounded like a rapid expansion of solar: Does a home or business go solar every four minutes? We’ll shed a little light on this claim. Solar expansion Obama’s claim came from Greentech Media (GTM), which published the statistic in August in its Solar Market Research Report, a project with the Solar Energy Industries Association. GTM provides quarterly and annual reports that contain solar-specific analysis and forecasts for industry professionals. A GTM chart shows how solar installations have rapidly increased in recent years from one every 80 minutes in 2006 to one every four minutes in 2013. "A lot happens in America every four minutes," wrote GTM in an August blog about their research. "During that short time period, 30 babies are born, 4,080 McDonald's Big Macs are consumed, and 48,000 tons of CO2 are emitted. And as it turns out, the U.S. is now installing one solar photovoltaic (PV) system every four minutes as well. If market growth continues at its current pace, the American solar industry could be installing a system every minute and twenty seconds by 2016." Every quarter GTM collects the number of solar installations from utilities and state agencies. Researchers get data from 28 states (including Florida ) which represents about 97 percent of the market and devise an estimate for the remaining states, said Shayle Kann, senior vice president of research. GTM has been tracking the solar market since 2009 and collected this particular detailed data since 2010. (Kann said that the U.S. Energy Information Administration has some data on solar installations but not to the level of detail that GTM requires for quarterly reports.) In 2013, there were about 132,000 installations, and there were 525,600 minutes, so the math works out to about one installation every four minutes. GTM is finalizing the number of installations in 2013 -- GTM says it’s possible it could have been higher. Part of the reason for the rapid growth is that the cost of solar panels and installation has dropped, Kann said. Experts on alternative energy generally agreed with GTM’s research but offered some caveats. "Solar is growing, but from a very small number...," said Christopher Bronk, director of the Program on Energy and Cybersecurity at Rice University. According to the November electric power monthly report from the Energy Information Administration, "PV solar energy accounts for about 1.5 percent of all electricity generated from renewable sources and .2 percent percent of all the electricity generated." And not surprisingly, solar is more common in some states than others. "As you move to places with a lot more cloud cover, let’s say Washington, D.C., then solar energy isn’t going to work as well," said Stephen P.A. Brown, an expert in energy economics at the University of Nevada. "Unless there is some huge change in technology it’s not projected to be the dominant form of energy any time soon or in fact ever." Our ruling During the State of the Union, Obama said, "Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar." Obama obtained that figure from an August report from Greentech Media. Solar has been expanding, but it remains a small slice of the overall market. We rate this claim True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-01-29T17:45:09	2014-01-28	['United_States']
pomt-04802	Says an appointed board created under Obamacare "will have the ability to come between you and your doctor in determining the best treatment options for you!"	false	/texas/statements/2012/aug/21/john-carter/john-cornyn-says-board-comes-you-treatment-options/	Saying he’s committed to repealing Obamacare, U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, told constituents: "You may not be aware of one of the most frightening provisions in the president’s healthcare plan -- the creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board." Carter’s July 31, 2012, letter continues: "This board, comprised of 15 unelected, unaccountable people hand-picked by the president, will have the ability to come between you and your doctor in determining the best treatment options for you!" After readers asked us to look into Carter’s claim about the board’s intrusive powers, we emailed Carter’s office for backup information -- and didn’t hear back. The board mentioned in the 2010 law has been singled out before, having figured into several Truth-O-Meter articles including a July 2012 False rating of Mitt Romney’s claim that the law "puts the federal government between you and your doctor." Romney offered no evidence for his claim; PolitiFact concluded that the law leaves intact the private sector delivery of health care. The board mentioned by Carter, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, is to focus on reducing the rate of growth in per-capita Medicare spending, but it is prohibited under the law from suggesting anything that leads to rationing or reductions in either benefits or eligibility. Generally, in contrast, the board might recommend that every discharged hospital patient get guidance on wound care or that they drink plenty of cold water. They might find that surgery to install certain medical devices – like hip replacements – should not be done on Medicare beneficiaries over the age of 105. The goal is cost-savings, not micro-managing patient care. Also, Congress has the power to overrule the panel’s recommendations. In February 2012, U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said in a press release: "Instead of giving patients control of their health care decisions, the president and his allies in Congress chose to delegate this power to a commission of 15 unelected bureaucrats in Washington." That’s False, PolitiFact Tennessee said, because the board would not control decisions made at the individual patient level. With Carter’s wording in mind, we read the relevant portion of the law. Section 3403 indeed states that the board is to include 15 members appointed by the president. Each appointee also would face Senate confirmation. As far as we can tell, the law does not give the board the power, or permission, to regulate any individual’s treatment options. For an August 2011 Truth-O-Meter article, PolitiFact Georgia asked four health experts about a congressman’s claim that "a bunch of bureaucrats" would "decide whether you get care." All four said that’s incorrect. A scholar at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank usually at odds with Democratic positions, said the assertion that the board would be controlling patients’ health-care decisions is "not even close to correct." Cato scholar Michael Tanne said the board "has nothing to do with individual care at all. It’s not making decisions on individuals." Our ruling Carter’s claim has no factual foundation. We rate it False.	None	John Carter	None	None	None	2012-08-21T10:00:00	2012-07-31	['None']
pomt-14810	The United States has "10,000 IRS agents making sure that you don't take an improper charity deduction," but to fight terrorism, it has "less than two dozen people focusing on countering violent extremism at home."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/nov/25/martha-mcsally/10000-irs-agents-only-2-dozen-people-focused-viole/	Four days after the Paris terror attacks, House Speaker Paul Ryan led a news conference to discuss a bill that would require President Barack Obama to develop a plan for defeating the Islamic State. The Janesville Republican was joined Nov. 17, 2015 by U.S. Rep. Martha McSally, who made a claim -- comparing the number of Internal Revenue Service agents to the number of people "countering violent extremism" in America -- that we want to check. "This administration needs to step up," said McSally, an Arizona Republican. "We do not have a strategy. We do not have a focus. There are over 200,000 social media tweets and posts per day by ISIS, in a very sophisticated social media campaign. They are acting at the speed of broadband while we are acting at the speed of bureaucracy." She added: "We have 10,000 IRS agents making sure that you don't take an improper charity deduction and less than two dozen people focusing on countering violent extremism at home. It’s time for this administration to step up its game, take this seriously. It is a generational conflict and we must lead now more than ever." McSally greatly understated what the IRS’ 10,000 revenue agents do. And to conclude there are only two dozen people who focus on countering violent extremism in the country, she defined that group very narrowly. Let’s take a closer look. Checking charitable deductions On the IRS part of McSally’s statement, her office asked the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service how many revenue agents the IRS has, according to emails forwarded to us by her staff. The IRS told the research service there were 10,840. A revenue agent, the research service told McSally, "typically is an accountant who audits and examines the tax returns of individuals, businesses, and tax-exempt entities to determine whether they are meeting their tax obligations." In other words, the work of the 10,000 IRS agents is much broader than merely checking whether a taxpayer improperly claimed a tax deduction for making a charitable donation. It’s also not necessarily surprising the number is as high as it is, given that millions of people and entities file federal income taxes. And only a federal agency, not state or local authorities, would be involved in auditing federal returns. That’s in contrast to the approach taken in countering violent extremism. Countering violent extremism Now for the second part of McSally’s claim -- that there are fewer than two dozen people "focusing on countering violent extremism" in America, which isn’t exactly the same as fighting terrorism. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, citing a White House strategy document on countering violent extremism, says violent extremists are "individuals who support or commit ideologically-motivated violence to further political goals." So, countering violent extremism is an effort to prevent such violence. We asked for more clarification from Amy Pate, research director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. She said: Think of a 20-year-old, marginalized, radicalized American who one day shows up at the airport with a ticket to fly to Turkey and join ISIS. Countering violent extremism is aimed at preventing that sort of thing from occurring. It’s done through a variety of outreach and education programs, social media and other efforts, aiming to get down to the local and even the individual level -- such as showing parents how to spot whether a son or daughter might be becoming radicalized. "The more local it is, the more successful it’s going to be," Pate told us. Indeed, the White House strategy document, issued in 2011, outlines how the federal government will "support and help empower American communities and their local partners in their grassroots efforts to prevent violent extremism." The White House also said, in February 2015, that "communities provide the solution to violent extremism; and CVE efforts are best pursued at the local level, tailored to local dynamics, where local officials continue to build relationships within their communities through established community policing and community outreach mechanisms. The federal government’s most effective role in strengthening community partnerships and preventing violent extremism is as a facilitator, convener, and source of research and findings." In other words, unlike auditing federal tax returns, which is done at the federal level, countering violent extremism has a federal component but is designed to be an effort that is spread out throughout the country. To back McSally’s statement on the two dozen federal workers, her office cited a statement made at a July 2015 congressional hearing by U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. He said: "Our committee asked the top agencies responsible for (countering violent extremism) how much money and how many people they have assigned to the problem. They could only identify around $15 million being spent and around two dozen people working full-time to combating domestic radicalization. That’s it." The four primary federal entities for countering violent extremism are the departments of Homeland Security and Justice, the FBI and the National Counter-Terrorism Center. But McSally and McCaul are counting only the number of full-time federal employees in those agencies whose work is dedicated solely to countering violent extremism. Pate told us that ignores the many other employees from the four entities that spend least part of their time on countering violent extremism -- as well as countless other people across the country, including local law enforcement, community groups and individuals. Our rating McSally said the U.S. has "10,000 IRS agents making sure that you don't take an improper charity deduction," but to fight terrorism, it has "less than two dozen people focusing on countering violent extremism at home." There are 10,000 IRS revenue agents who examine and audit tax returns -- a much broader scope of work than merely checking for an improper deduction. And there’s an indication that as of mid-2015, strictly speaking, perhaps two dozen federal employees were focused solely on countering violent extremism. But that effort involves more federal employees who do at least some work on countering violent extremism, as well as people in local communities across the country who are involved. We rate McSally’s statement Mostly False. More on homeland security Rand Paul in Milwaukee: 40 percent of illegal immigrants "had a visa and then became illegal," mostly because "they changed jobs."

pomt-01911	"The platform of the Republican Party says deport everybody and to hell with it."	false	/texas/statements/2014/jun/30/gilberto-hinojosa/texas-republicans-oppose-legal-status-us-illegal-i/	The chairman of the Texas Democratic Party predicted delegates to its state convention in Dallas would endorse a platform favoring paths to citizenship for hard-working, tax-paying illegal immigrants in the country and legal residency for children of illegal immigrants who came here through no choices of their own. In advance of his party’s gathering, where he won a fresh two-year term, Gilberto Hinojosa went on to suggest the Republican Party of Texas recently settled on an approach to immigration with a decidedly negative vibe. Hinojosa told KERA, the Dallas public radio station: "The party platform of the Republican Party says deport everybody and to hell with it. And that’s just not what America’s all about. So that’s going to be a big contrast, and I think it’s going to affect substantially the attitude a lot of Hispanics have toward Republicans." It’s been widely reported that Texas Republicans, who met in Fort Worth in early June 2014, removed platform language from 2012 endorsing a federal guest-worker program. Also, as the Austin American-Statesman noted in a June 7, 2014, news story, the platform was stripped of "any provision that would create an opportunity for immigrants living and working in the United States without legal sanction to receive provisional visas." Did the party also say "deport everybody," as Hinojosa said? The word "deport" isn’t in the 2014 Republican platform, which has a two-page section on immigration that opens by saluting the importance of immigrants in the nation’s history. It goes on to say: "It remains imperative to create fair and consistent procedures that will enable freedom-loving, hard-working and law-abiding immigrants to join us, by providing them an efficient, practical method of legal entry, so they can lawfully take positions where their labor is needed, without exploitation or harassment. "Our national interests are poorly served by our broken, embattled, and outdated immigration system, and patchwork attempts to mend its deficiencies will not prepare us to continue to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex global economy that demands the legal movement of people to fill jobs at all skill levels." Among other elements, the immigration plank calls for more officers on the border, an end to the possibility of in-state college tuition for certain illegal residents and protection of the ability of law officers to ask into the immigration status of someone in custody. The closest the plank comes to deportation is a line stating no form of amnesty should be granted, "including the granting of legal status to persons in the country illegally." Such individuals, we suppose, would remain subject to deportation at any time. For a slightly longer perspective, we looked next at the state Republican Party platform adopted by delegates to its June 2012 convention. The 2012 immigration plank opens: "Because of decades-long failure of the federal government to secure our borders and address the immigration issue, there are now upwards of 11 million undocumented individuals in the United States today, each of whom entered and remain here under different circumstances. "Mass deportation of these individuals would neither be equitable nor practical," the 2012 platform says, going on to oppose "blanket amnesty" while endorsing a temporary guest-worker program "to bring skilled and unskilled workers into the United States for temporary periods of time when no U.S. workers are currently available." To our email request for the basis of Hinojosa’s claim, Emmanuel Garcia, spokesman for the state Democratic Party, said Hinojosa was "referring to the emotions that many Latinos and immigrants feel with the rhetoric at the" 2014 "GOP convention and the changes in the GOP platform. You are correct those exact words are not there." Our ruling Hinojosa said the Republican Party platform "says deport everybody and to hell with it." The heck you say. The Texas GOP platform opposes illegal immigration and any legal status for unauthorized U.S. residents, which leaves deportations a possibility. But the platform doesn’t venture as far as the chairman said. It doesn't call for deporting everybody living here illegally. We rate this claim as False.

pomt-10466	"Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA and permanent China trade. Pennsylvania lost thousands of jobs."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/21/barack-obama/a-distinction-without-a-difference/	In an attempt to draw distinctions where there are, in fact, very few, the Obama campaign sent around a mailer in Pennsylvania last week attacking Sen. Hillary Clinton on foreign trade. Over a picture of people standing in an unemployment line is this headline: "Here's the Truth: Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA and permanent China trade. Pennsylvania lost thousands of jobs." PolitiFact has addressed the NAFTA issue before, concluding that in the past, Clinton has, indeed, energetically promoted NAFTA, while noting that more work needed to be done. In June 2007, she said NAFTA had some positive effects "but unfortunately it had a lot of downside." And at a debate in December 2007, she announced her intention to review and reform NAFTA if she were elected. The other claim in Obama's political ad about Clinton's support for permanent China trade relates to a bill that passed Congress in 2000 to enter the United States into a Permanent Normalized Trade agreement with China. Clinton was campaigning for the U.S. Senate when the bill passed (just seven Democrats opposed), and Clinton was asked at a CNN-sponsored forum in April 2000 what she thought about it, in light of China's history on human rights. Said Clinton: "I share the concerns that many of my supporters in organized labor have expressed to me, because I do think we have to make sure that we improve labor rights, we improve environmental standards in our bilateral and our multilateral trade agreements. "But on balance, I've looked at this, I've studied it, I think it is in the interests of America and American workers that we provide the option for China to go into the WTO (World Trade Organization). Right now, we are trading with China. We have a huge trade deficit with China. The agreement that has been negotiated between our two countries would open their markets to us in a way that they are not yet open, and in fact, for many large manufactured products, like automobiles, we would have the first chance to really get in and compete in that marketplace." Obama says he would have opposed the legislation. In a forum sponsored by the Alliance for American Manufacturing (AAM) on April 15, 2008, Obama said the Permanent Normalized Trade agreement with China "didn't do enough to ensure fairness and compliance." "Now, you can have a debate about whether my position is right or wrong," Obama said. "But here's what you can't do. You can't spend the better part of two decades campaigning for NAFTA and PNTR for China, and then come here to Pennsylvania, and tell the steelworkers you've been with them all along." But when Clinton and Obama addressed the AAM, separately, on April 15, 2008, their stated positions on foreign trade were "virtually identical," said AAM director Scott Paul. Both pledged to step up enforcement of current trade laws. Both promised to crack down on China's practice of manipulating its currency to give its products an unfair advantage. Both said they opposed the Chinese government subsidizing industry to the detriment of U.S. competitors. "China must stop manipulating its currency because it's not fair to American manufacturers, it's not fair to you, and we are going to change it when I am president," Obama said. Said Clinton: "I'm calling for changing our laws to send China a message. If you subsidize your exports and hurt our manufacturers, you'll pay a price." Which led Paul to conclude: "There is not a lot of policy difference moving forward." The debate comes amid a campaign initiated by AAM called "China Cheats. Pennsylvania Loses." Alliance for American Manufacturing, a nonpartisan business-labor alliance, commissioned a study by the Economic Policy Institute that concluded that trade deficits with China have cost the United States 1.8-million jobs since 2001 (78,200 in Pennsylvania). Another study by EPI concluded Pennsylvania lost another 44,173 jobs between 1993 and 2004 due to NAFTA. But while the Obama campaign mailer tries to make it seem as though the two Democratic candidates are far apart on trade issues, in substance they are not. It is true that Clinton has in the past verbally supported NAFTA and permanent trade with China. Yet it is also true that she has spoken forcefully about the need to reform NAFTA and to much more stringently enforce trade agreements with China. So we rate the claims in the mailer to be Half True.

pomt-03921	Knopp says he upheld a campaign promise not to join the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS).	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/feb/23/tim-knopp/did-tim-knopp-honor-his-pledge-eschew-pers/	Freshman Oregon Sen. Tim Knopp, R-Bend, is clear that lawmakers need to fix the Public Employees Retirement System this year, and that they themselves should not be part of the system. He pledged during his campaign to decline membership in PERS. Earlier this month, Knopp’s office issued a press release saying that along with being sworn into office, "he upheld a campaign promise not to join the state retirement program known as the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS)." "It is very important to me to honor the promises that I’ve made," Knopp is quoted as saying in the release. "If we don’t fix PERS now there will be fewer firefighters protecting our communities, fewer police officers on the streets, and fewer teachers in the classroom." PERS is contentious. Lawmakers reformed the system in 2003, curbing benefits for new employees going forward. Some lawmakers say it’s still too generous. Public employee unions are firm that the benefits were bargained for and are fair. Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, wants to find savings in the system, as do Republicans; House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, is lukewarm to the idea. Public employees generally favor Democrats with campaign help and money, so it’s not surprising to hear that Knopp, a Republican, promised to opt out. But PolitiFact Oregon also recalled that before he joined the Senate this year, Knopp was a three-term member of the Oregon House. In fact, he was House majority leader when lawmakers tackled reform in 2003. We were pretty sure he had been a member of PERS. Knopp’s office confirmed what we thought to be true. He joined the system in 1999, when he was first elected to the House, and remained an active member until 2005, when he left office. As a member for six years, he was vested in the system. The money continued accruing until 2010. What happened in 2010? Knopp needed money for a family medical emergency, so he cashed out his account. The total gross amount was $8,167.07, which we acknowledge is not an astonishingly high figure. Retirement benefits are calculated based on pay, and length of service, and legislators don’t earn much, about $20,000 a year. Still, we think his previous membership is a relevant detail curiously missing from an otherwise glowing press release. If PolitiFact Oregon were in office and had made public employee retirement a major part of our platform and had promised to opt out, we think we’d make it explicit that we had once been part of PERS, in the interest of full and complete disclosure. In any case, Knopp had three options when he was sworn into office this year: Join the Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan, which is the pension system he’s complaining about; join the Oregon Savings Growth Plan, which is like any other deferred compensation plan; or decline to join a retirement plan. Knopp chose the deferred compensation plan. The state -- his employer, the taxpayers -- contributes 6 percent to his plan. The state does not "pick up" the additional 6 percent of salary on behalf of employees, as it would under PERS. We had two questions for the senator from Central Oregon: One, why not publicize the fact that he was a member -- for more than a decade -- of the system he is now criticizing? And two, why take a retirement option at all? Let’s take the retirement question first. Knopp told PolitiFact Oregon that he’s not opposed to compensation for legislators. He just doesn’t want them to vote on a system in which they have a stake. To that end, he has co-sponsored a bill to prohibit future legislators from joining PERS or the deferred compensation plan, because they shouldn’t "be forced to be in the system," as he was. "Actual or perceived, there needs to be somebody who completely represents citizens and taxpayers, without a conflict," he said. As to the first question, Knopp said he disclosed his previous membership on the campaign trail. When his Democratic challenger said Knopp was a PERS member at an October 2012 candidates’ forum, he said, "I closed my account years ago, honestly, to pay some medical bills when my daughter had two brain surgeries." We get that the retirement system in 1999 was not the legislative issue that it was in 2003 or that it is in 2013. But why didn’t he close his account before 2003, when it was clear he’d have to vote on PERS reforms? He said it wasn’t clear at the time whether he could.. Why not close the account in 2005, after leaving office? He said he co-sponsored a bill in 2003 that offered a financial incentive for people with inactive accounts to close their accounts. He thought it unseemly to benefit from that legislation -- although we checked, and he wouldn’t have qualified. Then why wait until 2010 to close his account? Knopp didn’t have a clear answer. He acknowledges that had he not needed the money in 2010, he would have continued to be a member. Knopp has been a consistent and outspoken critic of the Public Employees Retirement System. He served as the House chairman of the committee to reform PERS in 2003. He promised voters that he would not accept PERS this year and he followed through on the promise. What Knopp failed to mention is that he was a member of PERS who closed his account in 2010 because his family needed the money. Knopp could have closed his account in 2003 -- and avoided the conflict then -- or he could have closed his account when he left office in 2005. None of that takes away from the accuracy of the statement -- he honored his pledge to stay out of PERS -- but it is additional information that we deem missing from his press releases. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Tim Knopp	None	None	None	2013-02-23T03:00:00	2013-02-12	['None']
pomt-07445	Says that in 41 states, government workers "are better paid than the taxpayers who support them."	false	/texas/statements/2011/apr/21/mitch-daniels/mitch-daniels-says-government-workers-41-states-ma/	Count Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels among skeptics of government workers having collective-bargaining rights, the issue that cleaved Wisconsin this year. Daniels, a Republican presidential prospect, told PBS talk-show host Tavis Smiley March 28 that government workers are better off than others: "There may have once been a time, Tavis, in the old days of patronage and so forth, where government workers were put upon and vulnerable, but that's a long time ago. Now, in 41 states out of 50, they are better paid than the taxpayers who support them. In the federal government they're almost twice as well paid. This doesn't even count the benefits and the almost complete job security they have." Never mind that government workers are taxpayers too. We note also that in November, PolitiFact Ohio rated False a claim that average federal workers make double the pay of average private-sector workers. The fact check cited a statement placed online by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis noting the private-sector workforce includes a broader range of jobs than the federal government, from minimum-wage positions to CEOs, while federal civilian jobs focus on professional areas like law, accounting and economics that require higher education. We’re focusing here on whether state and local government workers are better compensated than private-sector counterparts. To our inquiry, Daniels’ office pointed us to a March 2 news article in USA TODAY. The story, citing figures obtained from the bureau, says state and local government employees in 41 states earned higher average pay and benefits than private workers in those states in 2009. The national average for the government workers was $57,775, $2,511 greater than private-sector counterparts. But not in Texas, which ranked last among states in benefits for public employees. Its average compensation to state and local government workers, $51,310, placed the state 30th nationally, according to the article, but its government workers trailed private-sector Texans by $3,580. For more Texas-centric information, we turned to the latest comparison of state government and private-sector positions by the Texas State Auditor’s Office. The August report says that in fall 2009, nearly three quarters of 150,000-plus state workers were paid 10 to 20 percent less than private sector employees and another 19 percent fared worse. "Some states that limit the right of public employees to unionize — such as Texas, Georgia and Virginia — pay less in compensation than the private sector," the article says. "Massachusetts and New Hampshire generally permit unions but pay less than the private sector in those high-income states." The story says the newspaper’s analysis included full and part-time workers and did not adjust for specific jobs, age, education or experience. It says that in an earlier job-to-job comparison, USA TODAY found that state and local government workers make about the same salary as those in the private sector but get more generous benefits. The article also quotes economist Jeffrey Keefe of the liberal Economic Policy Institute saying the analysis is misleading because it doesn't reflect factors such as education that result in higher pay for public employees. For our part, we consulted Austin economist Stuart Greenfield, a retired state worker who has long advocated on state employee issues. Greenfield guided us to a Texas Watchdog article playing off the USA TODAY story and a 2010 study commissioned by two Washington-based groups. The March 3 Watchdog article says the $10,760 average benefits package for the average public worker in Texas compares to the $9,190 average benefits that average private employees receives, according to the federal bureau’s figures. The 2010 study, comparing worker earnings and benefits across and between private, state and local sectors, was written by Keith Bender and John Heywood, economists at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. The study was undertaken by the Center for State and Local Government Excellence, whose mission is to "help state and local governments become knowledgeable and competitive employers so they can attract and retain talented, committed, and well-prepared individuals to public service," and the National Institute on Retirement Security, which says it was established to foster understanding of the value of retirement security to employees, employers, and the economy. "Public and private workforces differ in important ways," the authors write. "For instance, jobs in the public sector require much more education on average than those in the private sector. Employees in state and local sectors are twice as likely as their private sector counterparts to have a college or advanced degree. "Wages and salaries of state and local employees are lower than those for private sector workers with comparable earnings determinants (e.g., education). State employees typically earn 11 percent less; local workers earn 12 percent less," they write. In Texas, the gap was even greater for local government workers, who made nearly 18 percent less between 2000 and 2008. "Over the last 20 years, the earnings for state and local employees have generally declined relative to comparable private sector employees," they say. In the study, the economists air what they refer to as Simpson’s Paradox: "The average state worker appears to earn more only because the state hires more of those in the highly educated categories that tend to earn more, not because workers with the same education earn more in the public sector." They say too that compensation specialists "repeatedly show that the typical state and local public sector worker has more education, more tenure, and greater responsibilities... the fact that public sector workers receive greater average compensation than private sector workers should be no more surprising than the fact that those with more skills and education earn more." In fact, the study says, "if we limit our data to college-educated workers, those in state government earn 13 percent less than those in the private sector, while those in local government earn 11 percent less than those in the private sector." The study also isolated benefits, including pension, insurance and paid leave differences, finding that from 2004 to 2008 benefits comprised a larger portion of compensation in state and local government "although not dramatically different, particularly when compared to larger private sector firms." Incorporating "benefits makes state and public workers appear somewhat less poorly compensated, but our estimate suggests they still receive less total compensation than similar private sector workers," the study says. "Benefits should be expected to be higher if the public sector workers are more highly educated and doing jobs that command higher earnings." Big picture: "Although a comparison of unadjusted average earnings will show that wages are higher among jobs in state and local government, this result is largely due to the fact that the workers in those sectors have more education. Holding education and other characteristics the same, typical state and local workers earn an average of 11 percent less and 12 percent less, respectively, than comparable private sector workers," the study concludes. "Workers in the state and local sector receive a slightly larger share of their compensation in benefits, but it is not dramatically larger." Next, we wondered if there was an inherent weakness in the USA TODAY analysis Daniel cites. If most government jobs are of the professional, white-collar variety -- with requirements and compensation to match -- that would skew comparisons with the private sector, with its larger share of low-wage and service-sector jobs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 6.5 percent of private sector workers in 2010 were paid at or below the minimum wage, compared to 2.8 percent of government workers. As we closed out this review, we asked the Wisconsin economists if they’d compared government to non-government workers in every state. By e-mail, Bender said the "data for our study were such that we were uncomfortable reporting results for any but the largest 10 (states) or so because of sample sizes," but he guided us to a Feb. 25 New York Times’ state-by-state comparison breaking out employees with and without college degrees. Based on median salaries, state workers lacking college degrees fared better than their counterparts in the private sector in 30 states. But private-sector workers with such degrees earned more than degreed state workers in all but four states. Bender also called the method employed by USA TODAY inaccurate. "Both earnings AND benefits vary greatly by educational level (and other personal characteristics) and without explicitly taking this into account, the vast majority of economists would think that these numbers are essentially meaningless," he said. "If one group of workers has more education or experience than another group, it makes economic sense that that more highly educated and experienced group get paid more on average... "In sum, do I know whether there are 41 states where earnings plus benefits are greater in the public sector once you compare similar workers? No -- the number may be lower or higher. I haven't seen any research that does this convincingly. What I do know is that the analysis in the USA TODAY doesn't come close." Daniels’ message, that government workers are better paid than those in the private sector, traces to an egregiously simplistic comparison, ignoring meaningful differences in the public and private sector workforces largely due to education. Factoring those in, many state and local government workers lag behind their private-sector counterparts. We rate his statement False.

pomt-08679	Proposed tax changes are a "handout" to BP.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/10/national-taxpayers-union/national-taxpayers-union-ad-blasts-tax-proposal-ha/	On Sept. 2, 2010, the National Taxpayers Union -- a conservative advocacy group -- announced that it would be spending $4 million on an advertising campaign that targets higher energy taxes. Here's the narration of the TV ad: "Our economy's hurting, but some senators want to weaken an industry creating jobs. America's energy industry supports 9 million jobs, but Congress may double-tax U.S. energy companies, helping foreign companies owned by China and Venezuela, even BP. New taxes will raise your gas prices, make us more dependent on foreign oil, and cost 600,000 American jobs. Tell Congress BP doesn't deserve a handout. No new American energy taxes." At first, we thought this was an ad decrying the Democratic cap-and-trade proposal, a legislative effort to cap greenhouse gases that Republicans have consistently criticized as a tax on ordinary energy consumers. But that's not what the ad is about. Instead, NTU says the ad is about two changes under consideration by the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress -- rules for "dual capacity" taxpayers, and the Section 199 deduction. The ad is correct that the modifications being considered would primarily affect oil and gas companies. Even by the byzantine standards of tax law, these rules are highly arcane. So bear with us as we try to explain how they work and investigate whether the ad portrays them fairly. Our aim is to gauge whether the ad is accurate when it says that making these changes would amount to a "handout" to companies like BP. Let's start with the "dual capacity" rule. This rule stems from a tax code provision that lets U.S. taxpayers receive credit for taxes paid on income derived overseas, so income is not taxed twice. Say you're a U.S. oil company. You go to a foreign country to extract oil. You pay a 20 percent tax to that country on what you extract. When your U.S. taxes are calculated, you'll get a dollar-for-dollar credit for the taxes paid overseas. Where it starts getting complicated is that some foreign countries charge oil extractors a single payment that includes both the tax and a payment for the right to drill in the first place. So, rather than paying 20 percent tax on what's extracted, the company will have to pay more, because the rights to drill are included in the same levy. (The dual nature of these payments is the origin of the term "dual capacity.") Whether the company considers this a tax or a royalty payment matters quite a bit for the U.S. company's tax bill because amounts considered to be foreign taxes provide dollar-for-dollar reductions in tax liability, whereas a royalty only permits a deduction, which is a significantly smaller tax benefit than dollar-for-dollar. So, the greater the amount that's considered a foreign tax, the larger the sum that can be deducted from U.S. taxes. Current U.S. tax law deals with this by trying to determine what part is the true tax (and thus eligible for a dollar-for-dollar tax credit) and what is being paid by the company for a specific economic benefit, such as the right to drill (which is only deductible as a business expense). This is a fairly easy process if the foreign country has a straightforward corporate tax structure. But it gets complicated if the country either taxes "dual capacity" taxpayers at a different rate than other corporate taxpayers or if it has no basic corporate tax rate at all. In such cases, U.S. companies have more flexibility to call the payments they've made "taxes" -- too much flexibility for some critics, who argue that it's an unnecessary loophole that drains the U.S. Treasury of taxes. That's why President Barack Obama, in his fiscal year 2011 budget, and some senators have proposed tightening the rules. We won't get into the guts of the proposed changes here, but the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress' official, non-partisan arbiter of tax policy changes, found that Obama's proposal would collect an additional $8.2 billion between 2010 and 2020. Oil and gas companies aren't the only sector that would be affected, but they are the main companies that will. Now for the second proposal -- eliminating oil and gas companies as beneficiaries of Section 199 of the tax code. Section 199 is a deduction for companies that produce goods or software or undertake construction projects in the U.S. Passed in 2004, it replaced a previous tax benefit extended specifically to U.S. exporters, struck down as an illegal trade subsidy by the World Trade Organization. Under section 199, U.S. oil and gas companies can take advantage of a lower tax rate. According to Treasury Department testimony in 2009, making oil and gas ineligible is projected to increase federal revenues by $13.2 billion from 2010 to 2019. We won't address the ad's claim that these proposals could result in the elimination of 600,000 jobs, higher gasoline prices or greater dependence on foreign oil, since such estimates are speculative and ultimately not provable. Instead, we'll focus on whether the ad is justified in calling such changes a "handout" to BP or other foreign companies. In the ad's defense, the changes would only affect U.S.-based companies, and by taking away a benefit from a U.S. firm, the government could, in a sense, be advantaging foreign-based firms. Pete Sepp, NTU's executive vice president, said that the two tax provisions were created to take the sting off the U.S. corporate tax code. Because many of the United States' competitors do not tax the foreign earnings of domestic firms -- but we do -- deductions and exemptions like the two in question here help U.S. competitiveness. "Taking away one or both these provisions for oil companies -- provisions that exist for a wide variety of firms -- will, in our opinion, necessarily increase the overhead of oil and gas firms (based) here. That means higher costs for those firms -- costs which foreign-based competitors like BP don't have to shoulder." Still, "handout" is a pretty strong word to describe what's being proposed. In Webster's New World Dictionary, the relevant definition of "handout" is "a gift of food, clothing, etc., as to a beggar." Allowing for some artistic license to exchange "BP" for "beggar," we think the accuracy of "handout" depends on whether the government is affirmatively providing a direct benefit to BP. And it's not clear that the government would be doing this if it made these changes. If the government were to pass these two policy proposals, it would certainly be taking away a benefit granted to U.S.-based oil and gas companies. But would taking away the two benefits from U.S. companies be equivalent to giving a handout to BP? We're not so sure. Mitchell Kane, a professor at New York University Law School who specializes in international corporate taxation, said the use of the term "handout" in this context is "highly misleading," noting that there would be no change at all to BP's tax liability. "There could be competitive effects, but this is a highly speculative claim, and in any event is not what most people think of as a handout," Kane said. "If your co-worker loses her job, and there is therefore less competition in the company for promotions and future raises, does this mean you have received a 'handout?'" There's another reason to question whether BP's British owners are the only ones who would benefit if these provisions were to pass. In a globalized economy, some Americans would actually benefit, since foreign companies employ, do business with and pay quarterly dividends to lots of U.S. taxpayers. According to BP's website, it is the largest oil and gas producer and one of the largest gasoline retailers in the United States, as well as the largest non-U.S. company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. And U.S.-based subsidiaries of foreign companies, including BP's U.S. subsidiaries, qualify for Section 199 credits, which weakens the argument that BP would be a clear winner if these changes were made. It's certainly understandable that U.S. oil companies doing business overseas would be opposed to these proposals -- and perhaps feel picked on, since both changes specifically target their industry. Still, we think the term "handout" in this context is questionable -- even hypocritical, since the tax policy the oil companies want to keep in place could easily be described as involving longstanding "handouts" for them. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	National Taxpayers Union	None	None	None	2010-09-10T11:16:10	2010-09-02	['None']
pomt-01766	"We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/30/bryan-fischer/american-family-association-radio-host-says-aids-c/	Some of the 298 passengers who died aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 were HIV/AIDS researchers and advocates headed for the 20th International AIDS Conference in Australia, a fact President Barack Obama mentioned after the plane was shot down over eastern Ukraine. Obama also said in July 18 comments about the crash that "the United States of America is going to continue to stand for the basic principle that people have the right to live as they choose." That touched a nerve with Bryan Fischer, director of issues analysis of the conservative American Family Association. Fischer claimed that Obama was using the MH 17 downing as a platform to legitimize gay relationships. "Obama politicizes deaths of AIDS researchers on Malaysian plane. We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men," Fischer said in a message on Twitter that was retweeted 66 times and attracted national attention. His comments were lambasted by writers of The Daily Beast, Salon and Patheos. Still, Fischer doubled down in another tweet and column. We wanted to dig into the facts behind his claim that the way to stop AIDS is to "persuade men not to have sex with men." Fischer’s evidence Experts say Fischer’s idea of an AIDS solution is highly flawed. But Fischer stood by his claim in an interview with PunditFact, citing a report from UNAIDS that the rate of HIV is 19 times higher among men who have sex with men than the adult population. Also, he said that while his tweet isolated on men having sex with men, he made a somewhat broader argument on his radio show. "We know how to stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Persuade men not to have sex with men," he said on his radio show Focal Point. "Persuade prostitutes to go straight, and persuade people not to shoot up with drugs. If we can get everybody persuaded to do that, then the epidemic begins to diminish overnight." Dr. Stefan Baral, a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health epidemiology professor and director of the Key Populations Program of the Center for Public Health and Human Rights, said Fischer’s post on Twitter reveals a misunderstanding about human nature and societal behavior. "His recommendation is akin to making recommendations for people not to drive cars for fear of car accidents or riding a bike for fear of falling," Baral said in an email. "In other words, this is a natural and healthy normal practice that in the context of an additional determinant induces risk. It would not be dissimilar from saying that there would be no cervical cancer if heterosexual people didn’t have sex." HIV/AIDS overview There is no cure for AIDS or HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS and ravages the body’s immune system if untreated. The statistics are staggering. About 35 million people have HIV in the world, including about 3.3 million children and 1 million Americans, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research, or amfAR. Among Americans, about 50,000 are newly infected each year, and 18 percent do not know they have the virus. In 2012, 1.6 million people died from AIDS, which was a 30 percent drop from 2005, according to UNAIDS. In the United States, gay men contract the virus at disproportionate rates to their share of the American population. In 2010, men who have sex with men comprised 78 percent of new HIV infections among men -- 63 percent of all new infections -- even though they made up just 4 percent of the male American population, according to the CDC. Still, preventing men from having sex with men (if that were even feasible) will not end HIV/AIDS in the United States. About 20 percent of Americans infected with HIV in 2010 were women, mainly through heterosexual sex, according to the CDC. HIV is carried through body fluids. The virus is passed when HIV-infected fluids enter the bloodstream of someone else, such as through contact with a cut or sore, sharing needles or syringes, or through the vagina, rectum, mouth, or tip of the penis. In the United States, anal sex is the highest-risk behavior for spreading HIV, followed by vaginal sex, sex with multiple partners and sharing needles with someone infected with HIV. Mother-to-child transmissions are not common in the United States thanks to widespread HIV testing of pregnant women and drugs that prevent the virus from affecting a child. Neither is getting the virus through blood transfusions and organ donations and transplants, which are intensely tested for HIV. But what’s true for Americans is not true for other people in the world. World picture About 70 percent of all people infected with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa, about 24 million people. This region is also home to the most children living with HIV whose infections originated during pregnancy, childbirth of consuming breast milk, according to AIDS.gov. Globally, the dominant form of transmission is heterosexual sex, said Sophie Barton Knott, UNAIDS spokeswoman. Nearly half of people with HIV are female, and most were infected through heterosexual sex. Most of the 50.9 percent of men with HIV got it through heterosexual sex, too, she said. The highest rates of AIDS among 15- to 24-year-olds is among women in many parts of the world, said Seth Faison, spokesman for The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. And in Eastern Europe, the highest transmission rates of AIDS are among people who inject drugs. "Men who have sex with men are a high-risk group, but not the only one," he said. The bottom line? Preventing men from having sex with men will not end AIDS. Faison said the criminalization of same-sex activity actually can increase transmission rates. Being gay is a crime in at least 76 countries, and in those places, gay men are less likely to receive treatment, testing and prevention. The CDC also says stigma and homophobia are likely one factor behind the rise in HIV infections among young gay men in the United States. "In effect, efforts to ‘persuade men not to have sex with men’ is counterproductive," Faison said. "It will not stop AIDS." Our ruling Fischer said, "We know how to stop AIDS: persuade men not to have sex with men." Though men who have sex with men are at the highest risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in America, this is not a serious solution to ending a pandemic disease. Not in the United States, and certainly not worldwide. Women, children, and men who don’t have sex with men are also at risk, and women make up about half of people worldwide who have HIV/AIDS. Fischer’s claim is ridiculous. It rates Pants on Fire.	None	Bryan Fischer	None	None	None	2014-07-30T10:11:12	2014-07-18	['None']
pomt-13841	In 2016, Dallas, Texas, has fewer "police officer-related shootings than any large city in America."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/12/mike-rawlings/does-dallas-have-fewest-police-shootings-america-i/	The morning after the ambush killing of five Dallas police officers, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said the police department has cultivated positive relationships with the Dallas community. The agency, he said, has trained in de-escalating encounters and community policing. "I want to brag just for a second if anybody hasn't heard us say this," he said at a news conference July 8. "This year, we have the fewest police officer-related shootings than any large city in America." Rawlings made a similar claim on MSNBC’s Morning Joe that same day. Even though his statement is unclear, a spokesperson confirmed the mayor was referring to shootings by, not directed at, officers. We wanted to know if there was support for his statement. The best data we have suggests the mayor might be right, but we can’t know for sure. No nationwide data There is a major stumbling block with claims like these: There is no national database of police shootings. The FBI does collect some data on justifiable homicides by law enforcement, but it’s not broken down to the city level. The agency also issues a Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted report, but it only goes up to 2014 (and it doesn’t cover people killed or wounded by officers). To make matters more complicated, the FBI’s numbers are provided voluntarily by law enforcement agencies. (Only a small fraction of the 18,000 agencies who voluntarily participate in the program provide deadly force data.) "Some cities would only report certain types of shootings," said Jonathan Maskaly, a criminology professor at the University of Texas at Dallas. "Others would report everything. Cities with problems would tend to obfuscate." Maskaly said verifying Rawlings’ claim — especially the "all large cities" component — is difficult without a comprehensive database. That said, we were able to find officer-related shooting data for specific police departments, as well as documentation of lethal force from media sources. These accounts, while limited, do show Dallas has a low number of shootings by police compared to other cities. Dallas vs. the rest of Texas The Washington Post tracks fatal police shootings nationwide, as does The Guardian. Both recorded the same incidents — five lethal shootings in Dallas in 2015, and one in 2016. A Dallas Police Department spokesperson pointed us to online officer-involved shooting data. The department’s "officer-involved shooting" data included lethal shots, shots that injured, and shots that missed. As a result of the broader parameters, the police department’s data shows 11 shootings in 2015, but still just one for 2016. There’s just one problem — the one shooting the newspapers found in 2016 is different from the one in Dallas’ data. The Guardian and Post included a shooting by a Mesquite Police Department officer in Dallas, whereas the police department data only counts its own officers. We did our own count using these three sources plus a Google News search. The result revealed one additional shooting by a Dallas officer. The numbers vary depending on if the data includes shootings by non-Dallas police officers that happened in Dallas (such as by the Mesquite Police Department) or just those by Dallas officers. Including non-DPD officers, there were 12 officer-involved shootings in Dallas in 2015 and three in 2016. Counting only the Dallas Police Department, however, there were 11 in 2015 and two in 2016. This is what Rawlings was referring to. What about other major Texas cities? We defined "large city" using the Census Bureau, looking at cities comparable to Dallas’ estimated 1.28 million people. Houston had 16 officer-involved shootings this year and 32 in 2015. San Antonio police reported five such incidents in 2016. Austin didn’t have available data, but an April news report counted five officer-involved 2016 shootings by the Austin Police Department as of that time. In total, there were two police-related shootings by Dallas police in 2016 — less than Houston, San Antonio and Austin. A broader look Rawlings said Dallas had fewer officer-related shootings than "any large city" in 2016, not just any large Texas city. So we looked around the country to see if any large departments reported fewer than the two police-related shootings we found by Dallas police. Data for the San Diego Police Department, captured by the county district attorney, show eight officer-involved shootings in 2015. We spoke to a county spokesperson, who told us there were three officer-involved shootings by the San Diego police in 2016. Officers of the Los Angeles Police Department shot 38 people in 2015. Data for 2016 wasn’t available, but scrolling through the LAPD’s press releases, we counted 11 officer-involved shootings. We also counted six officer-involved shootings in Las Vegas in 2016, at least 24 in 2015 for Chicago, and 21 in Phoenix for 2014. The list of "large cities" could go on indefinitely, and there is no guarantee we wouldn’t eventually find one with less than the two officer-involved shootings from Dallas police. To keep it simple, we checked eight cities in addition to Dallas — including San Antonio, Houston, Austin, San Diego, Los Angeles, Chicago, Las Vegas and Phoenix. From what we could find, Dallas police had the lowest number (two) of officer-involved shootings in 2016. Other measures Experts agreed that Dallas had a low number of officer-involved shootings compared to other cities. "If the data is correct — I would agree that Dallas has a low number of police shootings especially when compared with similar size cities," said David Hurley, assistant professor of criminal justice at Texas A&M University. However, counting the number of police shootings is the wrong metric to consider, said John Worrall, professor of criminology at the University of Texas at Dallas. He and Maskaly both pointed to shootings-per-officer or shootings-per-capita as more informative measure. However, there is no available data for strictly 2016 on that point. The Better Government Association published a July 2015 study of fatal police shootings in major cities between 2010-2014. Looking at that data, which is compiled via public records requests from police departments, Dallas had 34, more than San Antonio (28), San Diego (17) and San Jose (11). Dallas also had higher fatal shootings-per-capita than several cities during that period, including those with more fatal shootings overall such as Chicago and New York City. Our ruling Mayor Rawlings said Dallas had fewer officer-related shootings in 2016 than any other large city. There is no national database to compare Dallas with every single other large metropolitan area, so it is nearly impossible to verify that side of the claim. However, numerous sources suggest Dallas does, in fact, have a low number of officer-involved shootings compared to cities of similar sizes with available data. For that reason, we rate Rawlings’ statement Half True. Editor's note: This fact-check was updated July 13 with correct information from the San Diego Police Department to show three police-involved shootings for 2016, not two as originally reported. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ae42a763-78c9-44fc-9d7c-725105a8be16	None	Mike Rawlings	None	None	None	2016-07-12T15:02:27	2016-07-08	['United_States', 'Texas', 'Dallas']
pomt-02948	Nearly 6 in 10 uninsured Americans "can get health insurance for what may be the equivalent of your cell phone bill."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/28/barack-obama/obama-says-some-can-buy-health-insurance-cost-mont/	As President Barack Obama has taken a lot of heat for healthcare.gov, the website where people can buy health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, he has turned to his same talking points time and time again. In response to residents’ concerns that Obamacare isn’t affordable, Obama says: "One study shows that through new options created by the Affordable Care Act, nearly 6 in 10 uninsured Americans will find that they can get covered for less than $100 a month. Think about that. Through the marketplaces you can get health insurance for what may be the equivalent of your cell phone bill. Or your cable bill. And that’s a good deal." We got to wondering if he was right. If you had to choose one, is it more affordable to visit the doctor for your symptoms or punch them in on your WebMD mobile app? (We shouldn’t need to tell you which would be more effective for your health.) Cell phone bills Let’s start by pinpointing the easier number: the average monthly cell phone bill. J.D. Power, a consumer research company, released a study Oct. 17 saying the average individual phone bill is $79 per month, while a family’s runs about $149. There’s a lot of wiggle room in there. Obviously, smart phone bills are higher because of required data plans. Different carriers have different options for text messaging, data and minutes. That’s in the ballpark of what Obama was referencing. The White House sent us a 2012 Coupon Cabin study indicating that 46 percent of cell phone owners pay more than $100 per month. Average marketplace costs Now we’ll switch gears to the trickier subject. Are the health insurance plans offered on the marketplace in that same ballpark? The marketplaces offer consumers a number of different pricing options for plans. "Unless you and I are both the same age with the same number of people in the household and the same income in the same county, we’re not going to get the same data back," said Elena Marks, a Rice University health policy professor. As an example, the New York Times recently reported that, under the new law, health insurance costs are going up in rural areas, where there aren't a lot of marketplaces competing for consumers and driving down costs. Due to the complexity of pricing and the tax credit system for the plans, it’s difficult to tabulate a straightforward average to pit against an average cell phone bill. But let’s see what coverage costs could look like for some people. There are different levels of plans: catastrophic (only for people under 30), bronze, silver and gold. As premiums get pricier, they have lower out-of-pocket maximums, which means when people get sick, the plan covers more of their expenses if they have a gold plan as opposed to a bronze. Aside from the different levels, consumers pay different amounts based on how their income compares to the poverty level. For example, an individual who earns annual income at the U.S. poverty line ($11,490 this year) or up to 400 percent of that could get a tax credit of hundreds of dollars toward a plan. The law specifies they’d be expected to pay 9.5 percent of their income on insurance. At 400 percent of the poverty level, that breaks down to a maximum monthly payment of $363.85. But many people would pay less than that. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation within the Department of Health and Human Services published a report the White House referred us to indicating that 56 percent of the marketplace-eligible uninsured could pay $100 or less for a plan in 2014. That’s based on the costs of the second-cheapest silver plan, which is the benchmark for tax credits stipulated in the law. The ASPE study makes sense, said Boston University health policy professor Alan Sager. Many of the people applying for Obamacare, who don't have insurance through their employers, tend to be lower income, which means they'd qualify for subsidies that could put their premiums under $100 per month. "That'd really tend to favor the ASPE assertion," Sager said. Marks, another health policy expert, also referenced the study as a reliable average of premium costs. Because there’s a wide range of both insurance plans and phone bills, it’s not hard to see that an insurance plan could be cheaper month-to-month. However, that’s all assuming the plan holder doesn’t get sick. Health care isn’t all about affording the monthly premiums. When policyholders go to the doctor, they usually pay a fraction of the costs with deductibles and co-pays. The money consumers shell out at the doctor’s office doesn’t count as money they pay through the marketplaces, as Obama specified, but it’s easy to see how his audience could get tripped up by that distinction. The law does specify the maximum amount a policyholder would have to pay out in a given year: $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family. Divide those figures by 12 and you get $529.17 and $1,058.33, respectively. Clearly, those numbers are greater than what anyone should be paying toward a cell phone bill. Granted, most won’t come close to hitting their maximums unless they get sick, but the possibility’s there. Our ruling Obama said under the Affordable Care Act, some U.S. residents could get health insurance for the same price as a monthly cell phone bill. There’s a wide range of plan costs, many of which are comparable to phone bills, especially for those who qualify for tax credits. A credible study indicates that about 56 percent of marketplace-eligible people could pay $100 or less. Obama was particularly careful in his phrasing, citing that precise study. Still, health insurance isn't the same thing as a cell phone bill. It's insurance, so people who get sick will face additional costs in the form of co-pays and deductibles. Policyholders who get sick could be shelling out thousands of dollars each year for health care, much more than any cell phone bill. Overall, we rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-08898	"Today almost half our debt is owned by foreigners."	true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/30/jeb-hensarling/rep-jeb-hensarling-says-nearly-half-us-debt-owned-/	Speaking July 8 in Terrell, east of Dallas, U.S. Rep Jeb Hensarling, R-Dallas, focused on the federal debt, according to a July 12 recap in The Terrell Tribune. "Today," Hensarling said, "almost half of our debt is owned by foreigners. There is an old saying that whoever owns your debt may one day own you." We wondered if Hensarling got the level of foreign ownership right. Some perspective: The level of foreign ownership of the debt started inching up decades ago. According to a Forbes magazine article published in March, until the early 1970s foreigners owned less than 5 percent of the national debt. This started to change, columnist/economist Bruce Bartlett wrote, "after the big run-up in oil prices." Bartlett continued: "As oil exporters suddenly acquired vast financial resources they found it convenient to park them in Treasury securities, which provided liquidity and safety. By 1975 the foreign share of the national debt rose to 17 percent, where it stayed through the 1990s, when China began buying large amounts of Treasury bills . . . At the end of last year, foreigners owned close to half of the publicly held national debt." Hensarling’s office pointed us to a U.S. Treasury website stating that by June, more than 30 other countries -- China topped the list -- owned nearly $4 trillion in U.S. debt, which the government defines as all federal debt held by individuals, corporations, state or local governments, foreign governments, and other entities outside the U.S. government, less federal financing bank securities. According to another Treasury site, the federal government’s total debt as of June 1 was nearly $8.6 trillion—making the share owned by foreigners about 46 percent. We encountered a wrinkle, though. That $8.6 trillion in debt didn’t count nearly $4.5 trillion in "intragovernmental holdings," which would have brought the total U.S. debt to $13 trillion -- lowering the percentage of foreign-held debt to 30 percent. The government defines intragovernmental holdings as Government Account Series securities held by government trust funds, revolving funds, and special funds; and federal financing bank securities, including money owed to Social Security. Debt is debt, regardless of who's owed, no? So we wondered if it makes sense to consider the entire federal debt, as we just did, before calculating how much has been snapped up by foreigners. Hensarling spokesman George Rasley conceded Hensarling didn’t take into account all the government’s debt before making his statement. Rasley pointed out, though, that it’s not the Texan’s idea to separate intragovernmental holdings from publicly held debt; that’s the government’s approach. Rasley speculated in an e-mail: "I assume that it is (separated that way) because the government differentiates between debt we SELL to investors," debt purchased by members of the public as well as foreign nations, " and debt the government owes itself between accounts . . .which are owed by one arm of the federal government to another arm of the federal government." Sandy Leeds, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas, frequently delves into federal spending issues. Leeds echoed Rasley, telling us government officials, such as Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke almost always ignore intragovernmental debt in their references to U.S. public held debt. "There are two reasonable ways to approach this," Leeds said. "One, we've got $8.6 trillion of debt and we also have no money for Social Security other than what we take in each year. Or you could say we have got $13 trillion of debt" including intragovernmental debt such as money owed to Social Security. Leeds said: "I really couldn't argue that one is right and one is wrong." "There is certainly nothing misleading," Leeds said, about Hensarling's statement. Leeds added in an e-mail: "Dividing the foreign debt by the publicly held debt is fair. One way of thinking about this is to think of all of the debt that we had to go to the outside markets to finance. Foreigners financed 50 percent." We rate Hensarling's statement True.

pomt-07980	Between 2000 and 2006, "health insurance company profits quadrupled."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/19/chris-van-hollen/rep-chris-van-hollen-says-insurance-company-profit/	As the debate over a Republican effort to repeal the health care reform law kicked into high gear on Jan. 18, 2011, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., argued against repeal and began by citing a couple of statistics to set the stakes. "I'm interested to hear my colleagues say that they can identify with all the problems in the health care system," Van Hollen said from the floor of the House. "Between the year 2000 and 2006, premiums in this country doubled, health insurance company profits quadrupled, and this Congress did nothing." This statistic is nothing new in the health care debate. In fact, we first visited a very similar claim when Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., wrote a Sept. 21, 2009, opinion piece for the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call in which he said, "Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled." As we did then, we'll break this into two fact-checks. We'll deal with the claim about premiums in a separate item. Here we'll address Van Hollen's claim that health insurance company profits quadrupled between 2000 and 2006. And we'll borrow heavily from our fact-check of that similar claim made by Rockefeller in September 2009. Rockefeller took his numbers about insurance company profits from a study sponsored by Health Care for America Now. Researchers for HCAN looked at financial data submitted by 10 large, publicly held health insurers to the Securities and Exchange Commission, covering the years between 2000 and 2008. The 10 companies are Aetna, Amerigroup, Centene, CIGNA, Coventry, Health Net, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, Universal American Group and WellPoint. HCAN is a liberal group that supported the Democratic health care reform efforts, so we checked a few of HCAN's numbers by looking at some of the original disclosure forms on the SEC website and found no notable discrepancies. So the study appears sound. The researchers found that the collective profits of these 10 companies rose from $2.41 billion in 2001 to $12.87 billion in 2007 — a 466 percent increase, meaning that, over that period of time, they more than quadrupled. We dinged Rockefeller a bit for cherry-picking years, because, if you used, instead, the years 2001 through 2008, the data show that profits rose from $2.41 billion to $8.40 billion — a 249 percent increase. That's still a whopping jump, but it's not as high as the increase Rockefeller cited. The general dropoff in the economy had a lot to do with the lower profits in 2008, said Alex Lawson, a health care researcher for Campaign for America's Future, a liberal group, who co-authored the HCAN study, in a 2009 interview with PolitiFact. Meanwhile, there's another caveat for HCAN's study. The group didn't adjust the profit statistics for corporate takeovers. When big companies absorb smaller ones, the net effect may be to enlarge the profits of the biggest companies (including many of the 10 giants in HCAN's study) even as the total size of the health insurance industry — the broader entity that Rockefeller seemed to be referring to — stays roughly the same. While doing such adjustments would have been logistically difficult, and maybe even impossible, the fact that they weren't done puts limits on how this data can be interpreted. A health industry analyst, Steve Shubitz of Edward Jones, told us in 2009 that consolidation is "a very large part of this overall increase" in the higher profits by the remaining 10 companies. "Of course, these companies have increased profits, too, outside of acquisitions, but nowhere near to the extent that's implied by those stats," Shubitz said. Lawson acknowledged that the HCAN chart on profits does not address how much of an impact consolidation had on profits. But he added that the table actually comes from a study that specifically addressed the harm to competition caused by consolidation, so the group hardly ignored that issue. In addition, he defended the decision to use numbers unadjusted for consolidation. "That's what the market reacts to, and that's what they put in their annual report," Lawson said. The insurance industry, for its part, argues that total health plan profits are less than one penny of the total national health expenditure dollar. "The data is clear that profits are not what is driving rising health care costs," said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the leading health insurance trade group. Back in 2009, we rated Rockefeller's claim Half True, noting that if he had carried the data forward to 2008 — an admittedly somewhat atypical year — the increase fell short of his stated quadrupling. But Van Hollen had a clearer reason to set the parameters between 2000 and 2006. Democrats regained control of the House in 2007. So it's fair for him to stop short of the 2008 figures. But as we noted when Rockefeller made a similar claim, the numbers Van Hollen used reflect 10 of the biggest companies as opposed to "insurance companies" in general. And the study did not adequately account for consolidation. But on balance, we rate Van Hollen's statement Mostly True.	None	Chris Van Hollen	None	None	None	2011-01-19T10:54:34	2011-01-18	['None']
pomt-11344	The omnibus bill "does not designate a single dollar for Planned Parenthood."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/apr/06/robert-pittenger/pittenger-says-bill-doesnt-designate-money-planned/	The recent federal spending bill has become a point of contention in the Republican primary for North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District seat. Incumbent Rep. Robert Pittenger faces a challenge from Rev. Mark Harris, who lost the 2016 primary against Pittenger by only 134 votes. The duo has traded barbs over Pittenger’s voting record, whether Harris worked to stop Donald Trump from becoming president and now over the omnibus bill that Congress passed and Trump signed in March. Harris thinks Pittenger should’ve opposed the bill since it didn’t fully fund a border wall, among other reasons. Pittenger, meanwhile, has touted its benefits. One of the bill’s positives, Pittenger said in a recent newsletter, is that the bill "does not designate a single dollar for Planned Parenthood." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com When asked about the newsletter, Pittenger’s staff pointed to a breakdown of the omnibus bill that was circulated by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, chair of the House Republican Conference. Her summary of the bill, emailed to House Republicans, says "there has never been a line item for Planned Parenthood in the Labor, HHS, Education appropriations bill." The Pittenger campaign also pointed out a congratulatory letter he received from the National Right to Life organization – which the campaign included in its statement about Planned Parenthood funding. National Right to Life is an anti-abortion group that has endorsed Pittenger and gives him a 100 percent "pro-life" voting record. Funding remains The group’s letter supports Pittenger’s claim that the bill doesn’t include any "line item" money specifically for Planned Parenthood. But, the NRL letter notes that Planned Parenthood affiliates "are able to tap into funds from the various long-standing health programs." "The greatest amount of federal money to Planned Parenthood flows through so-called ‘mandatory spending programs,’ mostly Medicaid," the letter says. Indeed, recent estimates show that the organization about 40 percent of its funding from the government. Planned Parenthood receives more than $500 million in combined state and federal government funds. If a Medicaid patient comes to Planned Parenthood, the organization can bill the organization for services the patient chooses. Another portion can come through the government’s Title X Family program, which subsidizes birth control and tests for sexually-transmitted diseases. But Congress and President Donald Trump last year passed a law that allows states to withhold that funding for groups like Planned Parenthood. Pittenger voted for that law. Lawrence Shaheen, a spokesman for the Pittenger campaign, argued that the newsletter isn’t deceptive because it included the National Right to Life letter explaining that Planned Parenthood still receives funding through other means. Some tried to cut all funds So the omnibus bill doesn’t end funding for Planned Parenthood, even if the health organization isn’t specifically mentioned as a funding recipient. But it wasn’t for a lack of trying by some Republicans in Congress. Some House Republicans – including several from the House Freedom Caucus – tied their support for the spending bill to cutting federal funding to Planned Parenthood, according to Politico. However, the effort died largely because the bill wouldn’t garner enough support in the Senate to pass, according to Vox. Planned Parenthood's continued eligibility for federal funding prompted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to tout the bill as a victory for Democrats. "We don’t have the House. We don’t have the Senate. We don’t have the presidency," Schumer said, "but we produced a darn good bill for the priorities that we have believed in." While the omnibus bill gives no new funding to Planned Parenthood and doesn’t designate money for the organization by name, it does allow Planned Parenthood to continue receiving money from the federal government. Our ruling Pittenger said the spending bill "does not designate a single dollar for Planned Parenthood." Technically, in the very literal sense of the word "designate," Pittenger is right. The bill doesn’t specifically direct funding to Planned Parenthood by name. But the federal government continues to pay for Planned Parenthood’s services through Medicaid and other programs. And since voters are more likely to care about whether their tax dollars go to an organization – not whether the organization is specifically named in legislation – we rate Pittenger's claim Half True.

pomt-03988	"Three in four low-income workers don’t have any paid sick days available."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/feb/11/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-three-quarters-low-income-w/	Typhoid Mary was a cook. Working at that job made her single-handedly responsible for multiple outbreaks of typhoid fever, in and around New York City, about a century ago. PolitiFact Ohio couldn't help recalling that bit of history recently after reading advice for the flu season from the Centers for Disease Control, which urged sick people to stay home from work and school to avoid the spread of illness. The history was freshened by last week's news that a college cafeteria worker in Indiana had been diagnosed with typhoid fever, and it came to mind when we saw a release from Sen. Sherrod Brown saying that he is co-sponsoring the Healthy Families Act, which is being reintroduced in Congress. Also called the earned sick time initiative, the legislation would allow workers at businesses with 15 or more employees to earn paid sick days. Workers could earn up to one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked, up to a total of seven days. "For far too many Americans, a day home from work means a day without pay," Brown said. "Some 40 percent of private-sector workers in the U.S. don’t have any paid sick days at all. It’s worse for low-income workers — three in four don’t have any paid sick days available." We wondered about the numbers. Brown's staff said the source was last year's National Compensation Survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Its chart for paid leave benefits shows that 61 percent of all workers in the private sector have paid sick days -- meaning about 40 percent don't have them. Among the lowest-paid 25 percent of workers, the chart shows that 29 percent have paid sick days, meaning more than 70 percent don't have them. Among the lowest-paid 10 percent of workers, 18 percent have sick days, so 82 percent do not. (Three in four, the figure used by Brown, is 75 percent.) We found other figures as well:. More than three in four food service and hotel workers (78 percent) don’t have any paid sick days, according to an analysis by the Institute for Women's Policy Research. Workers without sick days are more likely to go to work with a contagious illness, according to a 2010 survey by the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center. And a 2011 study in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that a lack of sick leave helped spread 5 million cases of flu-like illness during the outbreak of 2009. Critics of the sick leave initiative, including the National Association of Independent Businesses, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, say paid sick days add costs to low-margin businesses, are burdensome to business and result in lost jobs. In a recent survey of businesses by the Employment Policies Institute, "Roughly 70 percent of respondents said that Connecticut’s sick leave law was not good for business," the group said. PolitiFact Ohio is not rating the legislation, however -- only Brown’s statement on the numbers of workers who don’t have access to paid sick days. We rate it True.

pomt-14895	"Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no federal elected office experience."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/08/ben-carson/ben-carson-said-no-one-who-signed-declaration-inde/	Ben Carson -- currently the top-polling Republican presidential candidate -- posted a message on Facebook on Nov. 4 to rebut critics who say his lack of experience in elected office would be a serious obstacle to his serving as an effective president. Soon after it was posted, we began hearing from readers asking us to check one of his claims. "You are absolutely right — I have no political experience," Carson wrote in the initial version of his post. "The current Members of Congress have a combined 8,700 years of political experience. Are we sure political experience is what we need. Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience. What they had was a deep belief that freedom is a gift from God. They had a determination to rise up against a tyrannical King. They were willing to risk all they had, even their lives, to be free." After our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed Carson’s claim that "every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience" and gave it Four Pinocchios -- the column’s worst rating -- the quote was changed. It now reads, "Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no federal elected office experience" (emphasis added). We were already looking into Carson’s initial Facebook comment when the wording change was made. We’ll address both versions here. The signers had 'no elected office experience' Many of the signers of the Declaration of Independence had held elective office before joining the Continental Congress, which produced the declaration. We found a long list, so take a deep breath before you start reading. They include: • John Adams. Elected to Massachusetts Assembly, 1770; attended First Continental Congress, 1774-1776. • Thomas Jefferson. Represented Albemarle County as a delegate in the Virginia House of Burgesses, 1769-1775 • Benjamin Franklin. Philadelphia councilman, 1748; elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly, 1751. • John Hancock. Elected to the Boston Assembly, 1766; president of the provincial congress of Massachusetts, c. 1773; elected to the Continental Congress, 1774, and then president of the congress in 1775. • Samuel Adams. Elected to Massachusetts Assembly, 1765; delegate to the First Continental Congress, 1774. • Elbridge Gerry. Elected to Massachusetts Legislature, 1773; provincial Congress, 1774. • Roger Sherman. Elected to Connecticut General Assembly, representing New Milford, 1755-1758 and 1760-1761; elected to various offices representing New Haven in the 1760s and 1770s; elected to the Continental Congress starting in 1774. • Caesar Rodney. Elected to Delaware Colonial Assembly, 1758-1770 and 1771-1776; delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, 1765; elected to the Continental Congress, 1774. • George Taylor. Elected to Pennsylvania provincial assembly, 1764-69; elected to Continental Congress, 1775. • John Morton. Elected to Pennsylvania provincial assembly, 1756-1775; delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, 1765; president of the provincial assembly, 1775. • George Ross. Elected to Pennsylvania provincial assembly, 1768-1776; Elected to Continental Congress, 1774. • James Wilson. Elected to Pennsylvania provincial congress, 1775; elected to the Continental Congress, 1775. • Thomas McKean. Member of the Delaware Assembly, 1762-79; Delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, 1765; delegate to the Continental Congress, 1774. • Matthew Thornton. Member of the New Hampshire provincial assembly, 1758-1762. • William Whipple. Elected to New Hampshire provincial congress, 1775 and 1776. • Stephen Hopkins. Speaker of the Rhode Island Assembly,1750s; member of the Continental Congress beginning in 1774. • Lewis Morris. Member of New York provincial legislature; delegate to the Continental Congress, 1775. • Philip Livingston. Alderman, New York City. • Carter Braxton. Virginia House of Burgesses, 1770-1785; delegate to the Continental Congress, 1774-75. • Thomas Nelson Jr. Member of the House of Burgesses, 1774; Virginia provincial convention, 1775. • Francis Lightfoot Lee. Member of the Virginia House of Burgesses 1758-1775; elected to Continental Congress, 1775. • Benjamin Harrison. Elected to Virginia House of Burgesses, 1764; member of the Continental Congress, 1774. • George Wythe. Member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, 1755-65. • William Hooper. Elected to general assembly of North Carolina, 1773; member of Continental Congress, 1774-1776. • Joseph Hewes. Member of the colonial assembly of North Carolina, 1766-1775; member of new provincial assembly, 1775; elected to Continental Congress, 1774. • John Hart. Member of the New Jersey Assembly, 1761-1771; member of provincial assembly, 1775; elected to the Continental Congress, 1776. • William Williams. Town clerk, selectman, provincial representative, elected state legislator, delegate to colonial conferences, 1770s. • William Paca. Delegate to the Maryland Legislature, 1771; elected to Continental Congress, 1774. That’s at least 28 of the 56 signers -- about half, and we were conservative in who we counted. The real number may be higher. Either way, Carson’s original claim, that "every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience," is way, way off. The signers had 'no federal elected office experience' The edit Carson made to the Facebook post doesn’t help his case, since there was no federal government before the Declaration of Independence was signed. This makes his entire claim illogical, experts say, "Of course they did not have federal elected office experience because there was no federal government at the time -- we were a British colony," said Michael Gerhardt, scholar in residence at the National Constitution Center and professor of constitutional law at the University of North Carolina. "It does not make sense to use the term ‘federal’ when no federal government existed," agreed Danielle Allen, a political theorist and author of Our Declaration: A Reading of the Declaration of Independence in Defense of Equality. "The signers of the declaration very often had leading political experience in their colony or, as they called them, in their ‘countries.’ " Jan Lewis, a professor of history at Rutgers University-Newark and the author of The Pursuit of Happiness: Family and Values in Jefferson’s Virginia, finds Carson’s claim ridiculous. "It makes about as much sense as saying none of them had been to the moon," Lewis said. "Of course they hadn't, because it was an impossibility at that time. No one could possibly serve in the federal government before there was a federal government, at least in the absence of time travel." Carson’s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Both the initial and the revised versions of Carson’s claim are far off base. About half or more of the declaration’s signers had held elective office previously, a reality that severely undercuts Carson’s overall point that the drafting of the Declaration of Independence showed how a lack of political experience can produce landmark political achievements. As for his later addition of "federal" to the comment, this makes the claim nonsensical, since there was no federal government prior to the signing of the declaration. We rate Carson’s claim Pants on Fire.	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2015-11-08T10:30:24	2015-11-04	['None']
pomt-01510	Says Rick Scott cut education by over a billion dollars, meaning thousands of teachers "lost their jobs" and "class sizes went up."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/sep/22/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-blames-rick-scott-teacher-layoffs-an/	Charlie Crist has upped the ante on one of his favorite talking points: attacking Gov. Rick Scott for K-12 education cuts. In a Crist TV ad praising public school teachers, the narrator says: "They don’t fly in private jets or float on fancy yachts, but the job Florida teachers do couldn’t be more valuable. And when Rick Scott cut education by over a billion dollars, thousands of them lost their jobs, class sizes went up, our kids paid the price." A visual shows a 2014 Miami Herald article that cited a $1.3 billion cut to public schools. "Why did he do it?" the ad continues. "To pay for millions in handouts to big corporations. Tax cuts here, budget cuts there. Thousands of teaching jobs gone." The ad gives no indication of when those education cuts took place, but the answer is that the $1.3 billion K-12 cut came in 2011. We have already fact-checked whether Scott cut education to pay for tax breaks; we rated it Half True. Here, we will fact-check the allegation about the consequences of the budget cut. Did thousands of teachers lose their jobs? Did class sizes go up? Teacher layoffs amid budget cuts Scott entered office in 2011 facing a $3.6 billion shortfall in the state’s $70.5 billion budget. His first budget proposal, released at a tea party rally, included steep spending cuts, including reductions in education spending. After a contentious session, the Legislature passed -- and Scott signed -- a budget that included $1.3 billion in cuts to education. The reduction ended up being about $540 per student, working out to a 7.9 percent cut in funding. (We’ve broken down some of those dollar figures before.) After he faced a backlash over the cuts, Scott went on in subsequent years to back increases to K-12 education, though his high point for per-pupil spending still lags behind the high-water mark under Crist. So did "thousands" of teachers lose their jobs as a result of the 2011 budget cuts? We found no definitive source that shows the precise number of teacher layoffs statewide. The Crist campaign points to layoffs in a single school district: Broward. The campaign cites a June 2012 Sun-Sentinel article that stated that the district "eliminated about 1,500 teachers" in 2011 -- but then was poised to add 678 positions in 2012. So that figure falls short of the "thousands" cited by the campaign. A spokeswoman for Broward schools told PolitiFact that in June 2011, a total of 1,431 annual and probationary teachers were not reappointed, but 583 were later rehired. Additionally, 117 teachers were placed on a layoff list, but 97 were rehired. That brings the total to 868 in Broward. A caveat about Broward: State budget cuts are not the only reason for the district’s budget woes. A major factor was that the county faced rapid enrollment growth followed by a decline. Though the Crist campaign only cited an article about layoffs in a single district, layoffs occurred in other counties, too, including 315 teachers in Pasco County. (In Miami-Dade, nearly all of the teachers kept their jobs, except for some temporary teachers who received poor performance reviews.) School districts report to the state Department of Education the number of teachers they have each year. That data shows that the number of teachers between the fall of 2010 and the fall of 2011 declined by 1,405, or about 1 percent. This came as the number of students was increasing by about 24,000 between the 2010-11 school year and the 2011-12 school year. By the fall of 2012, the number of teachers exceeded the 2010 level. This data doesn’t include how much of the decline was due to layoffs, retirements or terminations -- but it’s fair to assume at least some were layoffs. The initial drop of 1,405 teachers falls short of the "thousands" cited by Crist. Crist, a Democrat, and Scott, a Republican, have accused each other of causing teacher layoffs. In an ad, Scott blamed Crist for "3,000 teachers laid off" during his tenure as governor. That claim was based on a September 2009 report about possible layoffs. Scott’s ad omitted that Crist accepted federal stimulus money that preserved thousands of teacher jobs and that the Republican-controlled Legislature shared responsibility with Crist for cuts that occurred amid a national recession. We rated Scott’s claim Mostly False. Class sizes The second part of the claim about class sizes increasing due to budget cuts is tricky to evaluate because many factors shaped class sizes. Florida voters approved a class-size amendment in 2002, but the state phased it in over several years. The first year schools had to meet the rules at the classroom level was 2010-11. Until that point, class sizes were averaged schoolwide, and a 2010 referendum to keep the school averages failed. The cap limited 18 students between kindergarten and third grade, 22 in fourth to eighth grades, and 25 students in core high school classes. But changes made by the Legislature during Scott’s tenure make it less than meaningful to compare compliance rates from year to year. For example, in 2011, the Legislature reduced the number of courses under the mandate by two-thirds, only requiring core classes needed for graduation to follow the standard. In 2013, the Legislature changed the law so that districts could designate schools as "schools of choice" to get around classroom counts. That’s what Pasco did for its entire district, for instance. The Crist campaign cited only one piece of evidence on class sizes: a 2011 Miami Herald article that cited some anecdotes about very large classes in Miami-Dade, including 54 students in a college-prep world history class. According to the Florida Department of Education, here are the percentage of classes that were out of compliance: * 2010-11 (Crist) 5.48 percent * 2011-12 (Scott) 6.56 percent * 2012-13 (Scott) 4.22 percent * 2013-14 (Scott) 2.59 percent So there was a small increase -- about 1 percentage point -- from the last year of Crist to the first year of Scott. But then the numbers went back down. By December 2011, about half of the state’s school districts were in violation of the cap, including Broward and Miami-Dade and Pasco counties. Districts faced fines for violating the mandate. In Broward, more than half of the classes were not in compliance compared to a 97 percent compliance rate the year before. The Tampa Bay Times wrote that in Pasco, "shrinking local, state and federal revenue caused the board to eliminate several hundred teaching positions in order to balance the budget. The administration and board knew that could mean some classes would exceed the state caps." To get fined for such a budgetary storm is "extremely frustrating," Pasco School Board member Steve Luikart said at the time. "It's stand up and get whipped." Nearly all of Miami-Dade’s classes complied with the class size rule in 2011, but the district determined it was cheaper to pay the penalty than hire more staff to meet the cap. "It did not make economic sense at that time to comply at 100 percent," said Antonio Cotarelo, spokesman for the district. State law requires schools to be compliant regardless of funding, and the amount of funding specifically directed toward class size never decreased, according to a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Education. That means it is "pretty hard to make a direct link between less total education funding and higher class sizes," said Cheryl Etters, Department of Education spokeswoman. If the number of teachers statewide declined by 1,400 without being replaced, "it’s fair to assume that class sizes increased," said Ruth Haseman Melton, director of government relations for the Florida School Board Association. However there are a number of factors that influence class sizes, and state budget cuts are only one of them. Student enrollment is a major factor. A district may suddenly have a spike in students due to immigration or migration from other states. A district negotiating with a teachers' union might have decided to increase pay as a tradeoff for larger classes. "There are many explanations for why a district would struggle with class size one year and not the next...," Melton said. "It’s never as simple as a single sentence to explain almost anything with regard to education funding. There are always a number of factors that affect these things -- there is a not a single reason in one district or another that you could say, ‘Ah, this is the culpable element for why things went in the wrong direction.’ " We sent Crist’s claim to a spokesman for Scott’s campaign, who responded with claims promoting Scott’s track record on education funding after his first session. For example, Greg Blair pointed to "record" K-12 funding under Scott -- which is accurate in terms of the total amount but not for per pupil. Our ruling Crist said that Scott cut education by over a billion dollars, meaning thousands of teachers "lost their jobs" and "class sizes went up." The kernel of truth to this claim is that the number of teachers did decline and the percentage of classes out of class-size compliance rose in 2011. But this is outweighed by a long list of omissions -- and it doesn’t reflect Scott’s complete tenure. The first problem is it glosses over the fact that the cut took place in 2011, and was later followed by increases. In addition, it is an overstatement to suggest that "thousands" of teachers lost their jobs due to the 2011 state budget cuts. Statewide data shows the number of teachers dropped by about 1,405, but that includes departures for any reason, not just layoffs. The percentage of class sizes out of compliance with the mandate increased by about 1 percentage point between Crist’s last budget and Scott’s first budget. However, there are multiple district and state factors that influence class size and the compliance rules have repeatedly changed in recent years. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10894	"I've always voted for keeping the government open. I’ve never cast a vote to shut down the government."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/06/kevin-cramer/kevin-cramer-distorts-shutdown-record/	U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he would oppose a measure to close the government following President Donald Trump’s tweet about a possible government shutdown over immigration. Cramer, running to unseat Democrat Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, touted a clean record without any support for shutdowns. "I've always voted for keeping the government open," Cramer told Robert Port on July 31. "I’ve never cast a vote to shut down the government." We took a closer look. Actually, there’s no such thing as a formal "shutdown vote," said Steven Smith, a political science professor at Washington University. Rather, failure to pass appropriations bills by the start of a fiscal year or by the time temporary spending authority expires results in a shutdown. And Cramer has cast votes that indirectly resulted in a shutdown. The votes in question are from 2013, when Republicans in Congress fought the implementation of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act by refusing to fund it. As a minority party, Republicans didn't have the numbers to change the law, and Obama and his fellow Democrats refused to agree to gut it. Following a 16-day shutdown in October 2013, lawmakers voted to fund both the government and the Affordable Care Act. "He has voted for bills he knew would force a government shutdown because they defunded Obamacare and had absolutely no chance of passing the Senate or being signed by the president," said Josh Ryan, a political scientist at Utah State University. Essentially, Republicans would bring a bill to the floor to fund a narrow program or agency, Democrats would offer a motion to change the bill, and Republicans, including Cramer, would reject some of those. Most of these were procedural votes, and Cramer voted along party lines. There’s an element of the blame game here, too. "Sure, Republicans may have advanced a bill that would fail and shut down the government, but then again, Democrats could vote for the bill and keep the government open," said Ian Ostrander, a political science professor at Michigan State University. Cramer’s office presented the same argument. "The votes you reference were all procedural gambits to try and reopen the government that Democrats attempted to institute because they did not want to vote on the funding bills Republicans were offering, which would have funded vital parts of the government," Tim Rasmussen, Cramer’s campaign spokesman. This question is a little easier to answer when it comes to the U.S. Senate, because its rules structure allows for more obvious delaying tactics. We rated Sen. Ted Cruz’s claim he opposed a shutdown Pants on Fire, for example, because he voted against cloture (needed to break a filibuster) on a vote to fund the government. A senator can vote for cloture and still oppose the bill at hand, but by opposing even that, Cruz favored a shutdown over compromise. But with no filibuster in the House, it’s harder to disentangle policy positions from efforts to directly cause a shutdown. Our ruling Cramer said, "I've always voted for keeping the government open. I’ve never cast a vote to shut down the government." We found multiple instances where Cramer indirectly helped to cause a shutdown by voting for bills that defunded Obamacare -- these bills had no chance of survival in the Senate or of being signed by then-President Obama. While Cramer's actions were not direct votes on keeping the government open, they encouraged the 2013 shutdown. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-02694	"Forty percent of the country is going to be in states that are tolerant of gay marriage or at least civil unions."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/05/neera-tanden/head-liberal-think-tank-says-four-10-americans-liv/	There’s no denying 2013 saw a sea change for same-sex couples who sought government recognition of their relationships. Both court decisions and legislative action meant that 10 additional states recognized gay marriage. Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, speculated Dec. 29 on CNN’s State of the Union that changing views toward the gay community will continue in 2014. "This will be a wedge issue on the Republican side. I mean 10 years ago, we had Republicans pushing a federal marriage amendment in the Senate to ban gay marriage," she said. "Forty percent of the country is going to be in states that are tolerant of gay marriage or at least civil unions. And that number is only going to grow." We wanted to see if Tanden’s number — that four in 10 Americans now live in states that recognize same-sex marriage or civil unions — is accurate. We contacted the Center for American Progress to see how Tanden reached her number. They pointed us to a year-end round up from the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals. According to the organization, 38.37 percent of the population lives in states that allow same-sex marriage. (Note that this does not include civil unions, which we will address in just a bit.) That figure was released before a federal judge in December overturned a Utah ban on same-sex marriages. In the days since that decision, hundreds of gay and lesbian couples were married in Utah, though the state has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to halt further ceremonies while the ruling is appealed. Adding Utah to the mix, the Human Rights Campaign told PunditFact, would bring the total population living in states that allow gay marriage to 39.27. That was calculated by taking U.S. Census data from 2010 and comparing it with a list of states where same-sex marriage has been legalized, either through the courts or by legislative action. We wanted to double check the math ourselves. Gay marriage is now legal in 18 states — California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and Washington — plus the District of Columbia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan advocate for state legislative bodies. Civil unions or domestic partnerships between gay couples are allowed in Colorado, Nevada and Oregon. Using the most recent U.S. Census data estimates from 2013, here’s how the population breaks down in states that allow same-sex marriage or civil unions: State Population Percent of total population California 38,332,521 12.13 Colorado 5,268,367 1.67 Connecticut 3,596,367 1.14 D.C. 925,749 0.29 Delaware 646,449 0.20 Hawaii 1,404,054 0.44 Illinois 12,882,135 4.07 Iowa 3,090,416 0.98 Maine 1,328,302 0.42 Maryland 5,928,814 1.88 Massachusetts 6,692,824 2.12 Minnesota 5,420,380 1.71 Nevada 2,790,136 0.88 New Hampshire 1,323,459 0.42 New Jersey 8,899,339 2.82 New Mexico 2,085,287 0.66 New York 19,651,127 6.22 Oregon 3,930,065 1.24 Rhode Island 1,051,511 0.33 Utah 2,900,872 0.92 Vermont 626,630 0.20 Washington 6,971,406 2.21 Total 135,745,923 42.94 The total is about 43 percent. If you exclude the states that allow civil unions or domestic partnerships but not same-sex marriage, it comes out to about 39.15 percent of the population. By either measure, Tanden appears to be right. We should note that the Illinois General Assembly and the governor last year moved to legalize gay marriage in the state, but licenses won’t be available until June 2014. We also ran these numbers by opponents of same-sex marriage. Tanden’s figure was not disputed by Peter Sprigg, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council. But he said a better measure might be to compare the number of states where voters have approved ballot initiatives in opposition to same-sex marriage against states where residents voted in favor of it. Thirty states have approved constitutional amendments defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Those states make up two-thirds of the population and include California and Utah, where courts overturned voter referendums, and Colorado, Nevada and Oregon, where civil unions are legal. Only Maine, Maryland and Washington have held referendums that approved same-sex marriage laws. (We should point out that most states pass laws through the legislative branch, not via referendum.) Courts also played a heavy role in allowing gay marriage in California, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New Jersey and Utah. During her remarks, Tanden suggested that the number of individuals living in states that allow same sex marriage is "only going to grow." As recently as 2010, only seven states recognized gay marriage, comprising just 17 percent of the country. But of the 29 states that don’t allow for same-sex marriages or civil unions, 25 have constitutional amendments that define marriage as between man and a woman. Many of those amendments "require popular votes, usually alongside legislative action," to change them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. "Efforts to overturn constitutional prohibitions have begun in several states and litigation has also been initiated in several states" but the NCSL also notes "the scope for continued legislative change is limited." Our ruling Tanden said, "Forty percent of the country is going to be in states that are tolerant of gay marriage or at least civil unions." Both expert sources and independently verified statistics back up those numbers if we define "tolerant" as states where same-sex marriage or civil unions are legal. Subsequent court decisions could raise or lower that number, and opponents note many of those states allowed same-sex marriage only after court intervention. But at the time she spoke, her statement was accurate, and we rate it True.	None	Neera Tanden	None	None	None	2014-01-05T08:30:00	2013-12-29	['None']
pomt-06567	Members of the public are being charged $50 to hear Gov. Scott Walker and a dozen members of his administration talk about jobs and the economy at Lambeau Field.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/sep/30/one-wisconsin-now/one-wisconsin-now-says-gov-scott-walker-charging-p/	Gov. Scott Walker tried to take the edge off the latest dreary employment report -- issued on Sept. 16, 2011 -- by announcing a series of "job creation forums" around the state. Small, invitation-only forums were held in September in La Crosse, Milwaukee and in Green Bay. The highest profile one is a second Green Bay one, a day-long event Nov. 1 at Lambeau Field. The agenda features welcoming remarks from Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and a keynote speech at noon from the governor. The panels are made up of more than a dozen Walker Administration cabinet secretaries and appointees. Two business people -- both winners of awards from Walker’s administration -- are given slots on a panel at the end of the day. When that event was announced, some people got the impression it was an opportunity for thousands of unemployed state residents to connect with hiring employers. (When discussing unemployment, Walker frequently mentions a state web site listing thousands of job openings.) But the event isn’t aimed at helping individual unemployed people find work. It’s not a job fair. And that caught the attention of the liberal One Wisconsin Now group, which criticized the event and the admission fee. Walker is charging "the public $50 to attend a state-sponsored ‘jobs summit,’" the group said in a news release. Such pay-for-access claims have become familiar in the recent months. We looked into a similar complaint raised by the Wisconsin Democratic Party that said three Republican members of Congress were shutting down town hall meetings and charging constituents for access. we rated that claim Pants on Fire, in part because the fees in question were for Rotary lunches and other routine civic meetings and there were many other opportunities to meet with them. So, is One Wisconsin Now right about the governor’s office and the Lambeau event? Asked to support the claim, Scot Ross, executive director of the group, cited the announcements themselves. He said it looked like the public was being forced to pay for access to state officials: "They’re going to charge people to hear their ideas. How is that going to help us?" The event was characterized differently by the governor’s and lieutenant governor’s offices. Walker’s news release labeled the events "Job Creation Forums," including in Green Bay. Four days later, Kleefisch’s office announced greater detail about the Lambeau event and called it a "Small Business Summit." The Lambeau event is an opportunity for the administration to meet with business people, said Jeanne Taratino, Kleefisch’s chief of staff. She said the liberal group "misconstrued" the press releases announcing the events. "It’s not a jobs summit. It’s a small business summit," she said. "We’re not asking unemployed people to pay $50 to come to a jobs summit." She noted that there were expenses related to holding the event in meeting rooms at Lambeau (not in the stadium itself) and that breakfast and lunch were included. Tarantino said the administration hopes about 200 people will attend. The Lambeau event is open to all and those interested in attending can register on the web site of the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority. "We’ll take all comers," Tarantino said. "But it’s like every conference -- there’s a targeted audience." The breakout sessions will include comments from each cabinet secretary and than a chance for attendees to ask questions "about issues of importance to small businesses," she said. For example, a business owner might "have a problem with an audit," and want to know "how you can get an answer in a timely fashion," she said. Walker held smaller scale "jobs forums" in La Crosse on Sept. 22, 2011 and Milwaukee Sept. 27, and Green Bay Sept. 29. Those were two-hour, invitation only events, with no charge. In the case of the Milwaukee and Green Bay events they were announced one day in advance and did not appear to break much new ground. At the La Crosse forum, Walker was told that improvement to the local job market hinges on "limiting regulations and developing a skilled workforce," according to the La Crosse Tribune. Two employers -- the owner of a screen printing shop and a builder -- said that younger workers often lacked proper training and motivation. Our conclusion One Wisconsin Now claimed the Walker administration is charging people to hear elected and appointed officials talk about jobs and the economy in a day-long event in Green Bay. They are. But you also get to visit Lambeau (at least the meeting rooms) have two meals and listen to a lot of speeches. Then again, you could get yourself invited to one of the smaller events. Or you could send an email or make a call to the state’s jobs "hotline" (1-855-854-JOBS) -- for free. But the statement was limited to the Lambeau Field event. We rate it True.

pomt-01816	There are fewer wars, there are fewer people dying in wars "now than there have been in quite some time."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/21/stu-burguiere/fewer-wars-fewer-people-dying-wars-now-quite-some/	Armed conflict has been in the news this year: Syria, Iraq, Ukraine-Russia, and now Israel-Palestine. But on July 15’s Glenn Beck Program, head writer Stu Burguiere suggested that on the whole, the modern world is particularly peaceful. A caller got Beck gushing on the United States’ decision to bomb Nagasaki and Hiroshima to bring about the end of World War II and the effectiveness of nuclear deterrence. "I love that it’s probably stopped a war between the United States and Russia," Beck said. "We had a cold war instead of a hot war because we both knew, oh, if you push that button I’ll push that button." Beck put the number of lives saved by the nuclear bomb at potentially "hundreds of millions." Burguiere chimed in, acknowledging that nuclear weapons are still plenty dangerous. Even so, he continued, "so far, I don’t think you can look at it as anything other than a positive." "Violence around the world is dropping. There are less wars, there are less people dying in wars than there have been in quite some time. It’s odd to think about, but it’s true." With violence making newspapers’ front page almost every day, we were surprised enough to check: Are the number of wars and the number of deaths from wars on the downswing? The big picture Burguiere was a little vague with his time frame, so we’re going to start broad and zoom in. Compared to prehistoric, pre-state, and even Medieval man, Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker argues, the world has become incredibly peaceful. "Violence has been in decline for thousands of years," Pinker said in the Wall Street Journal, "and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in the existence of our species." "The rate of documented direct deaths from political violence (war, terrorism, genocide and militias) in the past decade is an unprecedented few hundredths of a percentage point." In his book, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, Pinker attributes our species’ decline in violence to the creation of states, trade interests, the Enlightenment and the dearth of major interstate war since World War II. It’s worth noting that even though rates of violence are down, the exponential increase in population means that the absolute number of violent crimes and deaths every year is nowhere near an all-time low. "Think about the vast loss of life in World War II," said Robert Epstein, professor of psychology at the University of the South Pacific. Epstein compared violent deaths to AIDS insofar as both were causes of death that were strictly behavioral. "If we use the same logic with, let’s say malaria or polio or any other cause of death, that relatively speaking we’re doing better, I don’t think a lot of people would accept that. They’d want to know, is it possible to eradicate that." Battle deaths After World War II -- and after the nuclear bombings Beck and Burguiere were discussing -- both the absolute number of direct deaths from war and the per capita rate of direct deaths dropped. Battle deaths are difficult to pin down precisely, but the Uppsala Conflict Data Program puts the number of battle deaths in 2013 at about 30,000. According to the Peace Research Institute Oslo, which produced the graph above, there were between 557,000 and 851,000 battle deaths in 1950, the highest since the end of World War II. Despite some peaks and troughs, there have been fewer battle deaths over the last decade than any other 10-year average since World War II. "The number of people killed in wars is close to its lowest point since 1946," Pinker said. "There was a slight uptick in 2012, and I expect it will continue to rise a bit in 2013 and 2014 because of Syria and Iraq, but not nearly enough to bring us to the levels seen during the Chinese Civil War, Korea, Vietnam, India/Pakistan/Bangladesh, Iran-Iraq, USSR-Afghanistan, and the many now-quiescent regions of Africa." The experts we spoke to generally understood deaths due to war to mean direct battle deaths, as applying a consistent standard to war deaths outside of battle is difficult. "Direct deaths are the only ones that can be counted with confidence," wrote Pinker in Better Angels. By most measures, war deaths are lower now than they’ve been for most of the post-World War II period, even as burgeoning conflicts in the Middle East have driven the number of battle deaths up in 2012 and 2013. Defining war Burguiere said fewer people today are dying in wars, but what constitutes a war is somewhat up for debate. The definition of war that most political scientists use is a conflict with at least 1,000 battle casualties in a year, according to Joshua Goldstein, author of Winning the War on War. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program -- which Goldstein called "the expert on battle deaths" -- refer to conflicts that kill 25-999 people as "armed conflicts," not wars. "Interstate wars, between regular armies, have dropped to zero currently and have become much less frequent and also shorter over recent decades," Goldstein said. He acknowledged, though, that "the world has slipped backward a bit in the last 5 years, mostly because of the war in Syria." Armed conflicts have also seen a slight dip in recent years, although they’ve generally risen in frequency since World War II, even as they’ve become less fatal. There are other ways, though, to define war. Mark Harrison, in his paper "Frequency of Wars," took an inclusive definition of war that includes even displays of force between countries. Based on this definition, as the number of countries has increased from less than 50 in 1870 to more than 180 today, the number of wars has also steadily increased. "One way to think about this could be the difference between fire and friction," Harrison said. "Burguiere says there are fewer fires and fire deaths, and this is true. Our work shows that there is increasing friction." Pinker, Goldstein and Harrison all attributed the decrease in major armed conflict to factors other than nuclear deterrence, although they acknowledged it’s an open debate. In Winning the War on War, Goldstein attributes the decline to the United Nation’s international peacekeeping and the fall of Communism, and in Better Angels, Pinker points out that Democratic countries have never fought in a war against each other. Neither, too, have capitalist countries. Commerce is "a game in which everybody can win," Pinker said. "Though the relationship today between America and China is far from warm, we are unlikely to declare war on them or visa versa. Morality aside, they make too much of our stuff, and we owe them too much money." Our ruling In the course of praising nuclear deterrence, Burguiere said, "there are less wars, there are less people dying in wars than there have been in quite some time." According to the most common definition of war -- an armed conflict with more than 1,000 battle deaths annually -- Burguiere is right, although other definitions exist. Battle deaths are also down since World War II. However, they have begun creeping up in the last couple of years, mostly because of the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. The record when it comes to "people dying in wars" generally is less clear, as is the role of nuclear deterrence.

pomt-08983	Dan Gelber's employment by BP's law firm "could disqualify him from representing Florida against BP as Attorney General."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/jul/15/dave-aronberg/dan-gelber-and-his-ties-bp-questioned-opponent/	If Florida winds up suing BP over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, a newly elected Attorney General Dan Gelber may have to sit the case out, according to his rival for the Democratic nomination. Dave Aronberg says that Gelber could be disqualified from representing the state in a case against BP because the private law firm he worked for until recently, Akerman Senterfitt, signed BP as a client in oil spill matters. The relationship between BP, Akerman Senterfitt and Gelber could create a conflict of interest too big for a judge to ignore, Aronberg says. "As one of the leading critics of BP, you will never have to worry which side I'm on," Aronberg, a state senator from Greenacres, wrote in an e-mail to supporters. "Our next Attorney General needs to be the people's attorney -- and not the polluter's attorney. "I'm not angry at my opponent. He and I served in the legislature together. The fact remains, however, that his employment by BP's law firm could disqualify him from representing Florida against BP as Attorney General." The accusation is significant, especially in a down-ballot state primary featuring candidates who have few policy disagreements. But is it true? First, the germane facts. Gelber was indeed an "of counsel" lawyer for Akerman Senterfitt, working in the Litigation Practice Group in the firm's Miami office (Akerman also has Florida offices in Fort Lauderdale, Tallahassee, Tampa and West Palm Beach, and is Florida's largest law firm). And Akerman Senterfitt was hired to represent BP in all of its Florida civil litigation. The two events -- Gelber's work for Akerman, and Akerman's relationship with BP -- overlapped for at least about a month. We don't know exactly when BP hired Akerman, and an Akerman spokesman didn't return our call for comment, but it happened before May 24. We'll explain how we know that in a second. Gelber, meanwhile, announced he was resigning from the firm in an e-mail on June 24. (Read it here). The e-mail says Gelber planned on leaving the firm in early July, but Gelber said his resignation became official by June 28. So Gelber was a lawyer for a firm representing BP for about a month. Now the question is would that by itself disqualify him from handling a case against BP as attorney general? Florida Bar rules The Florida Bar sets quite specific rules for determining conflicts of interest. The bar, in rule 4-1.9, says that a lawyer who has formerly represented a client cannot "represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person's interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed consent." Another rule deals more specifically with public officers, which Gelber would be if elected attorney general. Bar rule 4-1.11 says that a lawyer currently serving as a public officer or employee cannot "participate in a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially while in private practice or nongovernmental employment, unless the appropriate government agency gives its informed consent." Aronberg pointed us to additional bar regulations (4-1.10) that say that a firm of lawyers is essentially one lawyer for purposes of the rules governing loyalty to the client. There are all kinds of buzz words there for us to ferret out. In one sense, the key is whether Gelber represented BP, in another it's whether he participated personally and substantially. Looking at it another way, it's crucial perhaps to know what work Akerman did for BP in the month that Gelber was still employed at the firm. We asked Gelber, a state Senator from Miami Beach, to explain his role in any litigation related to BP. "Everything I heard about it, I read through the newspaper," Gelber said. Q: Were you part of any privileged conversations? A: No. Q: Did you see any privileged or confidential material? A: No. "I can list all the things I didn't know, but the easiest thing to say is that I knew nothing," Gelber said. To his point, Gelber said he didn't even have a conversation with his supervisors after learning that BP retained Akerman. He didn't want to ask when BP hired Akerman. He didn't want to ask why no one told him. He just didn't want to ask. There's also the matter of a letter written by another state legislator and Akerman lawyer, Alex Villalobos, specifically requesting Villalobos, Gelber and other Akerman lawyers who are also members of the state Legislature not be part of the BP litigation or privy to any BP information. That letter was written on May 24, the first record of BP being represented by Akerman Senterfitt. "We specifically request that we remain walled off and isolated from any discussions, documents or activities of any kind between the firm and BP," Villalobos wrote in a letter that was copied to Gelber. (Gelber says that he actually didn't see a copy of the Villalobos letter until weeks after it was written). Legal opinions With all that in mind, we turned to a cadre of legal experts to see if there is or could be a conflict. Most thought it would be difficult to have Gelber removed. "It seems to be quite unlikely," said John Steele, who runs the Legal Ethics Forum and has taught legal ethics classes at Stanford, University of California-Berkeley, Santa Clara, and Indiana University. "The devil is in details we probably don't have access to and never will." It's not enough, in most cases, for a judge to declare a conflict simply because Gelber worked for a firm for one month that simultaneously did work on BP's behalf. The question, Steele said, is did Gelber hear something in the halls of Akerman Senterfitt, or see an e-mail that might make BP uncomfortable should he sit as an opposing counsel. Also, Steele said, BP would have to raise the objection to have Gelber disqualified. Trying to get Florida's attorney general tossed off the case could have damaging political impacts for BP, Steele notes. Three other law professors we spoke with -- W. Bradley Wendell, a professor at Cornell Law School, Stephen Gillers, the Crystal Eastman Professor of Law at the New York University School of Law and Roberta K. Flowers, Wm. Reece Smith, Jr. Distinguished Professor at the Stetson College of Law -- agreed with Steele's assessment. "The claim is false," said Gillers. "If Gelber did not do work for BP on the spill while at the firm, Florida conflict rules, and those in all U.S. jurisdictions, permit him to represent the state against BP as Attorney General." Added Wendell: "Lawyers, ironically, are sometimes not very knowledgeable about the law governing lawyers." Yet other lawyers we talked to focused on Aronberg's use of the word "could" in describing Gelber's potential conflict. "I do feel comfortable saying that his statement is potentially true, depending on the existence of certain facts," said Andrew Perlman, a professor at Suffolk University Law School. (We should note that Perlman is an acquaintance of Aronberg's from law school. PolitiFact Florida contacted him through the Legal Ethics Forum, however, and without knowing of his relationship with Aronberg.) Richard W. Painter, the S. Walter Richey Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota Law School, said "the ball is in Gelber's court to establish that he would not be disqualified under the Florida rule, for example because he had no access to confidential information from BP about the oil spill." "I didn't just willy-nilly make this up," said Aronberg, who said he spoke with Antonacci and former state Attorney General Richard Doran about Gelber's potential conflict. "And there's a reason I said 'could.' We don't know, this is a complicated thing and only a judge can make the final decision." Our ruling Legal experts and law professors are clear that for Gelber to ever be removed in a case against BP, he needs to have had access to confidential information while working at Akerman Senterfitt. Put another way, it's not enough that he worked at Akerman for a month or so while the firm represented BP to disqualify him from pursuing a case against the oil giant. What evidence is there that Gelber received confidential or privileged information? None. We couldn't find it. Neither could Aronberg. Nor has it been reported somewhere else. That brings us to Aronberg's use of the word "could" in his claim -- Dan Gelber's employment by BP’s law firm "could disqualify him from representing Florida against BP as Attorney General." We have to acknowledge that anything is possible. New information could come to light significantly tying Gelber to the BP case, and that indeed could lead to his disqualification. But it isn't here yet, and in the absence of that information, Aronberg's claim sounds more like a scare tactic than rooted in some finding of fact. We rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15001	Says Republican Rep. Charlie Dent wants to kick the Freedom Caucus out of the Republican conference "for voting our conscience."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/11/dave-brat/understanding-freedom-caucus-divide-house-republic/	Encapsulating the divide and chaos in the GOP, the conservative who defeated former Majority Leader Eric Cantor and a moderate Republican duked it out on NBC’s Meet the Press. Following Cantor’s defeat and John Boehner’s announcement that he would step down as speaker, the insurgent wing of the party claimed their third victory when California Rep. Kevin McCarthy withdrew from the race to replace Boehner. Republicans, however, have yet to agree on a new leader as the infighting continues. Rep. David Brat of Virginia, Cantor’s replacement and a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, blasted the establishment for caving to Democrats and President Barack Obama, while Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Penn., expressed frustration that the hard right refuses to govern. ("A pox on both your wings!" chimed in conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.) Here’s a part of their Oct. 11 exchange: Brat: "I follow the American people. Charlie here wants us to follow, like a caucus or whatever. He wants to kick us out of our conference for voting our conscience." Dent: "I don’t want to do that." Brat: "You’re on the record last week saying it." CROSSTALK Brat: "I’ve got quotes. ..." Dent: "That’s an outrageous thing to say." Brat: "No, it’s absolutely true." Dent: "That’s not true." Brat: "You said we ‘need to be punished,’ end quotes." Dent: "No, I said we should marginalize people who don’t want to govern." We were curious about Brat’s claim that Dent wants to give the Freedom Caucus the boot. "Members of Congress should be able to vote their conscience and cast a vote that represents their constituencies without fear of retribution or political punishment," Jack Minor, Brat’s spokesperson, told us. To prove Brat’s point, Minor sent us a few examples of Dent criticizing the insurgent conservatives, as well as articles in which anonymous sources say leadership allies and members of the Tuesday Group — an informal caucus of moderate Republicans led by Dent — are considering excommunication. But that’s not the same thing as Dent saying "on the record" that he wants to kick the Freedom Caucus out of the conference for "voting their conscience" or that they "need to be punished." Dent told us he never made such a statement, but suggested Brat may have been confusing him with California Rep. Devin Nunes, a Republican and Boehner and McCarthy ally. "I would strongly encourage those who don’t want to be part of a caucus structure in our own party — they should go form their own party," Nunes told Breitbart. Dent, for his part, said he’s never endorsed that position. "I don’t think that’s a good idea. My view on this is you have to work around them," Dent told us in an interview. "I have said the leadership should try to marginalize those individuals, not by excommunicating them or by punishing them. You negotiate a bipartisan agreement and you make them less relevant. That’s what we’ve done." The record supports Dent. We searched three databases — Lexis Nexis, CQ and Google News — and couldn’t find any instance of Dent saying he wants to expel or punish the Freedom Caucus. That doesn’t mean Dent is a fan of the Freedom Caucus. He repeatedly calls them "rejectionists" and calls for the party to marginalize them and not "appease" their "unreasonable demands." He said they "fragged" Boehner and McCarthy. And he insinuated that they’re part of the reason why Republicans "don't have 218 votes for a bathroom break." Here’s a round-up of comments made by Dent this past week: • Oct. 9 News Max: "The Freedom Caucus, typically, does represent the more rejectionist wing of the party." • Oct. 9 CNN: "The Freedom Caucus has used tactics that I believe have undermined conservative principles. • Oct. 9 CNN: "What I've said all along is simply marginalize those members up front. Go out and negotiate your -- negotiate what you have to negotiate just like we did on the Medicare reimbursement to physicians, the SGR." • Oct. 8 MSNBC: "We also have the Freedom Caucus. ... I said before John Boehner stepped down, the same people who are trying to take down John Boehner were gonna try to frag the next guy. And that’s what happened today. • Oct. 8 CNN: "In my view, sometime to marginalize those members, you know, who don't want to be part of the governing majority. … And I don't think that any of our leaders should make accommodations to those who are going to make unreasonable demands." • Oct. 8 MSNBC: "Same members who wanted to take down John Boehner just fragged Kevin McCarthy. … Whoever’s going to be the next speaker should not appease this group of rejectionists, who have no interest in governing. They can simply not get to yes. The perfect will always be the enemy of the good to them, so we just have to deal with the reality as it is." • Oct. 8 NPR: "I mean, it was pretty clear there were a group of members — some said as many as 50 — you know, who were not going to support (McCarthy) on the House floor. … The same thing could happen for speaker, where we may need to assemble a bipartisan coalition to elect the next speaker." • Oct. 6 Rolling Stone: "There are a lot of folks in our conference who have a very difficult time getting to 'yes' on anything. ... On any issue of great consequence around here, we on the Republican side don't have 218 votes for a bathroom break! So we always need a bipartisan coalition." So it’s clear that there’s no love lost between Dent and the Freedom Caucus, but Brat takes the claim a bit too far, an expert told us. "Mr. Brat exaggerates what Mr. Dent said, as he doesn't literally advocate ‘kicking them out’ of the Republican conference," said Kathleen Kendall, a professor of political communication at the University of Maryland. "This exchange between Reps. Brat and Dent illustrated the sharp divide between two wings of the Republicans in the House." Despite his differences with the Freedom Caucus, Dent told us he wants the party to be open to everybody and he doesn't object to people "voting their conscience," as Brat put it. He noted, however, that Freedom Caucus members "talk a big game" as they sometimes side with Democrats as part of their obstructionist tactics. "Yes of course they should be able to vote their conscience," he said. "I understand conscience votes — I get that, I understand and respect it. But some point that seems to me that you want to be part of a governing majority or you don’t." Our ruling Brat said, Republicans like Dent want to kick the Freedom Caucus out of the Republican conference "for voting our conscience." Dent is critical of the Freedom Caucus but he told us he does not want to excommunicate them, nor could we find evidence that he’s expressed the desire to in the past. Brat may have been getting his moderate Republicans mixed up. It was Rep. Devin Nunes who suggested on the record that dissatisfied hardliners form their own party. We rate Brat’s claim False. Editor’s note: Shortly after we published the story, we received additional information from Brat’s spokesperson that we have added to the story. Brat's office also challenged our hearing of part of his back-and-forth with Dent. As such, we've removed a portion of Brat's quote in this fact-check. The changes do not affect our ruling. Here is a statement sent from Brat's office: "In Congressman Brat’s exchange with Congressman Dent, he clearly did not use the foul language that PolitiFact insisted but said, 'I’ve got quote for days.' "PolitiFact has engaged in the fabrication of a quote that Brat did not say. It discredits their entire publication and demonstrates that they are not in the business of publishing facts, but publishing false partisan attacks. It is dishonest, disgraceful and shameful. "On Sunday afternoon, the office was given only a few hours to refute a falsehood and a political attack. After sending 6 references supporting the statements of Congressman Brat, PolitiFact insisted that the references were not enough to support the claims and chose not to highlight them appropriately. "It is disappointing to see these actions out of a publication that claims to seek the truth."	None	Dave Brat	None	None	None	2015-10-11T17:00:46	2015-10-11	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-06564	Says the private sector in Texas created 1 million jobs over the past decade.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/sep/30/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-private-sector-texas-created-1-mil/	On the CNBC morning show Squawk Box, Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry made a claim on Texas job growth that sounded a lot like something we’ve checked before, with a twist. Noting that Perry has said on the campaign trail that government doesn't create jobs, interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin told the Texas governor that over Perry's 10-plus years as governor, his state's total number of government jobs had increased 19 percent, while the private sector saw only a 9 percent bump. "How do you square that circle?" Sorkin asked. Perry responded: "Well, our teachers in Texas are public employees, so we've had a huge influx of people into the state of Texas, so you have to have more teachers obviously to do that as well. But the private sector job creation over the last … 10 years has been 1 million jobs created, while this country lost 2.5 million. So we square that rather well with the rest of the country." Perry made a similar claim about Texas job gains during the Sept 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Reagan presidential library in California, although he didn't say he was talking specifically about the private sector. "When you look at what we have done over the last decade, we created 1 million jobs in the state of Texas," Perry said. "At the same time, America lost 2.5 million." We rated that Perry claim Half True. His figures — on the change in job numbers between December 2000, when Perry took office, and July 2011 — basically held up, but his statement had weaknesses. For instance, more than 20 states enjoyed net job gains over the same period, so the governor of any one of them could make a similar boast, leaving the misimpression that only his or her state gained jobs while the rest of the country lost jobs. For example, using the Perry campaign's methodology, Alaska created 43,700 jobs during Perry's time in the governor's office while the rest of America lost 1.4 million. Also, the Texas economy was rocking before Perry became governor. And, generally, many are skeptical about how much influence governors have over their state's economy. For this article, we wondered whether the roughly 1 million net increase in jobs in Texas during Perry's tenure all occurred in the private sector, as Perry told Sorkin. Precisely, the number of jobs in Texas increased by nearly 1.1 million between December 2000 and July 2011. In the period, government sector employment grew by 286,000, according to federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data and agency economist Cheryl Abbot. The BLS data on government workers contains federal, state and local employees, including postal workers but excluding military personnel. The Texas breakdown: Federal government: Increase of 19,900 jobs State government: Increase of 51,000 Local government: Increase of 215,100 Private industry was responsible for the rest of the state's net increase in jobs, or about 790,000 positions, 73 percent of the total. According to the BLS data, the private sectors that experienced job increases during the 128-month period were education and health services (404,900 increase), categories that do not sweep in jobs in public schools or hospitals; leisure and hospitality (215,200); professional and business services (196,800); trade, transportation and utilities (107,300); mining and logging (99,200); financial activities (57,500); construction (17,600); and other (18,400). Two sectors saw job decreases: manufacturing (233,400 drop) and information (91,100). Our ruling Perry cited a figure for private-sector jobs that he's previously used to describe total employment gains. That could lead close followers of his campaign with the misimpression that nearly all the job gains were in the private sector. To the contrary, government jobs represented about 27 percent of the total. But even though Perry was off by 200,000, he was in the neighborhood on his million-jobs statement. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-09-30T19:26:30	2011-09-29	['Texas']

pomt-02090	"At the mere request from Putin, President Obama withdrew the plans for a missile defense program based in Poland and the Czech Republic."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/19/dick-cheney/cheney-mere-request-putin-obama-ditched-eastern-eu/	As the unstable situation in Ukraine continues, former Vice President Dick Cheney was asked Sunday what he thought of President Barack Obama’s handling of Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. Cheney said Putin has taken advantage of what he sees as weakness in Obama, and that Obama had sent the wrong signals as early as 2009. "At the mere request from Putin, President Obama withdrew the plans for a missile defense program based in Poland and the Czech Republic," Cheney said on Fox News Sunday. Here, we’re fact-checking whether Obama withdrew plans for a missile defense program at Putin’s request. The Bush plan In 2006, on advice from Defense Secretary Robert Gates, President George W. Bush pushed for an initiative to install 10 interceptor missiles on the ground in Poland and an advanced radar system in the Czech Republic, to counter the potential threat of long-range missiles from Iran. Russia did not like the idea one bit. Russian defense minister Sergei Ivanov told the Russian news organization Ria Novosti that Russia was opposed and that the plans did not make "political sense, much less military sense." During the 2008 election, candidate Obama said he supported the installations in Poland and the Czech Republic but also said he was open to rethinking them. When Obama took office in 2009, he spoke of making U.S. relations with Russia less confrontational. The symbol of this was a photo-op of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presenting her Russian counterpart with a "reset" button. Three years after Bush announced his missile defense proposal, Obama changed course. On Sept. 17, 2009, Obama announced that the United States would pursue a new missile defense policy focused on knocking out short- and medium-range Iranian missiles. The new plan relied on missiles based on American warships and eventually sites closer to Iran. The response at home and overseas Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, released statements suggesting that Obama was being soft and letting down American allies. Pundits like John Bolton, whom Bush had appointed as ambassador to the United Nations, said Russia and Iran came away as "big winners" in a "bad day for American national security." Meanwhile, Israel and most NATO countries in Western Europe approved of the move, news stories show, because they thought the missile system provoked Russia. Polish and Czech leaders expressed disappointment. Obama left it to Defense Secretary Robert Gates to explain the shift. In a New York Times op-ed, and later in his 2014 book Duty, Gates said that Defense Department officials realized the Iranian government was putting more stock into building short- and medium-range missiles over long-range ones. The agency wanted to uproot the old plan to better counteract that threat, and the new tactic Gates and the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to Obama was cheaper and took less time to implement. Lance Janda, chairman of the Department of History and Government at Cameron University, added that the full U.S. strategy included deploying potentially hundreds of interceptor missiles in Eastern Europe starting in 2018. Lost in the GOP fury, Gates wrote, was that the Russians found Obama’s new approach to be even more worrisome than the Bush-era plan. They worried that those missiles could easily be configured to thwart them as well as Iran. Our ruling Cheney said Obama dropped a missile defense plan based in Poland and the Czech Republic on the "mere request" of Putin. While Putin strenuously objected to the plan, a Pentagon reassessment of the nature of Iran’s capabilities was the actual reason for the change. The Pentagon saw a greater danger from Iranian short-and-medium-range missiles than the long range missiles that were targeted in the original plan. NATO allies and Israel also favored the new approach, which included steps to install a missile defense system in Poland in 2018. So, Obama did forgo the Bush-era plan, but he didn’t do it at the "mere request" of Putin. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-04839	Says Josh Mandel bet against Ohio families	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/14/workers-voice/workers-voice-ad-says-josh-mandel-bet-against-ohio/	It is time for some basic finance: When interest rates rise, Treasury bond prices fall. We could go on (buy low, sell high, etc.) but there is only one more financial fact you really need to know for purposes of understanding a new ad attacking Ohio Treasurer and U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel. That fact is that at some point during 2011, a trust that invests for the benefit of his wife, Ilana Shafran Mandel, held shares in an exchange traded fund that deals in Treasury bonds. That investment now is being used by a group called Workers’ Voice, affiliated with the AFL-CIO, to claim that Josh Mandel was "betting against Ohio families." To understand the attack, you must understand the investment. This fund, or ETF, is not a traditional ETF (a fund that in many ways is similar to a mutual fund) that buys and sells stocks and bonds and performs with the ups and downs of the market. Rather, this ETF, called ProShares Ultra 20+ Year Treasury, deals in long-term Treasury bonds in a manner that acts as a hedge against falling Treasury bond prices. It is a "short" fund, in financial parlance, and it performs inversely to the regular market for Treasuries. When prices on Treasuries fall, the value of this ETF goes up. You could say that it bets on falling Treasury prices. Put another way, it is betting on rising interest rates. But if you wanted to criticize a politician, you might say, as Workers’ Voice did in an ad appearing on cleveland.com (the website affiliated with The Plain Dealer) and other newspaper websites, that this ETF was betting on a government default. After all, if the government couldn’t pay its bills, the value of its bonds would dive and this ETF could soar. That, however, is an extreme and hypothetical example. Workers’ Voice didn’t put it exactly that way, but it made clear that is what it meant. Its ad said that "The more your family struggles, the more money Josh Mandel stands to make." Its rationale, explained in a link it provided for readers, was that by investing in this ETF, Mandel, through his wife, was betting on the government defaulting on its obligations. The ad’s sponsor suggested that this was especially egregious because Mandel wasn’t just any investor but was, rather, a potential driver on the road to default. Although it is not known precisely when Mandel’s wife bought or, perhaps, sold this ETF, it is known that in August 2011, Mandel stated that he opposed a congressional bill (which passed) to raise the government’s debt limit. A higher debt limit was necessary to borrow more money and keep the government operating. Without it, the government might have defaulted on some obligations, likely devaluing formerly iron-clad government investments such as Treasury bonds. In a default, the government might stop providing some services to Ohio families. Put these together and you get a portrait of a candidate who, if elected to the Senate, would let the potential of a personal windfall stand in the way of doing the right thing for the country, or so the ad implies strongly. That’s a powerful claim, so PolitiFact Ohio asked AFL-CIO/Workers’ Voice spokesman Michael Gillis for its basis. Gillis pointed us to an article, which is also linked prominently in the Ohio ad, that appears on the website of Think Progress, an arm of the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund. The web article, dated July 27, 2012, was headlined, "Exclusive: GOP Senate Nominee Shorting U.S. Treasury Bonds, Would Profit from Default." The article noted that a trust that invests for the benefit of Ilana Mandel, called the JMS Trust, owned shares in this ProShares short ETF during 2011. According to a financial disclosure form filed by Josh Mandel last November and cited by Think Progress, the JMS Trust owned between $1,001 and $15,000 of this fund. On a different page, the financial disclosure form listed what appeared to be an additional investment in this ETF, also held by the trust, worth less than $1,001. The Think Progress article stated, "If a default were to occur, the desirability of Treasury bills would plummet and Mandel’s ETF would skyrocket in value. That precise scenario could become more likely if Mandel wins his race against Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH). One of the top issues Mandel lists on his website is to ‘Stop increasing the debt ceiling.’ Similarly, when Congress was embroiled in the debt ceiling fight last year, he stated that he ‘would have voted against the debt deal’ that narrowly staved off a default." At least in theory, this single part of the claim -- that Treasury bills would be less desirable and the ETF’s value would rise if the government defaulted -- is accurate. Yet that scenario is unlikely, and it oversimplifies the reason people invest in this ETF. Consider that the government has never defaulted. Yet people keep investing in this ETF, according to financial websites including Morningstar and Bloomberg, and did so even when default wasn’t in the public vocabulary. In fact, it appears to PolitiFact Ohio, based on a more recent financial disclosure filed by Josh Mandel in May 2012, that Ilana Mandel’s trust bought even more shares of this ETF -- up to an additional $15,000 worth -- even after the threat of default passed. ProShares declined to comment to PolitiFact Ohio, but it makes clear that this ETF is not an investment for amateurs. Investment advisers and active investors buy its shares as a hedge against changes in interest rates, a gamble referred to in columns and blogs that cover high-stakes finance. ProShares recommends in its marketing and disclosure materials that investors watch this fund daily, as it is subject to volatility. It is not a casual buy-and-hold investment. Ilana Mandel is not a professional investor. According to Josh Mandel’s financial disclosure and his campaign spokeswoman, Nicole Sizemore, the ETF and other investments are owned through the JMS Trust. When those trust assets are put together with her husband’s far more meager holdings, the couple’s worth runs in a range between $1.95 million and $7.1 million, according to financial disclosure filings. Ilana Mandel inherited the money; her grandmother was a founder of Forest City Enterprises, the real estate and development company. "Neither Josh nor his wife have control over Ilana's family's trust so neither of them are making any investment activity decisions on it," Sizemore said. "These decisions are made by the investment manager and presumably the trustees who oversee her family's trust." Josh Mandel has steadfastly refused to discuss his wife’s holdings, other than to report what is required by disclosure rules for public officials and candidates. His campaign said it was unable to discern why the investment manager or trustees bought this particular ETF but reiterated that neither Josh nor Ilana Mandel had a role in it. As noted in a number of financial blogs and columns, other investors buy shares in this ETF as a hedge against rising interest rates. Not being investment professionals, however, PolitiFact Ohio turned to Jack Bao, an assistant professor of finance at Ohio State University and an authority on bonds. "I guess that if the government did default, the short ETF would rise in value," Bao said when we told him of the Workers’ Voice scenario. But that is extremely unlikely, he said, adding that other options might have been possible to avoid default, such as printing more money, even if Congress had not raised the debt ceiling. "To believe that somebody was buying $15,000 worth of a short ETF and betting on the government defaulting seems a little far-fetched to me," Bao said. What happens in most cases, he said, is the investor buys this ETF as a bet on interest rates. He or she thinks they’ll go up and the value of Treasuries will go down -- but not necessarily tank. Before we rule on the Workers’’ Voice claim, it’s important to point out that Mandel never said he wanted the government to default. Like a number of other Republicans, he said that government spending needed to come down before Congress raised the debt ceiling. By playing this game of chicken, some Republicans said they hoped to force a more frugal solution that fell short of default. Democrats cobbled together a big enough coalition to raise the debt limit anyway. Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman joined them. The storm blew over. That leaves us with an extreme claim -- that Mandel was betting against Ohio families and hoping to fatten his family wallet. While we cannot say why his wife’s trust chose that particular ETF, we know that investors have plenty of rationales besides betting on default. In fact, Bao, the OSU professor, disclosed that he too invested in a short Treasury ETF. We realized that he and Ilana Mandel’s investment adviser had chosen, in fact, the very same ProShares ETF. So an OSU finance professor was betting on default, too? " I wasn’t betting on the government defaulting," Boa said. "I was betting on interest rates going up." In all the world’s possibilities, default was one. In probabilities, it was not. As we noted, the JMS Trust appeared to buy additional shares of this ETF subsequent to last August’s debt-ceiling showdown. That’s an additional factor that makes the ad’s claim -- that Mandel was betting against Ohio families -- far-fetched. The claim relies on one extreme possibility -- a possibility that has never occurred -- and runs with it, ignoring the other reasons why a trust fund or even a finance professor might choose this investment. That’s just ridiculous. Pants on Fire!	None	Workers' Voice	None	None	None	2012-08-14T06:00:00	2012-08-08	['Ohio', 'Josh_Mandel']

pomt-09759	"There's no evidence anywhere that offshore drilling has hurt tourism in any area where it has been allowed."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/05/barney-bishop/offshore-oil-drilling-has-cost-tourism-industry-st/	A leading advocate for oil drilling off the west coast of Florida is making his case by saying drilling has never been bad for tourism. Ever. "There's no evidence anywhere that offshore drilling has hurt tourism in any area where it has been allowed," said Barney Bishop, president of Associated Industries of Florida, a statewide business lobbying group. "High energy costs and high unemployment kill tourism more than anything. Without affordable gas, we can't get tourists to Florida." Can oil and tourism mix? Bishop's statement is focused on offshore drilling and not spills in general. It's an important distinction. Large-scale oil spills are more likely to be caused by tanker and barge crashes, not offshore drilling, according to the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. So while Florida beaches and tourism were affected by a three-barge collision that sent 330,000 gallons of oil and jet fuel into Tampa Bay area waters in 1993, it wasn't as a direct result of offshore drilling. To get to the root of Bishop's claim, then, offshore oil drilling itself has to be the culprit. The record there is thin, but not bare. An oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico 600 miles south of the Texas coastline malfunctioned in June 1979, sending oil pouring into gulf waters. According to estimates, the well, called Ixtoc 1, spewed 3.3 million barrels of oil before being capped in March 1980. The oil traveled north to soil 200 miles of Texas beach. Did that spill, one of the worst in history, hurt Texas tourism? "Sure it did," said Tony Amos, a research associate at the University of Texas at Austin Marine Science Institute. "Because vast amounts of tar came up on our beaches." Private groups and people connected with the tourist trade filed more than $300 million in lawsuits after the Ixtoc spill, saying the damage cost them that much in business, according to a 1980 Associated Press article. On South Padre Island, the mayor at the time, Glenn McGehee, said the spill cost his area $15 million. After the spill was cleaned up, the island's tourism bureau spent $200,000 on a new ad campaign: "Come on down, the coast is clear." Tourism in other parts of south Texas was reported down anywhere from 30 to 60 percent, according to newspaper accounts, and several communities said they lost millions of dollars as a result from the spill. And a 1982 study conducted for the U.S. Interior Department found that Texas beaches in the South Padre Island area lost tourism revenues between $3.98 million and $4.44 million. "The Ixtoc well spill pretty much shut down tourism," said F. Charles Lamphear, a retired University of Nebraska at Lincoln professor who co-authored the 1982 study. Lamphear did point out that some of the losses were offset by cleanup-related funding. Another oft-discussed incident, a 1969 oil drilling accident off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif., also affected tourism in that community, according to Santa Barbara County officials. The U.S. Coast Guard estimated that 100,000 barrels of crude oil spilled during the accident. "The tourist industry suffered in 1969; however, tourism recovered in subsequent years," county officials in Santa Barbara write on their government Web site. "A class-action lawsuit awarded nearly $6.5 million to owners of beachfront homes, apartments, hotels and motels." A public relations firm representing Bishop provided a six-page brief to PolitiFact to support his comments. The brief acknowledges direct impacts on tourism, but calls them somewhat rare and short-lived. One synopsis of a study of the Santa Barbara spill notes that the region lost "only" $3.15 million in recreational activity dollars. In 2008 dollars, that translates to almost $18.5 million. Another study said that while losses by beachfront businesses in Santa Barbara may have suffered, other businesses farther inland benefited. Using superlatives and absolutes might make for the best sound bite, but it also makes it more difficult to be right. Bishop said, "There's no evidence anywhere that offshore drilling has hurt tourism in any area where it has been allowed,” and the record shows otherwise. Though infrequent, incidents of offshore drilling directly and adversely affecting an area's tourist economy do exist. For that, we rate Bishop's statement False.

pomt-08324	Blames Mike McIntyre and Nancy Pelosi for the second straight year of no cost-of-living increases for Social Security beneficiaries.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/29/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-targets-mike-mcintyre-over-social-security/	Scaring voters about what could happen to Social Security if your opponent wins the election is a time-honored tradition in political ads, especially when Democrats are making the accusation. But in something of a twist, the National Republican Congressional Committee -- the campaign arm of House Republicans -- is using Social Security as a cudgel against a Democrat, seven-term Rep. Mike McIntyre of North Carolina. Here's the transcript of the ad: Narrator: "Mike McIntyre and Nancy Pelosi are not being honest with North Carolina seniors." McIntyre: "I'll never risk your Social Security." Narrator. "But McIntyre and Pelosi's big spending is robbing our Social Security trust fund. Social Security is billions in debt, and this year will be operating in the red. And now for the second year in a row, there's no cost-of-living increase for North Carolina seniors. Mike McIntyre and Nancy Pelosi: Their spending is putting our Social Security at risk." We've written at some length about the question of whether Social Security is "billions in debt" and "operating in the red." So this time, we thought we'd tackle the notion that McIntyre and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. -- the ad's boogeyman and boogeywoman -- are responsible for the fact that "for the second year in a row, there's no cost-of-living increase for North Carolina seniors." We'll begin by pointing out that North Carolina seniors aren't alone in this fate. Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, are calculated on a national basis, not by individual state. But how are they calculated? Here's the long answer. Until 1975, it took an act of Congress to adjust Social Security payments for inflation. But a law enacted in 1972 and signed by President Richard Nixon created a formula to automatically calculate the increase every year. The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment was tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The government compares that index in the third quarter (July, August and September) of the current year to the third quarter of the previous year. Until recently, every year since the formula was put into effect, that calculation led to a cost-of-living increase. In fact, high oil prices in the summer of 2008 helped produce a sizable COLA increase in January 2009 of 5.8 percent -- the highest increase in more than a quarter century. But lower energy prices and the effects of the recession combined to reduce the CPI-W during the period used to calculate the 2010 Social Security increase. So in a break with tradition, there was no upward adjustment for Social Security recipients for this year. When we last looked at this question in January 2010, we reported that for someone with a $3,054 monthly benefit -- a comparatively generous amount, based on what a steady earner at the maximum level would get every month if he or she had retired in 2009 at age 70 -- the amount forgone this year was $1,099 over the course of the year compared to what would have been added with a 3 percent cost-of-living adjustment. Most recipients would take a much smaller hit, according to Social Security Administration tables. And earlier this month, the Social Security Administration announced that there will be no increase for Social Security recipients in 2011, either. So the ad is correct that Social Security beneficiaries will go without an inflation bump for the second straight year. But that's not the whole story. First, there may not be an increase in benefits for next year, but it's because on the whole, seniors' cost of living isn't increasing. (That's the idea anyway; individual circumstances can and do vary.) And beneficiaries had already received a big bump for 2009. If current patterns hold, seniors should finally be due for a new bump in benefits for 2012. Second, some people contributing to Social Security will actually benefit from not having a Social Security increase. When benefits don't go up, neither does the $106,800 limit on earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax. Third -- and most important for analyzing the ad -- McIntyre and Pelosi had nothing at all to do with eliminating the COLA for 2010 and 2011. As we indicated, whether or not Social Security hands out an increase is determined by a mathematical calculation -- not by Congressional prerogative. Short of changing the decades-old law, there's nothing McIntyre or Pelosi could have done to provide beneficiaries with an increase in either of the two years. However, there's one more factor worth noting. Pelosi and other Democrats have proposed giving seniors a one-time $250 payment in lieu of a cost-of-living adjustment, as was done after the first non-COLA announcement. But nothing g can be done until after the election. It is this proposal that the NRCC uses to back up the claim. In an interview, an NRCC spokesman argued that the proposed COLA "fixes" may not win passage because of recklessly large spending by Congressional Democrats. The NRCC has a point, but Pelosi's office says that a vote is planned for November, and in any case, it strikes us as a bit of a convoluted explanation for the ad's claim. The simpler explanation -- and the one that we think most viewers would take away from the ad -- is that McIntyre and Pelosi had something directly to do with eliminating a cost-of-living increase for two consecutive years in the first place. Even though the ad carefully avoids an explicit accusation that McIntyre and Pelosi voted to eliminate the COLA, we think the ad implies otherwise. So we rate this part of the ad Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08162	"The American people spoke pretty loudly. They said stop all the looming tax hikes...."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/02/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-american-people-spoke-pretty-lou/	The Jan. 1, 2011, expiration of George W. Bush's tax cuts is approaching, and the parties are working feverishly to win public support for their position. Republicans have taken a firm stance in favor of extending the tax cuts for everyone, while President Barack Obama and many congressional Democrats want to extend them only for families earning less than $250,000. Following a Dec. 1, 2010, meeting between congressional Republican leaders and newly elected Republican governors, Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, who is poised to become House speaker early next year, said the Democrats were out of touch with public opinion. "I don't know what my colleagues across the aisle didn't hear during the election -- the American people spoke pretty loudly," Boehner said. "They said stop all the looming tax hikes and to cut spending." Our friends at NBC's First Read noticed a discrepancy between Boehner's comment and national exit poll data. "Actually," First Read wrote, "here’s what the public said about the Bush tax cuts, according to the exit polls last month: 40 percent said to continue ALL of the cuts, 36 percent said to continue them for families who earn less than $250,000 a year, and an additional 15 percent said to expire them for all. So a majority -- 51 percent -- backed either the Democratic position or wants all the cuts to expire." We thought we'd expand upon First Read's research and look at additional polls. We found four taken since the election that address the question of what to do with the expiring Bush tax cuts. (We're keeping the focus narrow by not addressing the question of whether the American people support spending cuts; we found a wide variety of different questions on that issue in these polls, making it a harder question to gauge.) Here are the questions on the Bush tax cuts in each survey: USA Today/Gallup poll, Nov. 19-21, 2010 What do you think Congress should do about the income tax cuts passed under George W. Bush that are set to expire at the end of this year? Keep the tax cuts for all Americans regardless of income: 40 percent Keep the tax cuts but set new limits on how much of wealthy Americans' income is eligible for the lower rates: 44 percent Allow the tax cuts to expire: 13 percent A follow-up question clarified where Americans would draw that income line, using some widely discussed income thresholds. Keep tax cuts for all: 40 percent Keep tax cuts up to $1 million income: 5 percent Keep tax cuts up to $500,000 income: 12 percent Keep tax cuts up to $250,000 income: 26 percent Let tax cuts expire: 13 percent Associated Press-CNBC poll, Nov. 18-22, 2010 The tax cuts that were passed in 2001 will expire this year if they are not continued. Which of the following best describes what you think Congress should do about the tax cuts? Continue the tax cuts for everyone: 34 percent Allow the tax cuts for people earning more than $250,000 to expire, but continue them for other people: 50 percent Allow the tax cuts to expire for everyone: 14 percent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, Nov. 11-15, 2010 Congress will soon decide whether to keep in place the existing tax cuts enacted during President Bush’s time in office, or allow them to expire. Which one of the following options would be your preference for what they should do? Keep in place the tax cuts for everyone permanently: 23 percent Keep in place all the tax cuts for everyone for another year to three years: 23 percent Eliminate the tax cuts for those earning more than $250,000 per year, but keep them for those earning less than that: 39 percent Eliminate all the tax cuts permanently: 10 percent Quinnipiac poll, Nov. 8-15, 2010 How should Congress vote on the Bush-era tax cuts: continue them for all, continue them only for families who earn less than $250,000 a year, or let them expire for all? Continue for all: 35 percent Continue for those below $250,000: 43 percent Expire for all: 14 percent How about if this was the choice on tax cuts; continue them for all, continue them only for families who earn less than $500,000 a year, or let them expire for all? Continue for all: 33 percent Continue for those below $500,000: 40 percent Expire for all: 18 percent While each poll asked the question with slight variations, some general patterns emerge. It's true that overwhelming majorities favor extending some of the tax cuts -- greater than 80 percent in every poll. But Boehner said Americans want to "stop all the looming tax hikes," and the polls don't support such a sweeping claim. The percentage of people who favor extending the tax cuts for every income level -- which is the formulation Boehner used in his comment -- ranges from 23 percent to 40 percent. That is quite a bit short of a majority. More important for our analysis, in the three of these polls that asked the question the same way, Boehner's position didn't even achieve a plurality from poll respondents. Instead, the highest level of support for any specific course of action was actually the Obama position -- extending tax cuts for those below $250,000 and not for those above that line. Support for this position ranged from 39 percent to 50 percent. When pollsters widened the range of policy options, the pattern broke down somewhat. In the USA Today/Gallup poll, for instance, a significant minority of those who favored an income cutoff for the tax cut extension wanted that cutoff to be higher than Obama's preferred $250,000. And when NBC/Wall Street Journal pollsters asked about a instituting a temporary tax-cut extension for another one to three years -- a widely discussed compromise option for the White House and Congress -- it won the support of about one-quarter of poll respondents. Still, the general pattern we see in these polls is that Americans are more likely to side with the Obama position than with the Republican position, though neither view won a clear majority. When we contacted Boehner's office, a spokesman said that the poll results were shaped by the wording. "The question should be, 'Do you think taxes should go up on January 1?'" the spokesman said. "In the real world, if I make the same salary next year and I pay more taxes, that’s a tax hike. If I pay less, that’s a tax cut." We don't doubt the results would have been more favorable to the GOP position if the wording had been changed, but we're not convinced by that argument. It is not an all or nothing choice. In fact, it's a choice between Democrats who propose letting the tax cuts expire for those earning more than $250,000, and Republicans who want to extend the cuts for everyone. The wording in the polls seems like a perfectly accurate reflection of those options. So we find that Boehner is wrong to claim the public supports his position. The polls show that while many Americans oppose an across-the-board expiration of the Bush tax cuts, it is not accurate to say the public spoke "pretty loudly" that Congress should "stop all the looming tax hikes." A plurality of the "American people" actually support what amounts to a tax hike for the wealthiest Americans. So we rate Boehner's comment False.

pomt-13807	"Hillary Clinton is for open borders."	false	/florida/statements/2016/jul/18/rudy-giuliani/rudy-giuliani-wrongly-says-hillary-clinton-open-bo/	Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended Donald Trump’s plan to secure the border and said that Hillary Clinton would take the opposite approach. "You know Donald Trump will secure our borders," Giuliani said at the Republican convention July 18. "His opponent has had her chance to do this, and she has failed. Hillary Clinton is for open borders." Claiming that Clinton would create "open borders" suggests she would allow undocumented immigrants to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries. That’s not what Clinton has proposed. Clinton supported legislation in 2013 that included a path to citizenship (with conditions) and heightened border security. However, some experts argue that "open borders" doesn't necessarily mean no enforcement at all, but rather making it far easier for undocumented immigrants to stay here. Clinton does want to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants, but that’s not the same as getting rid of enforcement or allowing people to enter and leave the United States without border control. We were unable to locate a Giuliani spokesperson Monday night. Clinton’s proposal Clinton and Trump have taken vastly different approaches on immigration, although they have both said they favor secure borders. During this campaign, Clinton has called for addressing immigration laws including a path to citizenship within her first 100 days. But she has also called for protecting borders and deporting criminals or those who pose threats. "We need to secure our borders. I’m for it, I voted for it, I believe in it, and we also need to deal with the families, the workers who are here, who have made contributions, and their children," she said in November. "We can do more to secure our border, and we should do more to deal with the 11 or 12 million people who are here, get them out of the shadows." This is pretty consistent with her view as a New York senator and secretary of state. In her 2014 book Hard Choices, Clinton praised the 2013 immigration bill co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of senators including Marco Rubio of Florida. That bill included billions for border enforcement over a decade for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. That bill passed the Senate but never reached a vote in the House. Clinton’s immigration platform does not amount to open borders, Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, previously told PolitiFact Florida when we fact-checked a similar claim by Trump that we rated False. Open borders existed before 1875, when there were no federal restrictions on emigrating to the country, he said. The United States had immigration restrictions from 1875 to 1924 without a border patrol, which was created in 1924. It’s wrong to conflate "open borders" with anything less than perfect enforcement of immigration laws, he said. It’s also wrong to "claim Clinton is for open borders while she has also supported massive increases in border security to better enforce our restrictive immigration laws." But Clinton has said she wants to limit deportations to violent criminals, not deport children and end raids and round-ups and go further than President Barack Obama for DREAMers and their parents if legally possible — although that is in legal limbo after the U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked. That greatly expands who could avoid deportation in a Clinton White House. Those policies amount to less enforcement to supporters of reduced immigration, including Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, and Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA. Beck has told PolitiFact that the term "open borders" is imprecise. However, if undocumented immigrants can "stay as long as you don’t commit a violent crime, that is pretty close to open borders. You don’t have to give amnesty -- you can just not have a threat of deportation, and it allows people to stay." Our ruling Giuliani said, "Hillary Clinton is for open borders." Clinton supported a 2013 bill that would have invested billions in border security in addition to a path to citizenship. As a presidential candidate she has called for securing the border and targeting deportation to criminals and those who pose security threats. While her plan would make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to avoid deportation, that’s not the same as allowing a free-for-all at the border and ending enforcement.

pomt-11586	"We have the highest graduation rate of basketball players in the history of the NCAA. We have the highest graduation rate of African-American basketball players in the history of the NCAA in basketball."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/01/john-calipari/college-basketball-graduation-rate-all-time-high-j/	College basketball has been in the midst of soul-searching since federal investigators uncovered an alleged black market for top high school prospects and college players. The federal probe into bribery and corruption, which led to 10 arrests in 2017, raised fresh questions about a system where young men generate billions in television and marketing revenues but are prohibited from being paid. The NCAA — college sports’ regulatory body — has long maintained that compensating players would undermine its goal of placing education ahead of athletics. "In the collegiate model of sports," the NCAA states, "the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first, athletes second." In theory here’s the basic bargain: College athletes, especially Division I football and men’s basketball players, collectively form a highly profitable commercial enterprise, and in exchange they receive a quality education. In a recent interview, John Calipari, who coaches the powerhouse University of Kentucky men’s basketball team, defended the NCAA model by emphasizing that student-athletes are earning college degrees at historically high rates. "I go back to this: We have the highest graduation rate of basketball players in the history of the NCAA," Calipari said during a Jan. 20 broadcast of ESPN's College Gameday. "We have the highest graduation rate of African-American basketball players in the history of the NCAA in basketball." The NCAA's official numbers back up Calipari's claim, but those numbers are manipulated to make graduation rates appear more positive. Meanwhile, a debate rages about whether college basketball players get a quality education from the current system, or if academics for big-time athletes are a distant priority. Not historic highs based on federal data One of the ways the NCAA monitors the academic outcomes of college athletes is by looking at the graduation data colleges report each year to the federal government. In general, a graduation rate is found by taking the number of graduates in a cohort and dividing it by the total number of students in that cohort. The federal graduation rate for the 2014-17 cohort of Division I men’s basketball players is 47 percent, according to the NCAA’s 2017 report. That’s just shy of the 48 percent rate of the 2001-04 cohort. The NCAA did not respond to our request for a broad sample of its federal dataset. But we found six NCAA reports of Division I men’s basketball graduation rates from the last 14 years. The eight years for which we were unable to find data are left blank in the chart below. According to the available data, the rate appears to have been stagnant for some time. It’s also not the highest it’s ever been. All-time highs under NCAA’s ‘graduation success rate’ An aide to Calipari indicated that the coach based his claim on a different measurement known as the "graduation success rate" — an alternative formula developed by the NCAA. The NCAA’s model differs significantly from the federal graduation rate, and paints a sharply contrasting portrait of student-athletes’ academic achievement. Specifically, the two measurements take very different approaches to students who leave school before graduating. Under the federal formula, when a student leaves college for any reason they are counted negatively against a school’s graduation rate. That’s the case even if the student ultimately transfers and graduates from another college. The NCAA has long complained the federal calculation understates the true graduation rate of athletes, and that it takes an overly rigid approach to its handling of transfer students. "It only measures persistence at a student’s first school when approximately one-third of all students nationwide transfer at some point in college," said Meghan Durham, an assistant director of public and media relations at the NCAA. The NCAA’s formula makes an entirely different accounting of students who leave school before graduating. Student-athletes who leave in poor academic standing (typically below a 2.0 grade-point average) are counted negatively against a school’s graduation rate. But players who leave school in good academic standing are simply removed from the NCAA’s graduation rate calculation. Because of their good academic standing, this latter group is considered still eligible to play college sports at the time they leave school, hence they’re referred to as "left eligibles" in NCAA parlance. In effect, when left eligibles depart college for any number of reasons — whether to pursue an NBA career, or because they were cut from a team and lost their scholarship — the NCAA simply drops them from their graduation rate tally. "They are treated as neither a success nor a failure but rather as if they were never in that school’s cohort," reads an NCAA explainer titled "Why the GSR is a Better Methodology." For its part, the NCAA says its treatment of left eligibles is fair. According to the NCAA’s estimate, the vast majority end up transferring elsewhere. But watchdogs note the NCAA does not track left eligibles after they leave school, so their academic outcomes are unknown, including the number of college dropouts who never graduate. While the NCAA does include incoming transfers in its graduation rate, this number is consistently far below the number who leave. "Thus, the NCAA system is not held accountable for a significant number of recruited athletes," wrote the authors of a recent article titled "The Hoax of NCAA Graduation Rates." "Even for those included in the GSR cohort as transfers, the original recruiting school is absolved of responsibility for failing to retain them." Using its alternative measure, the NCAA’s rates are currently at all-time highs for Division I men's basketball (82 percent) and African-American players in particular (78 percent), since this accounting method was introduced in 2002. "In the sport of men’s basketball, the overall rate increased 2 percentage points to 82 percent. The rates for African-American student-athletes in the sport rose 1 percentage points to 78," the NCAA wrote in its latest graduation trends report. "Both of these rates represent all-time highs." Woody Eckard, an economics professor at the University of Colorado Denver and an expert on student-athlete graduation data, said the steep climb of the NCAA’s rate could be the result of more left eligibles, instead of an actual graduation rate increase. But so long as the NCAA's data is not publically available, he said, this hypothesis cannot be tested. Issues with both models Eckard said both the federal and NCAA models have a flawed approach to players who leave before graduating. The federal rate understates the true graduation rate, because it effectively assumes none of the athletes who leave school before graduating will transfer and graduate from another school. But the NCAA’s formula makes the opposite error, he said. "The federal rate undershoots, and the NCAA’s rate overshoots," he said. "The truth lies somewhere in the middle, between the two." Richard Southall heads up the University of South Carolina’s College Sport Research Institute, one of the more vocal critics of the NCAA’s graduation success rate. He contends the NCAA inflates graduation rates by removing left eligibles, or "eligible dropouts," from its calculation. "If you remove all the eligible dropouts, who else is left in your athlete graduation cohort? Really those who make it to their senior year," Southall said. "If the sample — after removing these eligible-dropouts/transfers — only includes athletes who make it to their senior year, then the ‘graduation success rate’ really measures how many athletes left school ineligible or flunked out, which should not be very many." Eckard and Southall are among several NCAA critics who say the graduation success rate was engineered to deflect public scrutiny of consistently low federal graduation rates among Division I football and men’s basketball players. In 1984, for example, the graduation rate of men’s basketball overall was 38 percent, and 29 percent for African-American male players, which clashed with the NCAA’s preferred image as an institution with a dedicated educational mission. "Athletes were increasingly viewed as commercial chattel, whose value was based on their ability to produce revenue for universities and provide entertainment for fans," Eckard, Southall and Gerry Gurney of the University of Oklahoma wrote in their article "The Hoax of NCAA Graduation Rates." In response to mounting pressure, the authors argue, the NCAA launched a decades-long rebranding strategy to discredit federal graduation rates while holding up its own graduation success rate as a superior methodology. "More likely, however, the NCAA’s rates are ‘alternative facts’ (i.e., propaganda) designed to obfuscate its members’ exploitation of their most valuable assets: big-time football and men’s basketball players, and deflect attention from a shameful litany of academic-fraud scandals," the authors wrote. Another metric paints a different picture The College Sport Research Institute proposed its own model for tracking the academic outcomes of student-athletes. Their formula is based on federal data, but differs from the federal graduation rate in one significant way. The federal formula lumps together full-time students and part-time students. This causes trouble when comparing the graduation rate of the student body as a whole to that of a cohort of student-athletes, because virtually all athletes are full-time students. Take the NCAA’s latest report on Division I graduation trends, for example. It suggests black male basketball players graduated at a 9 percent higher rate than the African-American male student population at large. But the College Sport Research Institute’s formula paints a very different picture. Their calculation, known as the adjusted graduation gap, filters out part-time students, which they say allows a more accurate comparison of full-time students to their full-time student-athlete peers. While this data doesn’t exactly contradict the NCAA, it certainly tells another story. The institute’s most recent data shows graduation rates for men’s Division I basketball players lag behind those of full-time male students, with African-American players showing substantial gaps. In major conferences, the full-time all-male graduation rate was 78 percent. The rate for African-Americans was 41 percent, a 37 percentage point gap. (Major conferences include the American Athletic, Atlantic 10, Atlantic Coast, Big 12, Big East, Big Ten, Conference USA, Mountain West, Pacific-12, and Southeastern conferences.) Southall said the biggest gaps exist at schools in the "Power Five" conferences (the Atlantic Coast, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and Southeastern ), which he described as the "premier academic and athletic conferences." He noted that it’s easy to overlook that athletes in big-time sports programs are essentially working full-time jobs — spending 40 hours a week or more on their sport — while also trying to go to school full-time at rigorous academic universities. "The NCAA was aware of the problem in the late 1980s," Southall said. "But instead of addressing the problem, they created the ‘graduation success rate’ to rebrand academic success." ‘Eligibility is not education’ Critics say a singular focus on graduation rates masks serious concerns about the quality of education players receive. Mark S. Nagel, a professor of sport and entertainment at the University of South Carolina, said schools with big-time sports programs commonly make less rigorous classes available to athletes. "To keep the athlete’s mind focused almost exclusively on sports, easier classes and majors are selected, and ‘friendly faculty’ are targeted," Nagel said. "There is no doubt that in the age of ‘graduation means everything,’ many schools have ‘easy’ paths to graduate." Academic advisers are often assigned to make sure athletes who play on revenue-generating teams remain eligible, and in some cases advising turns into "doing the work for the athlete," said Nagel, who is an associate director at the College Sport Research Institute. "Most advisers are not evaluated by the post-college enrollment outcomes for former players; they are evaluated on if the current athletes are eligible to compete," he said. "In theory, having these academic resources for athletes is helpful, but it can easily spin out of control." At the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, for example, around 1,500 athletes were enrolled in and got credit for so-called "phantom classes" between 1993 and 2011. According to a report the university released in 2014 following an internal review, the classes "had played a large role in keeping underprepared and/or unmotivated players eligible to play." When schools funnel athletes into easier majors and classes in order to keep them eligible, their graduation rates exaggerate the educational value their athletes received, said Eckard of University of Colorado Denver. "I worked in college athletics for years and many ‘graduated’ without requisite skills and many could barely read — but they stayed eligible," said B. David Ridpath, professor of sports business at Ohio University. "Eligibility is not education." Ridpath is a member of the Drake Group, an NCAA watchdog, which has called on big-time sports programs to disclose student-athletes’ entrance exam scores, majors, professors, advisers and post-graduation employment. "Considering most institutions guard these things like state secrets and claim privacy, I don’t think what Calipari is saying is remotely close to the truth," Ridpath said. Not everyone believes academic skullduggery at big-time sports schools is a problem, at least when it comes to college athletes bound for the pros. "Some students, especially elite athletes, are not interested in an education," said Warren K. Zola, a professor at Boston College University and sports law expert. "Rather, they use the NCAA or their institution as a means by which they can play in the NBA." "If one accepts the premise that the purpose of college is to help students enter the workforce," he added, "then students who play for one year and then progress into the NBA could be considered a success." But a relatively small share of college athletes end up going pro. Some argue that to the extent there’s exploitation in college basketball, the vast majority of cases cut in favor of schools and against players, particularly African-Americans. "It’s simple," said Victor Kidd, a doctoral student who works with Southall and Nagel at the University of South Carolina. "Black players are being taken advantage of. Period." Maureen Weston, co-director of the Entertainment Media & Sports Law Program and a law professor at Pepperdine University, said schools are under intense pressure to track grades, academic progress and graduation success rates. But she believes most schools are diligent about educating student-athletes, even if some fall short. "My experience with student athletes in the classroom is excellent," she said. "I’m convinced the discipline it takes to excel at sports transfers to the classroom in most cases." "But the pressures to win and meet standards with jobs and funding on the line can cause temptations to fudge numbers," she added. Our ruling Calipari said, "I go back to this: We have the highest graduation rate of basketball players in the history of the NCAA. We have the highest graduation rate of African-American basketball players in the history of the NCAA in basketball." According to available data, the federal graduation rate appears to have been stagnant for some time. It’s also not the highest it’s ever been. The NCAA’s own formula shows remarkable growth in graduation rates since 2002 when its metric was introduced. Indeed, under the NCAA’s measure, graduation rates are at an all-time high. However, experts we spoke to believe these numbers are exaggerated. Some believe the growth is due to an increase in transfer students, not a higher rate of graduates. For context, we looked at an independent metric that compares the graduation rates of full-time men’s Division I basketball players to those of other full-time students. Under this measure, student-athletes graduate at lower rates, and have lost ground to their non-athlete counterparts since 2011. Critics also note that an overemphasis on athletes’ graduation rates as a mark of academic achievement masks serious concerns about the quality of education players receive.

Now, a recycled lie that she’s on a warpath against white people is again making the rounds. "White people are so 1960’s," starts a quote attributed to Obama’s midterm speech exam. "Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that they will be blended out by the time I am 30. Imagine a world without white people." The statement appears over a picture of the eldest daughter of former President Barack Obama along with a question. "What do you think of Malia Obama’s belief that white people should not exist? 1 like = 1 arrest" One such post shared on Facebook this week has already garnered more than 100 likes, and it’s been shared more than 1,000 times on the social media platform. We found an identical Facebook post from April 6 that was shared more than 36,000 times. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no news reports that Obama made such a statement. And Harvard media relations did not respond to an email seeking comment about the claim. But back in April, PolitiFact checked a similar claim that Obama had been suspended after writing a paper imagining a "world without white people." Then, the claim merited a rating of Pants on Fire. Six months later, with the quote recirculating, the only place where we find any trace of this statement attributed to Obama continues to be on a website run by a noted purveyor of fabricated news stories: a website formerly known as AmericasLastLineofDefense.org that now appears to be housed at dailyworldupdate.us.

pomt-09049	"Georgia has the most restrictive ballot access laws in the country.”	true	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/02/mary-n/norwood-says-georgia-has-most-restrictive-ballot-a/	Mary Norwood often said during last year’s unsuccessful run for Atlanta mayor that she was not red or blue, but purple. In other words, Norwood claimed she was not a strict disciple of either the Democratic or the Republican parties. So when Norwood jumped into the race earlier this year for Fulton County Commission chairman, she decided to run as an independent. So far, her toughest battle is not with the incumbent, John Eaves, but getting on the Nov. 2 ballot. “Georgia has the most restrictive ballot access laws in the country,” Norwood, a former two-term Atlanta city councilwoman, said during a television interview Tuesday evening. That claim was too juicy for PolitiFact Georgia to resist checking out. We began by asking the Norwood camp for details. Anne Fauver, her campaign manager, explained. Georgia requires independent candidates running for countywide offices to get at least 5 percent of all registered voters eligible to vote in the last election in that jurisdiction to sign a petition supporting their placement on the ballot. “I didn’t know how restrictive it was in comparison to other states,” said Fauver, who served with Norwood on the City Council. Norwood needs about 22,700 signatures to get on the ballot. Thus far, she is “more than halfway” to her goal, Fauver said. Norwood has until July 13 to reach the magic number. Norwood has taken Eaves to court over what she calls a “hypertechnical interpretation” of the law to discount about 3,000 of the signatures she has collected. The Eaves campaign says each petition signer must write “Fulton,” along with their address, on the form. Norwood says Fulton election officials told her she could pre-type “Fulton” on the form. A judge dismissed Norwood’s complaint on this point Thursday, saying, in part, that any ruling before the deadline “would constitute an advisory opinion.” As for the 5 percent rule, we reached out to Richard Winger, the California-based editor of Ballot Access News. He has studied ballot issues for more than four decades. Winger was called a “savant” on the topic by Columbia University professor Nate Persily and “the nation’s encyclopedia on this stuff” by Capital University Law School professor Bradley Smith. “That is the toughest such law in the country,” Winger said of Georgia. Until 1943, any political party could gain across-the-board ballot access by registering a slate of officers with the secretary of state. State leaders changed the system that year, primarily to discourage Communist Party candidates from getting on the ballot, Winger said. Some Southern states also used such rules to ensure that a white candidate would win, Smith said. The laws gradually changed over the years for some offices, Winger said. Statewide independent candidates now need the signatures of 1 percent of registered voters to get on the ballot. The rules stayed the same for independent candidates seeking a municipal or countywide office, or seats in Congress or the Georgia Legislature. Why hasn’t the law changed? For some reason, Winger said, state lawmakers couldn’t agree in the 1980s on several proposed bills that would have made it easier for people to get on the ballot to potentially run against them. A bill that would have removed the requirement that independent candidates gather signatures on a petition to run for office did not pass earlier this year. Winger ranks North Carolina as having the second-most-restrictive ballot access guidelines for independent countywide candidates. The Tar Heel State requires those candidates to get the signatures of 4 percent of registered voters in the county to get on the ballot. Winger ranked Illinois as third, but it’s worth noting that state also requires independent countywide candidates to get 5 percent of the signatures of voters who cast ballots in the 2008 election. As for her claim on Georgia’s rules about ballot access, the Peach State and Illinois both have similar ballot access guidelines. Therefore, we rate Norwood’s statement as True.

pomt-02757	Says Rep. Steve Stockman "basically wants gun-filled zones in schools."	true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/13/howard-fineman/howard-fineman-steve-stockman-wants-gun-filled-sch/	Texas politics took an unexpected turn when Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman filed just before the deadline to run against incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn. Assessing the matchup of two conservative candidates, Huffington Post columnist Howard Fineman said Stockman’s world is all about guns. "This is a guy who not only doesn't want gun-free zones around schools. He basically wants gun-filled zones in schools," Fineman said on MSNBC’s All In with Chris Hayes. We decided to check Fineman’s assertion. At the start of this year, a few weeks after the Newtown, Conn., shootings, Stockman introduced the Safe Schools Act of 2013. The bill was very simple. It would repeal a federal law that bans everyone except law enforcement from bringing a weapon inside a school. The bill’s stated purpose was "to restore safety to America's schools by allowing staff, teachers, and administrators to defend the children and themselves." There is no question that Stockman envisioned more people with firearms at schools. "Stockman clearly likes that scenario," said David Kopel, an associate policy analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute and a proponent of Second Amendment rights. Where Kopel differs with Fineman’s rhetorical flourish is on the point of whether the schools would be full of guns. "When I think of a gun-filled zone, I think of a gun show or going to the annual meeting of the NRA (National Rifle Association) where you know that you are never more than 50 feet from someone with a conceal carry permit and a gun," Kopel said. So, Kopel says Fineman engaged in a bit of exaggeration. The other supporters of gun rights we reached said the whole point of Stockman’s bill was to give principals, teachers and staff the ability to defend themselves and their students. We asked Stockman’s office for evidence that more guns would yield more security and did not hear back. But Kopel and Erich Pratt, director of communications for Gun Owners of America, both pointed to the example in Pearl, Miss., where a student opened fire in 1997. An assistant principal ran out to his car where he kept a gun and successfully apprehended the shooter. Pratt also said a Centers for Disease Control study found that the number of times a gun was used defensively was much greater than the number of times a gun was used to kill someone. The actual words from the report, which was a survey of past research, were a bit more nuanced. The authors noted that there was much debate about the data and said "defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals." The report added that gun-using crime victims have lower injury rates than victims who use other defensive strategies, however it noted that we don’t know if that protective benefit outweighs the deaths and injuries associated with gun ownership in general. The gun debate is fueled by conflicting values and studies. David Hemenway, professor of health policy at Harvard School of Public Health, said he knows of no report that shows that armed civilians provide a protective factor. In his view, the evidence speaks to quite the opposite conclusion. "Studies do show that where there are more households with guns, all other things equal, there is more homicide because there is more gun homicide," Hemenway said. Our experts could not point to research on whether armed school personnel would afford the students greater safety, largely because most states don’t allow guns inside schools and episodes of gunmen opening fire in schools are rare. "It’s hard for social science to do studies of such low frequency events," Kopel said. Our ruling Fineman said that Stockman "basically wants gun-filled schools." Stockman did introduce a bill that would make it easier for states to allow school personnel to carry firearms. The bill’s stated purpose was to allow those people to defend themselves and their students from an armed intruder. Our experts agreed that Stockman’s goal was to see more firearms inside schools. We did not hear from Stockman’s office so there is no way to know if he envisioned an upper limit to that increase. Based on his bill itself, there would be none. We rate the claim True.

pomt-05141	Rhode Island has the "worst maintained bridges in the United States of America . . . and we have the second worst maintained roads [behind] Alaska."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/22/michael-chippendale/state-rep-michael-chippendale-says-rhode-island-ha/	State Rep. Michael W. Chippendale rose on the House floor earlier this month to steer his colleagues away from a bill mandating more studies before any future road projects are completed. The bill (H7352) required the state Department of Transportation -- whether it was constructing a new highway or putting in a crosswalk -- to use "complete street design principles" that considered the "mobility needs of all users." The department would then have to issue a report showing it had considered, for example, the needs of bicyclists and pedestrians "of all ages." Chippendale, a Republican from Foster, called the bill arduous and costly. He said he’d rather see the money that would go toward design studies used to improve the state’s roads, because, he said, the state has the "worst-maintained bridges in the United States of America . . . and we have the second-worst maintained roads only to Alaska." The poor condition of the state’s bridges and roads has been a focus of attention for years. Rhode Island, like many other states, just doesn’t have enough money to repair and rebuild all those needing attention. But we wondered whether we really have among the worst roads and bridges in the nation. On the House floor, Chippendale attributed his information to the National Highway Safety Association, a transportation entity we searched in vain to find. But Chippendale might be forgiven for mixing up the name, considering the multitude of groups that have weighed in on state road conditions. Among them: The Governors Highway Safety Association; the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials; the Surface Transportation Policy Project; TRIP, a private transportation research nonprofit; U.S. PIRG, the federation of state public interest research groups; the Reason Foundation -- the list goes on. All the groups use the same basic data that state highway agencies submit each year to the Federal Highway Administration on road and bridge deterioration and spending. Researchers for the groups then choose their own various criteria from the data to study and compare, to suit their objectives. When we contacted Chippendale, he acknowledged that he attributed his statement incorrectly on the House floor. He said the basis of his claim came from a report he had filed away with information from his 2010 campaign. He then e-mailed us a copy of the 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems, issued in September 2010 by the Reason Foundation, a Libertarian research group that monitors government spending and efficiency. Chippendale said he had also seen other reports, as well as newspaper stories that supported his statement. The Reason Foundation report is based on 2008 data compiled by the Federal Highway Administration. It indeed rated Rhode Island’s bridges and roads the worst overall in the country. (The state Department of Transportation doesn’t dispute the findings. It says the problem is an issue of money.) Alaska came in right behind us at 49th. (By the way, Massachusetts was ranked 44th and Connecticut, 41st. New Hampshire was the best ranked New England state, at 27.) The states that ranked best -- North Dakota and Montana, for example -- had roads that were in good condition and had small transportation budgets. The foundation reported that "Rhode Island is spending about two to three times the national average, per mile, on its state road system . . ." Other recent reports have offered similar findings about the Ocean State’s roads and bridges. In 2009, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that sets standards for road design and construction, ranked Rhode Island the third worst state in the country for "poor" roads, with only New Jersey and California having worse roads. In 2010, the consumer group U.S. PIRG, a federation of consumer activist groups from around the country, issued a report that said Rhode Island had the highest percentage of "structurally deficient" bridges (27 percent) in the country. The group, using Federal Highway Administration data, defined structurally deficient as meaning "a bridge has a major defect in its support structure or its deck is cracking and deteriorating." That percentage has since dropped to around 22 percent -- the fourth worst in the country -- because the Route 195 relocation project eliminated about a dozen of those bad bridges, a state DOT spokesman says. The findings are also in a report from Transportation For America, another coalition of road budget watchdogs. Our ruling State Rep. Michael Chippendale turned down a path familiar to Rhode Island motorists when he described the Ocean State as having the "worst maintained bridges in the United States of America" and " the second worst maintained roads only to Alaska." Rhode Island’s rankings may go up or down a few notches depending on which report you look at and what year it came out. But every one we’ve seen shows the Ocean State is clearly at the bottom when it comes to road and bridge conditions. Chippendale might have incorrectly attributed his statement on the House floor, but his figures were accurate. We rate his claim True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-13857	"More people now die in Wisconsin from drug overdoses than car crashes."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/08/brad-schimel/do-more-people-die-wisconsin-overdoses-car-crashes/	More than a month after Prince died at the age of 57, toxicology tests determined the visionary musician’s cause of death: fentanyl, a synthetic opiate up to 50 times more potent than heroin. On June 6, 2016, Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel penned a guest column in the Wisconsin State Journal connecting Prince’s overdose to the state’s opiate epidemic. He sought to end to the stigma around drug addiction — and urged people to lock up prescription painkillers in their homes. Painkillers are often the starting point for people who develop opiate addictions. "We must alter our view of opiates," Schimel wrote. "More people now die in Wisconsin from drug overdoses than car crashes." Is Schimel right that drug overdoses have not always outnumbered car accident fatalities in Wisconsin but do now? If accurate, it would strengthen his case that drug addiction has become an increasingly urgent issue. We decided to look at the numbers. Checking the figures In support of Schimel’s statement, state Department of Justice spokesman Johnny Koremenos provided a report issued in September 2015 by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. "Deaths from drug poisoning, also called ‘overdose,’ have doubled since 2004 and surpassed motor vehicle traffic deaths in 2008," the report said. The sentence doesn’t refer to the total number of deaths, but to age-adjusted death rates. That approach is used to better make comparisons across years, when the age structure of a population changes. An accompanying age-adjusted chart showed that 4 out of every 100,000 people died from a drug overdose in 1999 while 16 out of 100,000 did by 2013. The death rate from car crashes moderately declined during the same period, from around 13 out of 100,000 people to 9. Beginning in 2008, the death rate from drug overdoses surpassed the death rate from car crashes in the chart. We asked the Department of Health Services what the unadjusted numbers show. According to Jennifer Miller, spokeswoman for the Department of Health Services, 2009 was the first time that deaths from drug overdoses outnumbered deaths from car crashes in Wisconsin. And overdose deaths have outnumbered car crash deaths every year since. In 2014, the most recent year available, 843 people in Wisconsin died of drug overdoses while 558 died in car crashes. So both age-adjusted and raw numbers show that beginning in 2008 or 2009 (depending on which numbers you use) more people in Wisconsin died from drug use than from car crashes. Nationally, the total number of drug-related deaths surpassed the number of motor vehicle deaths in 2008 -- about the same time the numbers flipped in Wisconsin. Our rating Schimel said more people now die in Wisconsin from drug overdoses than car crashes. The most recent data available from 2014 supports his statement -- 2009 was the first year when more people died from drug overdoses than in car crashes.

pomt-04844	Says state Senate candidate Aaron Bean voted to give health care subsidies to illegal immigrants.	false	/florida/statements/2012/aug/13/floridians-ethics-and-truth-politics/outside-group-claims-aaron-bean-voted-give-health-/	A third-party group in the middle of an ultra-competitive Republican state Senate primary is continuing to make illegal immigration a centerpiece of the campaign. The group, Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics, is targeting former state Rep. Aaron Bean for past votes. Bean is running for a Jacksonville-area seat against current state Rep. Mike Weinstein. Previously, we looked at the claim that Bean voted for "in-state tuition breaks for illegal immigrants." We examined the facts and rated the claim Mostly True. Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics is doubling down with a different claim in a new TV ad, accusing "Mr. Bean" (a reference to the dimwitted British character played by comedian Rowan Atkinson, perhaps?) of voting to "also give health care subsidies to illegal aliens" in 2007. We decided to see if the new attack has merit. As evidence, the group cites HB 7189, a proposal considered during the 2007 legislative session about Florida KidCare, which houses federal and state subsidized health care programs for children. The goal of this bill was to fulfill a plan by now-U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who was Florida House speaker in 2007 and 2008, to expand access to health care coverage for children. (It was Idea No. 86 in his 2006 book 100 Innovative Ideas for Florida’s Future.) HB 7189 would have allowed anyone who is under 19, a Florida resident and uninsured to be enrolled in KidCare. The bill made a number of administrative tweaks to ease the application process. More pertinent to our fact-check, the bill would have expanded premium assistance to two types of children, if the Legislature appropriated money for them: children of state employees, and "noncitizens" or "not qualified aliens." The inclusion of "noncitizens" and "not qualified aliens" is the basis of the claim from Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics. But that’s in error. Non-qualified aliens and noncitizens isn’t code for "illegal immigrant." States commonly use the terms to refer to other noncitizens who are lawfully present in the U.S. Arizona’s Medicaid administration agency, for instance, breaks down three groups of noncitizens like this: qualified aliens, undocumented aliens (aka illegal immigrants), and non-qualified aliens, who are admitted legally for a limited time and include foreign students, business visitors, and temporary workers on visas. Rep. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, who sponsored the KidCare reform push in 2007 and is running for state Senate this year, told PolitiFact Florida the bill was not written to subsidize illegal immigrants’ health insurance. "Certainly the intent of the bill was not to expand KidCare to illegal aliens," Galvano said. "The thrust of the bill was ultimately to lessen the fiscal impact on the taxpayer while at the same time providing health care to those in need." Like most bills, this legislation was written without the kind of detailed rulemaking delegated to state agencies. Had the bill become law, those rules might have been more explicit so that the subsidized premiums would not apply to illegal immigrants, though they are already banned under federal law from receiving government assistance. To be fair to Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics, what "noncitizens" and "not qualified legal aliens" actually meant got lost on the Legislature as well. During debate on the House floor, Rep. Gayle Harrell, R-Port St. Lucie, introduced a late-filed, one-line amendment: "The Florida Kidcare Program shall not provide premium assistance for enrollees who are illegal aliens." Her amendment spawned impassioned, and confused, debate, with some conservatives saying undocumented children should be eligible, too. "This is not about illegal children. It’s not about legal children. It’s about children in the state of Florida," said Rep. Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah, according to a couple news accounts. Harrell did not have the support needed to bring the amendment for a floor vote. The bill passed the House 98-14, with Bean and Rubio among conservatives voting in favor (Bean, then House Healthcare Council chairman, voted for it in committee too). But drama over the amendment slowed the bill’s momentum in the final days of session, and the Senate decided not to bring the proposal to a vote. "Unfortunately, some people thought the bill would have impacted undocumented kids," said Karen Woodall, executive director of the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, who pushed for the bill in 2007. "That whole debate -- while it was in my opinion morally correct and good -- it made it seem like it was going to impact those kids, and that’s why it didn’t pass in the Senate." Our ruling Floridians for Ethics and Truth in Politics says Bean voted to give health care subsidies to illegal immigrants. The group, however, misrepresents the bill’s intent by saying "not qualified legal aliens" is the same as "illegal immigrants." That’s not true. The bottom line is HB 7189 -- which never passed -- would have applied to children legally allowed to be in the United States. We rate the claim False.

pomt-03432	Says a "rape kit" can be used to "clean out" women, "basically like" dilation and curettage.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/jun/24/jodie-laubenberg/jodie-laubenberg-says-texas-rape-kit-dilation-and-/	The lead House sponsor of legislation pitched by advocates as improving the safety of abortion clinics and restricting certain late-term abortions described kits used after sexual assaults as akin to a procedure that scrapes out tissue lining the uterus. In floor debate that would extend hours past midnight June 23, 2013, Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, R-Parker, mentioned "rape kits" after Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, presented an amendment to Senate Bill 5 to exempt victims of rape and incest from limits on abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. A day later, the GOP-majority House advanced the measure to the Senate for possible action before a 30-day special session was to end June 25. Laubenberg, responding to questions from Democratic Reps. Joseph Moody of El Paso and Dawnna Dukes of Austin, framed her refusal to accept Thompson’s amendment by implying that rape kits used in hospitals can prevent unwanted pregnancy. Laubenberg said that currently, in "the emergency rooms they have what’s called rape kits, that the woman can get cleaned out, basically like a D and C" -- dilation and curettage surgery, often performed after miscarriages. We looked into whether the representative was correct that a rape kit is akin to dilation and curettage surgery, ultimately finding no common ground or any factual basis for this claim. Dilation and curettage, according to a fact sheet on the website of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is a surgical procedure that removes tissue from the lining of the uterus; it is often performed after a miscarriage. A woman’s cervix is dilated, or widened, to permit the use of instruments such as a curette, a thin metal tool with a scoop or ring on one end that is used to scrape the interior of the uterus. The doctors’ group put us in touch with Dr. Bonnie Dattel, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Eastern Virginia Medical School, who said by phone that a D&C is sometimes performed after a miscarriage to remove material left from the pregnancy that could cause infection or excessive bleeding if left in place. In contrast, a rape kit typically consists of tools, storage containers and paperwork related to collecting evidence in the first days after a possible sexual assault, according to Texas experts we reached and information posted online by the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, which calls itself the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization. The network says: "Following a sexual assault, the victim has the option to go to the hospital to have a forensic examination by a trained professional. During a forensic medical exam, a sexual assault evidence collection kit may or may not be used. The evidence kit affords the opportunity to collect any DNA that may have been left by the suspect." The network’s web page makes no mention of surgical procedures, instead saying a kit may contain instructions, bags and sheets for evidence collection, swabs, a comb, envelopes, blood collection devices and documentation forms. An exam using the kit "will most likely begin with the examiner obtaining a complete and thorough medical history from the victim. The medical forensic exam also involves a head-to-toe physical examination, which includes the genital area," the network says. The exam may also involve the collection of blood, urine, hair and other body secretion samples; photo documentation; the collection of the victim’s clothing, especially undergarments; and the collection of any possible physical evidence that may have transferred onto the victim from the rape scene, the network says. "Once the examination is completed and all specimens are collected," the network says, "they are carefully packaged and stored to assure that they are not contaminated." In interviews, representatives of the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault, which says it’s committed to ending sexual violence in Texas, and the Collin County-based Turning Point Rape Crisis Center, which counsels rape survivors, elaborated on what a rape kit is and isn’t. TAASA spokesman Rick Gipprich said by telephone that certified sexual assault nurse examiners typically use the kits to gather information and collect relevant samples. Sometimes a pregnancy test is administered, Gipprich said, but that is solely to see if a survivor might have been pregnant before the assault. Also, he said, the pregnancy test is not part of the kit. In addition, Gipprich said, a survivor may be offered high-dose antibiotics to ward off sexually transmitted diseases as well as a "morning after" pill to prevent impregnation, though such drugs and those offers are not part of the kit, he said. Jennifer Spugnardi, director of the Turning Point center, said by telephone that a rape kit is "really papers and envelopes," reflecting the nurse examiner’s responsibility to document an incident. Spugnardi said the kits are sometimes called "Sirchie kits," referring to a forensics supplies company that sells the kits. Online, we found a photo of a $15 Sirchie kit designed to meet criteria for a kit as spelled out in a publication from the Texas attorney general’s office. Sirchie describes the kit as containing legal and medical forms, oral swabs and hair combs and containers to separately hold clothing or biological samples. Like Gipprich, Spugnardi said any prescribed medicines are not part of a rape kit. She also pointed out that a kit can be used for a female or male victim. Regardless, she said, a kit is not equivalent to the D and C surgery or related to it. Spugnardi called the legislator’s statement "a very poor choice of words." By email and telephone, we asked Laubenberg how she reached her conclusion. She didn’t immediately respond. After this article posted, however, Laubenberg said by telephone that she knows a rape kit does not include the D and C procedure and that a kit does not cause abortions. In the floor debate, Laubenberg said, she also was trying to say that a rape survivor who goes to a hospital might be offered the morning-after pill to ward off pregnancy, though she said that she is aware that the pill is not part of a rape kit. In the debate, Laubenberg said, her point may have been muddled. "You’re trying to get your thoughts out as fast as you can," she said. Our ruling Laubenberg said a rape kit is equivalent to dilation and curettage surgery. A rape kit consists of items a medical specialist employs to gather evidence related to a possible sexual assault. It is not the same as the D and C procedure, which removes the lining of the uterus. We find this unsupported claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire. UPDATE, 10:20 a.m., June 25, 2013: After this article posted, we heard back from Laubenberg.

pomt-10393	John McCain says he never supported the privatization of Social Security, even though video shows he did.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/13/democratic-national-committee/privatization-gets-personal/	Democrats jumped on a comment that Sen. John McCain made at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on June 12, 2008. "I am not for quote 'privatization of Social Security.' I never have been, never will be," McCain said in answer to a voter question. The Democratic National Committee quickly spliced that video onto file video of McCain on C-Span. "Without privatization, I don't see how you can possibly over time make sure that young Americans are able to receive Social Security benefits," he said in 2004. The 26-second spot wraps up with a photo of McCain and George W. Bush, and audio of a crowd shouting "Four more years!" Seems like an obvious flip-flop, right? Not so fast. The DNC ad truncates McCain's remarks at the 2008 town hall. The Nashua (N.H.) Telegram reported the following exchange: "Amherst Democratic activist John Mendolusky engaged McCain in a sharp but respectful exchange over Social Security reform. 'You stated you are in favor of private accounts which really is privatization of Social Security,' Mendolusky began. 'Why would you have workers risk their nest eggs on the roulette wheels of Wall Street?' 'I am not for quote "privatization" of Social Security. I never have been, never will be. That is a great buzzword for an attack,' McCain shot back. 'Workers should have the right to put their own taxes, their own money into an account. If they don't want to, don't do it.'" McCain's rejection of the word privatization goes back to President George W. Bush's 2005 push to allow workers to divert a portion of the program's payroll taxes to personal investment accounts. The thinking was that private accounts would give younger workers the ability to manage their retirement nest eggs without government interference and it would keep the system solvent. McCain supported Bush's plan, going so far as to accompany the president on a series of town hall meetings in March 2005. It was around this time that Bush and his party decided that most people didn't like the idea of "privatizing" Social Security. Pollsters found that if you didn't call Bush's plan "privatization" but instead called it "personal accounts," you could increase support for the plan significantly — even though it was the same plan. So Bush and his supporters stopped referring to the plan as privatization and started calling it "personal accounts." Bush complained that privatization was a "trick word" designed to "scare people." Hence the 2004 video of McCain talking about "privatization" contrasted with 2008 video rejecting the term. Not that the new terminology worked. Personal accounts didn't get very far legislatively, and the initiative went down as one of Bush's biggest defeats in domestic policy. So what is McCain proposing for Social Security if he's elected? We looked at this question previously and found that McCain has offered only a broad outline for the program. His Web site says he wants to supplement the current system with personal accounts but adds the accounts will not be a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept. It also notes McCain wants to work with Democrats on a Social Security plan but is prepared to go it alone if they don't want to play. The full context of McCain's comment at the town hall meeting, which the DNC was happy to leave on the cutting room floor, shows McCain thinks that voluntary personal accounts do not amount to privatization of Social Security. He reiterated that position on the campaign trail the day after the New Hampshire town hall meeting. "I will not privatize Social Security, and it's not true when I'm accused of that," McCain said. "But I would like for younger workers, younger workers only, to have an opportunity to take a few of their tax dollars, and maybe put it into an account with their name on it. That's their money. ... And we will make sure that present-day retirees, I will commit, have the benefits that they have earned." This makes answering the Democrats' implicit claim that McCain favored privatization a little tricky. On a certain level, the video speaks for itself. If by privatization you mean George Bush's plan, then McCain clearly did favor it. But Bush himself didn't like the term privatization and felt that it was misleading. McCain clearly believes he can offer personal accounts while keeping the rest of Social Security intact and rejects the privatization label. For all of these reasons, we find the DNC's claim to be Half True.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2008-06-13T00:00:00	2008-06-13	['John_McCain']
pomt-12278	Says Scott Walker recently said "he got his bald spot from hitting his head on a cabinet, and it's not a joke, he actually said that his bald spot came because he hit his head on a cabinet."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/03/mark-pocan/hairy-situation-testing-mark-pocan-claim-about-sco/	Just when you thought it was safe to move on from the 2016 presidential campaign, a topic that grabbed a brief turn in the spotlight has again come to, well, a head: Gov. Scott Walker’s explanation for his bald spot. How did it resurface? Credit -- or blame -- U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, who began by ripping into Walker’s plan to make Wisconsin the first state in the nation to require needy but able-bodied adults to work and submit to drug tests to get Medicaid coverage. On June 6, 2017, Walker’s administration asked the federal government for permission to require the tests, which would apply to people seeking coverage through the state’s BadgerCare program. "Unemployment is low, and the percentage of people working in Wisconsin is among the best in the nation," Walker said in a statement at the time. "This application is a step in the right direction, and we’re continuing to build on Wisconsin’s legacy as a leader in welfare reform." A few days later, on June 8, 2017, Pocan slammed the proposal as unoriginal during a radio interview on "The Thom Hartmann Program." He was responding to a caller -- Dave from Hoffman Estates, Ill. "This is one we’ve seen in other states," Pocan said. "It just costs money. It hasn’t been proven to find people who are using drugs who are getting the money. It’s one of these demonizing tools of the poor again." Then his policy rip, turned into this riff: "Trust me, Scott Walker has not had an original thought in his head for a long, long time," Pocan said. "The most original thing he said recently is that he got his bald spot from hitting his head on a cabinet, and it’s not a joke. He actually said his bald spot came because he hit his head on a cabinet." To be sure, Pocan has less hair than Walker. But is Pocan right? When asked for backup, Pocan spokesman David Kolovson cited a statement from a Oct. 18, 2014, Wisconsin State Journal article: "The bald spot, (Walker) said, was the result of a repair incident in the kitchen when he banged his head on an open kitchen cabinet door while making repairs requested by his wife, Tonette." Kolovson also cited a June 15, 2015, Washington Post article that quoted Walker: "And I wish I could grow a little bit more hair on my scar up there," he said, mentioning his bald spot, which he says is the result of having bumped his head while fixing a sink years ago and not natural aging. A similar statement showed up in a Sept. 4, 2015, article on BBCNews.com. Carolyn Jacob, a board certified dermatologist, said Walker’s explanation is not outside the realm of the possible. "It really depends on if he actually cut his scalp on the cabinet," said Jacob, a medical doctor and director of Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology. "A scar would form and would not grow hair." "However," Jacob continued, "if he suddenly developed a circular spot in the same area, it may be unrelated but coincidental. We often see alopecia areata (circle/patches of hair loss) on patients, and no one knows why anyone gets it." Another expert, Ronda Farah, a medical doctor and assistant professor in the Department of Dermatology at the University of Minnesota, also spoke in general terms and not directly about Walker. She said an injury or trauma to the head could cause a bald spot. "If you have trauma to the head that leaves a scar, you could definitely get a bald spot." Farah said. "In general, I have seen hair loss at areas of trauma and scarring on the body and scalp." A spokesman for Walker’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Our rating Pocan claimed Walker recently said "he got his bald spot from hitting his head on a cabinet, and it's not a joke, he actually said that his bald spot came because he hit his head on a cabinet." Walker did make that claim, but it surfaced two years ago, during the early stages of the 2016 presidential campaign. So it was not as recent as Pocan indicated. Nor was it as farfetched as he suggested, at least according to two experts on hair loss. We rate Pocan’s claim Mostly True.	None	Mark Pocan	None	None	None	2017-07-03T05:00:00	2017-06-08	['None']
pomt-02367	Says President Abraham Lincoln enforced the Fugitive Slave Act until the Civil War ended.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/18/andrew-napolitano/napolitano-lincoln-enforced-fugitive-slave-act/	Andrew Napolitano’s contrarian view of the Civil War is that it did not need to be fought. In their Daily Show debate, host Jon Stewart rejected that conclusion in the strongest terms. "If there is ever any use of federal power that is justified, would it not be to end the most horrific, abhorrent practice in the history of mankind?" Stewart asked. "After it had tried everything else," Napolitano replied. "Like abolishing the Fugitive Slave Act, which Lincoln enforced and his judges enforced and his federal marshals enforced until the Civil War was over and Lincoln was nearly dead." We are fact-checking several claims from the Civil War debate between Napolitano, a libertarian pundit and former judge, and Stewart. Here we’re looking at Napolitano’s claim that Lincoln enforced something called the Fugitive Slave Act until the Civil War was over. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 made it easier for slave owners to use the federal government to get back the people who had escaped bondage. If a person found refuge in a free state, the act expanded the number of federal officials who could order their rendition back into slavery. The act also simplified the legal steps required by the owner to prove his claim and required the state to bear any costs involved. The law was part of a package of changes designed to ease tensions over slavery known as the Compromise of 1850. It’s clear that federal officials enforced the Fugitive Slave Act before the war, but Napolitano said it continued during the war and that enforcement took place under Lincoln himself. That specific claim is oversimplified. (Napolitano did not respond to our request for comment.) The picture is a bit complicated because federal policy changed over time as Congress and Lincoln navigated through the challenges of undermining the Confederacy, keeping peace within Union border states and ending slavery. By the time Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven states had seceded but war had not yet broken out. That came a month later. Lincoln’s first inaugural address offered the slave states, a group that included states still within the Union, full enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act. Lincoln said that so long as the law was on the books, he would follow it. In a further effort to stave off war, he said "there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere." It would be difficult to overstate the importance Lincoln placed on the rule of law. In many of his writings, he expresses a keen tension between his personal values and the laws of Congress and the Constitution. When the war started, two policies emerged, one for the South and one for the North. By August 1861, Congress had passed the First Confiscation Act, which authorized Union forces to seize any slaves used by Confederate forces. Military commanders in the field, however, had different policies. Even though the Secretary of War at the time ordered officers to provide protection to slaves, some refused them sanctuary. At about the same time, escaped slaves from Maryland (a border state) and unionists living in Virginia (a Southern state) were coming into the District of Columbia. Historian Edna Greene Medford wrote that Lincoln advised local authorities to allow Virginia owners to reclaim their slaves. The marshal for the district, Ward Lamon, a close friend and Lincoln appointee, supported the policy, arguing that the Fugitive Slave Act required it. University of Massachusetts historian Manisha Sinha, who appeared alongside Stewart and Napolitano on The Daily Show, told us that Lincoln balanced a desire to end slavery with his desire to win the war. "In the first two years of the war he was willing to respect the rights of slaveholders in the border slave states simply to prevent them from seceding," Sinha said. In July 1862, Congress passed the Second Confiscation Act, which was a broader statute and allowed Union forces to shelter escaped slaves from owners in any of the Confederate states. That still left slaves in Union states at legal risk if they got away from their owners. Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation ended slavery in the Confederate states in January 1863, but it wasn’t until passage of the 13th Amendment in January 1865 that the United States abolished slavery everywhere within its borders. In June 1864, Congress repealed the Fugitive Slave Act. The Civil War ended a year later, in spring 1865. Our ruling Napolitano said Lincoln, his marshals and his judges enforced the Fugitive Slave Act until the war was over. The record is much more complicated. Lincoln and other federal officials did enforce the law in some instances in the Union states in the early part of the war but not in every state and not consistently. The policy was quite different for the Confederate states. In that same period, Lincoln’s military and Congress moved to protect slaves who escaped from Confederate owners. Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation mid-way through the war, freeing all slaves in Confederate states. Napolitano repeated the word "enforced" three times for emphasis. The record is much more mixed and certainly, Napolitano gets his dates wrong. Congress repealed the Fugitive Slave Act in 1864, a year before the war ended. The judge’s words have a sliver of accuracy but overall, we rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Andrew Napolitano	None	None	None	2014-03-18T17:19:22	2014-03-11	['None']

pomt-06509	Says he "came to the Republican Party sooner in age" than Ronald Reagan.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/11/rick-perry/perry-switched-gop-younger-age-reagan/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry wasn’t always a Republican. His opponents like to remind him of that, as Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann did in a Republican presidential primary debate at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. And Perry likes to respond that another notable Republican once had a "D" behind his name too. "I, like most people in the state of Texas and those southern states, grew up a Democrat. Michael Reagan and I were talking just the other day, Charlie, that I came to the Republican Party sooner in age than his dad, Ronald Reagan, did," Perry told debate moderator Charlie Rose on Oct. 11, 2011. Perry said something similar to conservative commentator Sean Hannity during a radio appearance in August 2011. His words then, also repeated from a conversation with the former president’s son: "I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did." PolitiFact Texas checked it out. According to biographer Edward Yager, Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, "was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21." Yager said that he hadn’t seen copies of Reagan’s voter registration cards but that "virtually all the sources that refer to" Reagan’s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat. He remained a Democrat even as he supported Republican presidential candidates, according to Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at Reagan’s presidential library. The library’s website says Reagan made the switch and registered Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51. As for Perry, born March 4, 1950, he won his first three political races for a Texas House seat as a Democrat, then switched parties in 1989 to challenge a Democratic agricultural commissioner.

pomt-03729	"Under Republican Chris Christie, New Jersey had the highest increase in unemployment in the country last year. Nearly 1 in 10 jobless. The worst unemployment in the region. Near the bottom in economic growth, yet Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires but vetoed a minimum wage hike."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/apr/14/one-new-jersey/new-anti-chris-christie-ad-democratic-group-mostly/	New Jersey’s just about gone to economic hell under Chris Christie’s leadership, a Democratic group suggests in a new TV ad. Things are so bad here that the state ranks at the top nationwide for unemployment, at the bottom for economic growth and isn’t doing a thing to help the middle class, the ad claims. "Under Republican Chris Christie, New Jersey had the highest increase in unemployment in the country last year," a narrator states in the ad by One New Jersey. "Nearly 1 in 10 jobless. The worst unemployment in the region. Near the bottom in economic growth, yet Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires but vetoed a minimum wage hike." The ad, which is also running on NJ.com, the online home of The Star-Ledger, is largely accurate. Let's review each claim. New Jersey having the ‘worst increase in unemployment’ is based on the period from December 2011 to December 2012. Let’s note that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics measures unemployment data by unemployment rates and the number of unemployed. For that period, New Jersey and New Hampshire had the highest rate increase, at 0.3 percent. New Jersey’s rate ticked upward to 9.5 percent from 9.2 percent. New Jersey wasn’t the worst, though, when looking at the number of unemployed, said Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. Pennsylvania had 24,761 unemployed. New Jersey had 21,932. New Jersey’s unemployment rate increase was the 10th highest nationwide for the period from February 2012 to this past February, Seneca said. And with New Jersey’s unemployment rate hovering above 9 percent since June 2009 – the end of the recession – it’s accurate to claim the state has nearly 1 in 10 people jobless. The state, however, has added more than 120,000 private-sector jobs, according to BLS data, Seneca and the state Republican Party. Next, did we have the ‘worst unemployment in the region?’ One New Jersey didn’t define region specifically so we compared New Jersey with New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Connecticut. New Jersey’s unemployment rate was the highest among the five states from December 2011 to December 2012, according to BLS data. The ad also claims New Jersey is near the bottom for economic growth. We previously checked a similar claim by Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D-Camden). From 2010 to 2011, New Jersey’s real gross domestic product – an inflation-adjusted measure of a state’s economy -- dropped by a half percent, placing us 47th among all states, according to data from The Bureau of Economic Analysis. So we were near the bottom, but economic experts told us for the Greenwald claim that national and regional economic conditions – not just Christie -- were factors. Now let’s look at whether Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires and vetoed a minimum wage increase. Democrats approved a bill in May 2010 renewing a one-year tax rate increase of 10.75 percent for those with taxable income above $1 million. The rate had expired before Christie became governor.. Christie, who campaigned that he wouldn’t raise taxes, vetoed the surcharge -- protecting the rich, some claim -- and Democrats couldn’t override it. As for the minimum wage claim, Christie in January vetoed a Democratic proposal raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 an hour, with future increases tied to inflation. He instead proposed phasing in a $1 increase over three years and eliminating automatic hikes. "The sad truth is New Jersey is falling further behind, and no amount of hype can hide the reality that the middle-class and working families are hurting," One New Jersey spokesman Joshua Henne said in an e-mail. "The facts clearly show New Jersey has consistently trailed the rest of America when it comes to jobs and the economy." NJGOP spokesman Ben Sparks pointed to the state's private-sector job growth under Christie. "Despite the predictably misleading claims from Barbara Buono's campaign operatives, New Jersey has created over 120,000 private-sector jobs since Governor Christie took office, which stands in stark contrast to the failed two years Barbara Buono spent as Jon Corzine's budget chair, when our state lost 240,000 private-sector jobs," Sparks said in an e-mail. Buono, (D-Middlesex), is challenging Christie in the November gubernatorial election. Our ruling One New Jersey’s new ad claims, "Under Republican Chris Christie, New Jersey had the highest increase in unemployment in the country last year. Nearly 1 in 10 jobless. The worst unemployment in the region. Near the bottom in economic growth, yet Christie protected a tax cut for millionaires but vetoed a minimum wage hike." Each claim had varying degrees of accuracy. New Jersey and New Hampshire tied for the highest increase in unemployment last year. Nearly 1 in 10 New Jerseyans are jobless, and our state’s unemployment rate is the worst in a five-state region. The state has been near the bottom in economic growth, even though experts have said that’s not entirely Christie’s fault, and the governor vetoed a minimum wage hike. Christie technically didn’t cut the millionaire’s tax since it expired before he took office, but opinions vary wildly on that claim. We rate the ad Mostly True.

pomt-05489	George Allen "voted for 40,000 earmarks."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2012/apr/18/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-claims-george-allen-voted-40000-earma/	Jamie Radtke wants to tag George Allen, the frontrunner in the June 12 Republican primary for the U.S. Senate, as a big spender. In a recent web video, Radtke’s campaign claims that Allen "voted for 40,000 earmarks" during his previous term as a senator from 2001 to 2007. Earmarks are money sent to constituents for pet projects by members of Congress. Last year, we ruled that Radtke’s claim that Allen "had 40,000 earmarks" was False. Her campaign sought to clarify her words, saying Radtke’s statement merely meant Allen had voted for that many earmarks. We did not accept their explanation and pointed out several other claims by Radtke that suggested Allen personally requested all that pork. This time around, Radtke has altered her verb and given us a new claim to check. Did Allen really vote for 40,000 earmarks during his Senate term? Chuck Hansen, a spokesman for the campaign, said the number is based on a calculation by the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonprofit group that tracks earmarks and releases annual reports of "pork projects." Allen, as a senator, voted on the budgets from fiscal years 2002 to 2006. The 2007 budget did not pass until late January of that year, a few weeks after Allen left the Senate. He was defeated the previous fall by Democrat Jim Webb. The five budgets Allen voted on included 52,319 earmarks valued at $121.8 billion, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste. Hansen said that Radtke’s campaign, seeking to be conservative in its claim, chopped off about 25 percent the Citizens’ numbers and estimated Allen voted for 40,000 earmarks valued at $90 billion. But there’s an important fact that Radtke omits: Allen did not vote on each earmark individually. They were attached to about four dozen major appropriations bills that Allen supported during his time in the Senate. Those bills authorized a total of about $4.4 trillion in discretionary spending programs -- including defense, education and justice -- and the earmarks added up to less three percent of that total. Even the watchdog groups that have criticized earmarks as wasteful don’t totally blame Allen for supporting appropriations bills that kept government operating. "If anyone against earmarks voted against appropriations bills, we wouldn’t get anything done," said Leslie Paige, media director for Citizens Against Government Waste. "We don’t think that’s very telling. We would really rather look at what the member of Congress requested in earmarks and what bills they introduced on their own." Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Allen didn’t necessarily support "each and every earmark." He cited the $225 million "Bridge to Nowhere," connecting the city of Ketchikan, Alaska, with the Island of Gravina, which has 50 residents. Allen voted for a $286.5 billion highway and transportation bill in 2005 that funded the bridge. Later that year, he got a chance vote specifically on the earmark, when a measure came up to move funding from the Alaska project to a bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina on I-10 in New Orleans. Allen was one of 15 supporters of the unsuccessful amendment. Ellis, however, does not not give Allen a free pass on earmarks. He noted a few lawmakers -- including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. -- who voted against spending bills because they objected to earmarks. Allen "was part of the system and certainly got earmarks when he was in office as well," Ellis said. "You don’t get a total mulligan because the earmarks were part of much larger bills, but it does need that context." We don’t know how many of those earmarks Allen actually sponsored or requested. Members of Congress weren’t required to disclose whether they requested a particular line item until the year after he left office in 2008. During Allen’s term, Virginia received 1,135 earmarks, valued at about $1.2 billion, which could have been requested by any of Virginia’s 13-member delegation. Allen clearly sought pork for Virginia. "Every single earmark I’ve gotten, I’m proud of," he told a town hall meeting in Chesterfield County on March 20, 2006, according to a Richmond Times-Dispatch article. Allen said then that legislators who attach earmarks to appropriations bills should be identified. A few months later, Allen and other members of Virginia's congressional delegation refused cooperate with a Times-Dispatch reporter’s request to identify the earmarks they requested during fiscal 2006. In this year’s campaign, Allen is calling for a ban on earmarks until the federal budget is balanced. Afterwards, earmarks would require a two-thirds majority. Our ruling: Radtke claims that Allen, during his term in the Senate, voted for 40,000 earmarks. We have one quibble. Allen did not vote on the earmarks individually. The items were attached to massive appropriations bills supported by Allen that kept the federal government operating. The earmarks amounted to less than 3 percent of the spending contained in those laws. But unlike a few lawmakers, Allen never protested the secretive earmark process by voting against an appropriations bill. He went along with the system and said he was "proud" of the earmarks he got for Virginia. The appropriations bills Allen backed had 52,319 earmarks, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste. Radtke attaches a smaller number to Allen, but we won’t penalize her for understating her case. So Radtke’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-11626	"I have consistently opposed shutdowns."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/22/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-hes-opposed-shutdowns-he-hasnt-alway/	With an end to the federal government shutdown in sight, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, tried to argue that, contrary to popular belief, he was not the driving force behind the previous government shutdown in 2013. Back in 2013, Cruz -- then a junior member of the Senate’s minority party -- had tried to end funding for the Affordable Care Act. He pushed for language to defund Obamacare in spending bills, which would have forced then-President Barack Obama to choose between keeping the government open and crippling his signature legislative achievement. As the high-stakes legislative game played out, Obama and his fellow Democrats refused to agree to gut the law, and the Republicans, as a minority party, didn’t have the numbers to force their will. Following a 16-day shutdown, lawmakers voted to fund both the government and the Affordable Care Act. Cruz was widely identified at the time as the leader of the defunding effort. Most famously, Cruz spoke about defunding Obamacare on the Senate floor during a 21-hour speech, punctuated by Green Eggs and Ham as a bedtime story for his children. Many in Cruz’s own party, even those sympathetic with his goals, blamed him for a tactical blunder. During the spending impasse, his Republican colleagues launched "a barrage of hostile questions" at a GOP-only lunch, questioning whether Cruz had thought through the endgame. By the time Cruz was running for president in 2016, some Republicans were willing to criticize his approach publicly. Grover Norquist, an influential anti-tax activist, told the Washington Post in 2016 that Cruz’s shutdown plan was like a plotline in TV’s South Park in which a group of gnomes comes up with a nonsense plot to become rich. Josh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told the Post that Cruz’s approach was "like a toddler’s version of legislating." Leading up to the 2018 shutdown, Cruz’s role in the 2013 budget impasse received fresh media coverage, since he was now in the Senate majority. Would he be able to reconcile his past tactics with his current urgings not to shut down the government? This came to a head during a Senate hallway exchange between Cruz and reporter Kasie Hunt that aired on MSNBC on Jan. 22, 2018: Cruz: "We should not be shutting the government down. I have consistently opposed shutdowns. In 2013, I said we shouldn't shut the government down. Indeed, I went to the Senate floor repeatedly asking unanimous consent to reopen the government." Hunt: "Sir, you stood in the way of that." Cruz: "That's factually incorrect. It's a wonderful media narrative, but only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill. And when that bill comes up, you have a vote. A yes means fund the government, a no means don't fund the government. In 2013, virtually every single Republican voted to fund the government, including me multiple times. In fact, every single Democrat I believe in 2013 voted to shut the government down. The same thing is true here. Virtually every single Republican voted this week to fund the government. Virtually every single Democrat voted to shut it down." Hunt: "Sir, that's simply not the case. This was about Obamacare funding…" Cruz: "Those facts are incorrect. ... I get that you want to debate me, but you don't actually have any facts." Cruz’s argument that he didn’t cause a shutdown is one he and his camp has made in the past. In his 2015 book, A Time for Truth, Cruz wrote that neither he nor his ally, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, "nor the House Republicans even once voted to shut down the government. To the contrary, over and over again we voted to fund the government." And in the 2016 Post article, then-Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said the senator "didn’t pursue a government shutdown strategy. That’s not even sane. That would be a good thing to go out and campaign on? That wasn’t what he did. He led the fight to defund Obamacare." This echoes the framing Cruz offered Hunt -- namely, that his motivation was not to keep the government from being funded, but rather to defund Obamacare, and that the only reason people believe this is because of the biased media. However, even if, for the sake of argument, you accept Cruz’s line of thinking, his hallway comments offered a very specific definition of determining whether a lawmaker had "consistently opposed shutdowns." Specifically, Cruz said that "only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill." Cloture refers to a Senate vote to cut off debate and proceed to a bill; it’s a prerequisite for considering a bill, and these days, it typically takes 60 votes. So did Cruz ever "vote to deny cloture on a funding bill"? He did. It came on the legislation to end the 16-day shutdown -- a bill that didn’t include the Obamacare defunding language that he had been seeking. If this spending bill didn’t pass, the government wouldn’t be funded and would have to remain closed. As it happened, the bill passed by a large bipartisan majority, but Cruz was one of 16 senators to vote against cloture. He was also one of 18 to vote against the bill itself. By doing the "one thing" that he himself said defines causing a shutdown, Cruz didn't "consistently oppose shutdowns." "When he knew everyone else would vote to end the shutdown, he voted against funding the government," said Josh Ryan, a political scientist at Utah State University and author of the forthcoming book The Lawmaking End Game: Bargaining and Resolution in Congress. Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told PolitiFact that his "goal was to defund Obamacare, not shut down the government, and that is the point he was making today. He voted several times and fought in the face of (Democratic) opposition to fund vital government services -- including the military, veterans benefits, the National Guard, and National Health Institute -- while working to defund Obamacare before it went into effect, at which point he knew it would be markedly more difficult to undo. Sen. Cruz voted against cloture on the final bill because it still funded Obamacare, and he was committed to continuing the debate to defund it, while supporting bills to fund the other functions of government not impacted by Obamacare." Our ruling Cruz said, "I have consistently opposed shutdowns." Debunking this assertion doesn’t even require leveraging the many Republican statements criticizing Cruz’s legislative tactics for prompting the 2013 government shutdown. It only requires using the standard Cruz laid out in the same interview -- that "only one thing causes a shutdown: when you have senators vote to deny cloture on a funding bill." Cruz did that very thing in 2013, when he was one of 16 senators to vote against cloture for the spending bill that would go on to end the shutdown. He was also one of 18 senators to vote against the bill itself. We rate his statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-06025	The proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline is a bipartisan proposal.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/14/rob-cornilles/how-bipartisan-support-keystone-xl-oil-pipeline/	The major party candidates in the 1st Congressional District are on opposite sides of whether President Barack Obama should approve the building of a massive oil pipeline project from Canada to Texas. Democrat Suzanne Bonamici is opposed; she worries about the environmental impact. Republican Rob Cornilles is supportive; he said in last week’s televised debate, about halfway throughthe program, that the project has bipartisan support. "I do support the Keystone Pipeline. It’s a bipartisan proposal. Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress want this to move forward, because it’s not only a job creator, it’s also a way for us to responsibly manage how that oil is transferred from Canada to Mexico. Does the pipeline have bipartisan support? Much of the really vocal support for this project comes from Republicans. Democrats, not so much, although there are some who want the project. Environmentalists are opposed while labor’s AFL-CIO has decided not to take a formal position. Senate Democrats who like the project are Max Baucus D-Mont., Jon Tester D-Mont., Mary Landrieu D-La., Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Kent Conrad, D-N.D. We queried our delegation. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley are opposed. Rep. Earl Blumenauer was among 32 House Democrats who sent a letter urging the State Department to reject the route. Schrader is opposed to the expedited process, but not necessarily against — or for — the project. We don’t think the support of one Democrat or one Republican makes a proposal bipartisan, but it’s clear some Democrats are on board with the project. If we had to picture a bipartisan meter, the needle probably would surpass the halfway mark but fall short of 75 percent.

pomt-09132	John McCain "voted against the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, wrongly claiming they helped only the rich."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/15/jd-hayworth/hayworth-says-mccain-voted-against-bush-tax-cuts-b/	Less than two years after losing the 2008 presidential election, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is embroiled in a tough Republican primary against former Rep. J.D. Hayworth. In one recent ad, Hayworth attacked McCain for his vote on the two major tax cut bills of George W. Bush's presidency. "McCain voted against the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, wrongly claiming they helped only the rich," the ad says. We decided to see if Hayworth's ad correctly characterizes McCain's stance. Hayworth is correct that McCain voted against both the Economic Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. In fact, he was one of just two Republicans to oppose the 2001 bill (along with the late John Chafee of Rhode Island) and one of three Republicans opposing the 2003 bill (along with Chafee and Olympia Snowe of Maine). Before going further, we should add that McCain has since changed his stance on the Bush tax cuts. When they came up for renewal in 2006, he voted in favor of extension, and during the 2008 campaign, he once again advocated for their extension. In fact, during the 2008 presidential campaign, PolitiFact gave McCain a Full Flop for his changed stance on the Bush tax cuts. But that's irrelevant for checking Hayworth's claim, since the ad only challenges McCain on his views at the time the bills were passed. So, back to the core charge of the ad. Did McCain say, as Hayworth alleges, that the bills "helped only the rich"? The answer is: pretty much. In each case, before officially casting his vote, McCain gave a Senate floor speech to explain how he would be voting, and why. In both cases, he expressed regret that the bill would be targeting a disproportionate share of its benefits on wealthier Americans. In his 2001 speech, McCain said that he decided to vote against the final version of the bill after failing to find "that the progress we made in the Senate bill to scale back the benefits going to the top rate taxpayers to make room for more tax relief to lower income Americans would prevail in the final tax bill. During the debate on the Senate version of the tax reconciliation bill, I had urged my colleagues that substantial tax relief to middle income Americans should be our top priority. ... I cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us, at the expense of middle-class Americans who most need tax relief." Two years later, McCain spent much of his speech discussing his disappointment about the dropping of a provision he had backed that would have effectively reduced the tax burden of members of the armed forces and the foreign service stationed overseas. However, in the speech he also restated his concern about the share of benefits in the bill flowing to richer Americans. "Despite the recent successful war in Iraq, which highlighted the bravery and sacrifice of our military, the conferees provided nothing for them in this so-called growth bill," McCain said. "The only thing growing will be the tax breaks for the wealthiest citizens of this country." Later in the speech, he added, "Mr. President, the case is clear. The conferees should have included the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003 in the conference report for this tax relief bill. If they can look into the eyes of all the men and women in our military who have committed themselves to the defense of this country in Iraq and elsewhere around the world, and justify how they spent billions of federal dollars to cut taxes for our nation’s wealthiest at their expense, then the process is clearly broken. And that is a disgrace for which they are solely responsible." So when he had the opportunity to explain his thinking to the Senate and the American public, McCain on both occasions cited the disproportionate benefits for the rich. That gets Hayworth's ad most of the way home. But Hayworth's assertion that McCain "wrongly" claimed that the cuts "helped only the rich" does bring up two additional questions. First, did the tax cuts actually help only the rich? While the bills' benefits were concentrated among those with the highest incomes, taxpayers in all income levels did get some benefit. The Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the centrist-to-liberal Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, looked at all of the Bush-backed tax cuts enacted between 2001 and 2008 (which included, but was not limited to, the 2001 and 2003 bills) and found that the richest one-fifth of the population saw its after-tax income rise by 5.4 percent. The second one-fifth saw income rise by 3.5 percent, while the third one-fifth saw income rise by 2.6 percent and the fourth one-fifth saw income rise by 2.5 percent. The lowest one-fifth clearly fared the poorest, with an income boost of 0.7 percent. So it's certainly fair for Hayworth to knock the notion that the only people to benefit from the tax cuts were the wealthy. But is that what McCain said in his speeches? The answer is mixed. In 2001, McCain said that "so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us" -- which is not the same as saying that "all of the benefits" would go to the rich. However, two years later, McCain did suggest something closer to what the ad charges -- that "the only thing growing" as a result of the 2003 bill "will be the tax breaks for the wealthiest citizens of this country." So let's sum up. McCain voted against the tax cuts, as the ad indicated, and he cited the idea that the bills were tilted toward the rich as a major reason for his votes. When discussing one of the bills, McCain did suggest that only the rich would benefit, while for the other bill, he didn't. Because the ad was partly wrong on this final point, we'll mark it down a notch. But in general, the ad is quite accurate. We rate it Mostly True.	None	J.D.

pomt-02552	"What is and isn't a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-its-congress-change-how-feds-cla/	The buck may stop at the president, but does the blunt stop at Congress? For the second time in recent weeks, President Barack Obama was asked to publicly weigh in on the debate over decriminalization and legalization of marijuana. During an interview aired Jan. 31, 2014, CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Obama whether he would consider changing marijuana’s status as a Schedule I narcotic, a distinction that bans the substance from sale or use for medicinal or recreational purposes. "Well, first of all," Obama contended, "what is and isn't a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress." "I think it's the (Drug Enforcement Administration) that decides," Tapper offered. "It's not something by ourselves that we start changing," Obama replied. "No, there are laws undergirding those determinations." The back and forth was emblematic of the confusion surrounding the federal government's position on cannabis, particularly in Washington and Colorado, where new state laws legalizing marijuana technically run afoul of federal bans. But in this particular case, who is right, Tapper or Obama? Congress, the White House and controlled substances As usual, Obama has chosen his words carefully. He says that determining the classification of marijuana is "a job for Congress," not "the job of Congress." That could mean Obama philosophically believes that Congress should ultimately decide the fate of marijuana, even if his administration has some control over it. And to be clear, it does. But it’s complicated and not without roadblocks. First, a quick history lesson. Congress passed the Controlled Substance Act in 1970, and it was signed by President Richard Nixon later that year. The law set up guidelines to regulate and enforce the usage, production, sale and importation of various drugs and substances. In the law, Congress created five schedules to classify drugs and narcotics by medical use and potential to incite substance abuse. At one end of the scale is Schedule V drugs, which include substances like cough medicines with small amounts of the narcotic codeine. On the other end of the spectrum are Schedule I substances. These drugs have no accepted medical use and "are considered the most dangerous class of drugs with a high potential for abuse and potentially severe psychological and/or physical dependence," according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Distribution, manufacturing or possession of a Schedule I substance is a federal offense. When Congress passed the Controlled Substance Act, lawmakers singled out several dozen drugs that fall under this category. Among opiates, like heroin, and amphetamines, Congress included marijuana. Congress could amend the law to reschedule marijuana or exempt the substance altogether, as it did for alcohol and tobacco products. But there is another way to lawfully reclassify marijuana and it does involve the executive branch. According to the Controlled Substance Act, the attorney general, through the Drug Enforcement Administration, has the power to change the classification of a substance or remove it entirely, but only if the drug meets certain criteria. First, the attorney general reviews eight factors to determine what schedule to assign a substance, according to the law. The drug's actual or relative potential for abuse Scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect, if known The state of current scientific knowledge regarding the drug Its history and current pattern of abuse The scope, duration, and significance of abuse What, if any, risk there is to the public health The drug's psychic or physiological dependence liability Whether the drug is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under the Controlled Substances Act. If the DEA feels a substance should be reclassified, the agency can request a scientific and medical evaluation from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to determine if there are safe medical uses for the drug in question. Anyone from a drug company to a local government or even an individual citizen can also petition for review of a drug. Whatever conclusion HHS determines "shall be binding on the attorney general as to such scientific and medical matters," according to the law. That means the DEA cannot change the classification of a drug unless HHS says there are medical uses and it’s safe for consumption. The Food and Drug Administration, the agency under Health and Human Services that handles these reviews, has continually reaffirmed that "the scientific evidence to date is not sufficient for the marijuana plant to gain FDA approval." While research continues, the FDA said because marijuana can be addictive and clinical testing on the benefits of marijuana are not conclusive, it won’t give the DEA the go-ahead to reclassify the drug. In 2001 and 2011 the DEA, citing FDA research, turned down petitions to reclassify marijuana, and in 2006, the FDA upheld that "smoked marijuana has no currently accepted or proven medical use in the United States." Guidelines updated as recently as 2012 reflected that opinion. Many scientists have debated the merits of the FDA’s ruling, but in an email to PolitiFact, the White House reiterated that the agency’s findings serve as the basis for any action from the Justice Department. So basically, there is a mechanism for the executive branch to change the schedules. But it’s an arduous process and not something Obama can change by decree. And while the FDA is an executive agency that includes presidential appointees, the FDA’s recommendations are supposed be based on science, not politics. But Obama has found other ways to get around the FDA’s unwillingness to concede the medical benefits of marijuana to appease states that have gone a different direction. Schedule I substances cannot legally be used for medical purposes; however, 20 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws legalizing medical marijuana. In 2009, the Obama administration told federal law enforcement agencies to stop targeting medical marijuana dispensaries, signaling a change from the approach of President George W. Bush. Similarly, last year the Department of Justice said it would not target new laws in Colorado and Washington legalizing recreational marijuana. So even though marijuana remains a Schedule 1 substance, the current administration, through various memorandums, has not always treated it as one under the law. Our ruling Obama said "what is and isn't a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress." While Obama may feel that way philosophically, there is a process by which the executive branch can reclassify marijuana to allow for its medical use or completely remove it from the list of controlled substances. It’s not an easy process, but it’s there. And Obama’s Justice Department has often given tacit approval, or at least turned a blind eye, when states have taken steps to ignore the federal government’s classification.

pomt-07994	"This kind of snowstorm happens every 10 or 15 years."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/17/john-eaves/was-snowstorm-rare/	Now that metro Atlantans have freed themselves from the unyielding grip of ice and snow that descended upon the region last week, we thought it was time for some perspective about the magnitude of this mess. The miserable road conditions put several elected officials on the defensive. Fulton County Commission Chairman John Eaves explained why he felt it wouldn’t make sense to invest in snowplows or more spreader trucks. "You’ve got to weigh the cost versus the need," he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "The reality is, this kind of snowstorm happens every 10 or 15 years." Is Eaves correct? Was this a "perfect storm" that comes along only every decade or so? Didn’t we just have a "white Christmas" that shut down schools and caused the airlines to cancel hundreds of flights at the airport? PolitiFact Georgia contacted the National Weather Service’s local offices, headquartered in Peachtree City. Meteorologist Matt Sena noted that 3.7 inches of snow fell at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Jan. 9. By contrast, there were 4.2 inches of snow recorded at the airport on March 1, 2009. There! These types of snowstorms are more frequent than once a decade. But it’s not that simple, Sena told us. What made the last week’s storm different -- very different -- is the dangerous combination of snow, followed by sleet and freezing rain, followed by Arctic temperatures that turned much of metro Atlanta into a skating rink for much of the week, he said. So have there been similar combinations of subfreezing temperatures and precipitation that have lasted for days? If so, how often do they occur? Over the past 80 years, there have been 11 snowstorms of 4 inches or more in the city of Atlanta. The highest total was on Jan. 23, 1940, when 8.3 inches of the white stuff fell on Atlanta. The March 2009 snowfall was the most recent case for more than 4 inches. It closed some school districts for a day, about 12,000 metro Atlanta residents lost power and Delta canceled about 300 round-trip flights. Two days later, most of the roads had dried off, and flights were back on schedule. Channel 2 Action News meteorologist David Chandley noted the March 2009 snowstorm and some others didn’t have the lingering impact because they didn’t have the Arctic air blast afterward that turned the snow into ice. Many say the last comparable weather event to the past week took place when Atlanta was expecting lots of company: in January 2000, the week before it hosted the Super Bowl. An ice storm left more than 300,000 homes and businesses without power for days. More than a quarter-inch-thick ice hung from every surface. On the weekend of the big game, a second wave of ice tackled the region. There was a 47-vehicle crash on I-20, west of the city. The St. Louis Rams won the game in a thrilling finish, but many visitors remember the weekend for the wicked weather. Atlanta hasn’t hosted a Super Bowl since. A snowstorm in March 1960 blanketed Atlanta and much of North Georgia with as much as 10 inches. A little more than a decade later, in January 1973, a cold rain turned into an icy nightmare. The ice froze power lines, causing many of them to crash, creating a light show that could compete with the Independence Day fireworks display at Lenox Square. For three days, more than 200,000 people were without power. Nearly ten years later, on Jan. 12, 1982, there was "Snowjam." Seven inches of snow fell across Atlanta over three days. All of the city’s 1,425 miles of surface streets and 200 miles of interstate highways were immobilized. The snowstorm scared Atlantans so much that the AJC reported many fled the city before an anticipated snowfall in 1983 "like extras in a disaster movie." In March 1993, metro Atlanta was pounded by a blizzard that exceeded predictions. Winds reached 50 mph, as much as 1 foot of snow reportedly fell and the temperature plummeted into the teens. Some call it the "Super Storm of 1993." Sena contends snowstorms like this in 1993 and the most recent storm are rare. "Temperatures were cool beforehand … and we stayed below freezing days afterward," he said. Indeed, the thermometer rarely poked above the freezing point most of the week, causing ice to coat roads throughout the region. Chandley, who has been at Channel 2 Action News since November 1988 and lived in the area before that, said the worst storm he has seen was Snowjam because it took the region by surprise. This month’s storm is unusual, he said, because of the low temperatures that froze the snow for several days afterward. Because of the cold air that followed this storm, Chandley called it a "once-in-a-generation type of thing." Eaves seems to have a point about the frequency of this type of weather. We occasionally get snow and we occasionally get ice. But we rarely get the snow-ice-Arctic-conditions metro Atlanta lived through last week. We may not like how state and local officials responded to the snow and ice, but history shows this perfect storm of winter weather is rare. Eaves’ estimate of this type of thing occurring only every 10 to 15 years might actually be a bit conservative. We rate his statement as True.

pomt-15373	The Supreme Court’s views "are radically out of step with public opinion" regarding its decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/01/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-out-/	The Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide isn’t what the American people wanted, says Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Cruz, who is running for president, is an outspoken critic of the court’s 5-4 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that overturned the country’s remaining same-sex marriage bans. In an interview on Morning Edition June 29, NPR’s Steve Inskeep talked with Cruz about how he and other Republicans will respond. "The concern of conservatives seems to be that the court was following public opinion," Inskeep said. "Same-sex marriage, for example, is much more popular than it used to be." Cruz responded, "Well, Steve, let me actually disagree with your premise. The court doesn't follow public opinion. The court’s views are radically out of step with public opinion." "If the values had changed so much, there would be no need for the court to act because people would have acted democratically to change their marriage laws," Cruz added. "That hadn't happened, which is why the court stepped in and (threw) out the laws that the people did adopt." Given the swelling support for same-sex marriage in recent years, we wanted to dig into Cruz’s claim that "the court’s views are radically out of step with public opinion." To be clear: The claim could be interpreted as speaking about the court’s decisions generally. But given the context of the statement and our interaction with Cruz’s campaign, it seems he was talking about same-sex marriage specifically, so that’s what we’ll focus on. There’s a couple of different ways to look at this, but Cruz’s characterization is an exaggeration. A look at the polls On whether the American public supports same-sex marriage, there is no question. Numerous 2015 polls have found that a majority of the country -- around 60 percent -- favors same-sex marriage. The majority holds in most demographic groups. Support for same-sex marriage has risen dramatically in the past few years, as demonstrated by this Gallup chart, spanning 20 years: But there’s another question that doesn’t have a clear answer -- whether Americans think the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should have been left to the states, rather than having a decision made at the national level. This is essentially the question presented to the Supreme Court. Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips said "it is incontrovertible that a majority of Americans believe that the decision should be left to the states," pointing to a February 2015 CBS News poll that found 56 percent of Americans hold this position. However, other polls show the opposite: that a majority of Americans think same-sex marriage should be decided nationally. A June 2015 poll by CBS News and the New York Times found that just 41 percent of Americans think this is a state issue, while 54 percent think there should be a single federal law. Looking through a collection of the latest polls on gay rights, neither side stands out as the obvious position of the American public. Given the mix of polling results on this question, "it's not the case that the court's ruling was, as Cruz claimed, ‘radically out of step with public opinion.’ Rather, Americans were less definitive on this aspect of the gay marriage issue than others," said New York University professor Patrick Egan, who studies public opinion and gay rights issues. Phillips noted that a majority of states had laws banning same-sex marriage prior to this year’s Supreme Court and earlier lower court decisions -- more than 30 state bans in 2013, before the rulings started to roll out. Because state legislatures or the voters directly passed these laws, Phillips said they "reflected the popular will of the people in those states." But timing is important here. These same-sex marriage bans might have reflected popular opinion at the time they were passed -- nearly all came about before 2010 -- but public opinion on gay marriage has changed significantly since then. "If public opinion is changing -- and the data show it was -- it is possible for both the original legislative decisions and the subsequent court decisions to be consistent with public opinion," said Peter Enns, a professor of government at Cornell University who studies public opinion and government response. By 2014, at least 50 percent of residents in 32 states supported same-sex marriage -- including quite a few states that had gay marriage bans prior to court decisions, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. A majority opposed same-sex marriage in only eight states. Additionally, most political scientists would say public opinion is best measured via representative surveys, not by the laws currently in place, Egan noted. So it’s not always fair to say that an existing same-sex marriage ban shows that the people of that state are currently opposed to same-sex marriage legalization. Our ruling Cruz said the Supreme Court’s views "are radically out of step with public opinion" regarding its decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide. Most polls say around 60 percent favor same-sex marriage -- a high point. At the state level, the majority holds in most cases. Cruz’s staff said that Americans think legalizing same-sex marriage should be a state responsibility rather than something decided at the federal level. But different polls show different results on that point. There isn’t an obvious majority one way or the other. Certainly there is a good chunk of the population that opposes the Supreme Court’s decision, but it’s definitely not a clear majority. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-15021	Planned Parenthood "is an organization that funnels millions of dollars in political contributions to pro-abortion candidates."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/05/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-planned-parenthood-gives-millio/	The bitter debate over Planned Parenthood is continuing -- on the presidential campaign trail, in the halls of Congress, and on cable news Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina has repeatedly criticized the group after getting wide attention for her comments during the second Republican debate, when she said that an undercover video about Planned Parenthood shows "a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says, 'We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.' " (We rated that Mostly False.) During the Sept. 30, 2015, edition of the Fox News show Hannity, Fiorina said that Planned Parenthood "is an organization that funnels millions of dollars in political contributions to pro-abortion candidates." We wondered if Fiorina was right, so we turned to the campaign-finance data. It turns out she’s on solid ground. Here are the two major categories of Planned Parenthood spending from the 2014 campaign cycle: Source of spending Type of spending Amount spent, 2014 cycle Planned Parenthood Action Fund Inc. Federal PAC Contributions to candidates and parties $528,762 Super PAC and 501(c)4 groups Independent expenditures $6,058,338 Total $6,587,100 Let’s unpack these numbers a bit. The first line, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, refers to the amount spent by the group’s main political action committee. A political action committee is a group that bundles money donated voluntarily, including that from employees and their families, to be spent for political purposes. A PAC is legally distinct from the organization for which it advocates, and it must maintain separate bank accounts. PACs can give directly to candidates. The second line includes dollars spent by Planned Parenthood-related groups that are allowed to raise and spend money more freely, but which are not allowed to give money directly to or coordinate with candidates. These are primarily known as Super PACs and 501(c)4 organizations. So, combining these three categories of expenditures produces roughly $6.6 million in political spending just for the 2014 cycle. That number would go up if other recent election cycles were added in. So Fiorina has a point. It’s important to note that all of the reported expenditures on this list come from entities that are legally allowed to spend money in politics. While the operational, medical clinics of Planned Parenthood cannot spend money in politics, all the affiliates listed in the table are organized in such a way that they are allowed to make campaign donations or spend money in other ways on elections. Also, federal dollars flow only to the operational arms of Planned Parenthood, which by law are not allowed to spend money on politics. Despite the legal distinctions between these groups and what they can, and cannot, do in elections, it’s easy to see why there may be public confusion. That’s because officials with the group haven’t been afraid to use the "Planned Parenthood" brand when choosing names for affiliates that are allowed to engage in election activity. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, some of the group’s biggest affiliated spenders in 2014 were called Planned Parenthood Votes (a Super PAC that spent $4.2 million that cycle) and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund (a 501(c)4 group that spent $930,290 that cycle). Another 19 affiliates with "Planned Parenthood" in their name, mostly regional affiliates, had PACs that spent money on political purposes in 2014 or had employees who gave from their own pockets that cycle. This has the effect of fuzzing the image of what counts as "Planned Parenthood" in the public mind, even if not in legal status. Another point worth mentioning: Not all of this money was spent on "candidates," the word Fiorina used. Some of the money we totaled above went to candidates, but a lot went to party committees or was used for "independent expenditures," such as ads that independently supported a candidate without going through the candidate’s own campaign treasury. In the 2014 campaign cycle, the Center for Responsive Politics found that groups and individuals related to Planned Parenthood spent $679,708 specifically on congressional candidates. And if you broaden that out to the entire 1990 to 2016 period, the number rises to about $3.9 million specifically on congressional candidates. In 2014, the group's biggest recipients among incumbent senators were Ed Markey, D-Mass., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Al Franken, D-Minn., and Mark Udall, D-Colo. The four senators -- each of whom received a 100 percent vote rating from NARAL-Pro-Choice America -- received between $14,000 and $23,000 each. If you include all recent years, Fiorina’s right that the amount spent specifically on candidates (indeed, just the congressional ones) did reach into the "millions." It’s worth noting that Planned Parenthood is hardly the only organization to split itself into separate entities that have different abilities to participate in politics. In addition to being legal, it’s common practice. Indeed, a political affiliate of the Susan B. Anthony List -- an anti-abortion group -- spent $745,756 on independent expenditures in campaigns during the 2014 cycle. And during her unsuccessful 2010 Senate candidacy in California, Fiorina herself benefited from $246,183 in independent expenditures by National Right to Life and $234,774 in independent expenditures from the Susan B. Anthony List. Our ruling Fiorina said Planned Parenthood "is an organization that funnels millions of dollars in political contributions to pro-abortion candidates." Fiorina glossed over the difference between the operational arm of Planned Parenthood, which receives federal funding and cannot take part in electoral activities, and its affiliates, which can legally spend money on politics. Still, she is right that a variety of affiliates of Planned Parenthood -- usually with "Planned Parenthood" in their name -- have legally spent "millions" on politics in recent years, both for candidates specifically and on other electoral activities. The statement is accurate but needs clarification, so we rate Fiorina’s claim Mostly True.	None	Carly Fiorina	None	None	None	2015-10-05T15:55:01	2015-09-30	['None']
pomt-01870	When undocumented children are picked up at the border and "told to appear later in court ... 90 percent do not then show up."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/10/jeff-flake/sen-jeff-flake-says-90-percent-immigrants-given-co/	The surge of unaccompanied children at the U.S. border, primarily coming from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, has overwhelmed the ability of the United States to handle their legal cases. A law passed under President George W. Bush and aimed at curbing human trafficking requires that minors from Central America who reach the border must have their cases heard in court before they can be deported. Currently, children wait an average of 578 days before a hearing -- delays that are sure to lengthen if the flow of children continues unabated. A substantial chunk of the $3.7 billion President Barack Obama is requesting in a supplemental spending bill for the border would be for increasing the courts’ ability to handle the caseload of newly arrived children. In this context, Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., offered a notable statistic about the judicial treatment of people who arrive at the U.S. border. In a July 8, 2014, interview on the PBS News Hour, Flake outlined the risks of having large numbers of people released in the United States awaiting a hearing -- particularly the risk that they will fail to show up and boost the number of undocumented immigrants in the country. "When these kids are handed off from the Border Patrol, (the government’s) role is to actually place those children in the care of a guardian or a family member," Flake said. "And then what the record shows is that they’re told to appear later in court, where their case will be adjudicated. But 90 percent of them, 90 percent, do not then show up in court later." A reader called our attention to this, citing sharply conflicting data, so we decided to take a look. The reader pointed us to a report from the Bipartisan Policy Center -- a think tank founded by former congressional leaders of both parties -- that cited figures far smaller than 90 percent. The report used figures from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which is tasked by the Justice Department with handling immigration court proceedings, appellate reviews and administrative hearings. Between 2003 and 2012, the percentage of all immigrants who failed to appear in court after being released has bounced between 20 percent and 40 percent, settling in at about 30 percent at the end of that time span. (No data for children specifically is available from this long-running data set.) That’s substantially lower than the 90 percent figure Flake cited. Meanwhile, in a July 10 hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee -- which was held two days after Flake’s remarks on PBS -- Juan P. Osuna, the director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, told the panel that his department estimates that 46 percent of children currently fail to show up for their date in court. He told lawmakers that any other numbers are "incorrect." We checked with immigration policy experts to see whether the federal statistics or Flake’s estimate seemed more accurate, and they agreed that the federal statistics jibed with their long-term understanding of the issue. "I’m not aware of data that shows a 90 percent no-show rate," said Marc R. Rosenblum, deputy director of the Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program. He added that the long-term range of 20 percent to 40 percent matches what the VERA Institute found between 1997 and 2000 when it studied the issue on a federal contract to track individual immigration cases. The Bipartisan Policy Center also expressed skepticism about the 90 percent figure. "Based on the federal data we’ve seen, we know that between 2008 and 2012, about 70 to 80 percent of all immigrants showed up for their court appearance," said Rosemarie Calabro Tully, a spokeswoman for the group. She later passed us the estimate Osuna gave to the Senate committee. When we contacted Flake’s office, they said the senator’s source for the statistic was a comment by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., at a media breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor on June 26. The Monitor didn’t print a direct quote, but here’s an excerpt from the article: "Right now, (Goodlatte) said, the law does not allow minors to be held in a facility, so they are released to relatives or foster care, and then given a court date to reappear. More than 90 percent do not return, he said." So we contacted Goodlatte’s office. Goodlatte’s office said that while visiting the McAllen Border Patrol Station in the Rio Grande Valley in July, Goodlatte heard from Border Patrol agents that only 26 percent of those who were detained failed to show up for removal proceedings. They said officials didn’t give a percentage for those who had been released and failed to appear. They cited an article in Newsmax, a conservative online publication, that cited an anonymous "senior Los Angeles County Sheriff's detective who routinely deals with illegal immigrants" who said a "massive number — 80 to 90 percent" do not show up for deportation hearings. However, Goodlatte’s office acknowledged this was anecdotal evidence. Goodlatte's office also noted that there is already significant pool of immigrants whose final deportation has been ordered but not carried out. At least 858,779 non-detained aliens are deportable but haven’t been deported, many of whom are now off the radar of the authorities, according to calculations by the Center for Immigration Studies based on federal data. This is a related and notable issue, but somewhat different from what Flake or Goodlatte said. Experts we checked with did note a caveat: There’s no way of knowing if the current group of new arrivals will behave differently in regard to court appearances than their predecessors have. Indeed, due the backlog, it is unlikely that many of the minors apprehended in 2013 or 2014 have had their court date come up yet, and until their court appearance is complete, the government won’t know how many end up coming and how many fail to appear. Our ruling Flake said that when undocumented children are picked up at the border and "told to appear later in court ... 90 percent do not then show up." Historically, the rate has ranged between 20 percent to 40 percent, settling in at about 30 percent in 2012, the most recent full year for which data is available. A more recent estimate for children specifically, made by the director of the office responsible for handling such cases, is that the current no-show rate for children is 46 percent. That’s still quite high, but it’s only half what Flake said. We rate the claim False.	None	Jeff Flake	None	None	None	2014-07-10T18:20:53	2014-07-08	['None']
pomt-14510	"It’s highly unusual to have a Supreme Court confirmation in a presidential election year. The last one was 1940."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/feb/22/bob-goodlatte/goodlatte-says-scotus-appointment-presidential-yea/	Count U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th, among the many conservatives saying the replacement of the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court should be left to the next president. "It’s highly unusual to have a Supreme Court confirmation in a presidential election year. The last one was 1940," Goodlatte said in a Feb. 15 interview on the Fox Business Network. Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has criticized President Barack Obama over the years for embracing liberal policies and sometimes stepping around Congress to enact them. He told Fox it’s "highly unlikely" that Obama, who will leave office next January, would appoint a new justice who has anything close to Scalia’s conservative views. Obama is promising to nominate a new justice, and some Senate Republicans are threatening to block the nomination because they want the new president to fill the open seat. Although Goodlatte won’t have a vote in the controversy, we decided to fact-check his full statement that a presidential election-year confirmation of a Supreme Court justice is 1) rare and, 2) hasn’t occurred since 1940. During the 80-year time frame that Goodlatte cites, it’s pretty clear that election-year confirmations indeed have been a rarity. There’s a couple reasons for that. Russell Wheeler, an expert on the courts at the Brookings Institution, told our colleagues at PolitiFact National that justices rarely have died in office in recent decades, and they don’t usually resign during an election year in order to avoid escalating debate over filling their seats. But there has been election-year activity on Supreme Court seats. Let’s start with 1940. That Jan. 4, President Franklin Roosevelt, a Democrat, nominated Frank Murphy to the court. The overwhelmingly Democratic-led Senate approved the choice less than two weeks later. Murphy filled the seat of Justice Pierce Butler, who died in November 1939. In October 1956, Justice Sherman Minton stepped down. With the Senate adjourned, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, used a recess appointment to elevate William Brennan to the seat. Brennan was formally nominated by Eisenhower and confirmed by the Democratic-led Senate early the next year. The next election-year opening occurred in 1968, when Chief Justice Earl Warren announced he wanted to retire. President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat who was not seeking re-election, nominated sitting Justice Abe Fortas to succeed Warren as chief justice. Johnson nominated Homer Thornberry to replace Fortas. But neither of those men, who were nominated in June, got a confirmation vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Republicans and Southern Democrats filibustered Fortas, whom they considered a liberal jurist. In October, Johnson withdrew both Fortas’ and Thornberry’s nominations. Warren remained on the bench until the spring of 1969 when Warren Burger - nominated by President Richard Nixon, a Republican - became chief justice. So although there was action on Supreme Court seats in 1956 and 1968, it’s accurate to say the Senate did not confirm a justice during either election year. But 1988 was a different story. That Feb. 3, the Democratic-controlled Senate voted 97-0 to confirm Anthony Kennedy for a seat on the high court. That was during the last full year of Republican Ronald Reagan’s presidency. Kennedy was Reagan’s third choice to fill a vacancy left by retiring Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. In July 1987, Reagan nominated Robert Bork, but the Senate rejected him in a vote that October. Reagan then announced he would nominate Douglas Ginsburg but backtracked after Ginsburg acknowledged he had smoked marijuana as a college student and early in his teaching career. Finally, on Nov. 30, 1987, Reagan nominated Kennedy. The Senate Judiciary Committee held three days of hearings on Kennedy’s nomination in December 1987 before recommending his confirmation and sending his selection to the full Senate. We asked Goodlatte’s office to back up the congressman’s claim that no Supreme Court justice has been confirmed during an election year since 1940 and got a reply from Michael Woeste, deputy press secretary at the House Judiciary Committee. He stressed that although Kennedy was confirmed in an election year, the original nomination for the seat he filled was made well before then. "The Reagan example is distinguishable because Kennedy was simply a replacement for Douglas Ginsburg, who dropped out, and Ginsburg was the replacement for Bork, who dropped out earlier," Woeste wrote in an email. "So Reagan’s initial appointment for that slot on the Supreme Court occurred before the election year, and the replacements were for the same position." Our ruling Goodlatte said: "It’s highly unusual to have a Supreme Court confirmation in a presidential election year. The last one was 1940." Clearly, such confirmations are rare in modern times; it’s happened only once during the past 18 presidential elections. That doesn’t mean that the Senate has a long tradition of refusing to consider high court nominations when the White House is up for grabs. What it shows mostly is that Supreme Court justices avoid retiring during presidential election years. There’s an obvious flaw, however, in Goodlatte’s contention that 1940 was the last time a justice was confirmed during a presidential election year. Kennedy was unanimously confirmed in February 1988. So on the whole, we rate Goodlatte’s statement Half True.	None	Bob Goodlatte	None	None	None	2016-02-22T00:00:00	2016-02-15	['None']

pomt-06713	President Barack Obama "has virtually no one in his cabinet with private-sector experience."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/01/michele-bachmann/bachmann-says-obama-has-virtually-no-one-his-cabin/	During a visit to a sandwich shop in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., took a shot at the career backgrounds of the officials who comprise President Barack Obama’s Cabinet. "I want to bring advisers in from labor and from manufacturers and from the service industry and financial services," said Bachmann, who’s running for the Republican presidential nomination. "I want to know what they know, because that's what we've been missing from President Obama. He has virtually no one in his Cabinet with private-sector experience. I want to bring people who know how to create jobs into my administration." A reader suggested that we check whether Bachmann is right that Obama "has virtually no one in his Cabinet with private-sector experience." As it happens, we analyzed a similar claim 21 months ago and found it False. But we are updating and expanding that assessment here, due to subsequent arrivals and departures from Obama’s Cabinet. Our original analysis First, let’s recap what we published in December 2009. It was based on a statement by Glenn Beck, then a Fox News talk show host, on his Nov. 30, 2009, show. "History has proven over and over again — and so has the post office, for that matter — that government is not the answer," Beck said. "You need to unleash the people. The entrepreneurs. And if you are wondering how it is that the government can't see that — how they can be pondering even bigger stimulus packages as they stare the failure of the first one right in the face — I'll show you. Here are the past presidents and the number of appointees in their Cabinets with private sector experience — folks that have done more than write on the chalkboard; they've been out there, in the real world. Let's compare President Nixon — he's over 50 percent — with President Obama: Under 10 percent of his appointees have any experience in the private sector." After some digging, we found that the claim was based on a study by Michael Cembalest, the chief investment officer for J.P. Morgan Private Bank. In a Nov. 24, 2009, column titled "Obama's Business Blind Spot" and published on Forbes.com, Cembalest wrote, "In a quest to see what frame of reference the administration might have on this issue, I looked back at the history of the presidential Cabinet. Starting with the creation of the secretary of commerce back in 1900, I compiled the prior private-sector experience of all 432 Cabinet members, focusing on those positions one would expect to participate in this discussion: secretaries of State; Commerce; Treasury; Agriculture; Interior; Labor; Transportation; Energy; and Housing & Urban Development." He continued, "Many of these individuals started a company or ran one, with first-hand experience in hiring and firing, domestic and international competition, red tape, recessions, wars and technological change. Their industries included agribusiness, chemicals, finance, construction, communications, energy, insurance, mining, publishing, pharmaceuticals, railroads and steel; a cross-section of the American experience. (I even gave [one-third] credit to attorneys focused on private-sector issues, although one could argue this is a completely different kettle of fish.) One thing is clear: The current administration, compared with past Democratic and Republican ones, marks a departure from the traditional reliance on a balance of public- and private-sector experiences." In an accompanying chart, Cembalest reported that in the Obama administration, fewer than 10 percent of the Cabinet appointees counted under those rules had private-sector experience. According to the chart, all other administrations going back to Theodore Roosevelt's had rates in at least the high 20s, with the Eisenhower and Reagan administrations approaching 60 percent. The chart — typically reprinted by itself, without Cembalest's accompanying narrative — circulated in the conservative blogosphere for a couple of days before eventually being picked up by Beck. However, we found that at least three of the nine positions that Cembalest and Beck cited — one-third — were occupied by appointees who had significant corporate or business experience. • Shaun Donovan, Obama's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, served as managing director of Prudential Mortgage Capital Co., where he oversaw its investments in affordable housing loans. • Energy Secretary Steven Chu headed the electronics research lab at one of America's storied corporate research-and-development facilities, AT&T Bell Laboratories, where his work won a Nobel Prize for physics. • Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, in addition to serving as Colorado attorney general and a U.S. senator, has been a partner in his family's farm for decades and, with his wife, owned and operated a Dairy Queen and radio stations in his home state of Colorado. All three remain in Obama’s Cabinet. Three other Obama Cabinet members worked as lawyers for private-sector law firms, most of them with business clients: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Commerce Secretary Gary Locke. And Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner once worked for Kissinger Associates, a consulting firm that advises international corporations on political and economic conditions overseas. Of these, Clinton, Vilsack and Geithner remain in the Cabinet. The occupants of the two remaining Cabinet posts cited in Cembalest’s chart did not have significant private-sector experience: Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Both remain in their jobs. When we tracked down Cembalest to ask about his methodology, he expressed regret that his work had been used for political ends, saying that it was not his intention to provide fodder for bloggers and talk show hosts. He acknowledged fault in missing Salazar's business background, though he downplayed the private-sector experiences Chu and Donovan had -- managing scientific research and handling community development lending, respectively -- saying they did not represent the kind of private-sector business experience he was looking for when doing his study. "What I was really trying to get at was some kind of completely, 100 percent subjective assessment of whether or not a person had had enough control of payroll, dealing with shareholders, hiring, firing and risk-taking that they'd be in a position to have had a meaningful seat at the table when the issue being discussed is job creation," Cembalest told us. The Cabinet today Now let’s look at the Cabinet as it is now. To do that, we’ll detail the full list of Cabinet positions, which is broader than the more limited list Cembalest was working with. Department heads and the vice president always belong in the Cabinet, with other senior positions granted Cabinet rank at the president’s discretion. In addition to the vice president, the Cabinet includes the secretaries of 15 executive departments: Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Attorney General. The other positions that hold Cabinet rank under Obama are: White House chief of staff, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, director of the Office of Management & Budget, U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador to the United Nations, and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. We’ve already noted that Donovan, Chu and Salazar have solid private-sector credentials. To that list, we can add three names: • Obama’s nominee for Commerce Secretary, John Bryson. Bryson has served as chairman and CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, a major utility. • White House chief of staff Bill Daley. Daley has served in several top-level positions with JP Morgan Chase, as president of SBC Communications and as president and chief operating officer of Amalgamated Bank of Chicago. • Office of Management and Budget director Jack Lew. Lew, a longtime senior federal manager, has also served as managing director and chief operating officer of Citi Global Wealth Management and later Citi Alternative Investments. We can also add six names to the list of those who have worked as lawyers or consultants for private-sector companies. Though Cembalest treated them as different from other private sector workers, we see no reason to: • Vice President Joe Biden. Biden, something of an entrepreneur, founded his own law firm, Biden and Walsh, early in his career, and it still exists in a later incarnation, Monzack Mersky McLaughlin and Browder, P.A. Biden also supplemented his income by managing real estate properties, including a neighborhood swimming pool. Of course, he later became a long-serving U.S. senator from Delaware. • Attorney General Eric Holder. Holder, a former judge and deputy attorney general, has also worked as a litigation partner at the law firm Covington & Burling LLP. • Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Panetta, a former Member of Congress and Central Intelligence Agency director, worked in private practice as a lawyer for five years. • Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano. Napolitano, the former two-term governor of Arizona, also practiced law in Phoenix with the firm Lewis and Roca. • U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk. Kirk, the former mayor of Dallas, has also worked as a partner in the Texas-based international law firm Vinson & Elkins. • U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice. Rice, a veteran of the State Department and foreign-policy think tanks, worked early in her career as a management consultant with McKinsey & Co., which advises corporations on how to run their businesses more effectively. Finally, we can add five names to the list of Cabinet members without any significant private-sector experience: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, and Council of Economic Advisers nominee Alan Krueger. (We will note, however, that Duncan played pro basketball in Australia from 1987 to 1991, and that Shinseki was otherwise occupied as a career military officer.) Now let’s add the numbers together. If you take the most restrictive definition -- those employed by businesses other than private law and consulting firms -- Obama can count six members of his 22-member Cabinet with private-sector experience, or 27 percent. (We’re counting Bryson, who hasn’t been confirmed yet.) If you take what we consider the more common-sense definition -- which includes those who have worked for private law or consulting firms -- then Obama can count 15 out of 22 with private-sector experience, or 68 percent. That leaves seven of 22 Cabinet members without private-sector experience, or 32 percent. Our ruling Bachmann said that "virtually no one" in Obama’s Cabinet has private-sector experience. But even under the most restrictive definition, 27 percent of Obama’s Cabinet has what we consider pretty clear private-sector experience. And broader definition that includes private-sector law and consulting work -- much of which involved representing businesses -- kicks the percentage up to two-thirds. In addition, Bachmann said she would bring in advisers from manufacturing (Chu could fit that bill), the service industry (which could include Salazar) and financial services (which would include Donovan, Daley and Lew). Conceivably, a Republican president might appoint more business executives to Cabinet posts than a Democratic one would. But Bachmann still overstates her case by saying that "virtually no one" in Obama’s Cabinet has private-sector experience -- repeating a false claim that's been circulating for nearly two years.

pomt-15147	"We have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-us-has-93-milion-people-out-work/	Two of the nation’s most outspoken politicians appeared on the same show on Aug. 28, 2015, when Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump was a guest on former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin’s show, On Point with Sarah Palin, which airs on the conservative One America News Network. As her first question, Palin asked Trump about the state of the national economy. "If you really look, Sarah, at the economy, it's been terrible," Trump said. "We have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed." Palin went on to suggest that the government is actively keeping the American people in the dark about how bad the economy is, saying, "I don't think we're getting the truth out of the White House -- the true state of the economy." Trump agreed, saying, "The White House is not truthful." A reader asked us to look at the checkable portion of this exchange -- that "we have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed." So we did. We’ll take the two parts of the claim in turn. ‘We have 93 million people out of work’ We have addressed claims like this one previously and have not rated them favorably. Trump’s press office did not answer an inquiry, but we have a good idea where the number came from. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official collector of employment data, either 92 million or 93 million members of the civilian, non-institutionalized population who were age 16 and over were not in the labor force in July 2015. (There are slight differences in the figure if you use seasonally adjusted numbers as opposed to non-seasonally adjusted numbers.) But what does this number actually mean? For one, it includes lots of people who likely aren’t looking for work. It includes every American of retirement age -- 65 and older. It includes every high-school student at least 16 years of age. It includes every college and many graduate or professional-school students. It includes every person who has a disability that makes it impossible for them to work. It includes parents who are choosing to stay home to take care of their kids. It includes every adult who’s gone back to school full-time. It even includes trust-fund kids who are living off investments. Put it all together and this is not a trivial group of people. Out of the 93.8 million Americans age 16 and up who are deemed "not in the labor force," 9.7 million of them are between 16 and 19 years of age. Another 5.7 million are between 20 and 24. And 37.8 million are age 65 and over. (In fact, 17.5 million are over 75 years old.) What’s left? This leaves 40.5 million Americans who are not in the labor force and are between the ages of 25 and 64. It’s possible to argue that this number should be a bit higher -- college typically ends at age 22, not everyone goes to college, and healthy seniors today can usually work past 65 if they wish. But right off the top, Trump’s claim significantly overstates the matter. So what’s a better number? The official number of unemployed Americans is 8.3 million -- less than one-tenth of what Trump says. But to give Trump the benefit of the doubt, it’s possible to expand this number using more credible economic thinking. Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, says it’s not unreasonable to include: • The 6.4 million people who haven’t looked for work recently enough to qualify as being "in the labor force," but who say they "currently want a job." • And the 6.5 million people working part-time who would prefer to have a full-time job. This would mean that upwards of 21 million Americans could be described with some justification as "out of work" involuntarily, either fully or partially. But that’s not even one-quarter of the number that Trump offered. Most of Trump’s 93 million "don’t want to work and are not in the job market," said Tara Sinclair, chief economist at Indeed and associate professor at George Washington University. Burtless added that a large chunk of those suffering the plague of being "out of work" can actually be seen as benefiting from their membership in an affluent, technologically advanced society. "The fact that these adults are jobless is not a marker of economic failure -- it is an indicator of a very prosperous society that can afford to permit the old and disabled to retire, that can invest in young adults so they can improve their skills, and that can keep some adults in the home where they can care for children or attend to other non-paying pursuits," he said. ‘They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed’ The second half of Trump’s claim is no closer to accurate. Trump seems to suggest that government statisticians are performing something like medieval alchemy, turning lead (unemployment) into gold (employment) with the flick of a wand. But if someone gives up looking for a job, they are counted as either unemployed or not in the labor force -- not as "employed." There actually is an official statistical category for a person in this situation: If someone wants and looks for a job but then gives up, they are called "discouraged workers." Specifically, these people "want and are available for a job and who have looked for work sometime in the past 12 months" but are "not currently looking because they believe there are no jobs available or there are none for which they would qualify." However, "discouraged workers" are relatively rare -- in the most recent month, there were 668,000 of them, or less than 1 percent of the 93 million "out of work" Americans Trump referred to. Burtless said that Trump’s statement is "so confusingly wide of the mark" that he may have misspoken. Our ruling Trump said, "We have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed." That figure, boosted by Trump’s description, represents a basic misunderstanding of the labor market. Once you strip out full-time students, senior citizens, the disabled, and those who have chosen not to work to take care of their children, a more reasonable estimate of "out of work" Americans is somewhere in the neighborhood of 21 million, or less than a quarter of Trump’s figure. Meanwhile, he is flat wrong that the government reclassifies discouraged workers as "employed." We rate his claim False.

pomt-14025	"While Rob Portman relies on his super PAC and a handful of billionaires to do his dirty work, we don’t have a super PAC, and quite frankly, we don’t want one that spends millions to spew out lies and distortions."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2016/may/31/ted-strickland/ted-strickland-doesnt-have-super-pac/	The duel between leading U.S. Senate candidates in Ohio is feisty as ever, with polls showing Democratic former Gov. Ted Strickland and incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman neck-in-neck. Strickland’s latest tactic against Portman is to call him out for serving the billionaire class at the expense of Ohio’s regular Joes. A campaign fundraising email from Strickland’s campaign manager portrays Portman in the grips of dark outside spending, while Strickland takes in small donations from voters. "While Rob Portman relies on his super PAC and a handful of billionaires to do his dirty work, we don’t have a super PAC," wrote campaign manager Rebecca Pearcey, "and quite frankly, we don’t want one that spends millions to spew out lies and distortions." We recalled a similar claim by presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, whose own statement about not having a super PAC was fact-checked in the early months of the Democratic primary. We applied the same test to Strickland’s campaign rhetoric. Portman has an affiliated super PAC, meaning it’s dedicated solely to supporting him and opposing Strickland. Fighting for Ohio (though it’s registered in Alexandria, Va.) has spent more than $1.68 million against Strickland so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Top contributors to Fighting for Ohio include Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel ($250,000); Paul Singer, hedge fund manager of Elliott Management Corporation ($250,000); Edyth Lindner, widow of Carl Lindner, former owner of the Cincinnati Reds and Chiquita Brands ($100,000). Yes, Portman is funded by billionaires. But Strickland’s appeal for cash neglects to mention how he also benefits from outside spending. Senate Majority PAC is an unaffiliated funder that pledges its support to Democrats running for the Senate. The PAC mostly pays for TV and digital attack ads against Republican candidates. In this election season, the PAC has lasered in on four major Senate battlegrounds: New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Ohio. Donors to the Senate Majority PAC include George Marcus, real estate broker at Marcus & Millichap ($1 million); Fred Eychaner, Newsweb Corporation founder ($1 million); and actor/director Seth MacFarlane ($500,000). Anyone can register an unaffiliated super PAC with the Federal Election Commission. This means even if the Senate Majority PAC’s love for Strickland was unrequited, there’s not much Strickland can do about it. It’s illegal for a candidate to coordinate with a super PAC, according to the Federal Election Commission rules. But such rules are rarely enforced — since 1999, commissioners have only launched three investigations on candidate-super PAC contact. Unlike Sanders, who filed a cease-and-desist order against a PAC backing him, Strickland hasn't disavowed the $1.75 million that the Senate Majority PAC has spent so far on the race targeting Portman. Strickland for Senate spokesman David Bergstein retweeted the Senate Majority PAC earlier this year. Donations from non-profits and ad buys aren’t reported to the Federal Election Commission, further complicating the question of whose pockets are deeper. "The picture can change in an instant, and we may not know who’s truly ponying up the money on an ad to support a candidate," said Sheila Krumholz, the executive director at the Center for Responsive Politics. "There’s a lot of disingenuousness when candidates are saying, ‘You have more money,’ ‘No, you have more money.’ " Our ruling A Strickland for Senate fundraising email said, "While Rob Portman relies on his super PAC and a handful of billionaires to do his dirty work, we don’t have a super PAC." Strickland doesn’t have a super PAC solely focused on his campaign like the pro-Portman Fighting for Ohio. But big spenders still have Strickland’s back. It isn’t credible to say he’s impervious to the influence of dark money while still enjoying its benefits. The claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

Charlie Crist chimed in on foreign policy at a U.S. Senate debate on Oct. 24, 2010. As talk turned international, Crist touted Florida’s strong ties with Israel and advocated "keeping an eye" on Iran. Then he pointed to a rare opportunity he had as a domestic leader to take an international stand: "I am very proud, as governor of Florida, that we signed the first divestment act, as it relates to Iran, divesting any investments in companies that would invest in Iran, because we support Israel so strongly here in this state and this country." We wanted to check the record. Was Florida really first? We had to crank the way-back machine to 2007 for this one. In May that year, Crist’s office encouraged other governors to "follow Florida’s lead in Iran and Sudan divestiture." "As demonstrated by the end of apartheid in South Africa, when a light shines to expose oppression and extremism, the days of injustice are numbered," he said. Florida was the only state at that point to have moved Iran divestment legislation through the state House and Senate. In June, Crist signed the "Protecting Florida’s Investments Act." Among other things, it instructed the State Board of Administration to shed holdings with companies that did business in Sudan and Iran. News coverage at the time noted Florida was looking to "lead the charge" and confirmed that the state sought to cut ties with 57 companies doing energy-related work in Sudan and Iran. "At least two other states have also passed laws requiring divestiture of stocks tied to Sudan, but Florida is the first state to target both countries," the St. Petersburg Times reported in September 2007. Bills yanking state pension funds from countries suspected of engaging in genocide or sponsored terror became so popular, the National Conference of State Legislatures kept a list. But it wasn’t until October 2007 that California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a related bill, prohibiting the state’s pension funds from investing in companies doing business in Iran. It had already done the same with Sudan in 2006, before Florida — but that wasn’t Crist’s claim. He said Florida signed the first divestment act concerning companies doing business with Iran. Media reports and official pronouncements support Crist’s story. We rate his claim True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2010-10-24T17:16:59	2010-10-24	['Iran']

pomt-01403	In the 38 Studios deal, "Wall Street investors took a risk, and went bust."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/12/allan-fung/allan-fung-claims-wall-street-investors-went-bust-/	In the drama that's playing out over who should be the next governor of Rhode Island, a key role is being played by a character known as "Wall Street." You can see it in the "Bust" commercial from Republican gubernatorial candidate Allan Fung. It's an attack on his Democratic rival, Gina Raimondo, a venture capitalist who was elected general treasurer four years ago. The underlying issue is 38 Studios, the now-defunct video-game company created by former Boston Red Sox star Curt Schilling. Before the company went bankrupt, the state gave it a loan guarantee of $75 million. Whether the state is obligated to pay off the investors who purchased the bonds continues to be a hot topic in Rhode Island. With interest, the total payment would be $112.6 million over 10 years. "Wall Street investors took a risk, and went bust," Fung's commercial says. "But Gina Raimondo wants to use our money to bail them out. A former Wall Street financier herself, Raimondo's looking out for Wall Street, not Main Street." It's well known that Raimondo thinks the state should pay the holders of the "moral obligation" bonds and Fung thinks Rhode Island should not. For this fact-check, we’re going to focus on whether Wall Street investors really went bust on the 38 Studios deal. But first, a slight diversion. We also had considered checking whether it’s accurate to call Raimondo a "former Wall Street financier," a phrase that implies significant power, influence and -- in the aftermath of the the Great Recession -- questionable dealings. Fung spokesman Robert Coupe said the campaign was referring to the first venture capital firm Raimondo worked for, Village Ventures, which has an office in midtown Manhattan. It may not have had an office directly in New York City's financial district, but the "Wall Street" phrase "refers to the financial services industry in general, not just firms that are physically located on Wall Street or at the southern tip of Manhattan," Coupe said. Raimondo spokeswoman Nicole Kayner said the term doesn't apply because "Wall Street is investment banks, people who trade in stocks and bonds. It's not something Gina ever did." Instead, she said, Raimondo traveled to areas of the country "under-served" by capital to find and help finance entrepreneurs starting companies. We contacted more than a half dozen of the top U.S. business schools looking for experts to provide some guidance on this general question. Only one even wanted to venture an opinion, which was that, unless you're a major player, the accepted definition for "Wall Street financier" is as firm as jelly. The evidence on the second statement -- whether "Wall Street investors . . . went bust" as a result of the 38 Studios deal -- is much clearer. The 38 Studios bonds were sold in three blocks totaling $75 million; buyers were promised interest rates ranging from 6 percent to 7.75 percent annually. After 38 Studios went bankrupt, there was much debate over whether Rhode Island should repay the bonds. Ultimately, in June, the General Assembly and Gov. Lincoln Chafee approved a budget that included the $12.3 million due to 38 Studios bondholders this year. It was the second state payment for the loan. Last year the state made an initial payment of $2.5 million as the bonds became due. In short, the bondholders are getting their money, contrary to what Fung's commercial suggests. Even if the state were to renege someday, the bonds come with insurance from Assured Guaranty Municipal Corporation, a AA-rated bond insurer. If the state stopped payment, the insurance company would be on the hook to pay the investors. In an email, Coupe said that "went bust" is a reference to 38 Studios itself, which went bankrupt. "The graphic on the screen during this line refers specifically to the 38 Studios bankruptcy," he said. But the narrator specifically says, "Wall Street investors took a risk, and went bust." Asked about the insurance, Coupe said, "If the State of Rhode Island does not appropriate the funds to repay investors, then insurance coverage may repay the investors, but that insurance coverage does not operate as a guarantee. "It is accurate, therefore, to say that the investors went bust, although they may at some future point be made whole either by a state guaranty or insurance coverage," he said. "But both of those potential forms of repayment are conditional on other factors." Our ruling We'll leave it up to readers to decide whether Allan Fung is correct in calling Gina Raimondo "a former Wall Street financier." But when Fung's TV commercial says that "Wall Street investors . . . went bust" on the 38 Studios deal, it's clear that those investors are doing just fine. The state is making its payments on schedule. Even if Fung had said that the investors "might" go bust in the future, that seems highly unlikely, thanks to the insurance that came with the sale. We rate his characterization of what happened to the 38 Studio's Wall Street investors as False.

pomt-11496	"Under the previous administration it was … $100 to fill a car. American energy has delivered. Now it's $60. That’s $40 you have in your pocket … that you wouldn’t have."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/feb/26/ryan-zinke/ryan-zinke-wrong-gas-prices-are-down-40-under-trum/	Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke touted the Trump administration’s efforts on reducing gasoline prices and, in the process, beefing up Americans’ disposable income. "As good as the tax bill is, when America pulls up to a pump, and they fill their car up, under the previous administration it was 2 bucks, 4 bucks, 6 bucks, $100 to fill a car," Zinke said at the conservative CPAC conference on Feb. 23. "American energy has delivered. Now it's $60. That’s $40 you have in your pocket — every American that would fill up at a pump station — that you wouldn’t have." (The comment is around the 7:20 mark in this C-SPAN video.) Have gas prices fallen? It’s possible to come up with a 40 percent decline — but the decline came under President Barack Obama, not President Donald Trump. According to the federal Energy Information Administration, the peak gasoline price under Obama was $3.96 a gallon in mid May 2011. The low price under Trump was $2.33 — the week he was inaugurated in 2017. That’s a 40 percent decline, but the drop came entirely on Obama’s watch. For the final two and a half years of Obama’s tenure, the average gallon of gas went no higher than $3.50. It hit a low of $1.73 in February 2016, lower than at any point in the Trump presidency. Under Trump, the price at the pump has trended upward. From $2.33 at Trump’s inauguration, it rose to $2.56 in mid February 2018. That’s an increase of almost 10 percent. Here’s the full data for gasoline prices under Obama and Trump: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Did Trump’s pro-resource development policies make a difference? Probably not on gasoline prices so far, experts say. Most of the ramp-up in oil production that benefited consumer prices occurred during what critics have derided as Obama's "war on fossil fuels," said Severin Borenstein, a professor of business administration and public policy at the University of California-Berkeley's Haas School of Business. He added that Trump policies on drilling may make a difference going forward. "To the extent that looser environmental regulations allow greater oil production in the future, that will increase downward pressure on oil prices, and gasoline prices," Borenstein said. Still, the future price drops from Trump policies may not be massive. "Increased oil production in the United States has put some downward pressure on crude prices, though that is hardly the only factor in the decline of gasoline prices," he said. The Interior Department did not get back to us. Our ruling Zinke said, "Under the previous administration it was … $100 to fill a car. American energy has delivered. Now it's $60. That’s $40 you have in your pocket … that you wouldn’t have." The only 40 percent drop in the recent data occurred on Obama’s watch, meaning that Trump’s policies couldn’t have influenced it. On Trump’s watch, the price of gasoline has actually risen by 10 percent. We rate the statement False.

Obama worked on some of the deepest issues we had and was successful in a bipartisan way."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/08/barack-obama/he-worked-with-republicans-in-illinois/	In a TV ad, Barack Obama is praised by Kirk Dillard, a Republican state senator in Illinois. "Sen. Obama worked on some of the deepest issues we had and was successful in a bipartisan way," Dillard says. We find the claim to be true. Yes, Obama worked with Republican members on some of the thorniest facing the Illinois General Assemby--even when it meant making his Democratic colleagues mad. The legislature had not overhauled state ethics and finance laws for 25 years. Obama worked with a bipartisan group of four legislators, including Dillard, convened by former U.S. Sen. Paul Simon and the Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University. "Obama worked very well with the other members of the group," said Mike Lawrence, executive director of what is now known as the Paul Simon Public Policy Center. Lawrence said that Obama favored more sweeping reforms than Republicans and others did, but was willing to compromise. The work resulted in the Gift Ban Act of 1988. Obama worked with other Republicans on such issues as health insurance for kids and the state's death penalty--not an issue normally associated with bipartisan work between a liberal Democrat and Republicans. Viewers may have watched the ad and decided Dillard was supporting Obama for president. But Dillard made the ad, despite saying that as a loyal Republican, he has endorsed Sen. John McCain for his party's presidential nomination--a fact that he did not mention in the ad.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2007-09-08T00:00:00	2007-09-11	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-14789	"Ted Cruz tried to ban contraception" five times.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/02/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-exaggerated-claim-ted-cruz-tried-/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called out Republican rival Ted Cruz for a contradiction on contraception after Cruz made a widely aired comment about condoms on his college campus. It started when Cruz mocked a consistent charge from Democrats that Republicans are against birth control during a Nov. 30, 2015, campaign stop in Bettendorf, Iowa. "Last I checked," Cruz said, "we don’t have a rubber shortage in America. Look, when I was in college, we had a machine in the bathroom, you put 50 cents in and voila. So, yes, anyone who wants contraceptives can access them, but it’s an utter made-up nonsense issue." The Clinton campaign didn’t think much of his comment, challenging Cruz with a post on its website headlined, "Ted Cruz says no one's trying to ban contraception. Here are 5 times Ted Cruz tried to ban contraception." It added, "Cruz has personally tried to make it harder for women to get birth control." The post’s fine print includes more nuanced language than the headline lets on -- that Cruz is "trying to limit access to contraception," "tried to make it harder for women to get birth control," and is pursuing policies that "could ban some forms of birth control." The details in the softened (and more accurate) statements are lost in the blaring headline that Cruz "tried to ban contraception" five times." None of the Clinton campaign’s examples supports the idea that Cruz seeks a flat-out ban on contraception. The Clinton campaign took issue with our characterization of the post, saying that they never meant for the headline to say that Cruz tried to ban all contraceptives on five separate occasions. However, we think ours is the most obvious interpretation of the language in question. 1. "The time he supported a so-called personhood amendment, which could criminalize abortion and could ban some forms of birth control." This example offers the most support for Cruz trying to ban contraception, but it still overreaches. Cruz signed a "personhood affirmation" circulated by Georgia Right to Life this summer that commits him to a "human life amendment" to the U.S. Constitution that would define life as beginning at fertilization. As we have noted, the impact of such proposed "personhood" amendments on birth control is in dispute. Opponents, along with some legal scholars and medical organizations, say that giving a fertilized egg all the rights of a person could make several FDA-approved contraceptives illegal. But that would depend on how courts interpret personhood. A "personhood" provision has not yet passed at the federal or state level. Even more complicated is the meaning of "fertilization," according to a 2011 op-ed in the New York Times by Glenn Cohen, co-director of Harvard University’s Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics, and Jonathan Will, law professor at Mississippi College. Fertilization, they wrote, could mean at least four different things: "penetration of the egg by a sperm," successful combination of the genetic information from sperm and egg, activation of the genetic information, or implantation of the embryo in the uterus, Cohen and Will wrote. Sperm penetration occurs almost immediately, but implantation can take up to two weeks. "Thus, on some reasonable readings of the amendment, certain forms of birth control ... would seem impermissible, while on other equally reasonable readings they are not." A relatively narrow judicial interpretation could allow the use of the pill and intrauterine devices, or IUDs, while a broader interpretation may not. But even if an enacted personhood amendment was interpreted by judges in the most expansive fashion possible, it would still not limit spermicides and -- notably given Cruz’s comments -- condoms, since these prevent fertilization from taking place at all. So the first of Clinton’s examples holds some plausibility as supporting evidence for her overall claim, but it’s overly broad in suggesting that Cruz would ban all contraception and more speculative than she lets on. 2. "The time he was willing to shut down the government to cut funding from Planned Parenthood." Cruz was indeed willing to shut down the federal government if lawmakers and President Barack Obama maintained federal funding of Planned Parenthood. (Combined, state and federal funding accounts for about 41 percent of Planned Parenthood’s yearly revenue, or about $528 million, according to the group’s most recent annual report.) "It will be a decision of the president's and the president's alone whether he would veto funding for the federal government because of a commitment to ensuring taxpayer dollars continue to flow to what appears to be a national criminal organization," Cruz said in August 2015. But even if this shutdown had happened -- and it didn’t -- the result would have been more indirect than an attempted ban on contraception. At most, it might have hampered the ability of individuals to receive contraceptives from one specific provider, albeit a significant one. 3. "The time he called for the Supreme Court to turn women’s personal health decisions over to their employers by striking down the Obamacare birth control co-pay provision" in the Hobby Lobby ruling. In Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that a closely held, private corporation could decline on religious grounds to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. Hobby Lobby’s Christian owners said they objected to four of 20 Food and Drug Administration-approved forms of contraception that prevent implantation of the embryo. These include two forms of emergency contraception, also known as the morning-after pill, and two forms of intra-uterine devices, or IUDs. (The FDA considers these four methods to be contraception, but the company’s owners consider them to be a form of abortion.) The way the decision was written leaves some question about whether closely held, religious companies can choose to opt out of supporting any of the remaining 16 forms of contraception in their health plans. Already, some companies have been allowed by lower courts to stop paying for a wider range of contraceptives than were at issue in the Hobby Lobby case, though some of those cases are still working their way through the courts. Still, Cruz’s support for the Hobby Lobby decision does not by itself mean that he supports banning all contraceptives. First, the case involved employer co-payments for contraceptives, making it financially harder but not impossible for an individual to obtain contraceptives. And second, that case involved only four of the 20 FDA-approved contraceptives; whether the Supreme Court might some day support a broader interpretation that permits closely held companies to opt out of all contraceptives remains to be seen. 4. "The time he tried to get rid of a law that made it so women couldn’t be fired for their personal reproductive decisions (including birth control)." The Washington, D.C., law in question -- the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014 -- says employers cannot use their personal beliefs to discriminate against an employee for his or her reproductive health choices. Cruz took issue with the law in his capacity as a member of Congress, which is allowed a 30-day period to object to D.C. laws. (Congressional opponents were unable to derail the law, which would have also required the cooperation of Obama.) The potential to be fired or demoted from a job for using contraception is a heavy penalty. Still, opposing this bill is not the same thing as advocating for a ban on contraception. 5. "And the time he used a medically and scientifically incorrect argument to try to ban emergency contraception." The Clinton campaign cites an article in the liberal publication Salon.com that takes Cruz to task for saying that the federal government wants to make private companies (like those in the Hobby Lobby case) provide "abortifacients" to employees. The article draws a distinction between abortifacients, such as the pill RU-486, and "emergency contraceptives" that may be taken up to three days after unprotected sex. The medical community also draws a distinction between the two methods. The Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, for instance, writes that RU-486 "ends pregnancy" whereas emergency contraception "prevent(s) unintended pregnancy." The group states flatly that "emergency contraception is not the same as medical abortion." A potential gray area -- emphasized by anti-abortion advocates -- is that emergency contraception may take effect after fertilization has already taken place. Regardless of how early that occurs, this is enough for some abortion opponents to classify it as causing a pregnancy to be aborted. Setting aside this difference of opinion, it’s not clear that this example supports Clinton’s overall point that Cruz has sought to "ban contraception." By focusing on "emergency contraception," it addresses Cruz’s position on one type of contraception but not all types. Our ruling The post on Clinton’s website claims "Ted Cruz tried to ban contraception" five times. There’s little doubt that Cruz is a strong opponent of abortion, and as such, he and other anti-abortion advocates find certain types of contraception objectionable. But the Clinton campaign’s examples don’t exactly show Cruz trying to push across-the-board bans on contraception. The strongest conclusion about Cruz’s views that one could draw from these examples is that he might support a ban on certain types of contraception (but not all) through his support for a personhood amendment. The other examples are even more limited and deal with what employers would be required to pay for, for instance, or whether a major birth control provider should continue to receive federal funding. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11202	"In 2016, an officer was assaulted in America on an average of every 10 minutes."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/15/donald-trump/police-officer-assaulted-every-10-minutes/	President Donald Trump lamented the number of assaults on police officers at a ceremony honoring fallen officers on Capitol Hill. "In 2016, an officer was assaulted in America on an average of every 10 minutes, can you believe that?" Trump said on May 15, 2018. "It's outrageous, and it’s unacceptable. We must end the attacks on our police, and we must end them right now. We believe criminals who kill our police should get the death penalty. Bring it forth." Is that true? Trump’s numbers are based on data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. But factoring in the growing population of Americans and police shows the rate isn’t as constant as Trump made it sound. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The FBI reported that 57,180 officers were victims of line-of-duty assaults in 2016. With 525,600 minutes in a year, that breaks down to an assault every 9.19 minutes. Adjusting for the 10 percent of agencies that didn’t report any data, that’s an officer assaulted every 10.3 minutes. Some of the actions that legally count as an assault may not have resulted in pain inflicted on the officer, such as a drunk person shoving an officer. A shove carries the same weight as a stabbing by this measure. Of the 57,180 officers who were victims of assault, 28.9 percent (or 16,535 officers) sustained injuries. About three-quarters of the assaults did not involve a weapon other than hands, fists, or feet. Firearms were used in 4.2 percent of incidents and knives in 1.9 percent, according to the FBI. The rate of police deaths is much lower. In 2016, 52 law enforcement officers died in accidents and 66 were deliberately killed, according to the FBI. Those numbers have been decreasing over the past few decades. Trump called out one kind of assault in particular during his speech: "One of the most alarming crimes taking place against our police are ambush attacks. Think of that! Ambush attacks!" But ambush attacks are rare, according to Safiya Jafari Simmons, communications director at the Center for Policing Equity. Ambush attacks were responsible for 270 of the 57,180 officer assaults. Most assaults resulted from officers intervening in disturbances, effectuating arrests, or transporting prisoners. Trump’s use of the rate of assaults per minute, known as the crime clock, isn’t a sound practice, said James Fox, Lipman Family Professor of Criminology, Law, and Public Policy at Northeastern University. The statistic divides the number of minutes, not police officers, by attacks. But as the general and police populations grow, the clock still has the same number of minutes. Also, Trump’s statistic isn’t an average of different regions but an aggregate of national assaults. The frequency of assault, then, would change depending on the area. A single city has fewer total police assaults than the country, but the clock has the same number of minutes; the frequency would be lower even in the cities with most assaults. Dividing assaults by total police officers is more telling, Fox said. By that measure, on average, an officer has a 9.8 percent chance of being assaulted per year. Our ruling Trump said a police officer is assaulted every 10 minutes in 2016. That math works out if you divide the number of minutes in a year by the FBI’s count of line-of-duty assaults. There are a few points to remember about this particular statistic. This count doesn’t just isolate incidents where a wound was inflicted, such as a shooting and stabbing, so incidents such as shoving and kicking are also considered an assault. Also, a criminologist warned that the "crime clock" method does not really tell you that much, because it does not factor in the growing U.S. and police populations. Trump's statement is accurate but requires additional context. We rate it Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-05-15T16:25:18	2018-05-15	['United_States']

pomt-02857	Rhode Island's unemployment insurance system "is the most expensive such system in the country."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/nov/17/kenneth-block/ken-block-says-rhode-islands-unemployment-insuranc/	With every candidate promising more jobs, lower taxes, better education, and an end to fraud and abuse, voters face a daunting task when they try to figure out whether a candidate actually has specific proposals for tackling such problems. When Ken Block, a Republican candidate for governor, was asked about saving money during a Nov. 8, 2013, appearance on Rhode Island Public Radio, he said one potential source of savings was the state's unemployment system, financed by a tax companies pay to cover benefits for workers who lose their jobs. "When we attack our unemployment insurance system, which is the most expensive such system in the country, and we bring those costs into line with how other states run their program and what it costs for those other programs, I believe we should be able to save somewhere between another $50 [million] and $80 million annually year over year over year, which could be another third of a billion over four years," he said. PolitiFact doesn't rate predictions. But Block’s claim that Rhode Island has the most expensive unemployment system in the country -- a claim he has made repeatedly, including in a Nov. 13, 2013, Providence Journal commentary -- is a checkable statement. We emailed his campaign and asked for its evidence. Block’s policy director, Matthew Schweich, sent us a link to the "2014 State Business Tax Climate Index," published by The Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group. It ranks Rhode Island as 46 out of the 50 states, based on a complicated scale that assesses how well a state's tax system enhances or harms the competitiveness of the state’s business environment. In a category that compares unemployment insurance systems, Rhode Island ranks the worst. But Block didn't say the state has the worst system. He said it has the most expensive. The report doesn't have a state-by-state comparison of expense. In fact, Rhode Island was not ranked worst in any of the measures quantified in the report. The state has the sixth-highest minimum tax rate charged to employers and the 10th-highest maximum tax rate. Its taxable wage base -- the income level beyond which employers don't have to pay additional tax -- is higher in 14 other states, according to The Tax Foundation report. When we raised this issue with Block's office, Schweich argued in an email that, "You can’t measure the overall cost of a program by evaluating just a single metric. So, even if Rhode Island isn’t ranked absolute bottom in any individual category, the cumulative effect of being ranked near the bottom across many categories can demonstrate that, overall, RI’s system is the most expensive." He also argued that there are many ways to define "expensive." "Does it mean the cost to the state? The cost to employers? The economic and reputational cost to Rhode Island of being ranked bottom?" he wrote. "The Tax Foundation has produced the most detailed ranking of [unemployment insurance] programs, so we used it as a basis for this statement. We were satisfied with the methodology." Then we called The Tax Foundation and spoke to Joseph Henchman, coauthor of the study. He said a ranking of 50 out of 50 didn't necessarily make Rhode Island's program the most expensive. Other factors are considered as well. "We're measuring both expense and compliance and administrative costs," he said, explaining that the foundation would prefer to characterize Rhode Island's system as the most burdensome or the most complex. For example, one reason Rhode Island scored low in the rankings was because a local business has to be in operation three years before its actual track record for hiring and firing employees is used to set its unemployment insurance tax rate. Until then, the business is simply assigned a rate, which can be unfair to a company with a steady employee base. In most states, a business' experience rating is set after one year. Instead, Henchman sent us a 2011 report he authored that focused solely on state unemployment insurance programs. In a comparison of the average unemployment tax rates, Rhode Island ranked third highest behind Idaho and Oregon for 2010, and in a comparison of the average weekly unemployment insurance benefits, the state ranked fourth highest, behind Hawaii, New Jersey and Massachusetts. And that was before Rhode Island implemented a series of changes, still being phased in, that will decrease the average weekly benefit over time, according to Henchman's study. Finally, we looked at a recent report from the U.S. Department of Labor. The state-by-state ranking of tax rates that employers paid on total wages in the second quarter of 2012 shows Rhode Island ranked as the fifth highest, behind Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho and Oregon, all of which taxed more. In the ranking of the average weekly benefit paid to the unemployed in the second quarter of 2013, Rhode Island came in 10th behind Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wyoming, all of which paid more. Our ruling Ken Block said Rhode Island's unemployment insurance system "is the most expensive such system in the country." If he had said we were AMONG the most expensive, he would be on solid ground. But he has repeatedly insisted that Rhode Island's program is THE most expensive. The only evidence he supplied was a Tax Foundation report that doesn't directly evaluate the expense of the system. And other measures, from the foundation itself and U.S. Department of Labor, say it's not the most expensive. Because Block was unequivocal, we will be as well. We rate his statement as False.

pomt-00517	Says Hillary Clinton "was completely exonerated, when I was in the White House" by an official inquiry on Whitewater.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/23/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-hillary-was-completely-exonerate/	Before the little blue dress and the tearful intern, there were 220 acres of prime Ozarks riverfront and a missing ledger of billing statements. While the Clintons’ Whitewater controversy often takes a backseat to the more notorious and sensational Lewinsky scandal, former President Bill Clinton remembers it well (and probably less wincingly). Appearing on CNN’s State of the Union, Clinton evoked Whitewater as an earlier instance when the American people were told his wife was untrustworthy, but it was then proven otherwise. "I remember when Hillary was completely exonerated, when I was in the White House, in all that Whitewater business," Clinton said on June 14. "An official federal inquiry said that her billing records, they wished for her sake could have been found earlier, because they completely corroborated everything she'd said." (In a separate report, we looked at Bill Clinton's other comments about media coverage of Whitewater.) The investigations into Whitewater and the tangled web of the pre-Lewinsky scandals dragged on for six years and grew increasingly complicated, tedious, and impenetrable. Roughly $50 million later, none of the investigations found much evidence against the Clintons. Yet friends, foes, and the general public alike agree on one thing: Whitewater was so boring ("by design," writes Ann Coulter) that it became fascinating. So what exactly happened? What were the charges, and was Hillary "completely exonerated" as Bill says? Whitewater refresher "All that Whitewater business" began with a real estate investment made by then-Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton in 1978. The Clintons along with developer James McDougal borrowed about $200,000 to buy and turn riverfront property into vacation homes. They formed the Whitewater Development Corp. with the initial investment, which was heavily subsidized by McDougal. The homes didn’t sell well, but McDougal and the Clintons kept the business going, and McDougal did occasional political fundraising for Clinton. In 1985, McDougal hired Rose Law Firm (where then-Arkansas First Lady Hillary Clinton was a partner) to do legal work for Madison Guaranty, his savings and loans. Later, when the investigations began, Rose Law Firm’s billing record for the thrift, signed off by Hillary Clinton, could not be found. Madison Guaranty failed in 1989, costing taxpayers an estimated $60 million. McDougal, who had been removed as its president three years earlier, was indicted for fraud for making bad loans. About $134,000 was funneled through Whitewater. The Clintons, who had retained interest in Whitewater throughout, sold their share to McDougal for $1,000 in 1992. During the first year of Bill Clinton’s presidency, the Resolution Trust Corp., a temporary federal agency tasked with investigating failed savings and loans, named the Clintons as "potential beneficiaries" of Madison Guaranty's and McDougal’s illegal activities. That summer, Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster committed suicide, a few months after he filed delinquent tax returns for Whitewater. The charge against the Clintons As the scandal began to snowball, so did the questions (and conspiracies): What happened to Vince Foster? How did the billing records go missing? Did the White House cooperate with investigators or try to thwart them? But the overarching charge was this: Did the Clintons benefit from Whitewater-related fraud or, at the very least, was Hillary Clinton aware of it? The Clintons denied knowledge of and participation in any wrongdoings. In 1994, a special counsel was appointed to look into the Clintons’ involvement in McDougal’s activities (he would later be replaced by the now-famous Kenneth Starr), while the RTC hired law firm Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro to independently investigate. The Senate and House began to hold hearings on the matter in 1995. Overall, Whitewater was the subject of at least four separate but overlapping federal probes encompassing more than 50,000 pages of documents. Out of many reports, one So which inquiry was Bill Clinton referring to? His spokesperson wouldn’t speak on the record, but based on Clinton’s past claims, it is likely the former president is talking about Pillsbury’s supplemental 1995 report. "In mid-December, the complete Whitewater story finally came out, when the RTC inquiry from Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro was released," he wrote in his 2004 autobiography, My Life. "It said, as had the preliminary report in June, that there were no grounds for a civil suit against us in Whitewater, much less any criminal action, and it recommended that the investigation be closed." This description is more specific than Clinton’s 2015 remarks that his wife was "completely exonerated" and, after the discovery of the missing billing records. At the time of the December report’s release, the Clinton administration and Democrats had also lauded it as exoneration. Bruce Ericson, the Pillsbury lawyer who authored the reports, told us even back then he didn't agree with the Clintons’ characterization, given that Pillsbury’s charge was to weigh the pros and cons of a lawsuit. "(The reports) didn’t condemn them, but it wasn’t our place to make that sort of judgment," he said. "We were a bit uneasy about that word. I’m being lawyerly here, but that’s my job. We found a lawsuit against them would not be cost-effective or meritorious." In the preliminary and supplemental reports, which were both authored before the billing records were found, Pillsbury deemed that the RTC had "no cost-effective claims" against the Clintons, as they could not find evidence of the First Couple’s involvement or awareness in Madison Guaranty-related fraud. The law firm wrote (page 2020): "There is no basis to charge the Clintons with any kind of primary liability for fraud or intentional misconduct. This investigation has revealed no evidence to support any such claims. Nor would the record support any secondary or derivative liability for the possible misdeeds of others." Ericson’s sentiments were also echoed in the report, which noted that its conclusion (page 1945) "doesn’t necessarily mean that ... the evidence exonerates anyone, it simply means that no basis has been found to sue anyone." Other reports The mid-December Pillsbury report is one of many Whitewater reports. The law firm itself issued at least half a dozen, including two in late December 1995, just a few weeks after the supplemental report. While one report concluded that Hillary Clinton denied having knowledge of fraud and "the circumstances support her" (page 3307), the other stated that the RTC had grounds to sue Rose Law Firm for failing to disclose conflicts of interest that could have damaged the RTC, though a lawsuit wouldn’t be cost-effective (page 1465). After the missing billing records surfaced, Pillsbury released yet another report in February 1996 stating the discovery of the new evidence didn’t change the December conclusions. But, it noted, the records show that Hillary Clinton "performed more services for Madison Guaranty than previously known" (page 328). The Senate’s special Whitewater committee, which was Republican controlled, issued a more damning report, which dealt largely with the White House’s conduct during the probes rather than the Clintons’ culpability in fraud. (The Starr report similarly began as a liability investigation but turned into a Lewinsky probe that only mentioned Whitewater once in passing.) "Mrs. Clinton has minimized her role in the Rose Law Firm’s representation of Madison," the special committee wrote (page 156), "The billing records ... directly contradict Mrs. Clinton’s claim that her role on the matter was merely to serve as a ‘backstop.’ " Objecting to the "partisanship (that) has colored the Majority’s decisions," Democrats on the special committee also released minority views, stating, "No credible evidence has been put forward to show that Mrs. Clinton engaged in any improper, much less illegal, conduct." Different readings The partisan divide over Hillary Clinton’s innocence extends beyond Capitol Hill. Conservative groups and journalists say the inquiries do the opposite of corroborate Hillary Clinton’s story and they in fact incriminate her ethically, if not legally. Given that Whitewater resulted in Bill Clinton’s impeachment and 16 related convictions, "the idea that Hillary Clinton was ‘completely exonerated’ is not true," said a spokesperson for David Bossie, a former Whitewater investigator and now president of the conservative nonprofit Citizens United. He also pointed us to a May 1996 article in which another Pillsbury lawyer disagreed with the White House’s take on the report. Liberal observers, however, say her legal liability is precisely what matters. "She wasn't found not guilty. She was never charged with anything except by innuendo in the media," said Arkansas Times columnist Gene Lyons. "It's hard to say somebody was ‘exonerated’ when they were never actually charged. But HRC was certainly accused in the press, and her accusers certainly ignored the report that said she hadn't done anything wrong." (We checked out that claim, too.) "It isn’t up to the Clintons to prove their innocence," added Salon columnist Joe Conason. Our ruling Bill Clinton said his wife "was completely exonerated, when I was in the White House" by an official inquiry on Whitewater. A December 1995 report by the independent law firm Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro report found no evidence of the Clintons’ and particularly Hillary Clinton’s participation in fraud. Pillsbury’s task was to assess whether federal regulators could justify a lawsuit legally and cost-effectively. The report found that they couldn't, but the report and its authors didn’t and still don’t view their findings as exoneration. While some take issue with the word "exoneration," Bill Clinton’s broader point that his wife wasn’t found guilty is accurate. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-15304	"ISIS supporter tweeted at 10:34 a.m. Shooting began at 10:45 a.m." in Chattanooga, Tenn.	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/21/pamela-geller/pam-geller-spreads-false-claim-about-isis-linked-t/	As the public waited for details about the Chattanooga, Tenn., shooting attack that left five servicemen dead, anti-Islam activist Pamela Geller claimed that an ISIS supporter knew about the shooting before it happened. The shooting started at a military recruiting center on July 16, 2015, at 10:45 a.m. local time. Geller said the tweet from an ISIS supporter with #Chattanooga came 11 minutes before the attack at 10:34 a.m. (That supporter’s account has since been suspended.) Geller thought she was on to something, and the story spread to Robert Spencer’s "Jihad Watch" before taking off across other media channels. But the ISIS "warning" tweet wasn’t a warning so much as eerie post-attack commentary. What happened shows what can go wrong when you jump to conclusions about Twitter’s timestamps. The ISIS supporter’s tweet was actually published at 10:34 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, which means it was shared almost three hours after the shooting began. This became clear by Thursday evening, when Bret Baier shared on The O’Reilly Factor that the ISIS tweet was posted after the shooting took place. (The liberal website Media Matters for America published a timeline of the events as they spread on Fox News; the ISIS-tweet narrative lasted several hours.) The ISIS tweet spread like wildfire before people noticed the real timestamp of the pro-ISIS tweet. In an interview with PunditFact, Geller said that at the time she wrote her tweet, she was not aware that "Twitter's time stamping was not uniform." "I updated the post when new information became available," Geller said. We have not been able to find any additional tweets from Geller indicating the incorrect timestamp from her first tweet, which is still still published online. Geller did post an update to one of her website articles about the ISIS tweet and timestamp issue. Another article on her website has not yet been updated. Authorities are still investigating whether there is an ISIS connection. The shooter, Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, was killed by police. On her website, Geller points out that the ISIS tweet was posted before the shooter was named or "before we knew that the killer was a devout Muslim waging jihad," which to her is enough proof that the shooting was at least ISIS-inspired. Other news sources have been more careful in describing Abdulazeez’s possible motivations or allegiances. ABC News described Abdulazeez as a "disturbed (and) suicidal" man who wrote about "becoming a martyr." Still, Abdulazeez apparently called ISIS a "stupid group … completely against Islam" during a conversation with a friend, according to CNN. There are also different interpretations of Abdulazeez’s seven-month trip to Jordan. Family members said the trip was intended to "get (Abdulazeez) away from bad influences in the U.S." A government source told CBS that Abdulazeez did not travel outside of Jordan during his visit and there is no proof of him visiting Iraq or Syria. But a close friend of Abdulazeez said he changed after coming back. Our ruling Geller claimed that an ISIS supporter tweeted ahead of the Chattanooga shooting. The claim gained a lot of traction before it became clear that the tweet happened a few hours after the shooting. Geller updated the original post, but it did little to stuff the rumor back into the bag. We rate the claim False.

House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman James Oberstar, D-Minn., recently unveiled a new plan to invest $65-billion immediately in replacing or repairing bridges. Rather than redirecting money in the highway bill, Oberstar has proposed establishing a dedicated fund for bridge repair.

pomt-09187	"The Interior Department has only 30 days to review an exploration plan submitted by an oil company. That leaves no time for the appropriate environmental review. The result is, they are continually waived."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/01/barack-obama/obama-blames-30-day-limit-law-role-oil-spill/	As anger grows over the massive, uncontained oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the procedure for issuing federal drilling permits for the Gulf Coast has begun to attract intense scrutiny. During a May 27, 2010, press conference, President Barack Obama -- under pressure for the failure to stem the underwater leak -- laid a large portion of the blame on the existing law that governs the permitting process, as well as the regulations to implement that law, which were drawn up by the Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department office that oversees oil and gas leases. "What's also been made clear from this disaster is that, for years, the oil and gas industry has leveraged such power that they have effectively been allowed to regulate themselves," Obama said. "One example, under current law, the Interior Department has only 30 days to review an exploration plan submitted by an oil company. That leaves no time for the appropriate environmental review. The result is, they are continually waived. And this is just one example of a law that was tailored by the industry to serve their needs instead of the public's. So Congress needs to address these issues as soon as possible, and my administration will work with them to do so." We wondered whether the president is correct that the law mandates such a short period for an environmental review. The law in question is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The law was originally passed in 1953, though the amendments relevant to the Obama's statement were added in 1978. Under the law, a proposal to drill must pass through several stages before it can be approved. First, the Interior Department must choose the locations it will open to leasing. Then, the department puts those areas up for lease. Once a lease is purchased by an energy company, the leaseholder must submit an "exploration plan" to the Interior Secretary before exercising its right to drill. Interior Department regulations specify that the regional supervisor of MMS has 15 working days after receiving a proposed plan to rule a submission packet complete. At that point, a 30-day clock starts ticking. If the secretary finds problems during this period, modifications can be ordered or, if modifications are insufficient to solve the problem, the lease can be canceled. But if the secretary finds the plan acceptable, it must be approved within that same 30-day window. So Obama is correct about the law's 30-day limit. He's also correct that complete waivers of environmental impact reviews are common. The Interior Department says that in recent years, MMS has granted 250 to 400 waivers annually for Gulf of Mexico projects alone. (The department was unable to provide PolitiFact with the number of cases in which a waiver was not granted.) The Deepwater Horizon project had been given a "categorical exclusion" from detailed environmental review more than a year before the disaster occurred -- a decision that is supposed to be granted to projects that are expected to have minimal environmental impact. Meanwhile, on Obama's assertion that 30 days is too short a window to conduct a credible environmental review -- much less a plan to respond to a major malfunction -- many experts we spoke to agreed with the president. In general, then, Obama's statement is on target. But we think it's worth noting that the 30-day limit is not the only factor that explains the failure of MMS to study the environmental impact of Gulf of Mexico projects. The exploration plan Obama referenced is not the only environmental study that is supposed to be conducted during this process. Studies are also required when the lease locations are chosen and when the leases are sold, and they don't have statutory time limits. Critics say that, in their current form, these earlier-stage studies do not include enough detail on the specific drilling locations to qualify as a full-scale environmental assessment. But if MMS -- or Congress, or the industry -- had wanted to beef up these earlier studies as a way of getting around the 30-day limit, they could have done so. But they never did. In their absence, the courts have sometimes stepped in: In 2009, a federal appeals court threw out the initial five-year leasing plan for drilling in Alaska's Chukchi Sea, citing shortcomings in the plan's environmental assessment. Holly Doremus, a law professor at the University of California-Berkeley who has studied the MMS permitting process, called it "a bit disingenuous" for Obama to focus solely on the 30-day limit. "The categorical exclusion has never been formally justified by the short time line, and so far as I know MMS has never -- until after this blow-out -- asked Congress for more time to review exploration plans," she said in an interview. "I think rather that MMS has thought, and acted, as if it didn't need to do detailed environmental review at the exploration plan stage" because it does them at the two earlier stages. "If that review were more thorough, and considered true worst-case scenarios, it might well be the case that 30 days would be enough to look at the environmental impacts of exploration in a particular location," she said. Meanwhile, some say that Congress ought to shoulder a portion of the blame for letting an inadequate permitting process fester for more than 30 years. "If that is too short for a review, then Congress should change it," Gary Wolfram, an economics and public policy professor at Hillsdale College. "My suspicion is that, as with all central planners, Congress doesn’t know the proper amount of time it takes to review a project.'' Belatedly, Congress -- prodded, also belatedly, by the Obama administration -- is looking to change the rules. On May 11, 2010, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar released a legislative package that includes a proposal to eliminate the 30-day deadline. "Changing this 30-day mandatory deadline to a 90-day timeline that can be further extended to complete environmental and safety reviews, as needed, would provide MMS more time to conduct additional environmental analysis on an exploration plan," the department said in its announcement. Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, sought to attach the change to a supplemental spending bill before the congressional Memorial Day recess, but the effort was unsuccessful. Supporters vow to push on. "I am not aware of any pending free-standing legislation on this, but I do know that Congress will revisit the topic when it gets back," said Bill Wicker, a spokesman for Bingaman. Ultimately, Obama was correct on everything he said about the law -- the 30-day limit, the difficulties of conducting a full study in that time frame, and the frequent waivers. But we're marking him down slightly for implying that the 30-day limit tied the administration's hands. If the administration had wanted to change MMS procedures short of rewriting the law, it could have done so by proposing more stringent requirements for the other environmental assessments undertaken during the permitting process, which are not time-limited under the law. And it could have pushed earlier to rewrite the law. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-06-01T15:59:35	2010-05-27	['None']
pomt-03134	"The amount of interest" paid on the federal debt exceeds "total tax revenue."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/15/chris-kapanga/interest-payments-us-debt-exceeds-us-tax-revenue-w/	State Rep. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, has taken some bold positions since he won an open Wisconsin Assembly seat in 2010 as a political newcomer. In 2011, Kapenga said he believed several people were "bought out" by police and fire unions to stop those unions from being included in Act 10. The law advanced by Gov. Scott Walker dramatically curtailed collective bargaining rights for most public workers, but, over the objection of Kapenga and others, it exempted police and firefighters. In 2012, Kapenga joined eight other GOP state lawmakers who pledged to back a bill to arrest any federal officials who try to implement President Barack Obama’s health reform law in Wisconsin. Then in an Aug. 23, 2013 newsletter to constituents, Kapenga, a certified public accountant, made a bold claim about the federal debt -- and dared his readers to check it. "As we approach the $17 trillion debt level, I want to emphasize how dangerous this is for our nation," Kapenga wrote. "An old proverb tells us that the borrower is slave to the lender, and as we continue to spend and build debt, think about who we are getting our money from. The answer is the printing press and China. He added: "When the amount of interest you pay on your debt exceeds your total tax revenue (yes it does -- check it out!), common sense tells us that all other programs are at risk." Whoa -- just the amount of interest we pay on the federal debt is more than all the tax revenue Uncle Sam takes in? Actually, not even close. When we contacted Kapenga, he admitted he had erred, saying a constituent already had pointed out that he was wrong. OK. So, how do interest payments on the debt and total tax revenue compare? Net interest payments totaled $220 billion in 2012, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Net interest payments are what most economists cite when talking about interest on the debt, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities’ Richard Kogan told us. That figure corresponds to the roughly $12 trillion in debt that we owe outside creditors, such as China. Total interest payments -- the $220 billion plus $140 billion in interest paid for intragovernmental borrowing, such as tapping surplus Social Security funds -- was about $360 billion in 2012. That corresponds with the total debt of roughly $17 trillion. Is there reason to worry, as Kapenga indicated in his newsletter? Well, CBO projects that by 2020, net interest payments -- on the debt owed to outside creditors -- will nearly triple from $220 billion per year to $644 billion per year. But even that’s a far cry from the total tax revenue the federal government takes in. Federal tax revenue in 2012 was $2.45 trillion. That’s 11 times higher than the $220 billion in net interest payments on the debt and about seven times higher than the $360 billion in total interest payments. Kapenga said he has drafted this correction for his next newsletter: "Thank you to one of my constituents who noted an error in my Aug. 23 E-Update. In my article about the danger of our U.S. debt, it stated that ‘the interest you pay on your debt exceeds your total tax revenue’ when it should have said ‘total corporate tax revenue.’" The amount of corporate tax revenue the federal government takes in is much closer to the net interest payments on the debt, but it's still higher than those payments, according to CBO. Corporate tax revenue in 2012 was $242 billion, exceeding the $220 billion in net interest payments. For 2013, the difference is projected to be even greater -- $291 billion versus $223 billion. Our rating Kapenga said "the amount of interest" paid on the federal debt exceeds the federal government’s "total tax revenue." In fact, tax revenue is a number of times higher than what the government pays in interest on the debt. We rate Kapenga’s statement False.

pomt-15110	"I'm the only governor in America ... who signed a law that says there needs to be an independent investigation any time there's a death of someone in police custody."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-im-only-governor-sign-law-requiring-i/	Less than two weeks after tying President Barack Obama to the killing of police officers, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker defended his own approach to defusing tensions between law enforcement and the communities they patrol. In an interview on CNN’s State of the Union on Sept. 13, 2015, host Jake Tapper asked Walker to explain why he thought Obama played a role in the recent violence against police. Walker said the president hasn’t spoken out enough on the issue, and that police should be both supported and held accountable. "I’m proud to say I'm the only governor in America, the first one and I believe the only one today, who signed a law that says there needs to be an independent investigation any time there's a death of someone in police custody." The August 2014 police shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., sparked calls for just such independent inquiries. We wanted to see if Walker in fact is the only governor to have approved a statewide law. According to a few legal experts, plus our review of state-level legislation, Walker is on solid ground. The Wisconsin law On April 23, 2014, months before the Brown shooting, Walker signed Act 348. The law enjoyed bipartisan support. It required that whenever an officer on or off-duty kills someone, there will be an investigation by at least two investigators, "neither of whom is employed by a law enforcement agency that employs a law enforcement officer involved in the officer-involved death." Once the investigation is complete, the report goes to the district attorney in the county where the death took place for consideration of criminal charges. If no charges are filed, the report is made public. Michael Scott is the director of the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing and clinical professor in criminology at Arizona State University. Scott told us that analysts for the Wisconsin Legislature in 2014 found no other state required an independent investigation for police-related deaths. Scott said this measure came after a 10-year effort by one family. "The push for this legislation in Wisconsin came from a coalition organized by Mr. Michael Bell, the father of a young man shot and killed by police in Wisconsin," Scott said. "Two state legislators, Sen. Gary Bies and Rep. Chris Taylor, took up his cause and sponsored the legislation that Gov. Walker signed. Gov. Walker can take credit for signing the legislation, but it was not proposed by his office." We found legislators in several states, including Connecticut, California, New York and Missouri, introduced similar measures in 2015, but so far, none have passed. We also learned from the Walker campaign that many local police departments in Wisconsin and around the country already require an independent investigation. However, those policies are not state law. A funding wrinkle There was a brief flap in Wisconsin over the money to pay for these inquiries. PolitiFact Wisconsin reported that Walker’s initial 2015 budget provided no funds. But after the attorney general, a Republican, told House budget writers that this was not a cheap endeavor, and a state report showed the state’s Justice Department had investigated 12 deaths in less than a year since the law took effect, lawmakers agreed to fund four of the five positions that were requested. Walker’s office agreed, and the governor signed a two-year budget that included $635,000 for the work. Our ruling Walker said he was the only governor to sign a bill that required an independent investigation into police-related killings. Walker signed that bill in April 2014. According to experts we reached or whose work we read, and our scan of legislation, no other state has such a law. We rate this claim True.

pomt-05077	"We’re spending $12,000 bucks a kid a year in the school system."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/jul/03/don-mcintire/does-portland-public-schools-spend-12000-year-stud/	Portlanders will vote on a $35 per person annual tax this November, aimed at helping the arts. Mayor Sam Adams, who orchestrated the plan, was on OPB’s Think Out Loud last week touting the proposal as a way to boost music and arts education for children. On the other side was veteran tax activist Don McIntire. He called the plan "cockamamie" and "frivolous," and one which Adams and the city had no business promoting. "We’re spending $12,000 bucks a kid a year in the school system. If they’re not getting art training that’s the fault of the school system and that needs to be rectified," McIntire said on Think Out Loud. PolitiFact Oregon rang up McIntire for his source. He didn't specify Portland Public Schools on the radio, but he made clear to us that he was talking about the state's largest school district. He said it’s a national average, and he suspects PPS is even higher. In getting back to us with more information, McIntire upped the ante to $15,000 per student. His math is terrifically simple. Follow along. The adopted budget for Portland Public Schools is $678 million for 2012-13. Resources include a beginning balance, food service sales and government funding. The expenditures category includes salaries, materials and debt service. McIntire subtracted about $11 million for fund transfers, which leaves roughly $667 million. Divide that by 47,288 students -- which is current enrollment -- and voila, $14,100 per student. McIntire also said we should add $900 per student for education service district support. That, he said, gets us to $15,000. We asked him if it was fair to include building costs or debt service. Obviously those are not dollars going toward student instruction. McIntire said that it’s entirely fair "if money is taken and derived from the taxpaying public, and it goes into the system somewhere and it’s spent." OK, let’s move on. Next we asked Matt Shelby, spokesman for Portland Public Schools, to ask his people for a figure. He said he’d get back to us. Because PolitiFact Oregon is always on the move, we started looking online and found that the U.S. average in per pupil spending was $10,615 in 2009-10, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. So, there’s some context. In Oregon, according to the bureau, the number was lower: $9,624 per pupil (page 8). In Portland Public Schools, however, the number was higher: $10,949 (page 106). The averages included salaries and support services, with a portion for school and general administration. We turned to the Oregon Department of Education, which tracks spending by school district. We zeroed in on a report called operating versus capital expenditures per student. This looked like the report we needed. Hurray! There we found that the actual amount of money spent statewide per student, on average, in 2010-11 was $9,362. In Portland Public Schools, the per student spending was higher at $11,830. That is very close to $12,000. To short-circuit the process, we asked Shelby the spokesman if Portland Public Schools officials were comfortable with that breakdown. He said they were. We will not rule on McIntire’s revised statement that the district spends about $15,000 on each student a year. He and others may think that’s a better estimate of how much money the district has -- and therefore, what it can afford to spend on arts education -- but that’s not what he said publicly. We will rule on the $12,000 per student figure instead. The best historical numbers we have are state figures that show that Portland Public Schools in 2010-11 spent $11,830 per pupil. (The same report shows capital outlay per student was about $400, and $777 statewide.) Now, let’s go back to Portland Public Schools’ 2012-13 adopted budget. If you add together salaries, benefits, materials and services -- in other words, take out debt, capital and contingencies-- you get nearly $542 million. Divide that by the number of students and we end up at $11,459 per student. Again, we think that’s pretty close to $12,000. With debt and capital -- the way McIntire and some others think is more accurate -- the number would be more than $12,000. It would be anywhere from $13,200 (without contingency and ending fund balance) to $14,100 (if those categories are included) to $15,000 (if he is correctly adding education service district costs to the budget). His larger point is that the district, spending roughly $12,000 a student, has enough money to pay for arts and music classes. A higher number just makes his point stronger. Whether any of that is enough for Portland Public Schools to offer art and music instruction without a $35 per-person income tax is not for us to decide.

pomt-05755	Says local Texas chambers of commerce were granted exemptions from paying property taxes on their headquarter properties.	true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/01/becky-moeller/becky-moeller-says-local-texas-chambers-commerce-w/	The president of the Texas AFL-CIO roundly objects to subjecting recipients of unemployment aid to drug tests. In a Feb. 17, 2012, press release, Becky Moeller said "some politicians and interest groups want to attack the unemployment system by subjecting workers who lost their jobs through no fault of their own to insulting and costly drug tests." The release says Moeller was reacting to praise of Congress by Bill Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business, for including in its extension of unemployment benefits a provision giving states the right to require drug tests of recipients seeking a job that generally requires a drug test, as CNN reported Feb. 17, 2012.. . Moeller said: "We continue to wait for legislative proposals to require CEOs who accept corporate welfare and promise jobs that they often don’t deliver to take drug tests. Come to think of it, we’re still waiting for heads of local Chambers of Commerce in Texas who were granted sweetheart exemptions from paying all property taxes on their expensive headquarters properties to take drug tests to prove they are ‘ready and available’ to use taxpayer money." Wham, bam, blooey, and at a glance, nothing but opinion. But we focused on a clearly factual claim -- that local chambers of commerce got exemptions from paying property taxes on their headquarter properties. Setting aside her juicy adjectives as opinion -- "sweetheart" and "expensive" -- were local chambers granted exemptions from property taxes? They were, though we were unable to pin how many chambers have taken advantage and to what cost. The Greater Austin Area Chamber of Commerce, which in late 2011 confirmed plans to move from leased space to purchased space in downtown Austin, has applied for an exemption that could save the group about $100,000 in 2012 property taxes, a figure based on taxes levied on the property for 2011, the chamber’s president, Mike Rollins, told us in a telephone interview. Rollins said the Austin chamber did not seek the exemption law but appreciates the result. "Chambers do a lot of work that if they didn’t do it, the public would have to pay for it out of their ad valorem (property) taxes," he said, offering as an example the preparation and distribution of promotional information about the surrounding community. Rollins added that the Austin chamber has taken no position on the drug-testing law singled out in Moeller’s statement and, he suggested, it’s unfair to insinuate that any local chambers are aligned with the TAB leader’s salute to the law. So, how did the tax exemptions come to be? AFL-CIO spokesman Ed Sills, responding to our request for backup information, said the exemptions were authorized by the 2009 Legislature in an amendment to a measure covering other topics. According to legislative records, on May 27, 2009, state Sen. Mike Jackson, R-La Porte, put the exemption provision into House Bill 770, which as originated by Rep. Donna Howard, D-Austin, had to do with property taxes on a homestead residence rendered uninhabitable by water or mold damage. Jackson also was named chairman of the Senate side of the joint conference committee that reached a compromise version of HB 770. The measure then cleared the Senate with only Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, voting "no" and won House approval 144-0. Gov. Rick Perry let the proposal become law without his signature. The relevant provision, added to the Texas Tax Code, says that to qualify for the property-tax exemption, a nonprofit economic development group largely funded by dues-paying members must primarily be engaged in one or more of these activities: promoting the common economic interests of commercial enterprises; improving the business conditions of one or more types of business; or otherwise providing services to aid in economic development. It says too the group may not have a political action committee. Legislators embraced the provision in the face of a fiscal note stating: ""The bill's requirement for mandatory exemptions for qualifying economic development corporation property would create a cost to cities, counties, school districts and the state through the operation of the school finance formulas." Specifically, the note says, the change would reduce state revenue by nearly $1.2 million in the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2011, with the annual reduction increasing to nearly $1.8 million for the year ending Aug. 31, 2014. There’s a state cost, the note says, partly because state law requires the state to ensure that school districts maintain the revenue levels they had in 2006. According to the fiscal note, local cities, counties and school districts would see their combined related revenue drop less than the state’s annual decreases. We were unable to obtain updated cost projections taking into account actions by the 2011 Legislature changing how the school funding formulas affect state spending. In a telephone interview, Jackson told us he sought the exemption provision at the behest of a local chamber leader and after learning that about 25 percent of 500 local chambers in the state then owned their headquarters. A Sept. 2, 2010, Houston Chronicle news article credits the executive director of the Texas City-La Marque Chamber of Commerce with leading the statewide push to authorize the property-tax exemption. Per Moeller’s statement, Jackson said he did not want to give anyone a sweetheart deal but thought that business owners who compose the membership of local chambers already paid property taxes on their properties. Charging property taxes on the chamber HQs, he said, was like double taxation. Also, Jackson said, most chamber headquarters he has seen are "not big Taj Mahals." "The AFL-CIO ought to be all in favor of this," Jackson opined. "This allows these chambers to use that money to help economic development and create more jobs. That would just do more to help labor in general." A House version of the chamber-sought change, House Bill 831, drew favorable testimony from leaders of six local chambers of commerce including individuals from Kerrville, Brownsville, Lewisville and La Marque, according to the Texas Legislative Council, with representatives of a dozen additional local chambers registering in favor. Legislative records show no one testifying against the tax exemption provision. Sills, of the Texas AFL-CIO, said in a telephone interview that behind the scenes the labor group fought the change. He forwarded an email that he said was sent during the session to House members urging opposition to HB 831. The 2009 email says chambers of commerce lobby on many issues, sometimes against the interests of a majority of residents. "If the Legislature wants to allow the public to start subsidizing non-profit organizations that engage in the political process," the email says, "then alternatively we ask you to adopt an amendment that would include labor union organizations in that subsidy. We don’t think it would be great public policy, but it would create a more level playing field. It would be preferable, though, to oppose" the exemption proposal. "We believe that taxpayers do not want to subsidize chambers of commerce and other politicized organizations through tax subsidies." We rate Moeller’s statement True.

pomt-14574	Says Pat Toomey visited Joe Sestak and other veterans in 2002 "and then came home and voted against every veterans appropriations bill."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/feb/08/joe-sestak/joe-sestak-says-pat-toomey-voted-against-every-vet/	Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is defending his voting record after a challenger has repeatedly claimed the incumbent Pennsylvania senator has a pattern of voting against funding for veterans. Senate candidate Joe Sestak, a Democrat and former congressman, said during a recent luncheon at the Pennsylvania Press Club that Toomey visited him on the USS George Washington aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf in 2002, the carrier Sestak was commanding at the time. "I may disagree with Pat Toomey, who voted to send me to war, visited me on the aircraft carrier," Sestak said, adding, "and then came home and voted against every veterans appropriations bill." The Toomey and Sestak campaigns have gone back and forth in email communications to supporters and reporters, criticizing and defending Toomey’s records on veterans affairs, as they spar to represent voters in Pennsylvania, a state with nearly a million veterans. So we decided to put Sestak's claim to the test: Did Toomey truly did vote against every veterans appropriations bill since 2002? Sestak campaign spokesman Jake Sternberger said in the instance of the Press Club appearance in January, the former Navy admiral was referring to Toomey’s voting record when he served in the House from 1999 to 2005, though Sestak didn’t specify that at the time. His campaign also later highlighted Toomey’s time in the Senate, noting that he voted against plans in 2011 and 2015 that would have sent additional funds to programming for veterans. When it comes to his time in the House from 1999 to 2005, Toomey did vote against every major veterans appropriations bill, but he also voted in favor of more than a dozen resolutions that kept funding the same. As a senator, Toomey’s spokesman for re-election Steve Kelly said Toomey was a "strong supporter" of bipartisan Veterans Affairs legislation introduced in 2014, a bill its cosponsor (and current Democratic presidential candidate) Bernie Sanders called "the most comprehensive veterans’ health care legislation in modern history." In 2011 and 2015, Toomey had already voted in favor of stand-alone veterans appropriations bills, but instead of being signed into law, those dollars were later rolled into "omnibus bills," or plans that funded the entire federal government. Veterans appropriations make up about 6 percent of the funding in the large financing plans. Toomey, a fiscal conservative, voted against the omnibus bills in 2011 and this past December that ultimately would have sent more funds to veterans, but he said it wasn’t due to specific line items. "I have usually voted against these giant, thousand-page, trillion-dollar omnibus spending bills because they’re such a grossly irresponsible way to fund the government," Toomey said recently about his vote against the bills, according to his campaign. "They have literally many thousands of individual line items, and I know Congressman Sestak likes to pretend that I must oppose every individual line item because I voted against these grotesque omnibus bills. That’s just ridiculous." Sternberger said it’s "absolutely" fair to criticize Toomey’s record on veterans affairs based on the fact that he twice voted against the omnibus bills. Records show Toomey also voted against the Veterans Jobs Corps Act in 2012 and the Veterans Health and Benefits bill in February 2014, months before the VA scandal led to the resignation of former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki. Toomey later supported bipartisan legislation aimed at improving the VA. Toomey is a member of the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus and in 2014 introduced the Protect Veterans Employment and Training Services Act, which aims to provide jobs training services to veterans. The bill died at the end of the congressional session and was not enacted. Our ruling Sestak said that Toomey "voted against every veterans appropriations bill." Toomey did vote against major veterans appropriations bills between 2002 and 2005 while in the House. But as a senator, he repeatedly voted in favor of other bills that benefitted vets. Toomey did vote against veterans appropriations when he voted "no" to the omnibus bills in 2011 and 2015, but he also voted "yes" to stand-alone bills the same year and didn’t support the larger spending plans for reasons beyond the veterans appropriations. Sestak and his campaign mischaracterized Toomey’s record on veterans appropriations by saying Toomey voted against funding veterans programming "every" time. We rule the claim Mostly False.

pomt-00580	On Common Core.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/08/bobby-jindal/bobby-jindal-change-position-common-core/	Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal isn’t expected to announce his candidacy for president until June 24, but he’s already firing shots at future competitors. In response to Sen. Rand Paul’s comments in late May on the origins of ISIS, Jindal called him "outlandish," "illogical," and "unsuited to be Commander-in-Chief." Paul advisor Doug Stafford shot back at Jindal, saying, "It’s ironic Gov. Jindal would level such a charge when he flip-flops on crucial issues like Common Core and national security, and he has cratered his own state’s economy and budget." This is not the first time critics have accused of Jindal for doing a 180 on Common Core — the state-based educational standards aimed at improving student readiness for college and the workplace. (Read our past fact-checks of claims and flips relating to Common Core.) In light of his upcoming candidacy, we wondered: How does Jindal’s position on Common Core register on our Flip-O-Meter? It’s important to note that we are not making a value judgment about flip-flopping; we're just noting whether a change of position has occurred. Jindal support Common Core was launched in June 2009 as a collaboration between 49 states and territories. Louisiana adopted the standards in 2010 with Jindal’s blessing. In 2012, he handpicked John White, a strong supporter of Common Core, as state superintendent of education. At an event for business leaders in January of that year, Jindal lauded the Common Core standards as a step forward for education in his state that "will raise expectations for every child." Jindal echoed the sentiment early into his second term. Jindal stood by Common Core at a groundbreaking ceremony in 2013, amid an ongoing fight over the standards in his state and even after the Republican National Committee renounced the program. Though he never mentioned the initiative by name, Jindal said that "too many" governors, teachers, students and parents "have fought too hard for too many years to put Louisiana on that map (toward more rigorous education standards). And we're not going backwards." Then, he disowned the initiative. Jindal opposition Jindal himself acknowledges his change of heart, which he says is due to the federal government’s stepping in. His spokesperson Mike Reed told us, "Gov. Jindal supported (Common Core) when he believed it to be a state-led effort. Later, when he discovered it was a centralized federal effort, he opposed it and began working to remove Common Core from Louisiana." We’ve fact-checked several statements that suggest Common Core is a federal program or mandate. It’s not. States can improve their chances of winning federal money if they adopt educational standards; the Obama administration included that as criteria for its "Race to the Top" program. But Common Core itself remains a state-based, voluntary program. Nevertheless, by April 2014, Jindal was clearly in the opposition camp. "I'm from the school that believes education is a matter best left for local control," Jindal wrote in an op-ed for USA Today. "The notion of Washington determining curricula is something most states are simply not interested in. It's a non-starter." A month later, Jindal grew more emphatic in his distaste for Common Core, comparing it to centralized planning in Russia. He also tweeted: We will not be bullied by fed govt. Common Core advocates claim it not a fed takeover, but Sec. Duncan's comments & actions prove otherwise.— Gov. Bobby Jindal (@BobbyJindal) June 17, 2014 Beyond rhetoric, Jindal has actively tried to rock the schoolhouse standards. He sued the Obama administration over the national implementation of Common Core in 2014 (and he’s been sued for his repudiation). He asked Common Core to withdraw from the state. He broke with his own education head, an "exceptional" and "unusual" move, according to Ashley Jochim, who studies Common Core at the Center for Reinventing Public Education. He proposed an opt-out option for students in early 2015. He issued an executive order to repeal Common Core in Louisiana in 2014 and came up with a legislative plan as well. In late May, Jindal signed off on a compromise between Louisiana legislators that allows state review and revision of the federal standards with public oversight. But, according to his spokesperson, that doesn’t mean Jindal’s done with his efforts to permanently give Common Core the boot in the Bayou. "We support the compromise because it ensures we have local control going forward. The next step will be to elect leaders who are committed to getting rid of Common Core," Reed told us, noting that Jindal’s lawsuit against the Obama administration is moving forward. Experts say there’s no question Jindal reversed his position on Common Core. "Gov. Jindal has clearly flip-flopped on the issue. He went from singing the praises of Common Core to leading the charge for removing the standards in Louisiana. Because of Jindal, the state has made almost a complete U-turn on the standards," said James Shuls, a professor of education and policy at the University of Missouri in St. Louis. Jindal’s change of position has also been noted by CNN, the Huffington Post, the Washington Times, the Washington Post’s editorial board and the Times-Picayune. Our rating Jindal was once an ardent supporter of Common Core (and one of the first adopters of the initiative) but has since become one of its staunchest critics, mounting lawsuits and legislation against the initiative. Despite his endorsement of a compromise in his state, Jindal remains an opponent to the core. We rate Jindal’s position on Common Core a Full Flop.

pomt-05458	Under President Barack Obama’s watch, "oil production on federal lands has decreased 14 percent over the past year."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/24/jack-kingston/kingston-says-oil-production-down-last-year-under-/	Savannah Congressman Jack Kingston is standing in line with other Republicans this presidential election season to hit President Barack Obama on a major talking point. They’re pinning the blame for rising gas prices on Obama. Kingston took his turn April 12 with an op-ed in his hometown paper, the Savannah Morning News. "[W]hile families struggle with rising gas prices the president is only making things worse," the op-ed said. "When he [Obama] claims energy production is increasing on his watch, he is taking credit for production on state and private lands. In fact, oil production on federal lands has decreased 14 percent over the past year." Oil production is down 14 percent on federal lands? We thought this claim was well worth a check. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National and PolitiFact Ohio have looked at similar claims. Both teams cautioned against blaming a president for current oil production levels. Factors such as natural and man-made disasters, changes in technology and presidential policies dating back decades are also at play. "I don't think Obama can claim a lot of credit for production levels now, and I'm not even sure that [George W. Bush] can," Jay Hakes, who directed the independent U.S. Energy Information Administration for seven years during the Clinton administration, told PolitiFact National. Hakes is author of "A Declaration of Energy Independence," which looks at energy policy from President Harry S. Truman to President George W. Bush. "If you're going to go back — who should get the credit — I might be able to find something that Nixon did," Hakes said. PolitiFact Ohio addressed these factors when they looked into a March 26 statement by that state’s U.S. Sen. Rob Portman: "Last year, we produced 14 percent less oil on public lands than we did the year before." They found it was Mostly True. They checked the number against data from the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue, which tracks royalties to the government for oil, gas and coal produced on federal lands and waters. They also cross-checked it against information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which provides the federal government’s official energy statistics. Although the number was accurate, Portman’s statement needed additional clarification or information. At least part of the drop on public lands and waters last fiscal year was due to the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and an apparent shift by oil companies to private lands for "fracking." (Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a method of extracting oil or gas that opens up rock with a pressurized mix of water and chemicals.) About one week after PolitiFact Ohio’s story ran, Crossroads GPS, a conservative group, released a Web ad that tied Obama even more directly than Portman did to a decline in oil production. The group said that oil "production's down where Obama's in charge," and cited the 14 percent figure. PolitiFact National gave Crossroads GPS a Half True. The 14 percent decline took place in a single year -- fiscal year 2011, or Oct. 1, 2010, through Sept. 30, 2011. This time period includes the aftermath of the deadly Deepwater Horizon oil spill of April 20, 2010. The Department of the Interior issued a directive about a month after the disaster that said they would not consider drilling permits for deepwater wells for six months. Changes in federal regulations followed. National also found the data Crossroads GPS used did not tell the whole story. From fiscal year 2009 through 2011, crude oil sales from federal lands and waters did suffer a net decline of less than 1 percent, according to the Energy Information Administration. In 2009, oil production totaled 632 million barrels. In 2011, it was down to 626 million. However, during the first two fiscal years, oil production rose. In 2010, those sales totaled 726 million, a year-over-year increase of 14.9 percent. Furthermore, 2011’s 14 percent drop in production on federal lands and waters took place as onshore production rose slightly. Crude oil sales stood at 108 million barrels in 2010. They rose to 112 million barrels, an increase of 3.7 percent. We found that Kingston’s op-ed piece, which places the blame for gas prices squarely on Obama’s shoulders, shares these accuracy problems. He cited the 14 percent figure, saying Obama is "only making things worse" for families struggling with high gas prices. His spokesman Chris Crawford argued the congressman’s claim deserves a True. The number is accurate, and Obama is saying energy production is up on his watch. "I don't see how you can come to any conclusion but it being the truth," Crawford said in an email. But we’re not rating Obama’s statements. We’re also not taking issue with Kingston’s oil production data. Our issue is context, and that’s where Kingston runs into trouble. He cherry-picked the most unflattering oil production numbers under the Obama administration and ignored the impact of events well outside the president’s control: changes in technology, decades of presidential policy, and most importantly, the Deepwater Horizon spill. Kingston’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. According to PolitiFact’s rules, this earns Kingston a Half True.

pomt-08098	Governor-elect Scott Walker’s opposition to high-speed rail "killed 13,000 Wisconsin jobs"	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/14/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democratic-party-says-scott-walker-killed-13000-jo/	A barrage of invective hit Wisconsin Governor-elect Scott Walker after the federal government announced it would give nearly all of Wisconsin’s $810 million in high-speed rail funds to other states. Half a dozen local, state and national Democrats issued statements Dec. 9, 2010 condemning the Republican for his staunch opposition to the Milwaukee-to-Madison train, all focusing on the loss of jobs that would result. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin joined in with the highest figure, declaring that Walker had "killed 13,000 Wisconsin jobs." Walker, who takes office Jan. 3, could rightly be credited -- or blamed, depending on your point of view -- with killing the rail line. Indeed, so vehement was his vow to stop its construction that, in our view, he prematurely declared the proposal dead even when it still had some locomotion. There is no doubt that jobs tied to the train will be lost; Walker has acknowledged as much. But what about the 13,000 figure used by the state Democrats? If the scenery on this ride looks familiar, it’s because we’ve been down this track before. We rated as Barely True a November claim by the Sierra Club that refusing the federal rail money would cost Wisconsin nearly 10,000 permanent jobs -- that is, jobs aside from the construction-related ones. The claim relied on an analysis based on a host of assumptions, including the impact of an entirely built network connecting Midwest cities. Given the more recent outcry over the rail money, we decided to start our count anew. The Democratic Party told us it pegged the loss at 13,000 jobs based on a report on the high-speed rail project by the WISPIRG Foundation, which supported the project. WISPIRG is a nonprofit group that says it "works to protect consumers and promote good government." Bruce Speight, WISPIRG’s state director, said WISPIRG used Wisconsin’s federal grant application for the rail money to arrive at the 13,000 jobs. Here are the number of full-time-equivalent jobs the state’s application projected would be created during construction of the Milwaukee-to-Madison line: Year 1: 1,281 Year 2: 4,060 Year 3: 5,535 Year 4: 1,847 Year 5: 621 Year 6: 250 Think about the figures this way: The state projected that in Year 1, the rail line construction itself, plus economic activity generated by the construction, would create 1,281 jobs’ worth of work; in Year 2, there would be 4,060 jobs’ worth of work; and so on. The figures represent "job-years," not actual jobs, said Jon Dyck, a fiscal analyst at the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. A job-year, he said, is one person being employed for one year as a result of the rail line construction. In a memo Dyck wrote on the project, he cited the number of jobs per year that the state had projected in its grant application. He did not add the figures for the six years together to arrive at a total jobs figure. But that is what the Democratic Party did -- just as WISPIRG did in its report -- to get its total of 13,000 jobs. That approach can lead to double counting. Clearly, some of the people hired in Year 1 will also be working in Year 2. What’s more, the state’s numbers show a rise of employment, as construction peaks, and then a fall as it tails off. In Year 3, for example, the amount of work was projected to produce 5,535 jobs, but that number drops to 1,847 in Year 4. But under the math used to get to 13,000, they’re actually added together, for a total of 7,382 jobs in years 3 and 4. Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle was the first to use that approach. After the state filed its grant application in October 2009, Doyle’s office issued a news release saying the rail line would create "nearly 13,000 jobs by 2013." The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel later reported, however, that the only way to reach that figure (12,723) would be to add the jobs from years 1 through 4. If you carried out Doyle’s job counting over the full six years that were covered in the state’s application, you would exceed 13,000 jobs -- the number the Democratic Party seized on. Doyle’s administration defended its method of counting to the newspaper, saying the grant application simply followed a formula requested by the federal government. But Doyle’s job counting led the WISPIRG Foundation to issue a correction of its report, Speight told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Since then, WISPIRG, like some other rail supporters, estimates only that "thousands" of jobs would have been created by the Milwaukee-to-Madison line. Indeed, in the statement Doyle issued after loss of the federal funds, he referred only to "thousands of jobs" that the money could have created in Wisconsin. The Democratic Party, however, stayed with 13,000 -- not only in its news release, but in a billboard it put up in Milwaukee four days later. That brings us to the end of the line. The state Democratic Party claimed that Walker’s opposition to high-speed rail not only cost Wisconsin nearly $810 million in federal funds, but it "killed 13,000 Wisconsin jobs." The party relied on a report by an organization that two months earlier had disavowed the number after it was discredited by the Journal Sentinel. Perhaps thousands of jobs were at stake, but there is no evidence that 13,000 jobs were lost. What’s more, that has been clear for some time -- and most everyone else has stopped using the figure.

In an interview with Fox News, President Donald Trump praised China for working to help with the North Korea problem and he specifically noted that China has begun to reject coal shipments from North Korea, denying it a key source of revenue. "Nobody has ever seen it like that," Trump said April 17. "Nobody has ever seen such a positive response on our behalf from China." There’s a lot to unpack in that statement, not the least of which is whether China is acting on America’s behalf or its own, or both. The fact is, China has taken many steps over the decades to manage North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. Some long-time observers think its latest stance represents a new high; others are less convinced. China and North Korea The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy arm of Congress, described China as "North Korea’s closest ally, largest provider of food, fuel, and industrial machinery, and arguably the country most able to wield influence in Pyongyang." China buys over 80 percent of North Korea’s exports. At the same time, North Korea has been a thorn in China’s side for quite a while. A 2007 report from the Council on Foreign Relations said that "Chinese leaders are acutely concerned about a crumbling North Korea that precipitates massive instability in northeastern China." Reflecting a common view, Cheng Li, director of the China Center at the Brookings Institution, a Washington academic organization, told us, that above all, China wants stability. "It’s in China’s interest to have a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula," Li said. A bellicose North Korea might invite a U.S. attack, which would create refugee flows and crisis, or lead South Korea or Japan to reconsider their nuclear options. None of that would help China. China’s growing role China has been involved with North Korea talks since the mid 1990s, when bilateral negotiations between the United States and North Korea produced a pause in the country’s march toward building nuclear warheads. China took a more direct role in 2003. That year, North Korea withdrew from the Nonproliferation Treaty, restarted a previously frozen 5-megawatt nuclear reactor and during talks brokered by China, told the lead American diplomat that it now had nuclear weapons. "China wanted to play a role," Li said. "It wanted to cooperate with the United States. First, it organized the three-party negotiations (China, North Korea and the United States), which then became the six-party negotiations (with Russia, South Korea and Japan). It hosted the six-party talks and had harsh words for North Korea’s leaders." In 2005, those talks produced an agreement that might have led to a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. That agreement broke down four years later, but Frank Jannuzi, who spent 15 years as Senate Foreign Relations Committee policy director for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, credits China with pushing to keep diplomacy moving forward. "The United States had long been reluctant to engage in face-to-face official talks with North Korea, without the political cover of a multilateral venue," Jannuzi said. "The Chinese wanted these talks too, but in making them happen, they were doing us a big favor." China gradually ramps up the pressure Through its seat on the U.N. Security Council, China has approved five resolutions against North Korea. The first was in 2006, followed by another in 2009, two in 2013, and the most recent in 2016. Economic sanctions have increased through the later resolutions, although Jannuzi said China would only go so far on that front. "The sanctions would never be effective," he said. "Because the sanctions will always stop short of crippling North Korea’s economy, which China would not want." Jannuzi cautioned against reading too much into China’s latest rejection of North Korean coal. The March 2016 resolution imposed a quota on how much coal China could import. "The trade data suggest that North Korea reached the quota by about the end of February," Jannuzi said. "The coal China turned back went beyond the quota. So it’s good that China stuck with the sanctions, but they supported that when they voted for the resolution." The Brookings Institution’s Li said China is going beyond what it’s done before. He pointed to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit with Trump, and the rhetoric in Chinese media "China’s propaganda machine changed dramatically," Li said. "A few months ago, you began to see more criticism of North Korea’s missile program. Unofficially, commentators have talked about regime change. Previously, you couldn’t write about that." Januzzi said if China is being more vocal and showing its displeasure with North Korea, that’s in line with the past. "It represents a new high point in terms of their overall frustration level with North Korea but they have been ratcheting it up for 15 years," he said. Some analysts, such as Mohan Malik, professor of Asian security at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, see little to cheer in China’s recent moves. "No doubt, China is tightening the noose around Kim Jong-un’s neck, but it is nowhere near choking him," Malik said. "China’s trade with North Korea is significantly up from last year. And more importantly, the transfer of dual-use components from Chinese companies for use in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs continues unabated." Our ruling Trump said with North Korea, no one has ever seen such a such a positive response from China on America’s behalf. In the eyes of the experts we reached, China is doing more. Some were more enthusiastic than others. The record shows that China has gradually moved in this direction over the years. Refusing coal shipments is in line with U.N. economic sanctions that China voted for last year. China has largely maintained its trade ties with North Korea and so far, its actions have been more rhetorical than substantive. It is difficult to quantify a "positive response." Whether the latest moves represent a sea shift that "no one has ever seen," or the logical conclusion of a longer pattern, probably lies in the eye of the beholder. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-08200	Regulations are an "endemic weakness in government -- so old that Thomas Jefferson listed this problem among his charges against the King of England in the Declaration of Independence."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/nov/22/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-thomas-jefferson-called-regulation/	As part of his push to spur job growth, Gov.-elect Rick Scott has put a target on many government regulations. For example, Scott told business leaders at the Florida Council of 100 on Nov. 18, 2010, that he will freeze all regulations currently being formulated by state agencies so he can evaluate their impact. "Regulations grow and spread like weeds — if we aren’t actively working to cut them back, they choke off every productive effort," he told the group, according to prepared remarks. (The event was closed to the public, so we can’t verify the quote.) He added: "This is an endemic weakness in government — so old that Thomas Jefferson listed this problem among his charges against the King of England in the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson wrote, ‘He (King George III) has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.' " Scott quotes Jefferson correctly. But we wondered, what did Jefferson mean when he wrote that line? Did he think regulations are an endemic weakness in government? The "swarms of officers" Jefferson referenced were about 50 officials in the British Customs Service whose job was to stop colonists from smuggling goods to circumvent various taxes imposed by the Crown, including the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767. Colonists were "particularly adroit smugglers," said Stephen Lucas, a University of Wisconsin communications professor. The officials "certainly were harassing to the merchants and the smugglers who were trying to evade the laws." Lucas studies rhetoric and wrote the 1989 article "The Stylistic Artistry of the Declaration of Independence." Lucas adds: "He uses the term ‘swarms,’ which makes it sound like there are thousands of these officials. The point was to make them sound as onerous as possible." Jefferson was, of course, a politician. And the Declaration of Independence was a revolutionary document used to discredit King George III. "What would you expect a guy to say?" said Peter Onuf, an American history professor and Jefferson scholar at the University of Virginia. Onuf, however, pointed out that the document was a critique of King George -- not of government in general. "It’s designed to depict the government of George III as absolutely illegitimate," he said. "The important thing is that it’s an argument against a particular government." He added: "To take these phrases out of context and suggest they’re eternally valid under all circumstances, it just gets tedious after a while." Lucas said the Declaration’s famous preamble ("We hold these truths to be self-evident...") includes principles that apply to any government. The 28 charges against King George are just that -- specific accusations against the king. "In fact, the colonists tended to see these grievances they had against England as growing out of a conspiracy to choke off the colonies," Lucas said. "They’re not necessarily an inherent part of government." Let’s circle back to modern times. Scott is clearly trying to bolster his anti-regulation argument with the gravitas of the Declaration of Independence. He calls regulation an "endemic weakness in government" and then says Jefferson listed "this problem" in the Declaration. But Jefferson didn’t complain about regulation as an "endemic weakness." He leveled a specific charge against King George that, as Lucas points out, involved just about 50 officials to combat smuggling among the colonial population of 3 million. Scott accurately quoted Jefferson, but he took the line out of context to advance his own argument against government regulation. Jefferson was no big-government liberal (He once lauded the "suppression of unnecessary offices (and) useless establishments and expenses."). But in this case he was more upset about King George than he was about government intervention. We rate Scott’s statement Half True.

pomt-07460	"The top 1 percent of income-earners pay about 40 percent of all taxes into the federal government."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/18/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-top-1-percent-pay-40-percent/	In an April 13, 2011, interview on NBC’s Today show, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., offered a striking statistic describing how much of the tax burden in the United States is borne by the wealthy. In the interview, host Matt Lauer cited a deficit-reduction plan offered by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and asked why it included a major restructuring of Medicare but protected tax cuts for upper-income Americans. "If that's on the table, then why shouldn't the burden be equally shared?" Lauer asked. "Why shouldn't we put some of that burden on the wealthy and corporations?" Bachmann responded, "Well, remember, again, already the top 1 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of all taxes into the federal government. So if you want to talk about fairness, the top 1 percent are paying 40 percent of all of the income." We wondered whether she was right that "the top 1 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of all taxes into the federal government." The most recent hard data on this question comes from the 2007 tax year. It can be found in a Congressional Budget Office report released in 2010. CBO’s report shows what share of the federal tax liability was carried by various income groups. Here’s the rundown of the federal tax burden for the top 1 percent: Federal income taxes: 39.5 percent share Federal payroll taxes: 4.1 percent share Federal corporate taxes: 57.0 percent share Federal excise taxes: 4.7 percent share Total federal tax share for the top 1 percent: 28.1 percent So -- using 2007 numbers at least -- Bachmann is off by quite a bit. She’s even further off if you use an estimate for 2010 by the centrist to liberal Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, which pegs the share of all federal taxes for the top 1 percent at 22.7 percent. Bachmann would have been right if she’d said, "the top 1 percent of income earners pay about 40 percent of all income taxes into the federal government." But she didn’t say that -- and even if she had, her decision to focus on income taxes, rather than looking at the whole federal tax picture, would have presented the numbers in such a way that wealthier Americans would look more heavily taxed than they are. As a general rule, the burden of the income tax is tilted heavily toward the upper end of the income spectrum. The payroll tax burden is also tilted toward the upper end, but the payroll tax differential for rich vs. non-rich is not quite as great as it is for the income tax. For instance, the top 20 percent paid 86 percent of the income tax, but 42.9 percent of the payroll tax. Also, the Social Security portion of payroll tax applies only up to $106,800 in income. Meanwhile, the middle 20 percent of earners paid 4.6 percent of federal income taxes in 2007, but 16.6 percent of payroll taxes. So for critics of taxes -- and Bachmann certainly is one -- it packs a greater wallop to cite income tax burdens for the wealthy than it does to cite their overall tax burden. But in this case, she didn’t define the statistic she was using correctly. So we rate her statement False. Update: The original version of this story said, "Also, the payroll tax applies only up to $106,800 in income, with no tax on earnings above that limit." It should have noted that the income limit applies only to Social Security taxes.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2011-04-18T14:45:47	2011-04-13	['None']

pomt-01835	"Latinos now make up the majority population in Texas."	false	/texas/statements/2014/jul/17/roberto-alonzo/latinos-not-yet-majority-texans/	A Dallas legislator hailed a court ruling about the University of Texas by declaring that most Texans are Latino. In his July 16, 2014, press release, Democratic state Rep. Roberto Alonzo applauded the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for upholding how UT-Austin employs race as an element in choosing students to admit. Alonzo then called it imperative for UT to do all it can to keep pace with the state’s changing demographics. His statement listed among factors "the fact that Latinos now make up the majority population in Texas." That didn’t sound right. Shortly, a spokesman for the U.S. Census Bureau, Robert Bernstein, emailed us that as of July 1, 2013, Hispanics "comprised 38.4% of the total population of Texas." We spotted that Latino percentage estimate on a bureau web page specifying that of the state’s nearly 26.5 million residents at that time, 40 percent were white, 12.4 percent were black or African American and 4.3 percent were Asian. Separately, the state demographer, Lloyd Potter, advised by email the majority of Texas residents will be Hispanic as soon as 2036 (if migration into Texas from 2000 to 2010 continues at the same pace going forward) or as late as 2049 (if population changes are due solely to in-state births and deaths). Hispanic residents already comprise the majority of students in Texas public schools. According to a March 2014 report from the Texas Education Agency, some 2.6 million Hispanic students accounted for 51 percent of the state’s more than 5 million students in 2012-13--and Hispanic students have been the majority in Texas schools since 2010-11, a chart shows. In 2012-13, white students made up 30 percent of public school enrollment, the report said, with African American students making up nearly 13 percent and Asians nearly 4 percent. By telephone, Alonzo conceded his error. Minutes later, a revised release arrived by email, quoting Alonzo as saying: "Considering the fact that Latinos now make up a significant portion (38%) of the population in Texas, coupled with the continuing growth of Latinos in our Texas public schools compared to the low Latino enrollment at UT Austin and the lack of Latinos in professional employment and leadership positions, it is imperative that this flagship institution of higher learning do all it can to improve and keep pace with the changing, diverse demographics." Our ruling Alonzo said Latinos comprise the majority of Texas residents. That’s incorrect. Individuals who identify as Latino are close to surpassing the share of Texans solely identified as white, but no single ethnic group makes up the majority of Texas residents.

pomt-12863	"Obamacare has failed."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/01/paul-ryan/paul-ryans-damning-claim-affordable-care-act-obama/	When U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan describes repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, he gives the signature legislation of President Barack Obama a damning assessment. Here’s a typical version, from his weekly press briefing on Jan. 5, 2017: "We’re going to get this law repealed, we’re going to get this law replaced, and we’re going to have a transition period so that people do not have the rug pulled out from underneath them while we get to a better place. Obamacare has failed, is getting worse, and we have to provide relief. And we will have a transition period so that people don’t get hurt." Ryan earned a Mostly True rating for his November 2016 claim that Obamacare "is not a popular law" -- though it’s worth noting that a January 2017 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading nonprofit research group on health care, found a split, with 49 percent saying Congress should repeal the law and 47 percent saying Congress should not. Our rating was False when the Wisconsin Republican in January 2017 said Obamacare "is in what the actuaries call a death spiral," given that conditions didn’t match the definition of what is an established term. But perhaps no Ryan attack on the law has been as audacious as "Obamacare has failed," a declaration he has made several times. He even went so far as to say on Jan. 27, 2017 that it is "basically a spectacular failure," though three days later he went softer, saying in a tweet: "For many Americans, it has already failed." So, let’s put Ryan’s claim to the test. There are many ways, of course, to evaluate the Affordable Care Act, which became law in 2010 though many changes were phased in later. But two of the major ones are coverage (Do more people have health insurance?) and costs (How much do you pay for insurance and what does it cover?) "There were things that succeeded and there things that didn't go as planned," said Donna Friedsam, health policy programs director at the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute. Said economist Gail Wilensky, a senior health and welfare adviser to Republican President George H.W. Bush: "To say it’s a failure is problematic because it requires a more nuanced answer." This table highlights some of our findings. It’s followed by a more detailed analysis. Coverage Costs 20 million Americans gained health insurance Total health expenditures grew at record low rates in first three years after Obamacare 8.9% of Americans did not have health insurance in 2016, down from 16% in 2010 Employer plans: Family premiums up 99% under George W. Bush, 59% under Barack Obama Millions no longer at risk of being denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions 22% in 2017 in cost of the average mid-level Obamacare plan "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it": 2013 Lie of the Year Cut the typical family's health insurance premium up to $2,500: Promise Broken The coverage More gained coverage: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that during the first six years of Obamacare, 20 million Americans gained health insurance as a result of the law -- a figure acknowledged by Donald Trump’s administration. Similarly, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected in January 2017 that a 2015 bill that would have repealed key portions of the law would have increased the number of uninsured by 18 million in one year. On a related note, the President’s Council of Economic Advisers credits the law for what it says is a one-third drop nationally since 2010 in the share of Americans reporting that they have forgone medical care due to cost. Fewer are uninsured: As one might expect, far fewer people are uninsured. Defending Obamacare during the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton said a record 90 percent of Americans had health insurance. PolitiFact National rated that True. A month later, in November 2016, a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, based on its annual survey, found 8.9 percent of Americans did not have health insurance in 2016. That was down from 16 percent in 2010, the year the ACA was passed. How it’s been done: The 20 million who have gained insurance includes people covered through the law’s expansion of Medicaid, the creation of the Health Insurance Marketplace, where individuals buy policies, and changes in private insurance -- one that allows young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance plans and one that requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing health conditions. When former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina said in a Milwaukee debate in December 2015 that "Obamacare isn't helping anyone," she earned a Pants on Fire. At the time, 10 million people had been put on Medicaid as a result of Medicaid’s expansion under the law; and 9.5 million were enrolled in policies bought on the marketplace (including 8 million who were receiving subsidies under the law). In addition, the law as it stands now has meant millions of Americans are no longer at risk of being denied coverage due to pre-existing conditions (a Promise Kept for Obama); or are no longer at risk of being kicked off policies for developing expensive medical conditions. Broken promises: It’s worth noting that the gains in coverage have not all gone as planned. Obama and others had said repeatedly about the ACA -- "If you like your health care plan, you can keep it" -- and that became PolitiFact National’s 2013 Lie of the Year. Obamacare rules were strict, so that even if existing plans deviated a little, the plans were not grandfathered in under the law, and by the fall of 2013 insurers canceled coverage for millions of Americans. "Access to a ‘no-frills’ plan is a huge improvement on what low-income people experienced prior to the marketplaces," said a Vox critique of the ACA. "But it's still a far cry from what health wonks envisioned just a few years ago when they saw the health care marketplaces reshaping the industry. Referring to the 20 million, Wilensky, now a senior fellow at Project HOPE, an international health foundation, said of the ACA: "Saying it’s a failure is too harsh because it got that part done." The costs An Obama pledge made during the 2008 campaign to cut the cost of a typical family's health insurance premium by up to $2,500 a year was rated a Promise Broken. As they have for years, health care costs have continued to increase, but there has been some moderating. Premiums rising: Premiums have gone up -- a cumulative 11 percent between 2013 and 2016 for the average full-family, employee-sponsored plan; and 38 percent between 2014 and 2017 for Obamacare plans. But the results are mixed, if you consider how much premiums went up before the ACA: On employer-sponsored plans, family premiums increased by a cumulative 99 percent under the eight years of Obama’s predecessor, President George W. Bush, while under eight years of Obama, the increase was smaller -- 59 percent -- according to Kaiser. Kaiser’s latest annual employers survey found that the average family premium in 2016 for their plans rose just 3 percent from 2015, while the premium for single coverage stayed essentially flat. That’s not to say the premiums aren’t substantial: Workers on average contribute $5,277 annually toward their family premiums. For individual market policies, in the three years before the ACA, premiums rose on average 9.9 percent in 2008, 10.8 percent in 2009 and 11.7 percent in 2010, according to the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund. The higher increases under Obamacare include a projected 22 percent increase nationally in 2017 in the cost of the average mid-level Obamacare plan, which is the most popular choice, though Kaiser says the increase would be as high as 145 percent (for customers in Phoenix). Critics have also pointed out that people who buy insurance on their own in the federal marketplace have fewer choices. Some major insurers, because they suffered losses, have dropped out of the marketplace, leaving nearly one in five Americans who are eligible for Obamacare with only one insurer in 2017, according to research done by the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform for the New York Times. Big picture-wise, total expenditures on health care nationally grew at record low rates in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the first three years after the ACA was adopted, according to the President’s Council of Economic Advisers -- even if there is debate over a number of factors as to why. Health care costs are rising much more slowly than they did during the past 50 years, two former Obama health care advisers wrote in the Washington Post. But Wilensky said much of the slowdown can be attributed to the global recession, given that increases in health spending were even lower on average in other industrialized nations. Deductibles rising: Ryan and other Republicans have said many people feel they don’t really have health insurance because their deductibles are so high. It’s worth noting that one ACA provision ensures that nearly all Americans with employer coverage have a limit on their annual out-of-pocket spending. But the Kaiser survey of employers found the average deductible for workers covered by an employer plan was $1,221 in 2016, up 13 percent from $1,077 in 2015. And deductibles can run high for Obamacare plans. In a story headlined, "Many Say High Deductibles Make Their Health Law Insurance All but Useless," the New York Times found that in many states, more than half the plans offered through HealthCare.gov had a deductible of $3,000 or more. Our rating Ryan said: "Obamacare has failed." The Affordable Care Act did not meet all its promises, including a big one -- that you could keep your insurance plan if you liked it. But health care costs have risen more slowly since the law took effect and the law has met its major goal of getting more people insured -- an estimated 20 million. That’s not a failure. The biggest problem with Ryan’s statement is that he, and Obamacare critics, take a nuanced situation and turn it into a black-and-white statement. The same problem would face those who say Obamacare is a great success. Our definition of Mostly False is "a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That fits here.

pomt-12354	"We have pay equity. When you think about that wage gap, we all know it's 78 cents to the dollar. Well, in New York state it's 90 cents to the dollar."	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2017/jun/09/kathy-hochul/new-york-closer-pay-equity-most-states/	Women fare better in New York state than in other states when it comes to pay equity, Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul said during a speech in late May. "We have pay equity," said Hochul, who claimed women in New York state earn as much as twelve cents more on the dollar than the national average. "When you think about that wage gap, we all know it’s 78 cents to the dollar. Well, in New York state it’s 90 cents to the dollar." While New York state and most other states have laws mandating equal pay for employees, a wage gap between men and women persists. Is Hochul right about how narrow New York state’s gender wage gap is compared to the national average? What the data shows Hochul’s numbers are in the ballpark of what federal data shows. Women in New York state earn 86.9 percent as much as the median pay of men, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Women earn 81.1 percent as much as men overall in the U.S. The bureau tracked full-time, year-round workers in 2015, the most recent numbers. Only three other states and Washington, D.C., have smaller gaps. Women in Hawaii earn 87.9 percent as much as men, the highest level. Research from the National Women’s Law Center places New York state higher. The center compared data from the U.S. Census Bureau on the median salary of full-time, year-round male and female employees in each state from 2015. The census estimates show women in New York state earn 88.7 percent as much as men — more than any other state — compared with 79.6 percent overall in the U.S. "The data sample sizes are larger using the [Census Bureau] community survey, which is why we and other organizations use it," said Maya Raghu, NWLC Director of Workplace Equality. Why New York state differs New York has exceeded the national average in pay equity since at least 1998, the earliest federal data available online. Some years are better than others. New York state was less than one percentage point above the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ national average in 2005, when women earned 81 percent as much as men in the U.S. Other states consistently rank near the bottom for pay equity. Why? Experts say no single reason explains it. Occupational segregation is one reason. The types of jobs women and men hold vary by state, Raghu said. North Dakota, where high-earning men dominate the oil industry, ranks low for pay equity. New York state’s higher minimum wage also makes a difference. The minimum wage in New York was $8.75 in 2015, above the federal minimum wage of $7.25. Having a higher pay floor reduces the gender wage gap for lower-income workers, experts say. "In places like New York that have a higher minimum wage, you’re going to see a smaller wage gap particularly at the lower end of the distribution," said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Union membership also has an effect, Gould said. New York state ranks higher in union membership than any other state in the country with a 23.6 percent union membership rate. Wyoming, which has the widest gender wage gap in the country, has a 6.3 percent union membership rate. "Your unions may be very strong in New York, including teachers unions and unions that support service workers," said Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution. New York City also drives up the state’s pay equity ranking. Data from the American Association of University Women breaks down the wage gap by congressional district in New York state. Most districts in New York City rank above those upstate. "I think the rural urban divide is definitely part of the story," said Kevin Miller, a senior researcher at AAUW. "Cities tend to have smaller gaps, which is why we see the District of Columbia having a small gap." Education is part of that. More women in New York state hold a bachelor’s degree or higher, according to census data. "The educational advantage is increasingly shifting toward women away from men, and in a technologically advancing economy that’s going to favor toward women and raise their relative earnings," Sawhill said. The family choices some women make during their careers also explain the wage gap. Women are more likely to take time off work to care for a newborn child or a sick relative. A woman in that scenario may miss a significant chunk in pay during their leave from work. Without supplemental income during that time away from work, women are more likely to report lower pay than their male colleagues, experts say. Our ruling Hochul said the gender wage gap in New York state is "90 cents to the dollar." Hochul is close to what federal data and research groups report as the wage gap in New York state. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says women in New York make close to 87 percent of what men make. Researchers say it is closer to 89 percent. Hochul's numbers are slightly off. The data reveals a gender pay gap, but her point that New York state has a significantly smaller gap compared with the national average is correct. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-05910	Says U.S. Senate Democrats "have gone without any budget at all" for more than 1,000 days.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/02/paul-ryan/democrat-controlled-us-senate-has-gone-nearly-thre/	The day before President Barack Obama delivered his State of the Union address, House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan took shots at him and other Democrats over federal budget matters. In a Jan. 23, 2012 news release, the Wisconsin Republican repeated one of his favorite complaints. "Tomorrow marks the 1,000th day Senate Democrats have gone without any budget at all," he said. Let’s see what Ryan meant by singling out Senate Democrats and claiming they’ve been without a budget for nearly three years. While we’re at it, let’s examine the implications of operating government without a formal budget. Ryan’s spokesman, Conor Sweeney, said the last time the Senate passed a budget resolution -- a necessary step in adopting the federal budget -- was on April 29, 2009. A PolitiFact Florida item on a claim similar to Ryan’s confirmed the date. That means it was 1,000 days from when the Senate adopted the fiscal 2010 budget to Jan. 24, 2012, the date Ryan referred to in his news release. Of course, since the 2010 budget went through Sept. 30, 2010, the government actually operated without a Senate budget resolution for only 481 days as of Jan. 24, 2012, a point Sweeney acknowledged. So, Ryan is using language that is a little loose in saying the Senate "went without a budget" for 1,000 days. But in interviews, on Twitter, in other statements and in an article he co-authored that was published the same day as his news release, Ryan has been clear that he means 1,000 days passed without the Senate adopting a budget. So, how has the government kept running? Budgets vs spending Excerpts from a June 2010 PolitiFact National item tell how the budget process is supposed to work: The Senate and House are supposed to pass resolutions in the spring that outline the framework for future bills that address spending, taxation and other fiscal policy items. This budget represents a plan for allocating revenues and expenditures for the coming fiscal year, as well as for the next four fiscal years in more general terms. Each chamber is supposed to pass a version of the resolution, and if the two versions differ, then the chambers jointly hammer out a compromise and pass it. If a budget resolution does not pass, the majority can adopt appropriations bills, which actually allocate money for specific purposes. But the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate. Neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate adopted a fiscal 2011 budget resolution, but the Republican-controlled House approved a fiscal 2012 budget resolution. That gave Ryan more fuel for blasting the Senate Democrats for not adopting one. The lack of budget resolutions contributed to delays in appropriations to government agencies, said Steve Ellis, a budget expert with Taxpayers for Common Sense, a nonpartisan group that analyzes federal spending. Ellis said no spending bills were approved for fiscal 2011 until after the fiscal year started in October 2010; the remainder weren’t approved until April 2011, halfway into the fiscal year. For fiscal 2012, final spending bills weren’t adopted until just before Christmas 2011, nearly three months into the fiscal year, he said. So, when it lacks a budget for direction, Congress still has the power to spend money and keep government operating, but the process can get mucked up. Implications of no budget Does it matter? It does to some people. Failing to adopt a budget resolution "is not a fiscal calamity," Ellis said, noting there are other methods to set budget levels and even with delayed spending bills the government keeps operating. "But I would like the Senate and the House to do a budget resolution because that is going to get a better result than ad hoc or other mechanisms to get around it." From Ryan’s perspective, as he said in a statement in July 2011, Congress "has a moral — and legal — obligation to propose and pass budgets that tackle our generation’s greatest challenge." He added that "America’s job creators want certainty and confidence in the economy — which requires a credible plan to cut spending, prevent future tax hikes, and reassure our creditors that we’re restoring fiscal discipline." But neither party can claim superiority on budget resolutions. Senate Democrats didn’t pass a fiscal 2011 budget because "Republicans were threatening to hijack the budget process and waste the American people’s time with pointless political votes," a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told PolitiFact Florida. "Faced with this obstruction, we decided it would be a more productive use of the American people’s time to move on and address other issues critical to middle-class families." Our Florida colleagues also foundthat since 1983, the House and Senate have failed to pass a joint budget bill on four occasions. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, under Democratic control in 2002, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind. On three other occasions (fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007), the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress. Our rating Ryan said "Senate Democrats have gone without any budget at all" for 1,000 days. It hasn’t been quite that long since the last Senate budget resolution expired, but it has been 1,000 days -- and counting -- since the Democrat-controlled Senate adopted a budget.

pomt-01037	The Republican Party has not won a presidential election without either a Bush or a Nixon on the ticket since 1928.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jan/26/tweets/it-true-republicans-havent-won-presidential-race-1/	As he moves toward formally entering the 2016 presidential race, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is hammering home the notion that Washington needs a "fresh face." It’s a two-edged critique aimed at potential Republican rivals such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and at Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic senator and first lady who is gearing up for 2016. The Clinton-Bush era in the nation’s capital is well known -- from 1980 to 2004, Jeb’s father (George H.W. Bush) or brother (George W. Bush) or Bill Clinton won their party’s nomination for president or vice president. Hillary Clinton, of course, nearly made the top of the Democratic ticket in 2008. But there’s a more sweeping claim making the rounds on social media -- and various websites -- as the 2016 race takes early shape. This is how Washington Post Wonkblog reporter Matt O’Brien put it: Republicans haven’t won a presidential election without a Bush or Nixon on the ticket since 1928. Seems kind of unlikely, doesn’t it? That was our first reaction as we quickly tried to do think back through the roster of GOP presidential and vice-presidential contestants over that 84-year span. It’s right on, though. It’s a testament both to the Bush family legacy and to Nixon’s lengthy, comeback-dotted career. The period in question covers 21 presidential elections starting in 1932. Democrats prevailed 12 times; Republicans 9. The presence of a Bush or Nixon on the ticket turned out to be a boon for Republicans during those eight decades. But it didn’t mean a lock: in two races Republicans fell despite the connection. Here we go: Nixon was Dwight Eisenhower’s running mate in 1952 and 1956 and served as vice president. In 1960, Nixon narrowly lost the presidential contest to John F. Kennedy, but returned to win two terms before resigning amid the Watergate scandal in 1974. George H.W. Bush was Ronald Reagan’s running mate and vice president for two terms, then won the presidency in 1988 before bowing to Bill Clinton in 1992. Finally, Bush’s son George W. Bush was atop the GOP ticket in 2000 and 2004 before Barack Obama reclaimed the White House for Democrats in 2008 and 2012. You have to reach back to the GOP team of Herbert Hoover and Native American U.S. Sen. Charles Curtis in 1928 to break the streak. They won in a landslide over Democrats Al Smith and Joseph Robinson, with Socialist Party candidate Norman Thomas getting a smattering of support. Hoover, of course, was ushered out in 1932 as the Great Depression raged, and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt era began. Our rating No Republican has been elected president since 1928 without a member of the Bush family or Richard M. Nixon on the GOP ticket? You could look it up. But now you don’t have to. True.

pomt-12724	Says former president Jimmy Carter said, "Medical marijuana cured my cancer."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/mar/06/blog-posting/bogus-claim-jimmy-carter-credits-marijuana-curing-/	The Internet is getting a sustained buzz from a fake news story about former President Jimmy Carter saying marijuana cured his cancer, but the years-old hoax can only burn readers. "Jimmy Carter: ‘Medical marijuana cured my cancer,’" reads the headline on a post dated Dec. 8, 2015, from CannaSOS.com. The site says it is a social media platform where "cannabis enthusiasts" can discuss information related to marijuana. The post says Carter had become a cannabis connoisseur since being diagnosed, and credited a medical marijuana purveyor in Oakland, Calif., for helping find a proper strain of the drug. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fake, as part of the social media network’s efforts to thin out fake news stories. While the story goes back to 2015, it was shared on Facebook more than 1,000 times in the past seven months. Versions of the same story have appeared in links from other websites, as well. In 2015, Carter was really diagnosed with skin cancer that had spread to his brain, but in December of that year announced the cancer’s growth had been arrested and reversed. Instead of medical marijuana, Carter announced he had been trying a new drug called Keytruda that appeared to help control and reverse the metastatic melanoma. The fake story, meanwhile, appears to have originated from a Dec. 7, 2015, post on a site called SatiraTribune.com. There’s no disclaimer on the site, but their Facebook page notes that SatiraTribune publishes "satirical and futuristic news." The story is full of cliches about smoking marijuana, including Carter being forgetful and having the munchies for peanuts. It also says Carter would be supporting legalization efforts in several states. (Four more states voted to allow recreational marijuana in 2016, while three others approved medical marijuana. That brings the total number of states with some form of legal marijuana to 28, plus the District of Columbia.) Carter’s own record on marijuana is a little hazier than the story makes it out to be. He suggested to Congress in 1977 that possession of up to one ounce of marijuana should be decriminalized, in an effort to keep people out of prisons for smoking the drug. When a CNN anchor asked him in 2012 whether he supported legalization, he said, "I’m in favor of it. I think it’s OK." He recently clarified his position in 2013: "I do not favor legalization," he said at a meeting of state legislators and regulators. "We must do everything we can to discourage marijuana use, as we do now with tobacco and excessive drinking." But perhaps the biggest giveaway is a faked quote from Carter that reads, "I smoke two joints in the morning, I smoke two joints at night, I smoke two joint in the afternoon, and it makes me feel all right." That’s actually the opening line from The Toyes’ 1983 weed anthem "Smoke Two Joints," although many people instead refer to Sublime’s 1992 cover, or even Macy Gray’s 2012 interpretation. We don’t know which version Carter would prefer. At any rate, this is a fake story that sparked a wave of readers being fooled. We rate it Pants On Fire!

pomt-02485	The prosecution of state Sen. Don Balfour cost less than $100, excluding prosecutors’ salaries.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/19/lauren-kane/cost-prosecuting-balfour-put-test/	What price justice? December’s trial of state Sen. Don Balfour, R-Snellville, cost taxpayers either a pittance or a pile, depending on whom you ask. Balfour, once chairman of the powerful Senate Rules Committee, stood trial in December on allegations he swindled taxpayers by submitting false state expense reports. He was acquitted after an 18-month investigation and a three-day trial. On the day that the jury verdict came down, Lauren Kane, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Sam Olens, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the Attorney General’s Office, as a ballpark figure, spent "less than $100" on the case, not including the salaries of prosecutors. Two readers asked: Is that plausible? We ourselves wondered. At trial, attorney William B. Hill Jr., a member of the Balfour defense team and a former deputy state attorney general, estimated the cost of prosecuting his client at $1.2 million to $1.5 million. We began our research by circling back to Kane with a request for records of all case expenses. Kane said a couple of more bills had come in, pushing the office’s costs for the case to $303.95. But what about staff time? What was the rationale for not counting that? Kane said the office didn’t count the salaries of the four prosecutors who worked on the case because they are "fixed costs" and those employees would have been paid, regardless. We checked in with two former prosecutors, a former investigator and a sitting Superior Court judge to see what they thought. They all said it is fair to consider staff salaries as part of the costs. To say otherwise is "wrong," former DeKalb County District Attorney J. Tom Morgan said. "They are lawyers, and the fact that they are working on the public dole does not mean their time is not worth anything," Morgan said. "They are public servants who would be serving the public somewhere else if not for that trial." The legal minds we consulted also pointed out that the AG’s Office has spent millions of dollars in recent years hiring outside attorneys because of shortages of staff and expertise in some areas of the law. More than one raised the question: If those staffers had been free to work on other cases, instead of Balfour’s, couldn’t the AG’s Office have been able to cut some of its outside legal costs? Kane said no. None of the work that is farmed out involves criminal cases, she said. The AG’s Office had four prosecutors working on the case against Balfour. Collectively, the four logged 570 hours. The highest-paid of them put in 160 hours, the equivalent of four 40-hour weeks, according to information provided by the AG’s Office. We put the calculator to work. We looked at the annual salaries of the four employees — $106,924, $99,846, $95,000 and $63,936 — and the hours each worked on the case. We put the cost for the staff time they said was dedicated to Balfour’s case at $22,667, or about 10 times the amount the defense said the senator was accused of wrongly pocketing over five years. We decided also to look at the time invested by the GBI, which launched a criminal investigation at the request of the AG and after Balfour admitted to the Senate Ethics Committee that he’d submitted some erroneous expense reports and agreed to pay a $5,000 fine. In response to an open records request, the GBI told us that the special agent in charge of the investigation worked 371 hours on the case and a forensic auditor logged 620 hours. The time investment of the two added up to $19,203, based on salary information provided. That put salary costs associated with the investigation and prosecution at more than $40,000. We went back to Hill to ask about his estimates. He said he based them on cases he’d seen come through in his decade-plus in the AG’s Office, including six years as deputy attorney general. He said he believes his estimate would be in the ballpark, if all costs were calculated, including the time of the judge, court personnel, jurors and the many people interviewed by state investigators and prosecutors. Balfour has said he spent $156,787 defending himself against 18 felony charges. He has asked to get that money back from the state, and that’s an issue still to be settled. After the trial, Olens issued a statement saying Balfour’s expense requests "were too numerous and systematic to be simply isolated mistakes." "If those requests had been submitted by an unelected state employee, they would have been prosecuted," he said, "and a state senator should not be held to a lower standard." The jury foreman said she wasn’t sure how the reports became the subject of a criminal trial. "Personally, when you started looking at the dollar amounts of the charges, it became ‘Are we really here to talk about this?’ " she said in December. So where does that leave us? In an email to an AJC reporter on Dec. 19, Kane said the AG’s Office spent "less than $100" on the case. She said that did not include attorneys’ fees. She later amended the costs to $303.95 to include some subsequent bills. That fits with the original request for "ballpark" estimates of the office’s costs. The numbers provided were on target. But some critical information was excluded. Under our rating system, the statement merits a Half Truth.	None	Lauren Kane	None	None	None	2014-02-19T00:00:00	2013-12-19	['None']
pomt-02708	"61 percent of non-tea party Republicans actually agree...there is 'solid evidence the earth is warming,' ...[but] 70 percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there is 'no solid evidence' the earth is warming."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/dec/28/sheldon-whitehouse/us-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-most-republicans-ag/	During his weekly floor speeches on climate change, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse has been promoting the idea that congressional Republicans who blocked climate change legislation are out of touch with Republicans throughout the United States. On Nov. 25, PolitiFact Rhode Island gave a Mostly True ruling on Whitehouse’s claim that, in a poll, "53 percent of young Republican voters . . . under age 35 said that they would describe a climate [change] denier as 'ignorant,' 'out of touch' or 'crazy.'" Whitehouse repeated his assertion about young Republicans in a slightly different way during his Dec. 17 speech on climate, his 53rd, focusing on the attitudes of the tea party faction of the Republican Party. He cited a poll that looked at all Republicans, not just those under age 35. "Another national survey, this one by the Pew Research Center, found that most -- 61 percent of non-tea party Republicans -- actually agree, actually agree there is 'solid evidence the earth is warming,' with a plurality saying it is 'mostly because of humans,'" Whitehouse said. "But the tea partiers are different," he added. "Seventy percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there is 'No solid evidence' the earth is warming. And 41 percent of tea partiers assert that warming is 'Just not happening.'" "Unfortunately here in Congress," he said later in the speech, "the dark, heavy hand of the polluters is helping the tea party drive the Republican Party off the cliff." Was Whitehouse correctly characterizing the attitudes of Republicans in general and members of the tea party in particular? We went back to the Pew survey to look at those numbers. Pew conducted the poll of 1,504 adults from Oct. 9-13, 2013; 655 said they were Republicans or leaned Republican, and 304 of them identified with the tea party. Asked whether there is "solid evidence the earth is warming," 61 percent of non-tea party Republicans said yes; just 25 percent of tea party supporters said yes. (The margin of error for tea party numbers is plus or minus 6.5 percentage points and 6.2 percentage points for non-tea party Republicans. So Whitehouse quoted the findings accurately, within the margin of error. Whitehouse was also correct when he said that 70 percent of tea party members responding said there is no solid evidence that Earth is warming, with 41 percent saying it's just not happening. In contrast, a mere 13 percent of other Republicans said it's "just not happening." Yet just because Republicans think there's good evidence that Earth is warming doesn't mean they think human activity is responsible. That's an important point to consider when looking at whether members of the GOP support trying to do something to reverse the trend. Among non-tea party Republicans who thought the planet is warming, nearly 40 percent said it was due to natural patterns. Our ruling Sheldon Whitehouse said that "61 percent of non-tea party Republicans actually agree . . . there is 'solid evidence the earth is warming,' . . . [but] 70 percent of tea partiers, contrarily, say there is 'no solid evidence' the earth is warming." The senator was accurately quoting the results of the October Pew poll. But there's more to the story if you want to understand the ongoing opposition to climate change legislation by supporters of the GOP. While many non-tea party Republicans acknowledge that climate change is occurring, a majority (54 percent) still either deny climate change or think it is part of a natural cycle not caused by human activity. That's an important factor to consider, which Whitehouse omitted. For that reason, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-14027	It's entirely possible that the Democratic nominee, [Hillary Clinton], earned more money giving a single speech on Wall Street than I made the six years that I was there back in the 1980s… In fact, it’s quite likely.	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/may/31/pat-toomey/pat-toomeys-wall-street-earnings-likely-didnt-top-/	U.S. Senator Pat Toomey, R-Pa., appeared on the Chris Stigall Show two weeks ago, and he wasn’t afraid to poke fun at his Wall Street past. When Stigall mentioned that Hillary Clinton has been paid lucratively for giving speeches to Wall Street banks, Toomey responded by making a comparison between Clinton and himself. "It's entirely possible," said Toomey "that the democratic nominee, [Hillary Clinton], earned more money giving a single speech on Wall Street than I made the six years that I was there back in the 1980s." "In fact," he went on, "it’s quite likely." We reached out to the Toomey campaign multiple times seeking information about how much he earned during his six years on Wall Street, but they never got back at us. The hefty salaries of modern-day Wall Street traders are viewed by many with disgust, but 30 years ago, Wall Street was a very different place. Is it possible Pat Toomey earned less on Wall Street than Clinton did for a single speech there? We decided to find out. How much has Hillary made for her speeches? It’s no secret Clinton has made a lot money from giving speeches, but most of the speeches that she’s given were not to Wall Street banks. According to her 2014 tax return, 14 of the 41 speeches Clinton gave in 2013 were to Wall Street banks, and she was paid the same amount, $225,000, for most of them. But on Oct. 7, 2014, her Public Financial Disclosure Report report states that she gave a speech to Deutsche Bank and earned $260,000 for it. CNN compiled a list of all the amounts that the Clintons have earned for speaking to big banks from February 2001 to May 2015, and it reaffirms that amount for her Deutsche Bank speech. But Toomey’s claim specifically refers to Wall Street. If Clinton made $260,000 in her most profitable speech to a Wall Street firm, then Toomey would have had to have made an average of about $43,000 during his six years on Wall Street for his claim to be true. The Rise of the Stock Market and the Traders in it Toomey worked on Wall Street from 1984 to 1990 for Chemical Bank and Morgan Grenfell. In a 1999 interview with Derivatives Strategy magazine, Toomey discussed the work he did at Morgan Grenfell, where he said he and a few others were recruited to start a "serious derivatives operation." "We were dealing in various currencies," said Toomey, "all kinds of interest rate and currency-related derivatives—options, swaps, forwards and so on." A report by the Los Angeles Times confirmed Toomey traded derivatives around interest rates and currencies. Again, when we asked the Toomey campaign if they could provide us with approximate salary figures for Toomey or Wall Street derivatives traders in the 1980s, we didn’t receive a response. Luckily, there are some figures we can use as approximations. The derivatives market exploded during Toomey’s time on Wall Street. In fact, the size of the global derivatives industry more than quintupled from 1986 to 1991. According to a report by Mother Jones, the notional value of derivatives contracts went from $865 billion to nearly $4.5 trillion. Salaries for Wall Street employees were not nearly as lucrative as they are today, but employees there were still among the highest-paid in the nation. A New York Times article from 1987 put the average salary on Wall Street that year at $65,000, before bonuses (which was more than three times the average New Yorker’s salary of $19,000). That number included all Wall Street employees, from the highest-ranking positions to new analysts. According to the Derivatives magazine article, Toomey’s position at Chemical Bank was "associate," a position generally considered to be above entry level and often given to people with MBAs. Philip Bond, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Washington, said a salary of $43,000 was within the realm of possibility. "I guess an average of $43,000 a year strikes me as being on the low side," said Bond, "But I don't think it is impossible. After talking to colleagues here, I believe the starting salary for an undergraduate on Wall Street would have been considerably less than $43,000 in 1985." However even in the 1980s, Wall Street traders generally earned significant bonuses along with their annual salaries. Former bonds salesman Michael Lewis wrote about how bonuses were determined in his bestselling book Liar’s Poker. "A salesman's year-end bonus was determined by traders," writes Lewis, " A trader's bonus was determined by the profits on his trading books. A salesman had no purchase on a trader, while a trader had complete control over a salesman." Toomey doesn’t appear to have been a bad trader. Morgan Grenfell hired him and other associates to start its derivatives operation in 1986, according to the Derivatives Strategy magazine article. If Toomey made significant profits as a derivatives trader, then he would likely have made a solid bonus along with his salary. Lewis, as he notes in Liar’s Poker, made a bonus of $45,000 in his first year as a bonds salesman, matching his $45,000 salary that year. Lewis had a M.A. in economics when he entered Wall Street, while Toomey only had a B.A. in government. It is possible Toomey made an annual compensation of less than $43,000 per year, but that seems unlikely when we take a bonus into account. And even if he did make an average of $43,000 a year during his time on Wall Street, inflation would put his total haul at well above $260,000. We asked two professors to help us adjust a 1985 salary of $43,000 for wage inflation. Ehud Ronn, a professor of finance at the University of Texas at Austin, also noted the figure of $43,000 a year seemed somewhat low. Ronn used an index that reported a historical time series of compensation in the financial sector. According to the index, a salary of $43,200 in March 1985 would be equivalent to $124,200 in 2016. If Toomey made an average of $124,200 over six years, he would have made $745,200 in 2016 dollars according to this estimate. Bond, the University of Washington professor of finance, used GDP per capita to adjust for wage inflation. "Nominal GDP per capita is about 4 times as high today is in the mid-1980s" said Bond, "So if financial compensation had grown at the same speed as nominal GDP per capita, $43K in 1985 would equate to roughly $170K today." If Toomey made an average of $170,000 over six years, he would have made $1,020,000 in 2016 dollars according to this estimate. "Based on these back-of-envelope calculations, I suspect Toomey's statement is true, or at least close to true," started Bond, "but if he adjusted for inflation, his claim is most likely not true." Lynn Stout, a professor of corporate law at Cornell University and an internationally recognized expert in the field of financial derivatives, seemed to believe that a yearly figure of $43,000 would have been very low even in the 1980s. "If he did receive only $43,000 a year for six years of trading," said Stout, "he must have been one of the worst performing and worst paid derivatives traders on Wall Street at the time." Our ruling Pat Toomey said that it was possible and even likely that Hillary Clinton earned more money giving a single speech to a Wall Street bank than he did in his six years there. Clinton earned $260,000 in her most profitable speech to a Wall Street bank, so Toomey would have had to have earned an average of about $43,000 per year on Wall Street. It’s possible the entry-level salary for a trader was less than $43,000 in the 1980s, but Toomey was a trader at the forefront of the derivatives operation at Morgan Grenfell. So it’s likely he earned a significant bonus, which would put his earnings over that threshold. It gets less likely if we adjust Toomey’s non-bonus-inflated potential salary for inflation. An annual salary of about $43,000 in 1985 would make significantly more than $260,000 over six years in 2016 dollars. And Toomey didn’t just say it was "possible" he made less in six years on Wall Street than Clinton did in one speech. He said it was "likely." Based on average salaries and bonuses from this era of Wall Street and input from experts, it does not seem likely. It gets less likely if we adjust Toomey’s non-bonus-inflated potential salary for inflation. An annual salary of about $43,000 in 1985 would make significantly more than $260,000 over six years in 2016 dollars. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-13416	Says New START, passed while Clinton was secretary of state, is a "treaty cutting Russia’s nuclear arms."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/21/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-overstates-impact-new-start-russia/	Democrats and Republicans working together were able to get Russia to cut their nuclear arms, Hillary Clinton said in a recent television ad. In the ad, Clinton criticized her opponent, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, for claiming to be able to fix the country’s problems himself. She then touted her record as first lady, senator and secretary of state. "Donald Trump says he alone can fix the problems we face," Clinton says into the camera. "Well, I don't believe that's how you get things done in our country. It takes Democrats and Republicans working together. That's how we got health care for 8 million kids, rebuilt New York City after 9/11, and got the treaty cutting Russia's nuclear arms. We've got to bring people together. That's how you solve problems, and that's what I'll do as president." The ad, called "Only Way," has aired in seven states, beginning Sept. 9. We wanted to look at "the treaty cutting Russia’s nuclear arms," which led us to Clinton’s foreign policy record while secretary of state from 2009 through early 2013. Clinton is referring to the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START, an agreement between Russia and the United States designed to limit both countries’ deployed strategic nuclear weapons. The original START treaty was in force from 1994 until it expired in 2009; New START was signed in April 2010 and went into force in February 2011. Clinton’s claim that New START cut Russia’s nuclear arms is imprecise and overstates the treaty’s impact. "Russia is not expected to rapidly or dramatically reduce its nuclear weapons holdings," said Lisa Koch, a professor and nuclear proliferation expert at Claremont McKenna College. "New START could be characterized as a modest, rather than a sweeping, arms control treaty." What’s in the treaty? New START has three primary limitations on vehicles capable of launching nuclear weapons and the nuclear warheads themselves. By February 2018, Russia and the United States each have to meet these restrictions: 700 deployed ballistic missiles and heavy bombers: intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons; 800 total deployed and non-deployed launchers: intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, submarine-launched ballistic missile launchers, and nuclear-capable heavy bombers; 1,550 total deployed nuclear warheads on these missiles and bombers. It’s accurate that these limits are more restrictive than prior treaties. For example, START I limited deployed nuclear warheads to 6,000, and the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty limited them to 1,700-2,200. But it’s questionable whether it has, in practice, reduced Russia’s nuclear arsenal for two main reasons: First, Russia was actually below New START limits in two out of the three categories right when treaty implementation began in February 2011. The State Department publishes where both countries stand on these requirements twice a year, starting with an initial exchange of data when New START took force in February 2011. At that time, Russia had 865 deployed and non-deployed launchers for strategic missiles and heavy bombers, meaning it would have to reduce that fleet by 65 to meet the limit of 800 by February 2018. However, Russia had 521 deployed missiles and heavy bombers out of 700 allowed, and 1,537 deployed nuclear warheads out of 1,550 allowed. So Russia could actually increase its deployed missiles and heavy bombers, as well as its deployed nuclear warheads, beyond that initial February 2011 count and still be within treaty limits. "It is true that the treaty has lower limits than previous treaties, but since Russia was already below the New START limits for deployed forces when the treaty entered into force in 2011, it is not correct to say that the treaty is ‘cutting Russia's nuclear arms,’ " said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, which supports arms control. In fact, the latest State Department report shows that as of March 2016, Russia has 1,735 deployed nuclear warheads, about 200 more than the treaty allows. At first glance, this might seem like Russia is building up its deployed nuclear arsenal in spite of the treaty. However, experts told us that this spike is actually a result of Russia modernizing its nuclear program. Essentially, they’re sending out new missile launchers and submarines that can hold more nuclear warheads per vehicle without having yet retired the old ones, so there’s some doubling up for the time being. Because New START doesn’t set limits during this interim implementation period (February 2011-February 2018), Russia still has a couple years to bring its deployed nuclear warheads within the limits set out by the treaty. Experts expect it to do so. "Russia’s compliance is not in doubt at this point," Kristensen said. Before New START passed, it was clear Russia intended to modernize its nuclear arsenal in a big way, said Steven Pifer, director of the Brookings Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Initiative. Now, their modernization efforts have to fit within the New START limits, and it’s unclear if they would have grown beyond those limits absent the treaty. "I would say that New START does reduce and limit Russian strategic arms, but I would not overly hype the depth of the reduction," said Pifer, a Clinton supporter who testified before Congress in favor of New START. Second, New START only limits a portion of the nuclear arsenals. New START mainly counts strategic, deployed weapons. But it doesn’t limit nonstrategic weapons, nor weapons that have been stockpiled or retired. The treaty "does not require either government to destroy non-deployed warheads," Koch said. "Both governments can still stockpile warheads beyond the agreed-upon limit of 1,550 without violating the treaty." Excluding the thousands of warheads that have been retired and are awaiting dismantlement, Russia currently has about 4,500 nuclear warheads, including stockpiles and the 1,735 deployed warheads reported for New START, according to Federation for American Scientists estimates. Russia’s total nuclear warhead arsenal has been on a steady decline since the 1990s. That decline has nearly stagnated during President Barack Obama’s presidency, hovering at around 4,500 since 2012, according to Federation for American Scientists data. Throughout Obama’s tenure — and Clinton’s term as secretary of state — Russia has shrunk its total nuclear arsenal far less than it did under the past three presidents. And it would be difficult to attribute any reduction in Russia’s nuclear stockpiles to New START, given that the treaty only limits deployed weapons. "The end of the Cold War, the financial crisis in the 1990s and the START I treaty had a much greater effect on shaping Russia's current and planned nuclear posture than the New START treaty," Kristensen said. It’s worth noting that some experts no longer consider stockpiles a serious threat to security. Under New START’s deployed weapons restrictions, the effectiveness of a large stockpile is limited, especially because Russia only produces about 10 missiles per year, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Thus the treaty might make it so that Russia does not feel the need to stockpile as many weapons. Our ruling Clinton said New START, passed while she was secretary of state, was a "treaty cutting Russia’s nuclear arms." The treaty hasn’t cut Russia’s nuclear arms yet. But if it does in the future, after the treaty is fully implemented in 2018, it seems that any reductions would be minimal rather than sweeping. New START has a limited impact in that it focuses on one portion of Russia’s nuclear program: deployed strategic weapons. The treaty does place tighter limits on these weapons than any past treaty. But Russia was actually already meeting the treaty’s limits, for the most part, when treaty implementation began. Also, the treaty does not restrict either country from stockpiling weapons, nor does it require them to destroy any existing weapons.

pomt-10148	"You had supported John McCain's military strategies pretty adamantly until this race."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/03/sarah-palin/mccain-and-biden-agree-on-military-matters-barely-/	During the vice presidential debate in St. Louis, Gov. Sarah Palin claimed that before the presidential campaign, Sen. Joe Biden agreed more with Sen. John McCain than with Sen. Barack Obama on military matters. Her claim came during a discussion of the Iraq war. "You're one who says, as so many politicians do, I was for it before I was against it or vice-versa," Palin said during the Oct. 2, 2008, debate. "Americans are craving that straight talk and just want to know, hey, if you voted for it, tell us why you voted for it and it was a war resolution. "And you had supported John McCain's military strategies pretty adamantly until this race and you had opposed very adamantly Barack Obama's military strategy, including cutting off funding for the troops — that attempt all through the primary." Palin was correct to say that both Biden and McCain voted to authorize the Iraq war in 2002, and voted for a military-funding bill that Obama opposed in 2007. But was she right to state broadly that Biden "supported McCain's military strategies pretty adamantly"? First let's look closely at just how adamant Biden and McCain were about voting for the Iraq war resolution. McCain was a strong supporter of granting Bush broad authority to invade pre-emptively. "The president has spoken clearly of the threat Saddam Hussein's regime poses to America and the world today," he said in the Senate on Oct. 10, 2002, the day before the vote. "In this new era, preventive action to target rogue regimes is not only imaginable but necessary ... In the new era we entered last September, warning of an attack before it happens is a luxury we cannot expect." By contrast, Biden was a reluctant supporter of the resolution. Before it was approved, he and Sen. Richard Lugar, the Indiana Republican, offered an unsuccessful alternative resolution narrowing the goal of American military action to disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, and emphasizing multinational support for any military action. When Biden did vote for the resolution, he voiced misgivings. "I find myself supporting this resolution but worried that supporting this resolution will get us into real trouble," he said in the Senate on Oct. 10, 2002. "I hope we don't walk out of here with my voting for this final document and somebody six months from now or six years from now will say we have the right now to establish this new doctrine of pre-emption and go wherever we want anytime." So he did not support McCain's position on the war resolution "pretty adamantly." More like pretty reluctantly. The other example to which Palin referred of Biden siding with McCain rather than Obama was their vote in favor of a military funding bill on May 24, 2007. Obama voted against the measure because it did not include a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq. Here's what Biden said about his vote on CNN on May 27, 2007: "I'm not going to use the troops as a pawn in this game...I've worked very hard...on getting these new mine-resistant vehicles into the field, which will cut casualties by two-thirds...We delay this funding, it kicks down the road another two to three months before these vehicles get on the road." That's pretty adamant. But there's a major area of military strategy on which Biden and McCain have not agreed: the surge. McCain pushed for an influx of troops to Iraq for several years before Bush finally adopted the strategy in early 2007. For that reason, it is the military strategy most closely associated with McCain. But Biden spoke out against it forcefully. On Meet the Press on Jan. 7, 2007, Biden said a surge would be "a tragic mistake." In April 2007, he told the Washington Post the surge would not succeed. He even singled out McCain as misguided. "Assume the surge worked, then what?" he told the Post . "Stay there forever?" So Biden "supported McCain's military strategies pretty adamantly," as Palin claimed, only when it came to military funding. He voted to authorize the war, but his reluctance stood in stark contrast to McCain's zeal. And he and McCain were utterly at odds on the surge. We find Palin's claim to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14464	Says Mahatma Gandhi once said, "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/03/donald-trump/donald-trump-falls-phony-gandhi-quote/	It's a message designed to inspire perseverance in the face of long odds, and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump invoked it on Instagram, accompanied by a photograph of a Feb. 28 rally in Alabama in advance of Super Tuesday. "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win," says the quote, which Trump attributes to Mahatma Gandhi, India's legendary activist who eschewed all violence. The quote is certainly legendary. A quick Google image search of the phrase "then they laugh at you" produced a flood of memes crediting Gandhi. We stopped count at 100. We found it on Bernie Sanders' Twitter feed. Sarah Palin posted it on Facebook Feb. 24 in front of a photo of Trump. Our colleagues at Snopes.com found an instance where Hillary Clinton used it during a 2004 fundraiser. And last year, Billionaire Magazine cited it in a Tweet to celebrate enormous wealth, without a hint of irony. Inspiring? Yes. Accurate? No. We reached out to the Trump campaign in hopes that they had an original source for the quote. They didn't respond. But there's no evidence that Gandhi ever said it. "I know of no source by Gandhi where this quotation occurs," said Dennis Dalton, professor emeritus at Columbia University's Barnard College, who has spent 55 years researching and writing on Gandhi's life. It's been thought to be false for quite some time, prompting the Christian Science Monitor to list it five years ago as one of "The 10 most famous things never actually said," although the Monitor reported no effort to find its origin. Some authors have suspected it's derived from a May 15, 1918, speech during a biennial convention of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America in which Nicholas Klein of Cincinnati, talking about that union, said, "First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And they they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you. And this is what is going to happen to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America." Barry Popik, a contributor to the Yale Book of Quotations and the Oxford English Dictionary, found a more recent variant in a 1968 article in Women's Wear Daily. Referring to French artist, writer, designer and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, the article says, "Cocteau expressed it best. ‘First, they ignore you. Then, they abuse you. Then, they heap you with honors. Or make you into a statue. Stone. Dead.’ " Popik said the first reference he has found giving Gandhi credit for that type of quote comes from an out-of-print book — the 1982 proceedings of an event held by the Workshop in Nonviolence Institute. Snippets can be seen on Google Books. On page 9 of volume 18 are the words, "Gandhi once observed that every movement goes through four stages: First they ignore you; then they abuse you; then they crack down on you and then you win." Note that the catchphrase itself is not in quotes. It appears the author was paraphrasing. "We have 1918 (in labor unions) and 1982 (in an antiwar group), and just about nothing in between. It's a real puzzle," said Popik. Dalton, the Gandhi historian, said a lot of quotes attributed to the nonviolent activist aren't real. "An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind," is a variant of a phrase written for the 1982 Richard Attenborough movie Gandhi. The catchphrase "You must be the change you want to see in the world," was also never spoken by him, he said. "The point is that a study of his life and work do tell us that he could have spoken or written such words, because they capture the spirit of what he did," said Dalton. "That's perhaps the best answer that I can give." In the end, it's comparable to people thinking that Sarah Palin said, "I can see Russia from my house" (Tina Fey said it while impersonating Palin on Saturday Night Live), that Humphrey Bogart uttered the phrase, "Play it again, Sam," in Casablanca, or that Sherlock Holmes said "Elementary, my dear Watson," during any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. A lot of people believe it, even though it's not true. Our ruling Trump quoted Mahatma Gandhi as saying, "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win." There's no evidence that Gandhi ever said any such thing. Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and many others have made the same mistake. The claim is False.

The National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome states that about 40,000 children are born each year suffering from Fetal Alchol Spectrum Disorders, which includes birth defects, but also conditions such as learning disabilities or poor motor skills. The group says that number is more than Spina Bifida, Down Syndrome and Muscular Dystrophy combined, but it's still quite a way from 300,000. As for birth defects alone, the Surgeon General says that alcohol-related birth defects affect between .5 and 2 infants per 1,000 births. That comes to between about 2,100 and 8,300 cases a year, given current birth rates.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2007-09-27T00:00:00	2007-09-26	['None']

pomt-04221	"When you look at the number of crashes before the cameras were installed compared to after, they’re virtually the same."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/nov/27/steve-acenbrak/red-light-cameras-dont-impress-roswell/	Roswell city leaders recently met to discuss a proposal to hit the brakes on red-light cameras. The idea to remove them is not new, but a claim about their effectiveness was interesting enough that we thought it should be put on the Truth-O-Meter. "When you look at the number of crashes before the cameras were installed compared to after, they’re virtually the same," said Steve Acenbrak, the city’s transportation director. Is that true? Roswell, a north Fulton city with a population of 91,168, has two red-light cameras. One sits at the intersection of Ga. 9 and Ga. 92/Holcomb Bridge Road. The other camera is located at Ga. 9 and Ga. 140/Mansell Road. The cameras were installed in February 2007. Red-light cameras became popular in many cities and counties as a way to reduce the number of motorists who run red lights and hit other vehicles or pedestrians who assumed they had the right of way. There is an ongoing argument about whether the cameras are effective when it comes to reducing accidents. The National Motorists Association, a group advocating motorists’ rights, has led the fight against the cameras. "There is no evidence that these ticket camera systems make drivers more safe," the association states on its website. "In fact, the opposite has proven true. Ticket cameras increase accidents!" A study by the Federal Highway Administration found that red-light cameras "provide a modest aggregate crash-cost benefit." The study found the cameras tend to reduce severe side-impact crashes, but increase less-severe rear-end collisions. The city of Alpharetta has red-light cameras at more intersections (seven) than any community in Georgia, according to state records. Atlanta has working cameras at six intersections, the records show. The city of Snellville, though, removed its cameras a few years ago. City officials said the number of violators was so small that it wasn’t cost-effective to keep them. Roswell officials have made a similar case to scrap its cameras, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Acenbrak said the city researched the number of wrecks at those intersections three years before the cameras were installed and three years afterward. The state Department of Transportation does not do its own research of wrecks at intersections with red-light cameras. It collects the data from the cities and counties with cameras, a spokeswoman said. Here’s what Acenbrak shared with PolitiFact Georgia at both intersections. At the Ga. 9 and Holcomb Bridge Road intersection, there was a slightly higher ratio of collisions there after the camera was installed. Acenbrak said there were three wrecks in the 25 months prior to the cameras. There were three wrecks in the 22 months after the cameras were installed, he said. At Ga. 9 and Mansell Road, there was a higher percentage of wrecks before the cameras were installed as opposed to the total afterward. Acenbrak’s numbers show there were three wrecks in the 13 months before the cameras were installed, a ratio of one collision about every four months. The director said there were two crashes in the 22 months afterward, a ratio of one wreck every 11 months. Acenbrak said those numbers prove his point, along with other data he presented to us, such as less than 3 percent of wrecks throughout the city each year can be attributed to motorists running red lights. "We still have red-light runners, but they’re not causing crashes," he said. To summarize, Acenbrak said the number of wrecks at Roswell’s red-light camera intersections was virtually the same before and after the cameras were installed. At Ga. 9 and Holcomb Bridge Road, it was almost identical. At Ga. 9 and Mansell Road, the ratio of wrecks after the cameras were installed was smaller.

Two months later, the gaping divide between the two parties on abortion -- seen in the bitter floor debate over the bill -- remains wide. That was evident when Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha) and the Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) were interviewed together on Wisconsin Eye Aug. 7, 2013. Vos said he was proud the new law means that "every single mother has the opportunity to see the child" before making a "final decision to end the life of that baby." Democrats who sued to block the law, he added, are "out there saying it’s more about getting rid of the child than it is about giving information to the mother, and I think that’s sad." In response, Barca called the new law "so irresponsible." "I think it's maybe the first time we've dictated a medical procedure a woman has to go through, whether she can afford it or wants it or believes it’s necessary. In the case of rape … even if you're raped, if you don't report it in the first 30 days, the Republicans will force you to have to have an ultrasound." The bill passed on party-line votes, and Gov. Scott Walker signed it into law July 5, 2013. Besides ultrasounds, Act 37 requires doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles. The law’s authors say that means better care if abortions result in urgent medical problems. A judge has temporarily blocked the requirement on doctors, but the ultrasound provision remains in effect. Abortion providers argue the admitting requirement would force closure of two clinics because their doctors don't have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. The result, they say, is that abortions in Wisconsin would not be available north of Madison or -- after the 19th week of pregnancy -- anywhere in the state. While the ultrasound provision has drawn much attention, the treatment of sexual assault victims under the bill has drawn relatively little. Is Barca right that women who do not report a rape within 30 days would be required to have an ultrasound? More about the law Under the law, the person performing the ultrasound must describe what is being shown and provide the woman an opportunity to see the ultrasound images. But the woman can't be required to view the images. PolitiFact Wisconsin previously rated False a claim by activist Rachel Campos-Duffy that more than 90 percent of women seeking an abortion decide not to get one after seeing their ultrasound. Research indicates that some women change their mind, but no solid evidence backs her sweeping claim. Barca’s statement was specific to sexual assault victims. The new law explicitly grants an exception -- a "waiver" in the bill’s parlance -- from pre-abortion ultrasounds when a pregnancy is the result of sexual assault or incest, or in cases of medical emergencies. The bill’s definition of "sexual assault" includes rape. It covers assaults of the first, second and third-degree. The reporting requirement drew criticism from some lawmakers and the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault, which said that for victims who don’t report a rape, an ultrasound "only serves to remind them of the trauma caused by the perpetrator." Several things have to happen before sexual assault victims qualify for the waiver. -- The woman must state that a report alleging the assault has been made to law enforcement. -- A physician or qualified assistant must confirm the report has been made and make a notation in the woman’s medical file. -- Law enforcement officials must confirm -- confidentially -- that they received the report. So it’s correct to say that rape victims who seek abortions would be required to have an ultrasound unless they report to police. But Barca runs into trouble on part of his statement. He frames his claim around a specific time limit, saying that rape victims don’t just have to make a report to avoid an ultrasound, they have to do so within 30 days. To be sure, that reporting timeframe is the norm in Wisconsin. In 2010, 72 percent of the 4,857 reported sexual assaults were reported within 30 days, state figures show. Still, another 12 percent of those reporting did so after a month but before one year, and another 5 percent did so after a year. No data was available on the rest. But our search of Act 37 and related statutes, plus checks with legislative officials and interest groups, found no evidence of any specific timetable in the law enforcement reporting provision. Rather, victims can report the crime and thereby avoid an ultrasound scan without regard to any time limits. Barca aide Erik Greenfield told us the lawmaker misspoke in mentioning a 30-day time limit. It’s unknown exactly how many rape victims seek abortions but do not report being assaulted. But there is evidence that many sexual assault victims do not report file a report with police, for a variety of reasons. Nationally, a large survey by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an arm of the U.S. Justice Department, showed that 64 percent of rapes or sexual assaults against females were not reported to the police from 2005 to 2010. The leading reasons for not reporting: feared reprisal (20 percent); considered it a personal matter (13 percent); felt police would not help (13 percent); reported to different official (8 percent); not important enough to report (8 percent); did not want to get perpetrator in trouble (7 percent). In Wisconsin, evidence suggested that only 19 percent of sexual assaults are reported to law enforcement, the state Office of Justice Assistance, said in 2011. OJA was an independent state agency eliminated in the 2013-’15 state budget. Critics of the bill say these numbers strongly suggest that some abortion-seeking assault victims will be non-reporters and therefore will be forced to get an ultrasound. State Sen. Mary Lazich, the bill’s sponsor, doesn’t deny the possibility, but said victims could avoid that. "They need to report sexual assaults," Lazich, R-New Berlin, told us. Our rating Barca said that a new law passed by Republicans regulating abortion deals with sexual assault victims this way: "Even if you're raped, if you don't report it in the first 30 days, the Republicans will force you to have to have an ultrasound." The law does require an ultrasound when such victims do not report the assault to law enforcers, but there is no 30-day deadline for doing so. Barca’s claim is partially accurate but misses on an important detail that muddles his message. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-08142	The Pentagon's survey about the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy found that 92 percent of service members "agree that they could serve ... in a unit in combat" without compromising "mission readiness."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/06/wesley-clark/wesley-clark-says-92-percent-troops-surveyed-would/	On Dec. 5, 2010, ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour devoted much of its program to a discussion of whether, and how, to end the military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy and open the ranks fully to gay and lesbian service members. A portion of the discussion addressed a detailed Pentagon study of the issue released on Nov. 30. The study, among other things, included a survey of some 115,000 active-duty and reserve members, which the report called "one of the largest surveys in the history of the U.S. military." Those who back the effort to open the military to openly gay and lesbian personnel hailed the survey as concrete evidence that any problems integrating gay men and women into the services will be limited and manageable. Opponents of a change, for their part, found evidence within the survey that showed a greater likelihood of problems, especially in specific groups such as combat units. On This Week, retired Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the former top NATO commander in Europe and a former Democratic presidential candidate, cited one finding from the survey that indicated that a transition away from "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" should be achievable with relative ease. Clark said "what the survey showed is that essentially all of the service members, 92 percent, agree that they could serve -- they could serve in a unit in combat, and they could work together effectively, and it wouldn't compromise mission readiness." He continued, "I think a lot of the survey, honestly. It shows the effects of six, eight months' politicization, continuing coverage in the media, and some of it is just people in the military saying, just leave us alone and let us do our job. They come down on one side or the other of this. Let's just get on with it." We wondered whether the study really showed that 92 percent of service members were comfortable serving with gay men and women, as Clark suggested. We found that Clark was off the mark in describing what that poll result meant. Once we looked at the report, we were able to find the 92 percent statistic easily. It appears in the report summary, as one of three findings that "best represented" the survey as a whole. "When asked about the actual experience of serving in a unit with a co-worker who they believed was gay or lesbian, 92 percent stated that the unit’s 'ability to work together' was 'very good,' 'good,' or 'neither good nor poor,'" the report said. Superficially, that sentence seems to back up Clark's comment. However, the report is worded somewhat unclearly, and it took us a couple readings before we fully understood what the 92 percent figure referred to. In a footnote, the report sources the statement to Question 47a. But there's a problem for Clark. That question was asked only of a subset of survey respondents -- those who "said they served with a coworker they believed to be gay or lesbian and where all, most, some or a few other unit members believed the coworker to be gay or lesbian." Of the roughly 115,000 service members interviewed for the survey, only about 78,500 -- or two-thirds -- fell into that category. One can imagine that service members who have been through the experience of serving alongside a gay or lesbian colleague might feel more comfortable about the arrangement than those who have not. So using this subset to extrapolate to all service members is problematic. And when survey questions were asked of all respondents, rather than just the subset of those who think they served with someone gay, the levels of comfort are consistently lower. In Question 68a, for instance, the survey asked, "If 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell' is repealed and you are working with a service member in your immediate unit who has said he or she is gay or lesbian, how, if at all, would it affect how service members in your immediate unit work together to get the job done?" For this question, 26 percent answered "negatively" or "very negatively." That's more than triple the 8.4 percent that answered "poor" or "very poor" when an equivalent question was asked only of those who believed they had served with a gay or lesbian colleague. Answers were similar with other questions asked of the entire set of respondents. When asked how "service members in your immediate unit (would) pull together to perform as a team" after the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," a little more than 29 percent of all respondents answered "negatively" or "very negatively." And when asked "how service members in your immediate unit (would) trust each other" after repeal, about 33 percent of all respondents answered "negatively" or "very negatively." It's worth noting that even at these higher rates, only a minority of survey respondents said that repealing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" would produce exclusively negative consequences. So while the level of comfort Clark cites -- 92 percent -- is too high, the survey nonetheless found a notable degree of comfort with a repeal "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" within the ranks. (Or at least a tolerance for repeal. Only about 18 percent of all respondents went so far as to say repeal would be "very positive" or "positive," while 52 percent -- an absolute majority -- said it would either have no effect on performance or an equal mix of positive and negative effects.) So Clark is generally right that only a small minority of service members think a repeal would have negative or very negative effects on unit performance, but he exaggerates just how small that minority is. For this reason, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Wesley Clark	None	None	None	2010-12-06T16:27:23	2010-12-05	['The_Pentagon']

pomt-15221	Says he was "one of the chief architects" of balancing the federal budget.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/09/john-kasich/checking-out-john-kasichs-claim-he-was-one-chief-a/	Days after the first Republican presidential debate, Donald Trump continues to exert a powerful gravitational pull on his GOP rivals. If they aren’t talking about him, they are talking about why they don’t care to talk about him. Ohio Gov. John Kasich aimed to steer clear of Planet Trump on the Sunday news shows. When ABC’s George Stephanopoulos asked Kasich if he thought Trump is a problem for his party, Kasich said he doesn’t think of things that way. "What happened on Thursday is I was relaxed and I was able to talk about my record, balancing the federal budget, one of the chief architects, national security experience -- turning Ohio around." Like Kasich, we’ll set Trump aside and dig into the facts behind Kasich and a balanced federal budget. This is one his prime talking points. Kasich often casts himself as one of the chief architects of a balanced budget. Sometimes he carries it a step further and says he’s the chief architect. In fact, he said that later in his talk with Stephanopoulos, and during his interview on CNN’s State of the Union. But in this fact-check, we’ll assess his more humble claim. Kasich the budget cutter Kasich first won a seat in the House of Representatives in 1982. He had a reputation as a young lawmaker with more than abundant energy, a brash style and a willingness to work across the aisle. He backed a balanced budget amendment when Republicans were in the minority, and he was a leading voice for the measure when a GOP wave put his party in charge of the House under Newt Gingrich in 1994. Gingrich promoted Kasich over more senior lawmakers and made him chair of the House Budget Committee. Kasich’s big moment came in 1997. The nation was poised for a balanced budget. Deficits had been shrinking for years, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Between 1992 and 1996, they fell at an annual average rate of 24 percent each year. When the Clinton administration submitted a budget that would eliminate the deficit by 2004, Kasich was the first Republican to reject and call for a do-over. In a February op-ed, Kasich wrote that "it is not that difficult to cobble together a budget that could at least appear to be balanced within five years." But he said a balanced budget amendment would force leaders to deal honestly with every budget in the future. "If the politicians know they must not only achieve a balanced budget but also must maintain a balanced budget, they will have no choice but to develop credible solutions and do so sooner rather than later," Kasich wrote. No amendment emerged, but a bipartisan deal was struck by July, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, sponsored by Kasich, had a clear path. Kasich was at Clinton’s side when the bill was signed into law. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said of Kasich, "More than any single man, he is responsible for balancing the budget." There is no question that Kasich was a key player in the writing and passage of that law. Ramping up to a surplus The libertarian-leaning CATO Institute assessed the fiscal situation in 1998. Stephen Moore, the institute’s director of fiscal policy studies, gave the Republicans great credit for pushing for a balanced budget. He called the surplus the by-product of the GOP’s "single-minded crusade to end 30 years of red ink." But Moore argued that spending cuts had little to do with the final result. He noted that spending had risen $150 billion in two years. "We have a balanced budget today that is mostly a result of 1) an exceptionally strong economy that is creating gobs of new tax revenues, and 2) a shrinking military budget," Moore wrote then. Other analysts reached much of the same conclusion, although with a few more nuances. John Gilmour is a political scientist at the College of William and Mary. Gilmour notes that there were significant spending reductions in the 1997 bill. It curtailed Medicare spending, but did it so severely that those cuts have been routinely reversed by Congress (the so-called "doc-fix" measures). When Gilmour ran the numbers from 1979 through 2000, he found a pattern that preceded that 1997 budget law. "The budget surpluses resulted from revenues growing more rapidly than normal, and outlays growing somewhat more slowly than before," Gilmour said. That trend can be seen in this graph from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Both Gilmour and another researcher, political scientist B. Dan Wood at Texas A&M University, told PolitiFact that the groundwork for deficit reduction was laid in legislation passed in 1990 and 1993. The 1993 law increased taxes on the well-to-do as well as people of more modest means. Kasich opposed both measures. Wood notes that at least on paper, the 1997 law did trim spending by $127 billion between 1997 and 2002. He also points to the Tax Reduction Act of 1997 that, among other steps, reduced the capital gains tax from 28 to 20 percent, and child tax credits. But Wood says the timing of the surpluses and key elements of those two laws don’t line up. "The budget was in balance before any of the provisions of these laws came into effect," Wood said. "So, Kasich could not have been responsible for balancing the budget." We came across a couple of reminders of how different the times were almost two decades ago. Not only did Kasich agree to do a fundraiser for a Democratic colleague in California (Gary Condit whose affair with Chandra Levy later toppled his career), but we came across this in a Washington Post article: "Arianna Huffington, a conservative activist and columnist who has been encouraging Kasich to seek the nomination, said he is a fresh face in a party saddled with tired, "recycled" politicians. ‘He speaks with a passion,’ she said last week." Huffington went on to become the publisher of the liberal-leaning Huffington Post. Our ruling Kasich said he was one of the chief architects of the balanced federal budget. Kasich has a long track record of pushing for a balanced budget, and contemporary accounts from 1997 place him very much at the center of the action. His description of being "one of" the chief architects, instead of the sole mastermind, also puts him on safer ground. Conservative and independent scholars point out that it is also worth remembering that there was more going on that actually led to not just a balanced budget but budget surpluses. Some of those factors were beyond Kasich’s power to influence, such as the economy. In addition, he opposed earlier fiscal bills that ultimately were followed by falling deficits, and deficits continued to fall before some key elements of the budget plans he crafted ever took effect. His statement is accurate but needs additional information. So we rate it Mostly True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2015-08-09T19:36:52	2015-08-09	['None']

pomt-11719	Says the Obama administration purged "training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/15/scott-perry/gop-lawmaker-claims-fbi-purged-training-documents-/	Did the Barack Obama administration ditch FBI material used to train counterterrorism agents? At a House committee hearing on worldwide terror threats, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., claimed the former administration purged information that could "allow us to see in totality the threat that faces America." "Just curious if you can tell me if the FBI has taken any steps to reverse the previous administration's purge of training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood," Perry asked FBI director Christopher Wray at the Nov. 30 hearing. Wray said he was not aware of efforts to purge training material. "They were purged in the last administration," Perry told him. Is that true? Perry's office did not respond to our requests for information. We found the FBI did rescind training material during the Obama administration — but it was less than 1 percent of 160,000 pages of training documents that were found to contain information that was factually inaccurate, imprecise or used stereotypes. The review came after media reports show that training material included claims identifying "mainstream" American Muslims as "likely to be terrorist sympathizers." The Arab American Institute said the documents "crudely" depicted Arab Americans and American Muslims "as threatening, irrational, or otherwise abnormal." Here’s what we know about the FBI’s review and rescinded documents. Reports of anti-Muslim training material Wired in July 2011 reported that part of a January 2009 presentation for new FBI recruits said that Islam "transforms (a) country's culture into 7th-century Arabian ways." Additional Wired reporting in September 2011 found that during a training session at the FBI Academy in Quantico, Va., agents were told that "mainstream" American Muslims were "likely to be terrorist sympathizers; that the Prophet Mohammed was a ‘cult leader’; and that the Islamic practice of giving charity is no more than a ‘funding mechanism for combat’." A chart in the presentation contended that the more "devout" Muslims are, the likelier they are to be violent, Wired reported. The FBI distanced itself from the messages in the training. It told Wired that the presentation had a disclaimer saying the views expressed were of the author and "do not necessarily reflect the views of the U.S. government." An FBI press release issued a day after Wired’s report said the training segment was presented only one time and quickly discontinued. At a November 2011 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked then-Attorney General Eric Holder about the training material, presenting among examples a claim that ‘‘the Arabic mind is swayed more by ideas than facts." "It is regrettable that that information was, in fact, a part of a training program," Holder said, adding that there was an ongoing review of training material "to ensure that that kind of misinformation" was not being used, because it could undermine and negatively impact outreach efforts. The FBI reviewed 160,000 pages of material and eventually removed hundreds of pages from its training. Less than 1 percent of the material reviewed had "factually inaccurate or imprecise information or used stereotypes," the FBI told Wired in February 2012. A March 2012 letter from Durbin to then-FBI Director Robert Mueller expressed disappointment that the FBI would not produce a written report on the material deemed inappropriate, and that it would not be publicly shared or given to Congress. Durbin’s letter said FBI briefers shared copies of "a handful" of the material with Senate Judiciary Committee staff, but were not allowed to keep the copies. The FBI did not confirm to PolitiFact if it eliminated such material, but referred us to public source material and 2012 congressional testimony. At a May 2012 House Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the FBI, Mueller said 876 inappropriate training documents had been removed after a review of 160,000 documents and over 1,000 videos, but did not specify what the material said. Judicial Watch, a conservative group that litigates on public corruption and other issues, said documents it obtained through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit showed that reasons cited for the removal of material included: "Article is highly inflammatory and inaccurately argues the Muslim Brotherhood is a terrorist organization," and "author seems to conflate ‘Islamic Militancy’ with ‘terrorism’ and needs to define the difference and use it in their analysis." "The excised material included references linking the Muslim Brotherhood to terrorism, tying al Qaeda to the 1993 World Trade Center and Khobar Towers bombings, and suggesting that ‘young male immigrants of Middle Eastern appearance … may fit the terrorist profile best’," Judicial Watch said. Our ruling Perry said the Obama administration purged "training courses and information about Islamism, jihad, Sharia, and the Muslim Brotherhood." The FBI removed nearly 900 training documents containing information that was inaccurate, imprecise or depicted stereotypes, after a review of 160,000 pages and more than 1,000 videos. The review came after 2011 media reports about training material portraying Muslims stereotypically and prone to violence. Though the FBI did not publicly disclose the material it rescinded, Judicial Watch said that through a lawsuit for information, it found that removed material included references to the Muslim Brotherhood. Perry’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-06284	1 percent of Americans are millionaires. 47 percent of House Reps. are millionaires. 56 percent of Senators are millionaires.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/21/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-congress-has-disproportionate-s/	Over the past two months, the Occupy Wall Street movement has spread to cities around the country, and those other movements are busy putting out messages that protest against income inequality. A reader recently sent us an example from Facebook, which was an online message credited to Occupy D.C. The posting says: "1 percent of Americans are millionaires." "47 percent of House Reps. are millionaires." "56 percent of Senators are millionaires." "What would the country be like if our representative government was actually representative?" The reader asked us to check it out, and we were curious ourselves if the division of wealth between the country as a whole and our elected leaders was quite that stark. So we decided to unpack the numbers. We’ll take it in two parts. "1 percent of Americans are millionaires." A millionaire is a person whose net worth is $1 million or more. Net worth is cash, home value, stocks, bonds and other property minus any debts owed. The Federal Reserve Board conducts a Survey of Consumer Finances every three years. Its last survey was in 2007, with an update in 2009. The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute analyzed that data and determined that the average wealth of the top 1 percent was close to $14 million in 2009, down from $19.2 million in 2007 (in part because of a decline in housing values). Still, many in the top 1 percent clearly were multimillionaires. A 2011 study by the Deloitte Center for Financial Services estimated there are around 10.5 million households in the U.S. in 2011 with net worth of more than $1 million. That's around 9 percent of all households, which is far larger than 1 percent. If you measure how many individuals have incomes of $1 million or more, the Occupy D.C. posting was closer to the mark. The Internal Revenue Service recently released income statistics for 2009. It found the top 1 percent of the country included people who made adjusted gross income $343,927 and up. But adjusted gross income can leave out some types of income, particularly types of income not subject to tax. For a fuller pictures, we turned to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. It created an economic analysis of total cash income for 2011, not just taxable or adjusted income. The center found that the top 1 percent in 2011 had an average income of $1.5 million a year. However, some elites made slightly less the a million. The least wealthy of the top 1 percent had cash income of $532,613. Interesting, but income only doesn't define millionaires. "47 percent of House Reps. are millionaires. 56 percent of Senators are millionaires." Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate are paid $174,000 annually, with leadership positions paid slightly more. But many members of Congress were wealthy before they arrived and have substantial net worth. Members of the House and Senate are required to file financial disclosures that include their assets and liabilities, and the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics compiles those disclosures. The representatives and senators are not required to disclose precisely how much they are worth, but they do have to indicate a range of amounts for their assets and liabilities. The center calculates the midpoint between these high and low estimates, then uses that midpoint to rank-order lawmakers from richest to least rich. According to the center’s most recent analysis, 183 members of the House had a midpoint net worth estimate of at least $1 million. Meanwhile, the center calculated that 67 senators had a midpoint net worth estimate of $1 million or higher. These numbers were for the calendar year 2010. The wealthiest member of Congress was Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., the head of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. "Issa's minimum estimated net worth in 2010 was $195 million, while his maximum estimated net worth was more than $700 million," the center said in its analysis. The midpoint estimate in that range is $448 million. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., is the least wealthy member of Congress. Hastings’ liabilities exceed his assets; the center reported that his minimum estimated net worth is negative $7.3 million while his maximum estimated net worth is negative $2.1 million. The median net worth of House members was an estimated $756,765, while the median net worth of a senator was $2.63 million. So, using these estimates -- and remember, these are only estimates -- 42 percent of House members are millionaires, while 67 percent of senators are millionaires. Our ruling The Facebook posting from Occupy D.C. said, "1 percent of Americans are millionaires. 47 percent of House Reps. are millionaires. 56 percent of Senators are millionaires." One recent study found that around 9 percent of all U.S. households have net assets of more than $1 million. So the claim on Facebook significantly understates the wealth of individuals. It's closer if you look only at income. The top 1 percent of Americans has an average income of $1.5 million. But the relevant figure would be net worth. As for members of Congress, the most recent estimate shows that 42 percent of House members and 67 percent of senators are millionaires in net worth.

pomt-06326	"No other public or private business in America" except for the U.S. Postal Service must fund 100 percent of employee retirement and retirement health costs in advance.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/nov/11/sanford-bishop/bishop-signs-letter-saying-post-office-faces-big-p/	U.S. Postal Service leaders warn dire budget problems might force them to close offices and lay off 220,000 workers to keep from shutting down completely. But as ugly as the agency’s $9 billion deficit seems, lawmakers could do one simple thing to help stanch the bleeding, the postmaster general argues. Change laws that make the post office pay for retiree benefits years before the bills come due. Recently, U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, an Albany Democrat, signed a letter with 81 other members of Congress that echoed this argument. "The Postal Service would still have positive net revenue today except for the requirement that it prefund 100% of employee retirement and retirement health costs, a requirement that Congress imposed on it in 2006," it said. "No other public or private business in America faces this onerous and unnecessary requirement, and Congress could give the Postal Service breathing room to recalibrate its business model simply by repealing this retirement prefunding requirement," it continued. Our sister site PolitiFact National has already written about whether the post office’s financial losses would be solved by changing pension laws. What drew PolitiFact Georgia’s attention is the letter’s suggestion that the Postal Service is being singled out unfairly. Is it true that no other public or private business in America must prefund 100 percent of the costs of its retiree pension and health care benefits? Before we address this question, we should note that the USPS is a unique government organization. It’s a part of the executive branch, but unlike a typical federal employer, it can go belly up. And unlike with a typical business, Congress can pass laws that directly dictate how the Postal Service spends billions of dollars. One of these is the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006. It requires the Postal Service to do what’s called "prefund" 100 percent of the health benefits for its future retirees. The cost: About $5 billion a year until 2017. This is how it works. Each year, the federal government estimates how much Postal Service employees earned in pension and health retirement benefits and calculates what the USPS needs to save to pay these bills in the future. By law, the USPS has to store that money in a trust fund. The federal Office of Personnel Management, which oversees pensions for federal workers, acknowledged in a Feb. 28 study that among federal employers, the retiree health benefit funding rule is unique to the post office. They also said it’s essential. The USPS could go out of business, sticking the federal government with a bill it cannot pay. This could force the entire federal retiree health program to go broke, the OPM report argued. Now, let’s look at Bishop’s claim. Federal employers: Under the current retirement system, all federal employers, including the Postal Service, must prefund their pension benefits. And as we explained earlier, the USPS does have unique health benefit funding rules. It’s therefore accurate that under the current retirement system, no federal employer aside from the Postal Service must prefund 100 percent of both its retiree health and pension benefits. State and local governments: No federal or state rules require state or local governments to fully fund pension or health benefits, said Keith Brainard, director of research for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. None of the experts we interviewed had heard of cities, towns or counties with health prefunding requirements. Private industry: By federal law, private companies must fund their pensions fully, and catch up over time if they fall behind. They don’t have to prefund retiree health benefits. This means there’s no reason to go postal over the claim by Bishop and others that "no other public or private business in America" except for the USPS must fund 100 percent of employee pension and retirement health costs in advance. By and large, this statement fits the evidence. We do take some issue with the claim’s broader point, which is that the retirement funding requirement unfairly singles out the post office. As we noted above, the office that manages federal retiree benefits argues the arrangement could keep the entire federal health benefit fund from going broke. With this dispute in mind, we rule Bishop’s statement Mostly True.	None	Sanford Bishop	None	None	None	2011-11-11T06:00:00	2011-09-15	['United_States']

pomt-11086	Says "massive floods" led to Legionnaires’ disease outbreaks at the Quincy Veterans’ Home.	false	/illinois/statements/2018/jun/18/bruce-rauner/rauners-legionnaires-claim-misses-mark-and-point/	Gov. Bruce Rauner’s administration has faced a barrage of criticism for its response to a series of deadly Legionnaires’ disease outbreaks at the state-run veterans home in downstate Quincy. Speaking last week to a group of state employees and lawmakers about the state budget in downstate Marion, Rauner tied extreme weather conditions in 2015 to the outbreak that killed 12 Quincy Veterans’ Home residents that year and sickened dozens of others. Subsequent Legionnaires’ outbreaks at the home sickened more residents. "In 2015, we had massive floods and tornadoes," the governor said. "The Mississippi River got a bunch of flooded water into it, a lot of dirt, and a whole bunch of Legionella bacteria, which are nasty water bugs … The Mississippi River is where the Quincy Veterans’ Home gets its water. And bacteria got in all the old plumbing and we’ve been treating it and heating it and filtering it and you can’t get rid of all the bacteria, so now we’ve got to rebuild it." Rauner has been on the defensive over the Quincy situation ever since WBEZ, Chicago’s public radio station, disclosed late last year that his administration kept residents of the home as well as the public in the dark for several days after that 2015 outbreak was first detected. The flood theory isn’t the first time Rauner has sought to deflect blame for the deaths on to an Act of God out of his control. And that raises two complementary questions we thought worth checking out: Could he be right? And if he is, so what? Election year blame game The Quincy story continues to unfold against the backdrop of a heated election battle between Republican Rauner and Democrat J.B. Pritzker, so it stands to reason that the incumbent would be sensitive to allegations of fatally dropping the ball. Early this spring, we rated as Mostly False a claim by Pritzker seeking to connect a recent outbreak at Quincy of stomach flu-like norovirus with the earlier Legionnaires’ problems. A few months earlier, we rated as Half True an attempt by Rauner to explain away the Legionnaires’ problems at Quincy by stressing that the bacteria lurks in most Illinois water systems. Experts said such contamination usually presents no threat unless water systems are poorly maintained. Rauner’s argument about floods and tornadoes comes in the same spirit as his water systems comment, but experts say it is even less grounded in fact. WBEZ followed up by reporting that neither Rauner nor his public health administration were able to cite any analyses directly linking flooding to the outbreaks, which returned in 2016, 2017 and again this year. An array of experts, including federal health officials investigating the Quincy situation, also did not back up any flooding connection to the veterans’ home problems. So we asked Rauner’s office for any further evidence. We also sought an explanation for why attempting to pinpoint a cause for the initial outbreak mitigated criticism of how the administration handled the crisis once it was discovered. Spokeswoman Rachel Bold said the administration is exploring various theories for both the cause of, and remedy to, the outbreaks, and pointed to several studies on the correlation between increased rainfall and a heightened risk of Legionnaires’ disease. But she did not address our second question about the relevance of raising the flooding issue. Which underscores a different, and likely more important, point. Former President George W. Bush clearly was powerless to stop Hurricane Katrina from slamming into New Orleans in 2005. The problem for Bush was how slowly his administration reacted to a tragedy with broad and fatal consequences once winds subsided and the devastation became clear. Similarly, not even Rauner’s harshest critics have suggested he could have prevented the initial Legionnaires’ outbreak in 2015. But lawmakers from both parties and political opponents have blasted his administration for delays in responding to the crisis and possibly making it worse. Rauner vehemently disagrees, and it’s not our purpose here to weigh in on who is right or wrong on that score. What is significant, however, is whether the trigger for the outbreak in any way affected the response, and the governor has provided no evidence for that being the case. Our ruling While speaking to state employees and lawmakers about Illinois’ budgetary priorities, Rauner claimed "massive floods" led to a deadly Legionnaires’ disease outbreak that hit the Quincy Veterans’ Home during his first year in office. His administration was unable to cite any analysis specific to Quincy to demonstrate that link, and federal health experts who have investigated the Quincy situation have made no such connection, either. More to the point, criticism of the governor in respect to Quincy centers not on what led to the initial Legionnaires’ outbreak but how slow his administration was to respond while seniors were sickened and many died. The governor’s statement appears to be an effort to deflect blame. Rauner’s Act-of-God claims about the source of Legionnaires’ are unverified and off-point. For that, we rate his statement False.

pomt-08056	The tax-cut deal "adds more than $800 billion to the deficit over two years -- more than the cost of TARP and more than the cost of the Recovery Act" and about the same as health care reform.	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/27/bobby-scott/rep-bobby-scott-says-tax-deal-costs-same-health-ca/	Rep. Robert C. "Bobby" Scott was not among the members of Congress cheering the recent tax-cut deal. Scott, D-3rd, vehemently opposed any extension of the Bush-era tax cuts. Congress passed a two-year extension of all of them. In a statement, Scott said the tax deal will keep deficits high. "However popular these tax cuts may be today, that popularity will pale in comparison to the anger at the deep cuts in popular programs we will need to make in order to pay for this bill," he wrote. Scott added: "This bill adds more than $800 billion to the deficit over two years -- more than the cost of TARP and more than the cost of the Recovery Act. It costs about the same over two years as the 10-year cost of the Health Care Reform bill, which we paid for." That’s a lot to tackle, but we’re up to it. First, is the $800 billion for the tax cuts continuation correct? Yup, the Congressional Budget Office score of the tax compromise for just the next two years -- 2011 and 2012 -- is $797 billion. "The 10-year cost is a bit higher due to some residual effects even though the compromise itself only lasts for two years," notes Nick Kasprak, an analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. Next, let’s check TARP, or the Troubled Asset Relief Program. It passed under President George W. Bush in 2008 to address the subprime mortgage crisis. Scott’s OK there, too. TARP authorized $700 billion in spending, much of which has been paid back. The Treasury now estimatesthat the true cost (minus what’s paid back) will be about $30 billion. Next up, The Recovery Act, also known as The Stimulus. Here’s where Scott runs into a bit of trouble. The most recent Congressional Budget Office estimate of the Stimulus bill’s 10-year cost is $814 billion. That’s $17 billion more than the estimated cost of the tax compromise. Given that the new estimate was just released last month, perhaps Scott’s was relying on an older projection. The original Congressional Budget Office estimate was $787 billion, $10 billion less than the two-year tax cuts estimate. Let’s move to health care reform. Turning back to the CBO, the health care bill is projected to cost $788 billion over 10 years. As Kasprak notes, that is, in theory, to be paid for with $931 billion in increased revenue, for a net deficit reduction of $143 billion. "There are lots of assumptions and simplifications that go into a ten year score, and there is by no means universal agreement that the bill would actually reduce the deficit. But that is the official score," Kasprak said. Regardless, Scott’s more than safe on the cost alone. So, let’s review. Scott’s said the tax compromise will cost more than TARP, more than the Stimulus and about the same as close to the 10-year cost of the Health Care Reform bill. He’s right on TARP, right on health care reform, and off by a tad on the Stimulus -- perhaps because the cost estimate of the act recently changed. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-01361	"Jason Carter’s plan: increase spending by $12.5 billion."	false	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/20/nathan-deal/deal-attack-ad-misfires-claim-carter-will-spend-bi/	Republican Gov. Nathan Deal has a new television ad out that says his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Jason Carter, plans to go on a spending spree if elected. It’s part of the GOP’s strategy to paint Democrats as the tax-and-spend party. "Jason Carter’s plan: increase spending by $12.5 billion," the ad’s narrator says at one point. That’s a head-turning forecast given that the state’s annual budget is about $21 billion. PolitiFact decided to review this one further. Deal spokeswoman Jen Talaber said the governor’s campaign developed the $12.5 billion projection based on Carter’s pledges to restore full funding to k-12 education and expand Medicaid. School systems have not been fully funded by the state since 2003. That’s become a major issue in this year’s governor’s race. Austerity cuts to education this year are about $747 million, and that’s better than the recent past. Talaber said the $12.5 billion forecast assumes that Carter will spend $1 billion a year in each of the next 10 years, $10 billion total, to fully restore education funding. But that also assumes Carter, if elected governor, would serve more than the two-term maximum (eight years) the law allows. Second, it assumes that the Legislature, now in Republican control, would follow his recommendation and approve the money every year. Lastly, at least for next year, the $1 billion is off the mark. Although adjustments have to be made for factors such as enrollment growth, school systems would need about $747 million to be fully funded, based on the extra money put into education this year on Deal’s recommendation. The campaign does the same thing with its math for Georgia’s cost to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It’s $2.5 billion projection is for a decade, not a single year. That makes the figure disingenuous on its face. But the number does exist, in a 2012 Kaiser Family Foundation study that focused on the ACA's Medicaid expansion plan. If states sign up, the federal government pays all the costs for newly eligible enrollees in 2015 and 2016 and no less than 90 percent thereafter. A similar state study projected the cost to be about $2.1 billion – still in the same general range. Missing from the spending claim: the $31 billion to $35 billion in federal money that will come back into Georgia under expansion. In other words, Georgia’s spending would create a 17-fold return on investment in actual dollars. The state study projects the spending also would stimulate $65 billion in economic activity over the decade. "To say that the state is going to have to come up with $2.5 billion on its own is incorrect. There will be extra money coming back from the federal government," said William S. Custer, the author of the state report and director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University. Deal has adamantly opposed expansion and say there’s little reason to believe the debt-ridden federal government will continue to pay 90 percent of the costs far into the future. Further complicating the math, Georgia must spend some of the $2 billion projection, even without expansion, to meet ACA requirements. But without expansion, there is no counterbalance of federal money. And, from a state budget standpoint, there also are areas where expansion could cut spending. The studies don’t count cost reductions in state-funded health care to those who are incarcerated or in some mental health programs, who could be transferred to an expanded Medicaid program. The state has not done the calculations to determine the potential savings, which would likely need to be done on a case-by-case basis to determine Medicaid eligibility, said Timothy Sweeney, director of health policy at the left-leaning Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. Still, Sweeney said "substantial savings" could be achieved. "We are serving these people already, with state funding," Sweeney said. "It’s clear that transferring that service to federal funding would cut state costs." Those figures help prompt many health care leaders in Georgia to push for expansion. State lawmakers, though, backed Deal’s stance that expansion would be a fiscal trap by passing House Bill 990 last spring. The measure requires the GOP-controlled General Assembly to approve any expansion of Medicaid "through an increase in the income threshold." That leaves a loophole for Georgia to expand the program only via a loophole such as Arkansas did, by using the federal subsidy to buy private health care insurance, not Medicaid. That more or less leaves the fate of Medicaid expansion – and the potential costs – in the hands of the Legislature, not the governor. The ad says Carter’s plans will result in taxes on small businesses and the middle class, something Carter flatly denies. It calls Carter "silver tongued" and "untrustworthy." Carter says additional funding for education will come from cuts in government waste, recovery of delinquent taxes and economic growth. That’s typical campaign banter. (We’ve ruled Half True a claim by Carter that education funding can be increased significantly if the state goes after $2.5 billion in delinquent taxes. But what about the ad claim that Carter’s plan will cost $12.5 billion? Those cost projections cannot be taken seriously. They are for a period of 10 years -- longer than Carter could legally be in office. They leave out other critical facts -- like lawmakers would have to sign off on any major spending. We rate the ad claim as False.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2014-10-20T00:00:00	2014-10-13	['None']

pomt-01717	"The music industry is the biggest export from Africa after oil and gas."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/07/dbanj/nigerias-bono-claims-music-one-africas-biggest-exp/	All eyes are on Africa this week, as the Ebola crisis persists and dozens of its leaders converge in Washington for the first-ever U.S.-Africa business summit. And a recording artist nicknamed "Africa’s Bono" is chiming in. Nigerian popstar D’Banj, an ambassador for the ONE Campaign, discussed the summit on ABC’s This Week on Aug. 3. He promoted investing in African agriculture, through the power of music. According to D’Banj, Africa puts out more beats than anything else, except barrels. "The theme of the summit is … investing in the next generation," he said. "Ten years ago, we did not have any (music) industry, we did not have any support. We did not even have any record label. And because we believed in ourselves and we believed in what we had, we continued. And now the music industry is the biggest export from Africa after oil and gas." A spokesperson for the ONE campaign told us that D’Banj was not referring to music as an economic export, but rather making the point that beyond its oil reserves, Nigeria is best known for its entertainment industry. Nonetheless, we were curious about how the recording industry stacked up economically. Second fiddle? Neither the World Bank nor the International Federation for the Phonographic Industry had data on the African music recording industry. So we had World Bank economist Cesar Calderon walk us through how to estimate Africa’s export revenue in 2012. Using the World Trade Organization data, we calculated that Africa’s total export revenue -- combining merchandise exports and commercial services exports -- is around $720 billion. Fuel exports account for 49 percent of that total, or about $355 billion in 2012. Though the WTO has data from some African countries on exports generated by "audiovisual services," the list is far from comprehensive. The best we can do is look at the "personal, cultural, and recreational services" category, which includes revenue from music, film, TV, museums, libraries, etc. This is a subcategory of commercial services, and brought in $480 million in exports. Altogether, the entire entertainment sector makes up less than 0.1 percent of the total export revenue, a crumb of the export pie. So what are the biggest exports out of Africa? In terms of earnings, after oil, it’s minerals and agricultural products, according to Jennifer Cooke, the Africa director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Specifically, Economy Watch lists palm oil, gold and diamonds, cocoa, timber, and precious metals. Using WTO data, we found the share of total exports generated by agriculture (7.9 percent), mining products (6.9 percent), and manufactures (14.2 percent). These export sectors are at least 100 times larger than the entertainment industry. Can’t Afrobeat that Though the recording industry doesn’t bring as much cash, the books may not reflect the reality of sales. Industry experts and academics alike said it’s hard to gauge just how much the music industry is worth in Africa. For one, there’s no formalized reporting to keep track of content, and the distribution system is a network of street vendors who may reprint content after paying a one-time fee, said Aidbee Adiboye, a spokesperson for Chocolate City Group, one of Africa’s largest entertainment companies. And secondly, piracy is a problem. "The protection of intellectual property throughout the region remains a concerning issue," said Jenny Mbaye, who studies African cultural production at the University of Cape Town. "In this sense, the piracy challenge calls for actively confronting and redressing the persisting lack of information and poor documentation of the processes that animate the chain of production and labour dynamics in these economies." Looking at homespun statistics from Nigerian entertainment executives, album sales clocked $30 million in 2008 (triple that of 2005’s), global live performances brought in an additional $105 million, and ringtones sold $150 million in 2011. Nollywood -- that’s Nigeria’s film industry, the second largest in the world after Bollywood, according to the UN -- cashes in $250 million in annual revenue, according to the Financial Times. Now, these numbers represent total revenue, not export revenue. Nonetheless, they provide a general sense of how the industry is faring. And it’s worth noting that the African music industry is burgeoning, especially in D’Banj’s home Nigeria and especially as it moves to digital platforms. Though the African diaspora is the primary consumer of African entertainment, Africans living abroad can act as "introducers," according Michael Ugwu, the former CEO of iROKING, the largest digital distributor of Nigerian media. Ugwu, who is in the process of setting up Sony Music West Africa, said that as digital distribution becomes more popular, international platforms are increasingly looking at Africa as an untapped market and as a pool for local talent. "Although very little data can assist in providing a systematic knowledge of the music economy on the continent, African music and cultural products in general, certainly present a comparative advantage on the globally competitive market of creativity," said Mbaye. Of course, the continent is home to global popstars Akon and K'naan, as well as the famous choral group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Just a few years ago, the world was afflicted with Ghanian dance fever with Azonto, in which moves are taken from humdrum activities like driving or washing clothes. And D’Banj himself has international appeal. His 2012 hit, "Oliver Twist," inspired a West End musical and featured a cameo role by Kanye West, who then signed D’Banj to his label G.O.O.D. Music as its first international artist. Our ruling D’Banj said, "The music industry is the biggest export from Africa after oil and gas." Africa has a good story to tell about its music, but that doesn't mean it's a major export. In fact, the entire entertainment sector comprised less than 0.1 percent of Africa’s export revenue, far behind other sectors like agriculture and mineral products. Experts said the reported revenue may be less than the actual numbers though, due to the lack of a reporting and distribution infrastructure in Africa. But it wouldn't be enough to make a significant different. We rate D’Banj's claim False.	None	D’Banj	None	None	None	2014-08-07T14:44:13	2014-08-03	['Africa']
pomt-04132	"Our pension system is the only one in the country that’s 100 percent funded."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/06/scott-walker/walker-says-wisconsins-pension-system-only-one-cou/	Gov. Scott Walker is used to hearing cheers from conservative audiences when highlighting fiscal constraints he put on Wisconsin’s budget in 2011. He seemed a bit surprised, though, during his November 2012 address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library when scattered applause broke out after he mentioned the state’s pension fund. Walker was comparing Wisconsin’s fiscal condition to that of California and of his standard punching bag, Illinois, which raised taxes to close a budget gap. "They have a pension system that’s not even halfway funded," Walker said of the Land of Lincoln. "Now, in contrast, in our state, our pension system is the only one in the country (that’s) 100 percent funded." Hearing some applause, Walker added: "You can clap for that, sure." In 2011, much attention centered on the mandate by Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature that most public employees pay a larger share of their pension costs. It was part of Walker’s controversial drive to sharply curtail collective bargaining by public-sector unions. The health of the state-run Wisconsin Retirement System -- which serves some 166,000 retirees and 260,000 active workers, including teachers, state and municipal employees -- has received less attention. And though Walker made the statement awhile back, it’s worth a look as we enter into the new budget season. Is Wisconsin’s pension system the only one in the nation that’s fully funded? To evaluate the claim, we’ll examine the two most recent years with complete data, 2010 and 2011. The number we’re looking at is the "funded ratio" -- the ratio of a pension plan’s assets to its liabilities. It’s one key measure of whether a fund can meet all its future obligations. It varies with investment gains and losses, changes in benefits and other factors. A ratio of 100 percent means the fund -- at least as of that moment -- is in position to pay future retirees all their expected benefits. At the end of fiscal year 2010, which began before Walker took office, only Wisconsin had a fully funded pension plan (100 percent), the Pew Center on the States concluded in a widely cited June 2012 report. Walker spoke of the report at that time, and while it’s a bit dated, the report is of recent vintage. The Pew study noted that 34 state-run plans were below the 80 percent threshold that experts say is the minimum for a healthy system. There was a tiny bit of rounding in the determination that Wisconsin was 100 percent funded. The actual percentage at the end of 2010, Pew found, was 99.84 percent. The Pew Center considers that so close to 100 percent that it constitutes full funding, said Pew senior researcher David Draine. All told, the Pew report cited a $757 billion pension funding gap among the states on liabilities of $3 trillion, noting "serious concerns" about funding levels in 32 states. Illinois was lowest among the states at 45 percent in 2010. We found other evidence that backed up the ranking of Wisconsin as best-funded among state plans. That included a 2012 report by Morningstar, and a survey by the National Association of State Retirement Administrators using 2011 data that had Wisconsin as the highest-ranking state-run plan for general employees. (Some municipal plans, or state plans for just teachers or law enforcement, were healthier than Wisconsin). For the official 2010 and 2011 Wisconsin figures, we turned to a report by the Wisconsin Retirement System’s actuarial consultant, which annually calculates the funded ratio. The firm, Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company, reported 99.8 percent funding for year-end 2010. And for year-end 2011, the firm put the Wisconsin fund’s funded ratio at 99.9 percent, according to its latest report. The report showed the Wisconsin system at 99 percent or greater since 2003. Rob Marchant, deputy secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Employee Trust Funds, said the Pew report that put Wisconsin at 100 percent is probably the best source for comparing the states. Marchant added that "100 percent funded" is a loaded phrase that pension officials tend to avoid because various assumptions go into the calculation of a funded ratio. So it’s not an exact science. But the governor is on solid ground in saying the Wisconsin system is fully funded -- and the only one in the nation, to boot. One last note: One way the fund stays healthy is adjusting the annual pension payments to retirees. They go up or down depending on the investment performance of the fund. Because of the recession, payments for many state retirees decreased annually from 2009 to 2012 and will drop again in 2013, bringing the five-year total of cuts to $4 billion. Payments are projected to begin rising again in 2014. For a majority of retirees, payments cannot fall below what employees received upon retirement. Our rating Gov. Scott Walker told an audience of California conservatives that "Our pension system is the only one in the country that’s 100% funded." It’s slightly below 100%, but so close that a respected research organization rounds it up. And no other plan covering general state employees can make that claim. We rate Walker’s statement True.

pomt-06187	Newt Gingrich "has suggested" building "a mirror system in space" could improve the Earth’s habitability.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/12/david-brooks/david-brooks-says-newt-gingrich-once-proposed-putt/	In a Dec. 9, 2011, column titled, "The Gingrich Tragedy," New York Times columnist David Brooks expressed ambivalence about the new front-runner in the Republican presidential race, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. Brooks said that ideologically, Gingrich "comes closest to my worldview." But Brooks added that he was repelled by Gingrich’s "bombastic" style and "revolutionary temperament — intensity, energy, disorganization and a tendency to see everything as a cataclysmic clash requiring a radical response." In the column, Brooks cites negatively what he considered half-baked ideas by Gingrich. "For example, he has called for ‘a massive new program to build a permanent lunar colony to exploit the moon’s resources.’ He has suggested that ‘a mirror system in space could provide the light equivalent of many full moons so that there would be no need for nighttime lighting of the highways.’" The space-mirror system seemed so outlandish that we felt compelled to check whether Gingrich really suggested it. We e-mailed Brooks to ask where he found this quote, but we didn’t hear back. We did, however, locate a similar quote in an article by Andrew Ferguson published in the New York Times magazine on June 29, 2011. Ferguson read 21 books by Gingrich -- a famously prolific author -- in an attempt to answer his article’s titular question: "What Does Newt Gingrich Know?" Here’s a portion of what Ferguson wrote: "Gingrich’s first book, Window of Opportunity: A Blueprint for the Future, came out in 1984 and contained the seeds of much of what was to follow. Beneath its cover image — a flag-draped eagle inexplicably threatening the space shuttle— the backbencher Gingrich was identified as chairman of the congressional Space Caucus, a position that inspired a series of ‘space cadet’ jokes that took years to die. Window of Opportunity was co-written by Gingrich’s second wife, Marianne, and a science-fiction writer called David Drake. ... "In Window of Opportunity, Gingrich introduced himself as a futurist, a role he has played off and on throughout his career. There are problems inherent in futurism, most of them involving the future, which the futurist is obliged to predict (it’s his job) and which seldom cooperates as he would hope. Gingrich has called some and missed some. In 1984, he saw more clearly than most that computers would touch every aspect of commercial and private life, but nobody any longer wants to build ‘a large array of mirrors [that] could affect the earth’s climate,’ warming it up so farmers could extend the growing season." Because the quotes from Brooks and Ferguson are slightly different, we wanted to look directly at the book ourselves before making our judgment. In the book, Gingrich proposes (among many other ideas) "five simple steps to a bold future" in space, most unusually a lottery in which randomly selected taxpayers would win a spot on a space shuttle flight. But the floating mirror idea isn’t on this list. Instead, it’s included in Gingrich's recap of a June 1979, NASA-sponsored new concepts symposium in Woods Hole, Mass., "where 30 experts brainstormed a range of pioneering options for NASA worthy of Lewis and Clark." Here’s how Gingrich summarized the idea: "The climate group at the Woods Hole conference suggested that a large array of mirrors could affect the earth’s climate by increasing the amount of sunlight received by particular areas, citing recent feasibility studies exploring the possibilities of preventing frosts in Florida or enabling farmers in high altitudes to plant their wheat earlier. "A mirror system in space could provide the light equivalent of many full moons so that there would be no need for nighttime lighting of the highways. Ambient light covering entire areas could reduce the current danger of criminals lurking in the darkness. Mirrors could be arranged to light given metropolitan areas only during particular periods, so there would be darkness late at night for sleeping." Brooks’ portrayal glosses over the fact that Gingrich was primarily reciting proposals made by participants at a NASA-sponsored forum. Still, Gingrich cited them approvingly. Still, we didn’t want to stop with a look at whether Brooks framed the issue fairly. We also wanted to know whether this was ever a mainstream idea -- and whether it’s technologically feasible. One thing that’s clear is that it was not a new idea by the time it was raised at Woods Hole. At least two space pioneers promoted the concept in the 1920s, a full four decades before man landed on the moon. Hermann Oberth (1894-1989), a scientific author based in Germany, published several books in the 1920s that anticipated the "first rockets and satellites, … the landing on the moon, interplanetary probes, international manned space stations, and reusable space ferries," according to the museum that celebrates his life near Nuremberg, Germany. Among the ideas discussed in his books was "extraterrestrial utilization of the sun's energy with huge space mirrors that beam the collected sun energy down to earth." These ideas were popularized in a book by another space pioneer, an Austro-Hungarian named Hermann Noordung (1892-1929) in a 1928 book, The Problem of Space Travel: The Rocket Motor. So the idea is an old one. But despite several decades’ worth of advances in space technology by the time Gingrich published his book, space experts and scientists told us that the idea never got much beyond the science fiction stage. Yuri Pavlovich Semenov -- until 2005 the chief designer for Energia, the developer of Russian manned spacecraft -- "was quite a proponent" of the idea, said Marcia Smith of spacepolicyonline.com. During the Soviet era, Semenov and his allies thought such a technology could light up the northern latitudes of the USSR. However, "it was considered impractical by the mainstream space crowd, not just technically but in terms of the potential environmental effects," Smith said. John Logsdon, the founder and retired director of the Space Policy Institute at the George Washington University Elliott School of International Affairs, said that similar ideas "have been suggested over the years by ‘out of the box’ thinkers, but they never entered the mainstream." Others have suggested using mirrors to reflect the sun’s rays away from the earth, as a way to attack global warming, said Edward Ellegood, a space policy analyst at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. But where Gingrich’s idea is concerned, Ellegood said, "It’s probably not even remotely cost-effective." Here’s another problem: "Micro-meteorite bombardment would destroy these mirrors over a few-year time period," said Gregory Bothun, a University of Oregon physicist. The experts we spoke to for this story agreed that even if the idea proposed by Gingrich in 1984 was economically and technically feasible, it would entail too many downsides to be desirable. "Imagine a world where it never got dark! What would this do to plants, animals, my sleep, and the souls of poets and lovers everywhere?" said Scott Denning, an atmospheric science professor at Colorado State University, in an e-mail. "Imagine having a really annoying neighbor who beams sodium vapor lamps into your bedroom windows. Now imagine everyone in the world having such a neighbor." Raymond S. Bradley, a geoscientist at the University of Massachusetts, put it simply: "This is not a mainstream idea. It is one of the dumbest ideas I have heard of." Our ruling Gingrich co-wrote his book more than a quarter century ago, and since he doesn’t appear to have reiterated the call for floating mirrors in recent years, we can safely assume the idea is no longer at the top of his policy agenda. But did cite the idea approvingly in his book, so we rate Brooks’ statement True.	None	David Brooks	None	None	None	2011-12-12T11:40:26	2011-12-09	['None']

pomt-02999	When SACS came back to the DeKalb County School District to give a midterm review, we got straight A’s.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/oct/17/michael-thurmond/dekalb-superintendent-guilty-grade-inflation-descr/	Things have been tough for the DeKalb County School District. The state’s third-largest school system was in danger of losing its accreditation. It has struggled financially, leaving reserves almost depleted and requiring deep budget cuts, teacher furloughs and larger class sizes. A former superintendent is currently in court on racketeering charges. Gov. Nathan Deal removed two-thirds of the school board for financial mismanagement and micromanaging that put the district at risk. And an interim chief, former state Labor Commissioner Michael Thurmond, was brought in earlier this year to try to right the ship. Thurmond has been optimistic, repeatedly reminding parents and staff that the district will improve, but that it will take work to turn things around. He has continued to spread his message of hope in district updates, particularly about the school system’s accreditation. "When SACS came back at midterm for review we got straight A’s," Thurmond said during a meeting with parents earlier this month. We were intrigued by the superintendent’s statement. Had DeKalb, with its ongoing legal, financial and personnel issues, secured a perfect score with an accrediting agency? We decided to do our homework and find out. Thurmond made his statement at Towers High School in south DeKalb during a parent council meeting. The then-interim superintendent had been traveling across the county, speaking to various parent and school groups. (Just last week the DeKalb school board voted to extend Thurmond’s superintendent contract two more years, through summer 2015.) To check Thurmond’s claim, PolitiFact Georgia had to research DeKalb’s accreditation history. Last year, a team from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools -- a private agency that accredits public schools in Georgia and elsewhere -- visited DeKalb to investigate numerous allegations of school board mismanagement. Representatives for SACS’ parent company, AdvancED, said the board was accused of undue interference in administrative matters, as well as wasting money. At the time, DeKalb’s accreditation -- which greatly affects students’ college acceptance chances -- was already in a precarious position, at a less than stellar "on advisement" status. Ultimately, the district’s accreditation was placed on probation, with SACS officials warning that a full accreditation loss was imminent without immediate changes. Earlier this year, after the system was placed on probation, the governor removed and replaced six board members. The Georgia Supreme Court is expected to rule by November on a challenge to the law that allows governors to remove school boards in districts on probation. In May, a SACS team returned to DeKalb for a three-day review, as Thurmond noted during the parent meeting. The agency issued a report of its findings in July. The report indicated that all 11 required actions from the agency’s October 2012 visit were "in progress." The monitoring team concluded that the district had made "recognizable progress." The report also noted: "The overall progress of the district in addressing the required actions is still evolving and significant work remains to be accomplished." Another SACS monitoring team is scheduled to return to DeKalb for a two-day visit in December. In the meantime, the district remains on probation. We asked Thurmond’s office about the superintendent’s claim and reading of the SACS report. "In the educational arena, an ‘A’ grade is generally awarded when a student receives a score of 90-100. It is important to note that an ‘A’ does not require perfection, but an ‘A’ does represent significant and noteworthy achievement," a district spokesman said in an email. The spokesman said Thurmond was speaking metaphorically about the importance of the interim report, which noted significant improvements during the past two months and recognizable progress on addressing the 11 required actions. PolitiFact Georgia also questioned SACS about Thurmond’s claim. Agency representatives noted that AdvancED and SACS do not give letter grades to school systems. "(Thurmond) was clearly using an analogy that the monitoring visit was positive," said an email from the company spokeswoman and CEO. "The report clearly indicates that the district is moving in the right direction but that the required actions remain In Progress as there is much work to be done in ensuing months and years." We also checked with the Georgia School Boards Association, which helps boards prepare for SACS visits, for thoughts on Thurmond’s statement. A board development specialist with that agency deferred to SACS for an explanation. So, was DeKalb Schools Superintendent Michael Thurmond correct that the district’s midterm review from an accrediting agency back in May resulted in a straight-A report card? It’s subjective. Thurmond used the letter grade as an interpretation of the positive SACS report. The report does note the district’s improvements on 11 requirements over the past few months. But it also notes the significant work that is left to do, and it questions whether the school board and district leadership can successfully complete it. And most important, the district remains on probation until another monitoring visit at the end of the year. An A means exceeding standards – that’s not what the district is doing. It’s making progress, which isn’t an A in anyone’s book. We rate Thurmond’s claim Mostly False.	None	Michael Thurmond	None	None	None	2013-10-17T16:25:28	2013-10-03	['None']

pomt-15242	"Since I took office, Wisconsin now has the 2nd highest health care quality ranking in the country."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/05/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-he-took-office-wisconsin-has-ran/	Amid the field of GOP presidential contenders, Gov. Scott Walker is projecting himself as the candidate who has gotten things done. On July 26, 2015, he took to Twitter with a series of claims all beginning with "Since I took office." Several were ones we have already put to the Truth-O-Meter. "We made it easier to vote but hard to cheat." We rated a similar claim Mostly True. "Property taxes are lower today than 4 years ago." That also clocked in at Mostly True. Walker tweeted one claim we hadn't checked: "Since I took office, Wisconsin now has the 2nd highest health care quality ranking in the country. - SW #Walker16" Wisconsin is often regarded as having some of the best health care in the nation. But Walker has come under fire for his actions, especially when he did not accept federal dollars available through Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. But he also signed the Quality Improvement Act and a hospital regulatory bill. He established a grant program to encourage primary care physicians and psychiatrists to practice in underserved areas. And Walker also put more money toward mental health care. We wondered if the rating on the state’s health care quality care had changed much under Walker. Report looks at quality When asked for backup, Walker's team pointed us to a ranking released each year by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The federal agency ranked the state second only to New Hampshire in its 2015 report. Wisconsin had been ranked third in 2014, so it moved up one spot. The ranking draws data from three dozen sources and gives each state a score based on some 200 measures of health care access, quality and elements related to a set of national health care priorities. The assessment is considered the most thorough measure of health care quality. The agency, part of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, started releasing overall scores on health care quality for each state in 2007. That year Wisconsin was ranked number one in health care quality. For the next few years, Wisconsin held the first or second spot in the nationwide ranking. In 2011, the year after Walker took office, the state fell to seventh, based on 2010 data. Even then, Wisconsin's health care quality score was not far behind the states in the top five. Since then, the state climbed back up in the rankings until it reached number two again in 2015. Ernest Moy, who works on the team that writes the report, said most states go up and down a few spots each year. One drawback to the ranking is that it can accentuate small differences that may not be meaningful. "States that are stable in rank are not static but rather improving at the same rate as most other states," Moy said. "For a state to improve its rank, it needs to improve at a faster rate than most other states." This isn't the only health care quality ranking. The Commonwealth Fund, a think tank that supports better quality in health care, especially for society's most vulnerable, also ranks all 50 states on health care quality. On its 2014 scorecard, the Commonwealth Fund ranked Wisconsin seventh. That is up from ninth in 2009. The latest scorecard evaluated state health care performance between 2007 and 2012 based on 42 measures of access, quality, costs and outcomes using publically available data, such as government surveys. Wisconsin performed the best in the prevention and treatment category and the worst in avoidable hospital use and cost. Our rating Walker tweeted, "Since I took office, Wisconsin now has the 2nd highest health care quality ranking in the country." He backed this up with a reputable ranking from a federal agency. But the state had always been ranked highly and, aside from a downward blip the year after he took office, had long been No. 1 or No. 2. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-11412	"Biden preparing 2020 presidential bid -- with Obama as vice president."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/21/yournewswirecom/no-joe-biden-not-running-president-barack-obama-hi/	Rumors have spread suggesting that Joe Biden is not only running for a 2020 presidential bid, but he is planning to do so alongside former president Barack Obama as vice president. "Biden preparing 2020 presidential bid - with Obama as vice president," read the headline on March 15, 2018, on Your News Wire, a hoax website claiming to "cover the headlines the mainstream outlets shy away from" on its Facebook page. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Earlier this month, PolitiFact debunked that Biden has confirmed that he is running for president in 2020. The latest story begins by citing a real Politico story regarding Biden’s proposals on how to defeat President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Despite the fact that the Politico article stated, "Biden hasn’t been actively exploring the presidential options himself, and is far from making any decision about whether he’ll run," the Your News Wire article writes that it says that Biden is preparing for his campaign announcement. There is no evidence that is happening. The hoax goes on to say that Biden has chosen Obama -- whom he used to serve under as vice president -- to be his running mate. The story claims that it would be legal under constitutional law for the two to run together, but two-term presidents have traditionally taken an unspoken vow to retire from public life. The 22nd Amendment prohibits a president from being elected for more than two terms, but it does not explicitly mention a former president being elected as vice president. However, the 12th Amendment states that "no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States." The unspoken vow two-term presidents take is also exaggerated. There is no obligation for a two-term president to stay out of public life. Since he left office, Obama has given public speeches at universities and is working on new books. The article goes on to quote two different real stories from the Hill newspaper, but it only provides a link to one changing the context of the quotes given in different stories regarding speculation of Biden’s bid. Quotes from Biden’s aides about Biden and Obama reclaiming the White House were also made up. When searching for these quotes, the only results we found came from the Your News Wire story.

pomt-14215	"90 percent of fires in Arizona are human-caused."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2016/apr/19/doug-ducey/are-90-percent-fires-arizona-caused-humans/	As officials gear up for wildfire season in Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey talked fire safety at a press conference April 13. "I think it’s important to note that 90 percent of fires in Arizona are human-caused," Ducey said. "Unattended campfires, discarded cigarettes, hot exhaust pipes, any source of extreme heat or spark can result in a Wallow or Rodeo-Chediski fire." Given Arizona’s vast land area, 113,594.08 square miles to be exact, we were curious as to whether nine out of every 10 fires in the state really are caused by humans and how that could be documented. Sort of Ducey’s spokesman, Daniel Scarpinato, provided us with Arizona State Forestry data that backs up the governor’s claim on the surface. In 2015, 352 out of 404 fires, more than 87 percent, were human-caused. Of the 304 fires reported this year, 296, more than 97 percent, were human-caused. The State Forestry maintains a database of all fires, even if they don’t respond to a blaze at first. State Forestry spokesman Bill Boyd said most fires historically are human-caused, even something as simple as parking a hot car over grass. "If you look at it over the years, there is a large human component in there," Boyd said. But there’s a caveat here -- the data only includes fires on state and private land, not federal land. Ducey said "in Arizona," which also includes federally-managed land. Almost 40 percent of the Grand Canyon State is federal land. Multiple agencies, including the U.S. Agriculture Department, U.S. Defense Department and U.S. Interior Department, have fire jurisdiction over certain areas of land. For example, the U.S. Forest Service has fire jurisdiction over national forests and the Bureau of Indian Affairs does the same for tribal land. "It is complex and coordinated at all levels, from local to national," said Mary Zabinski, spokeswoman for the Southwest Coordination Center, an interagency group of state and federal agencies. All that coordination means we do have a total for the entire state for human-caused fires. According to the Southwest Coordination Center, for the entire state of Arizona -- state, private and federal land -- 61 percent of fires in 2015 were caused by humans, and 39 percent of fires were caused by lightning. However, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Jennifer Jones notes that 90 percent of wildfires on all land nationwide are caused by humans. "Typically, the majority of fires on land under the jurisdiction of state and local government agencies are human caused as those lands are closer to homes and roads," Jones said. Our ruling Ducey said that "90 percent of fires in Arizona are human-caused." Ducey’s claim is correct when referencing only state and private land. But he wasn’t that specific. Fires "in Arizona" includes federally-managed land, in addition to state and private land. And the percentage of human-caused fires on all those lands combined isn’t 90 percent, it’s 61 percent. So Ducey has a point that human activity is contributing to wildfires, but the number he cites is a good bit off. On balance, we rate Ducey’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/525a6335-26e4-476f-8213-ceac74e77b7c	None	Doug Ducey	None	None	None	2016-04-19T12:00:00	2016-04-13	['Arizona']
pomt-15026	"It's estimated we leave somewhere north of $350 billion a year - that's billion - a year on the table uncollected because IRS doesn't have the resources."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2015/oct/05/gerry-connolly/connolly-says-irs-lacks-resources-collet-350-billi/	U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly, who represents legions on federal workers living in Northern Virginia, scoffs at conservative efforts to pare the Internal Revenue Service. Congress has cut about $1.2 billion from the IRS budget during the past five years. The actions impair the nation’s ability to collect revenue needed to reduce deficits, Connolly, D-11th, said during a Sept. 9 interview on Federal News Radio. "It’s estimated we leave somewhere north of $350 billion a year - that’s billion - a year on the table uncollected, because IRS doesn’t have the resources," he said. Connolly added that if the IRS had more resources, it could collect so much in unpaid taxes that the government could get rid of the so-called sequestration budget cuts - projected to slice about $1 trillion during the next decade - and have enough left over to make a sizable down payment on the national debt. We examined Connolly’s claim that the U.S. loses about $350 billion in tax revenue each year because the IRS lacks the means to collect it. George Burke, the congressman’s spokesman, said Connolly’s statement was based on IRS reports on the country’s "tax gap" - the amount of underreported income, unpaid tax bills and taxes that never were collected because returns weren’t filed. "On several occasions, IRS officials have testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the amount of uncollected taxes and the agency's lack of resources," Burke wrote in an email. "The potential return on investment is mind-boggling." The $350 billion The IRS periodically provides an estimate of how much revenue Uncle Sam is owed but doesn’t collect because of tax evasion. Mark Hanson, an IRS spokesman, told us in an email that it takes years for the agency to compile its tax-gap estimate, because it requires complicated research. The latest figures available are for 2006. The IRS says there were nearly $2.7 trillion in total tax liabilities in 2006. Of that amount, about $450 billion wasn’t paid on time. The main cause of missed payments was taxpayers underreporting their income, the IRS said. Some late payments eventually trickled in, and the IRS took enforcement actions against some tax scofflaws. Those actions recovered about $65 billion, according to the agency’s tallies, leaving about $385 billion in liabilities the IRS says it was owed but didn’t collect. So Connolly’s claim that there’s "somewhere north" of $350 billion in taxes left on the table has validity. Is all that tax collectible? To complete our fact check, we also need to look at the second part of Connolly’s statement - that the IRS doesn’t collect the $350 billion-plus each year because it lacks "resources." Two analysts told us that extra resources could help the IRS narrow the gap, but it wouldn’t completely erase tax evasion. "Some of it is uncollectible, people don’t have the money," said Eric Toder, co-director of the non-partisan Tax Policy Center who has written about the tax gap. Moreover, Toder said that certain unpaid tax liabilities are just inherently difficult to discover, such as cash transactions by small businesses that can occur without any record. More auditors would capture some unpaid taxes, Toder said, but they would provide only a few stitches in mending the tax gap. In 2007, Toder authored a paper that said Congress and President George W. Bush’s administration could take added steps to patch the tax gap, such as providing the IRS more resources for enforcement and requiring taxpayers to report more income information. But he said policymakers had to be realistic about the return they would see on such initiatives. "Although estimates of how much additional resources and better enforcement tools would raise are incomplete and highly uncertain, it is extremely unlikely that they could raise more than $20-30 billion per year," Toder wrote. In an interview, Toder told us there is a danger the tax gap could grow if the IRS is cut back too much and there becomes a sense that enforcement is lax due to strained resources. We also spoke to Robert Goulder, tax policy counsel at Tax Analysts, a Falls Church-based non-profit that examines tax regulations. He told us filling the gap would require unrealistic scenarios, such as an IRS agent being assigned to watch the cash register at every "mom and pop" small business. Added enforcement also would run counter to an American culture that chafes at inquiries from the IRS, Goulder said. Even with an unlimited budget, Goulder said, "they still couldn’t get the tax gap down to zero." A 2012 Government Accountability Office report, which looked at various strategies to cut down the tax gap, said "closing the entire gap may not be feasible, since it could entail more intrusive recordkeeping or reporting than the public is willing to accept or more resources than the IRS is able to commit." It cited a 1997 GAO report which said "it would be unrealistic to assume that our tax system, or any tax system, can achieve 100-percent compliance and thus eliminate the tax gap." Our ruling Connolly said Uncle Sam forgoes $350 billion a year because the Internal Revenue Service lacks the resources to find and collect that amount. His figure is solid, based on the latest data available from the IRS -- from 2006. But his contention that the gap is caused by lack of IRS resources is an overstatement. Although analysts say more manpower could help the agency narrow the gap, it wouldn’t come close to filling it. Some unpaid taxes are extremely difficult to sniff out, and some people simply can’t pay, they said. So on the whole, we rate Connolly’s statement Half True.

pomt-12604	California’s Central Valley and Inland Empire "are experiencing tremendous job growth."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/apr/04/jerry-brown/jerry-browns-mostly-true-claim-about-tremendous-jo/	Gov. Jerry Brown frequently touts California’s overall job growth when telling what he’s called the state’s ‘comeback’ story. He claimed recently on NBC’s Meet the Press that California has added "2.1 million jobs in the last six or seven years." We checked the numbers and rated that claim True. Later in the same interview, the show’s host Chuck Todd asked Brown about inland California’s struggles, leading to another claim that caught our attention: Chuck Todd: "But there are parts of your state that are struggling. You have rural counties, ones that don’t touch the ocean, struggling. Housing prices are up there, while jobs don’t go there." Gov. Brown: "The Inland Empire, the Central Valley, they have a harder time. But they, too, are experiencing tremendous job growth." Brown makes his jobs claim at about the 2:05 minute mark in the video above. California’s job growth is normally associated with coastal hubs like Silicon Valley and San Francisco. So, we wondered whether Brown had his facts right when he said these inland regions had really experienced "tremendous job growth," too. We set out on a fact-check. Inland Empire Home to about 4.5 million people, Riverside and San Bernardino counties make up what’s known as the Inland Empire, a sprawling set of communities east of Los Angeles. The economists we spoke with say Brown’s case for "tremendous job growth" here is a strong one. The region’s 3.2 percent job growth rate was the fastest among the state’s large metro areas from February 2016 through February 2017, said John Husing, chief economist for the Inland Empire Economic Partnership. During that year, it added 47,500 jobs, which was more than the 35,700 created in the Santa Clara metro area, considered the heart of Silicon Valley, Husing said. "This area is a real growth engine," he added, listing construction, logistics and transportation among the growing sectors. Over the past five years, as the region has recovered from the Great Recession, it added jobs at a rate of 22.3 percent. That trailed only the San Francisco-Redwood City-South San Francisco metro area’s 22.7 percent rate among large metros. A spokesman for the Brown Administration cited the same statistics backing up the governor’s claim. Colin Strange of the San Bernardino Area Chamber of Commerce said San Bernardino is seeing job growth, but mainly in "blue-collar jobs" that pay about $15 per hour including fork-lift operators and truck drivers. Husing, who has studied the region’s wages, said the Inland Empire has a lower share of high-paying administrative jobs compared with the state as a whole. He said, however, that the region is outperforming the state in its share of middle-class jobs that pay between $45,000 and $60,000. Central Valley The Central Valley stretches about 450 miles from Bakersfield north to Redding. It includes urban cities like Sacramento, Stockton, Modesto and Fresno, vast farmland and a diverse economy, making job growth trends for the overall region more complex. A report by Stanislaus State University in the Central Valley city of Turlock offers some help. That report shows the 8-county San Joaquin Valley, which makes up the central and southern portions of the Central Valley, experienced a 1.56 percent job growth rate in 2016; a 1.86 percent rate in 2015 and 1.80 percent in 2014. Those averages trailed the state’s overall job growth average, which measured 3 percent in 2015 and about 2 percent last year. But it beat the 8-county region’s 1.23 percent historical average job growth rate. SOURCE: Stanislaus State University, College of Business Administration, 2016 Business Forecast Report, Volume VI, Issue 1 "Within its own limits, the Valley has consistently grown. But it hasn’t been a home run," Gokce Soydemir, an economics professor at Stanislaus State, said of job growth in that portion of the Central Valley. Jeffrey Michael, director of the University of Pacific’s Center for Business and Policy Research in Stockton, added by email: "Central Valley areas have also done very well in recent years with the exception of Bakersfield, where recent economic fluctuations are tightly connected to the oil industry." Bakersfield’s job growth rate was flat, at 0.1 percent, over the past year. Meanwhile, Sacramento, the biggest metro area in northern portion of the Central Valley, saw 1.8 percent growth over the past year, close to the statewide average. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed California’s Central Valley and Inland Empire "are experiencing tremendous job growth." Economists say Brown is right about the Inland Empire. That region experienced the fastest job growth rate among the state’s large metro areas over the past year, and added more jobs than the Santa Clara metro area, the heart of Silicon Valley, during that period. Job growth in the Central Valley, while it’s outperformed its historical benchmark in much of the diverse region, hasn’t kept up with the overall state average. The governor’s argument here needs this key clarification. In the end, we rate his overall claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-10065	Says a Congressional Budget Office report on spending by House Democrats in the economic stimulus concluded it "is just not stimulus. It won't help the economy grow."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/22/eric-cantor/Cantor-distorts-CBO-data/	In the debate over how best to provide economic stimulus, put U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor, the Republican whip, in the camp that thinks more tax cuts and less government spending is the way to go. Fair enough. But in a Jan. 21, 2009, interview on Fox News, Cantor cited a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office to back up his argument. "We have a list of ideas very focused on small businesses, the self-employed, entrepreneurs and families, because we believe very much you provide tax relief to those individuals that we will see an economy that bounces back," Cantor said. "Unfortunately, here on the Hill, what we're seeing now is the congressional Democrats proposed massive amounts of spending; that in fact today the Congressional Budget Office came out with a report — said that it's just not stimulus. It won't help the economy grow." That seemed odd, given that the CBO is supposed to be an objective, nonpartisan fiscal research arm for Congress. So we decided to check it out. What Cantor cited is not so much a CBO report as a data run projecting how much of the proposed $355 billion stimulus money proposed by House Democrats for infrastructure projects like bridge, highway or school construction and other "discretionary" spending would be going out the door in any given year. Because while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi talks about "shovel ready" projects, the reality is many of the proposed projects would take time to get off the ground. The CBO analysis found that about $136 billion of the $355 billion total would be spent in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 (remember, we are already 4-1/2 months into the 2009 fiscal year). So that means only about a third would be spent this year and next. By the end of the 2011 fiscal year, about 70 percent of the money would be spent. When we called Cantor's office, they made the point that the CBO data show that the proposed spending by the Democrats wouldn't be spent fast enough to quickly stimulate the faltering economy. They note that a previous CBO report projected a marked contraction in the U.S. economy in 2009 will be followed by a slow recovery in 2010. Therefore, Cantor and other Republicans have argued, the bulk of the infrastructure spending wouldn't kick in until we are already well out of a recession. "If most of the plan won't be spent before 2011, what help is that to the economy now?" said Cantor spokesman Brad Dayspring. Therefore, he said, it's fair to extrapolate from the data that the Democrats' plan won't help the economy. A few caveats to the CBO spending analysis are in order. First, as Cantor acknowledged later in the Fox interview, the CBO analysis referenced by Cantor only looked at so-called discretionary spending, not the entire $825 billion stimulus package proposed by House leaders. Among the spending not analyzed is a proposed $275 billion in tax cuts and nearly $200 billion for jobless benefits — both of which are expected by some to jump-start the economy more quickly than infrastructure projects. Second, the CBO data is based on an already outdated version of the proposed stimulus package. Last, and perhaps most important, the three-page CBO data sheet makes absolutely no qualitative conclusions about whether infrastructure spending will stimulate the economy, or whether it will or won't help the economy to grow. It projects when the money would be spent, period. There is sure to be heated debate between Democrats and Republicans in the coming weeks about spending versus tax cuts in the proposed stimulus package, and which would create more jobs, more quickly. If Cantor's point is that Democrats have been too optimistic in how quickly they can create jobs through infrastructure projects, the CBO data give a bit of ammunition to suggest that such projects will likely take several years to unfold. But the way Cantor said it suggests that the nonpartisan and well-regarded CBO had come out with a report that said the opposition party's proposal wouldn't work. That's a serious distortion of three pages of data that simply laid out a likely timeline of spending. Yes, coupled with other data, it is possible to make an argument that the proposed infrastructure spending won't provide an urgently needed boost to the ecomony, but that's not an argument the CBO weighs in on one way or another. And Cantor's suggestion that it does is False.	None	Eric Cantor	None	None	None	2009-01-22T20:21:41	2009-01-21	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-06717	Says that in 2009 ExxonMobil "paid no federal income taxes, received a $156 million rebate."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/01/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-exxonmobil-paid-no-taxes-/	For the past year or so, Exxon Mobil’s tax payments, or lack thereof, have provided political fodder to politicians like Rep. Dennis Kucinich, a Cleveland Democrat who maintain that U.S.corporations don’t pay their fair share of taxes. "Let’s go into some facts here and talk about shared responsibility," Kucinich told FoxNews host Neil Cavuto in an interview on Aug. 6, 2011 that he conducted from Seattle, with the city’s iconic Space Needle in the background. "Listen to this: Exxon Mobil, $19 billion in profits in 2009, paid no federal income taxes, received a $156 million rebate." The statement had a familiar ring to it, so PolitiFact Ohio checked it out. Kucinich’s claim is similar to one made last year by Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who asserted that Exxon Mobil booked $19 billion in profit for 2009, paid no taxes and got a $156 million refund from the Internal Revenue Service. PolitiFact ruled that claim False because Exxon paid many other types of tax that year, and also because it relied on statistics from the company’s 2009 "10-K" form that may not reflect the company’s actual tax payments. Officials from Exxon Mobil, as well as a University of North Carolina business school tax professor, said the figure on the form doesn’t refer to the actual income taxes that Exxon paid to the government, which is confidential. Exxon Mobil spokesmen told PolitiFact the company’s "U.S. income tax expense" for 2009 was approximately $500 million. The company declined to provide documentation for that number. Exxon Mobil’s updated 2010 "10-K/A" form also lists "- $156 million" as the company’ U.S. income tax figure for 2009, as did the earlier form consulted by Sanders. But Exxon spokesmen Cynthia Bergman White and Ken Cohen reiterated it’s not correct to interpret the negative figure as a $156 million refund. They said it merely reflects a tax credit Exxon obtained because of overpayments in previous years. In a blog statement that Exxon Mobil released after filing its 2010 forms, Cohen said the company paid more than $9.8 billion in total taxes and duties to the U.S. government and its subdivisions that year, including more than $1.6 billion in income tax expenses. He said the 2009 numbers were taken out of context by the media and politicians. The numbers "reflected more than ExxonMobil’s tax expense for 2009 activities," said Cohen. "They included the effect of adjustments to our taxes for earlier years, which exceeded the amounts related to 2009. In fact, ExxonMobil’s income tax expense related to 2009 activities was approximately $500 million." That statement matches ExxonMobil’s response to PolitiFact last December. Kucinich spokesman Nathan White insisted his boss’ claim is "completely true" and wasn’t as sweeping as the previous Sanders claim that PolitiFact examined. Kucinich stipulated that Exxon paid no federal income taxes in 2009, while Sanders had said it paid no taxes at all that year. White pointed to a 2010 report from CNN Money, which also listed Exxon’s 2009 federal tax bill as "-$156 million" even as it pointed out that the company paid heavy taxes in other countries, as well as sales taxes in the United States. "You are comparing apples to oranges," White said in an email. "The Politifact critique of Senator Sanders is irrelevant because the two statements are not the same." Kucinich’s words weren’t identical to Sanders’, but were they different enough to warrant a different rating on the Truth-O-Meter? As University of North Carolina tax professor Douglas A. Shackleford told PolitiFact last year, the "-156 million" figure that Sanders interpreted as a rebate doesn’t actually refer to the cash taxes that Exxon paid to the U.S. government. The $156 million number refers "to the U.S portion of the current and deferred income tax expense." "It is a (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) number, not a figure from their U.S. corporate tax return," Shackleford said. "The actual income taxes paid by Exxon to the U.S. government is confidential information. It is not reported in their financial statements." We contacted Shackleford again, who confirmed that the same rationale would apply to Kucinich’s claim. The amount of income tax that Exxon Mobil paid to the U.S. government in 2009 is confidential information that did not appear on the forms that Kucinich and Sanders relied upon to make their claims that the company paid no income taxes and got a rebate. ExxonMobil says the "- $156 million" figure reflects holdover tax issues from previous years that showed up in paperwork for 2009, and that it’s U.S. income tax expense for 2009 was approximately $500 million. A tax professor confirmed that interpreting that $-156 million as the ExxonMoblil’s tax figure would be a misreading of the 10-K form. Based on that, we rate Kucinich’s statement, as we did Sanders’, as False.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2011-09-01T06:00:00	2011-08-06	['ExxonMobil']

pomt-12772	"For every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent."	true	/global-news/statements/2017/feb/22/bono/bono-each-year-school-adds-12-womans-income/	U2 frontman-turned social activist Bono took to the podium at the Munich Security Conference to make the case that the world’s richest economies would benefit from lifting up the poorest. The lack of jobs breeds extremism, he argued. "You may not be interested in the trouble on a far-off street or across the Mediterranean on the other side of the globe, but let me assure you, that trouble is interested in you," Bono said. The singer-activist put education high on the list of where donors should put their money. "We need a plan to make sure all girls can go to school -- 130 million girls around the world don't," Bono said. "For every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent. Some studies even suggest that more education can reduce a country's risk of conflict by 20 percent." We wondered about the power of education to lift the incomes of women. Does each year of schooling actually lead to a 12 percent rise in earnings? According to the most recent research, it does. A 2014 study from the World Bank took data from 139 countries over a span of four decades and found that both men and women gain from going to school, and women gain more. "When considering only males, the rate of return to another year of schooling is 9.6 percent, and for females the rate of returns is much higher, at 11.7 percent," the authors wrote. Their chart helps show the differences. Bono’s press office at One, the advocacy organization he co-founded, told us this was the study behind his claim. The findings seem pretty clear, but we checked with Christina Kwauk, a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution, an academic center in Washington. Kwauk said not only is the average gain correct, but schooling continues to pay as women rise through the education system. "Higher levels of education have even higher rates of return," she said. "For example, an additional year of tertiary education is associated with nearly a 17 percent increase in income." Research also shows that gains are highest in low-income countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, the average increase is over 14 percent for women. That’s due in part to the very low starting point. It’s not totally clear why women gain more than men from education, but one theory is that women get a double advantage from going to school. Not only does it increase their skills -- as it does for a man -- but it also reduces the wage gap between men and women. So long as a society is open to hiring a woman for a higher paid job, her income bump will be larger compared to women with less education. A number of studies provide important caveats. They highlight that the quality of education matters, and simply finishing one year of schooling is not a guarantee that someone has learned as much as one might expect. Social attitudes also have an strong impact. If women are excluded from certain kinds of work, that will place a limit on their income gains. Our ruling Bono said that for every extra year a girl goes to school, her income goes up 12 percent. A recent World Bank study based on numbers from more than a hundred countries found that the average woman gained 11.7 percent more in wages with each year of school. Rounding up to 12 percent seems fair. These gains can vary both up and down, depending on the country, but that’s the nature of an average.

pomt-09397	"Last week the Texas State Board of Education (SBOE), led by Rick Perry's appointee, voted to remove Thomas Jefferson from social studies textbook standards. That's right. Thomas Jefferson... was deleted from a list of historical figures who inspired political change."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/23/bill-white/white-says-state-board-education-led-perry-appoint/	The State Board of Education has provoked a national outcry for its effort to revise curriculum standards in Texas. Lately joining the chorus: Bill White, the former Houston mayor and 2010 Democratic nominee for governor. In a March 17 e-mail, White blames GOP Gov. Rick Perry for lackluster leadership at the expense of students' education. "Last week the Texas State Board of Education (SBOE), led by Rick Perry's appointee, voted to remove Thomas Jefferson from social studies textbook standards. That's right. Thomas Jefferson — Founding Father, author of the Declaration of Independence, and a world-renowned scholar who advocated democratic, limited government — was deleted from a list of historical figures who inspired political change," White's e-email states. Did White get that right? In July 2009, the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills review committee, consisting of seven social studies teachers from different school districts across Texas, recommended revising a high school world history studies course description to include various ideas from the Enlightenment era, an 18th-century period of philosophic thought whose tenets included reason, skepticism and revolution, according to scholars. The amendment read: "Government. The student understands how contemporary political systems have developed from earlier systems of government. The student is expected to ... explain the impact of Enlightenment ideas from John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, Voltaire, Charles de Montesquieu, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Thomas Jefferson on political revolutions from 1750 to the present ..." (The review committee noted in its original draft that its suggested list was not meant to be exhaustive.) Board member Cynthia Dunbar, a lawyer and assistant law professor from Richmond, made a motion at the board's March 11 meeting to change the proposed standard, substituting "writings" for "Enlightenment ideas" and removing Jefferson from the suggested list. In Jefferson's place, she added Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin and Sir William Blackstone — respectively, a Roman Catholic priest and saint; a Protestant theologian; and an English jurist who wrote that the doctrines of common law are based on God's word. Dunbar, defending the amendment, said: "It does take out (the) reference to Thomas Jefferson. But the reason is not that I don't think his ideas were important. It's just that this is a list of political philosophers from which the Founding Fathers based their ideologies and their principles." Dunbar's amendment won preliminary board approval by 8 to 6. But that doesn't mean Jefferson has been stricken from Texas classrooms. "The only individual mentioned more times in the curriculum standards than Thomas Jefferson is George Washington," board chairwoman Gail Lowe says in a March 19 press release. In fact, members left intact these elements: In a fifth-grade U.S. history course, students are expected to "identify the Founding Fathers and patriot heroes," including Jefferson. In an eighth-grade U.S. history course, students are required to "explain the roles played by significant individuals during the American Revolution," including Jefferson. And in a high school government course, students must "identify the contributions of the political philosophies of the Founding Fathers," and "identify individuals in the field of government and politics," both including Jefferson. So Jefferson stays in U.S. history and government classes unless the board later decides otherwise when it finalizes the standards in May. How does White's statement stand up overall? First, the board was updating the state's curriculum standards, not textbook standards. Then again, the curriculum standards will serve as a framework when the board meets to revise textbooks in 2011. Next, he overstates Perry's role in determining the board of education's membership. Lowe, the chairwoman, is an elected official, not a Perry appointee. But the governor named her chairwoman of the board. Finally, White said the state board voted "to remove Thomas Jefferson from social studies textbook standards," but the vote was on a single amendment to a single high school world history standard. White also implied that those standards were already in effect. They weren't. We can see how White might've been confused. Media coverage of the board's action hasn't always been precise. White's final sentence — that Jefferson was deleted from a list of historical figures who inspired political change — is a more accurate way to put it. We rate White's multi-part statement as Half True.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-03-23T22:18:32	2010-03-17	['Thomas_Jefferson', 'Rick_Perry', 'Texas_Education_Agency']

pomt-05492	"We are at a 40-year low in our crime rate in our state."	true	/florida/statements/2012/apr/17/rick-scott/rick-scott-said-florida-crime-rates-are-40-year-lo/	Florida crime rates are at 40-year lows. Forty-year lows? That’s the kind of dramatic statement that makes fact-checkers sit up and say, "Really?" Gov. Rick Scott has made that statement several times when asked about the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager in Sanford, Fla. His comments seem intended to reassure people that Florida is a safe place to work and live, even while the state investigates the Martin shooting. (See Scott discuss it on MSNBC’s Morning Joe.) "We are at a 40-year low in our crime rate in our state," he said in an April 13, 2012, report from Reuters. "From a public safety standpoint we are absolutely heading in the right direction." Martin died after a resident, George Zimmerman, reported him to 911 as acting suspicious. The operator told Zimmerman not to pursue Martin, but Zimmerman shot Martin a short while later. Police didn’t arrest Zimmerman, and that angered Martin’s family and others. It also got people talking about Florida’s "stand your ground" law, which allows people to use deadly force when they believe their lives are at risk. Scott said an official review of the controversial "stand your ground" law will begin after the investigation into the shooting itself is complete. A reader (and Palm Beach Post reporter) on Twitter reported that Scott again said crime rates were at 40-year lows during a forum in West Palm Beach; she asked us to check it out. So we decided to investigate. Our first stop was with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Crime statistics on the website only go back 11 years, so we contacted the department directly. It provided us with crime statistics from 2010 back to 1971, for a total of 40 years. The department uses the number of crimes and the population of Florida to calculate crime rates, so different years can be compared. The crime rate shows how many crimes occurred per 100,000 people. In 1971, the crime rate was 5,668. The rate crept up through the 1970s, peaking in the late 1980s at 8,908. The rate then slowly dropped through the 1990s. In 2000, it dropped below the 1971 mark and continued downward. In 2010, the crime rate reached a new low of 4,105. (See the data for yourself.) As we dug deeper, we saw that Scott has been touting the statistic since it was first announced by the department almost a year ago. Do the numbers reflect reality, though? From time to time, there have been allegations that local police haven’t always reported numbers as accurately as they should. We addressed this point in detail in another fact-check. Overall, though, we found no evidence that isolated cases of cheating undermine the larger trend of declining crime rates. We should also point out that Florida isn’t the only place experiencing historically low crime rates, even during a severe economic recession. Why are rates declining? Nobody can say for sure. "I wish we had some really good answers, but we don’t," said Ronald L. Akers, a professor of criminology at the University of Florida. "There have been a number of reasonable hypotheses that fit what we know, but nothing we can really pin down with certainty." The theories are highly diverse, and some are fairly controversial, as we noted in previous fact-checks on crime rates. Here are some of the ideas that have been advanced to explain the lower crime rates: Police are getting better at using technology to prevent crime. More people are in jail and therefore can’t commit crimes. Drug addiction is not as widespread as it once was. Online banking and debit cards mean people don’t have cash at home. Abortions have suppressed the number of poor, unsupervised young men. Low inflation makes stealing non-cash items less attractive. President Barack Obama is setting a positive example for African-American youth. New gun laws establishing the right to carry are deterring criminals. Joblessness means people are at home watching the neighborhood. Extended unemployment benefits and food stamps mean people don’t have to turn to crime.

pomt-12970	"Pennsylvania Federal Court grants legal authority to remove Trump after Russian Meddling."	pants on fire!	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/dec/23/today-news-24/pennsylvania-judge-didnt-overturn-donald-trumps-pr/	To hardcore Hillary fans, the headline probably sounds like the only good news they’ve heard since Nov. 8. A website called Today News 24 posted a story earlier this month titled "Pennsylvania Federal Court grants legal authority to remove Trump after Russian Meddling." That’s not a maybe or a possibility in the headline. That’s a definitive statement. But it comes from Today News 24, a site so obscure it doesn’t even show up on the first few pages of a Google search (and should not be mistaken with South African source News 24). On Facebook it has a more significant presence, with over 5,000 likes and about one post every day for the last several weeks. The website for Today News 24 has a dozen or so political-related stories on its homepage and separate sections about trucks and motorbikes that are nearly devoid of content. Most of the headlines have a liberal slant. So is there any evidence to back up this claim about removing Trump? For starters, the Today News 24 article is similar to one published on a website called USA Snich PolitiFact debunked earlier this week. That article claimed "Putin Interference Could Give Courts Legal Right to Make Hillary President" and used information from a Huffington Post column written by contributor Alex Mohajer, who is identified as the political director of "Bros4Hillary" and a lawyer. This article uses the same premises put forward by the Huffington Post column — without linking — but takes the possibility a step further by declaring a Pennsylvania court has granted legal authority for the removal of Donald Trump. Like many fake news stories, there are elements of truth combined to create this overblown statement. An actual case from Pennsylvania in the 1990s, for instance, really did reverse the results of an election. In 1993 in Philadelphia (of course), a winning state Senate candidate was ruled by the courts to have participated in a scheme to drum up hundreds of votes through illegal absentee ballots. This Democratic politician, William Stinson, was removed from office by federal Judge Clarence Newcomer and replaced by the Republican he defeated, Bruce Marks. The CIA and FBI have also both claimed Russia attempted to sway the electorate toward Trump. But that’s not all this article is saying. No federal court in Pennsylvania has granted "legal authority" to remove Trump because of the Russian hacking, as the headline suggests. The article, written by an author identified as "darko," couches the headline somewhat, saying the 1995 ruling "could provide legal grounds to remove Donald Trump from office." But even that action isn’t plausible. PolitiFact interviewed Kermit Roosevelt, a constitutional scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. He said the case involving Stinson and Marks was different than what happened with Russia’s hacking. "I’m pretty confident that there’s zero chance of it happening," Roosevelt said. "I could see a court reversing the result of an election if fraud was proved along the lines of, ‘Candidate A really won 150 to 100, but Candidate B fraudulently altered the records to make it look like he won 150 to 100.’ But that’s not what happened. No one credible is alleging that the election was affected by that kind of fraud. The votes recorded were the votes that were cast. They may have been influenced by fake news and Russian propaganda, but there’s no judicial remedy for that." Our Ruling The website Today News 24 published an article headlined "Pennsylvania Federal Court grants legal authority to remove Trump after Russian Meddling." The article uses information highlighted in a Huffington Post article about a judge overturning the results of a 1993 Philadelphia election to show the possibility of Trump being removed in favor of Hillary Clinton. Scholars say the particulars of the 1993 case and this year’s election are not similar. Plus, the headline doesn’t say it’s a possibility. It says the court has granted authority to remove Trump. No federal court in Pennsylvania has done that. We rule the claim Pants On Fire.	None	Today News 24	None	None	None	2016-12-23T12:32:53	2016-12-16	['None']

pomt-06100	"We don't take a dime from D.C. lobbyists or special-interest PACs -- never have and never will."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/04/barack-obama/barack-obamas-campaign-says-they-dont-accept-lobby/	In late December, President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign made a fundraising pitch that, among other things, touted the measures his campaign is taking to distance itself from lobbyists: "We don't take a dime from D.C. lobbyists or special-interest PACs -- never have and never will." A reader pointed out this claim and asked us if it’s true. First, we checked with the Obama campaign, and a spokeswoman confirmed that the campaign does not accept money from federally registered lobbyists, either making direct donations themselves or serving as "bundlers" who solicit and package donations from others. To enforce that policy, the campaign continually reviews the federal lobbyist registry. On the surface, the Obama campaign’s claim seems plausible. But we think it’s important to add some context about how this pledge is phrased. A key issue is how you define the word "lobbyist." As we noted in a recent item, to be a registered lobbyist, one has to meet a number of detailed rules laid out in federal law. One of the main rules is that a person has to register if he or she holds two or more meetings with elected officials or staff in any quarter of the year on behalf of a client. Also, lobbying activities must constitute 20 percent or more of the lobbyist’s time during any three-month period. (Want more detail? Read 27 pages of guidance on disclosing lobbying activities via the U.S. Senate website.) Experts we spoke to said that it’s not uncommon for a former lawmaker or other senior political official to offer "strategic advice" without having to register as a lobbyist. Strategic advisers can do quite a bit for clients without acquiring the lobbyist label. They can give advice on individuals to meet with and what arguments to make. They can instruct someone who is a registered lobbyist, again telling the lobbyist with whom to meet and what to address. They may take clients to meetings with non-governmental groups, such as grassroots political groups. They may even have one big meeting with an elected official to make a case for a client. "There’s a lot of activity that ordinary people would think of as lobbying that doesn’t trigger the obligation to register as a lobbyist under federal law. Strategic advice is one of those kinds of things that doesn’t," said Joseph Sandler, an attorney with the Washington law firm Sandler Reiff Young & Lamb. Sandler was one of four co-chairs of an American Bar Association task force that recommended changes to federal lobbying laws to improve disclosure and reduce conflicts of interest. So by the campaign’s standard, a strategic adviser who doesn’t officially register to lobby -- or a former lobbyist who is no longer registered, or someone who supervises lobbyists but isn’t registered -- is free to give money to the campaign or serve as a bundler. According to an Oct. 27, 2011, New York Times report, at least 15 of Obama’s bundlers, who collectively have raised at least $5 million, "are involved in lobbying for Washington consulting shops or private companies," advocating interests from "telecommunications and high-tech software to Wall Street finance, international commerce and pharmaceuticals." None of these 15 bundlers is "currently registered as a federal lobbyist," the Times reported. But "at least four of them have been (officially registered lobbyists) in the past. And a number of the bundlers work for prominent lobbying and law firms, including Greenberg Traurig and Blank Rome." As examples, the Times cited Sally Susman, David L. Cohen and Michael Kempner, all of whom have raised at least $500,000 for the campaign. Susman, an executive with drug-maker Pfizer, "helped organize a $35,800-a-ticket dinner that Mr. Obama attended in Manhattan in June. At the same time, she leads Pfizer’s powerful lobbying shop, and she has visited the White House four times since 2009 — twice on export issues. But under the byzantine rules that govern federal lobbying, Ms. Susman has not registered with the Senate as a lobbyist." Meanwhile, Cohen "oversees lobbying at the Comcast Corporation" and "hosted the president and some 120 guests" at his home in Philadelphia, the Times reported. Guests "paid at least $10,000 each to attend; Mr. Obama called Mr. Cohen and his wife ‘great friends.’" And Kempner "runs a team of Washington lobbyists" at the MWW Group, a New Jersey-based firm where he serves as CEO. The firm employs seven registered lobbyists in Washington, even though Kempner himself is not one. The Obama campaign notes that its policy is still more stringent than federal law requires and adds that many of the Republican presidential campaigns have more permissive rules on lobbyist donations. The Obama campaign, for instance, voluntarily releases its list of bundlers. In addition, the Obama campaign is hardly alone in setting the standards as it has. Experts we spoke to said that it’s not uncommon for campaigns to say they’re banning lobbyist money but to allow the same sorts of activities permitted by the Obama campaign. "A world of strategic consultants and state-level lobbyists can, and do, give," said Meredith McGehee, policy director for the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that analyzes campaign-finance issues. There are other ways for a campaign to benefit from the support of lobbyists without accepting their money. "Even campaigns that say they will not accept lobbyists’ campaign contributions typically accept other forms of help from lobbyists, such as door knocking, poll watching and the like," said Robert K. Kelner, an attorney with the firm Covington & Burling who specializes in political and election law. Lobbyists can also make sure that their clients "are given good advice on where and when to give, especially with all the entities available -- candidate PACs, leadership PACs, super PACs, 501(c)4s, trade associations, party committees, state party committees and so on," McGehee said. "A big dog lobbyist will help steer their clients, and the executives of that client, to ‘smart’ giving." Our ruling The Obama campaign has a point that it doesn’t "take a dime from D.C. lobbyists or special-interest PACs." But this leaves out important details. The campaign -- like others before it -- uses a narrow definition of "lobbyist" that allows donations and fundraising by people who most likely look, to the average American, like "lobbyists," even if they are not officially. In addition, the Obama campaign’s policy doesn’t bar even federally registered lobbyists from serving as volunteers for the campaign, as long as they don’t give or bundle money.

pomt-06016	"More people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/17/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-more-people-have-been-put-food-/	During the Jan. 16, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., former House Speaker Newt Gingrich resurrected one of his favorite attack lines against President Barack Obama -- that food stamp usage has peaked under the current president. Calling Obama the "best food stamp president in American history," Gingrich said that "more people have been put on food stamps under Barack Obama than anyone in American history." We addressed a similar comment by Gingrich in May 2011 and thought it would be worth an update. We’ll start by noting that "food stamps" -- which provide qualifying, low-income Americans with vouchers to buy groceries -- have officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008, although many people still use the informal name. It’s possible to interpret Gingrich's statement that "more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any president in American history" as suggesting that Obama is forcing people into the program. In fact, it’s a voluntary program. In any case, here are the historical data: For the most recent month with available data -- October 2011 -- roughly 46.2 million people received SNAP benefits. That’s down slightly from September 2011, when 46.3 million people received benefits, but those two months were the highest in history. The trendline shows consistent increases in the numbers of Americans receiving SNAP benefits: 30.8 million in October 2008, 37.7 million in October 2009, and 43.2 million in October 2010. In addition, the average number of people on SNAP every month hit a record high in 2011 -- 44.7 million. It’s risen every year since 2007. We also checked to make sure that this wasn’t influenced by population growth, and it wasn’t. Currently, about 14 percent of the population is on food stamps. In 1994, the highest year for SNAP use prior to the recession that began in December 2007, the rate was 10.5 percent. So Gingrich is correct that food stamp use is at its highest level in both raw numbers and as a percentage of the U.S. population since the program began in 1969. Case closed? Not quite. Gingrich’s talking point implies that this is Obama’s fault. Clearly, the rise in food stamps is a direct consequence of the most recent recession, which began more than a year before Obama took office. It’s impossible to know how high SNAP usage would have gone had the Republicans, rather than Obama, shaped policy in 2009 and 2010. On the one hand, SNAP usage has continued to climb almost every month of the Obama presidency despite some signs of an economic recovery. So Gingrich’s charge cannot simply be dismissed out of hand. On the other hand, there is typically a lag time before an upturn in the broader economy begins to show up in decreased SNAP usage. The previous high from 1994, for instance, came following a recession that officially ended in mid 1991 -- and that recession was much milder than the most recent one. This makes it harder to divvy up the blame. One last point: The number of food stamp beneficiaries had started to head upward under President George W. Bush, partly because of more aggressive efforts to get eligible Americans to apply for benefits, and partly because of changes in the rules that had the effect of broadening eligibility. The experts we spoke to agreed that both policies began under Bush but were retained by Obama. The changes produced consistent increases in the number of average monthly beneficiaries. The number rose in seven out of the eight years of Bush’s presidency -- most of which were years not considered recessionary. All told, the number of recipients rose by a cumulative 63 percent during Bush’s eight-year presidency. Our ruling The number of SNAP beneficiaries is at a record level, and it has risen in most months of the Obama presidency. But Gingrich oversimplifies when he suggests that Obama is the root cause. Much of the reason for the increase was a combination of the economic problems Obama inherited combined with a longstanding upward trend from policy changes. But Obama has supported those policies.

pomt-12793	The media has "a lower approval rate than Congress."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/16/donald-trump/news-media-less-trusted-congress/	In a wide-ranging news conference, President Donald Trump said a few nice things about the media and quite a few not-so-nice things. While he acknowledged that there are good reporters, his opening salvo was strongly critical. "The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about (it), we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people," Trump said. "Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control." Later, Trump compared the media with Congress. "You have a lower approval rate than Congress, I think that's right, I don't know," Trump said. "I think they have lower -- I heard lower than Congress." Trump gave himself some wiggle room on the accuracy of that, but he still made the point. To set the record straight: The press does rank low in the trust department, but Congress ranks even lower. The latest numbers come from Gallup, which has been asking people how much confidence they have in various institutions since 1973. As of June 2016, 40 percent of the public had a negative opinion of television news, but 55 percent weighed in on the negative side for Congress. Newspapers did a hair better in the mistrust department. About a third of the people surveyed said they had very little or no trust in the printed press. Positive Negative Newspapers 20% 36% Television 21% 40% Congress 9% 55% Looking at the numbers in net terms (positive minus negative), newspapers and television have an average net rating of minus 18 percent. But Congress’ net is minus 44 percent. Other surveys might have different numbers, but the thrust remains the same. Hefty fractions of the public might have a bad feeling about the news media, but they feel even worse about Congress. A 2016 Pew Research Center survey asked people if they trusted what they heard from national news organizations and 24 percent said "not too much" or "not at all." A 2015 survey found that 69 percent viewed Congress unfavorably. The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polled the public in 2014. They reported that "over half of Americans say they have hardly any confidence at all in Congress." The comparable measure for the press was 44 percent. Again, trust in news media might be low, but Congress comes in lower. It’s worth noting how low both institutions score in this chart about public confidence from Gallup: Our ruling Trump said he thought that the media had lower favorability ratings than Congress. But Congress actually ranks below the news media, according to surveys from three different research groups spanning several years. In two polls, mistrust in the media broke 40 percent, which is hardly anything to brag about. But in those studies, mistrust in Congress was over 50 percent. Trump had a point that the media has a trust issue, but he got the ranking wrong in terms of Congress.

"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris," Trump said Thursday in the White House Rose Garden. The reaction from Pittsburgh’s mayor, Bill Peduto, was swift. He tweeted, "Fact: Hillary Clinton received 80% of the vote in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh stands with the world & will follow Paris Agreement @HillaryClinton." At a press conference in Pittsburgh with local reporters Thursday, Peduto repeated this claim: "The people of Pittsburgh voted for Hillary Rodham Clinton, 80 percent." Peduto’s spokesperson Timothy McNulty said Friday the mayor got the number "off the top of his head" and noted the numbers weren’t that different. During an appearance on CNN late Thursday, Peduto qualified his earlier statement: "The city of Pittsburgh voted for Hillary Clinton with nearly 80 percent of the vote. [Trump] may be talking about all of western Pennsylvania, but it’s a far cry from being Pittsburgh." And while on "Hardball with Chris Matthews" on MSNBC, Peduto again stuck with the same claim: "Actually in Pittsburgh, Hillary Clinton won with nearly 80 percent of the vote." Did Clinton win the city by that majority? Almost. Allegheny County election records show that Clinton won 75 percent of the vote in the city of Pittsburgh, while she won 56 percent of the vote county-wide. We calculated Clinton’s vote total using precinct-level data published by the county through the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center. Our ruling Trump said he was elected to represent people from Pittsburgh, not Paris, when explaining why he decided to withdraw the U.S. from a global climate deal. Pittsburgh’s mayor, Bill Peduto, responded by tweeting that Hillary Clinton received 80 percent of the vote in Pittsburgh. Clinton received 75 percent of the vote.

pomt-08645	"700 jobs (were) lost because Allen Boyd" voted for the health care bill.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/sep/16/national-republican-congressional-committee/allen-boyd-cost-sallie-mae-employees-their-jobs-he/	Republicans hoping to take back the U.S. House of Representatives have their sights set on North Florida Democrat Allen Boyd. A "Blue Dog" Democrat and a seven-term congressman, Boyd faces a serious challenge this November from Republican funeral-home owner Steve Southerland. The St. Petersburg Times labeled Boyd one of the two most vulnerable incumbents in Florida, and the National Republican Congressional Committee has identified the race in Florida's 2nd Congressional District as one its top prospects. The NRCC reserved a big chunk of fall television time in Tallahassee, and already is airing an ad criticizing Boyd for voting for the massive federal health care legislation. The ad is called "Allen Boyd sides with Nancy Pelosi," and says that the passage of the federal health care bill will cost Boyd's district 700 jobs. "Our economy is hurting, but Allen Boyd sides with Nancy Pelosi and he's killing our jobs," the ad begins. "When Allen Boyd voted for Obamacare, he voted to shut down a local facility that employs 700 people. 700 jobs lost because Allen Boyd sided with Nancy Pelosi." It's important to note that while this fact check -- that Boyd's vote on health care cost his district 700 jobs -- is about the federal health care legislation, it's not specifically about health care. The massive legislation tacked-on changes to how students receive loans to pay for college. It's those changes to the student loan programs that cost North Florida 700 jobs, the NRCC is claiming. We'll explain the whys and hows in a moment, but first a primer on the student loan changes adopted in the health care bill. The student loan changes Before the health care bill passed and was signed into law by President Barack Obama in March 2010, there were basically two kinds of college loan programs: the Federal Family Education Loan Program, in which private lenders make and secure loans to students and receive subsidies from the federal government; and the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program, in which the federal government directly loans to students. The federal health care bill eliminated those subsidies to private lenders and shifted student lending to the government's Direct Loan program, which Obama believes is more efficient and cost-effective. The shift is expected to save $68 billion over the next 11 years, $36 billion of which would be used to expand Pell Grants, a federal program that helps low-income students pay for college. Other money, about $9 billion, will help pay for some of the additional health care costs. Boyd voted against the original version of the health care bill to pass the House in November 2009 -- which included the student loan changes -- but voted for the final version that passed the House 220-211 and ultimately became law. He said he decided to support the final version because he believed it met four key principles: It reduced health costs, increased access, ensured patient choice and did not add to the federal deficit. "This bill is not perfect, but I believe it meets these four principles of responsible reform by providing the largest middle class tax credits for healthcare in our nation's history and preserving a patient’s ability to choose their own doctor," Boyd said in a release announcing his support. The question for this fact check to address then comes down to those 700 jobs, how they were impacted by the health care bill, and what Boyd could have done to stop any job losses. Saving Sallie Mae jobs Boyd's 2nd Congressional District includes a student loan processing facility operated by Sallie Mae, the nation's largest private provider of student loans. The facility is located in Lynn Haven, just north of Panama City. It employs about 540 full-time workers, and had in the past hired about 160 temporary workers. The company did not hire those workers in 2010. Sallie Mae officials said repeatedly that if the health care bill passed with changes to the student loan rules, all of the Bay County jobs could be in jeopardy. Boyd initially appeared to side with Sallie Mae and its employees, visiting the Bay County facility in November 2009 after voting against the first version of the health care bill. He also voted against the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act (H.R. 3221) in the House, which attempted to accomplish the same changes to the student loan program. "Sallie Mae is one of our most vibrant and reliable employers in North Florida," Boyd said in a Sallie Mae press release. "I will continue working to protect these valuable jobs and preserving the current student lending infrastructure that has served our students and schools well for years." Boyd attempted to remove the student loan language from the health care bill, and offered an amendment to that effect in front of the Budget Committee on March 15, but the amendment failed 4-32, Congressional Quarterly reported. Boyd said switching to federal loans would result in the loss of thousands of jobs for employees in the student loan industry, but acknowledged he had not been able to reach a compromise with other Democrats, CQ reported. But on March 21, Boyd voted for the health care bill, which included the student loan changes. He said he believed he still thought it possible to save the Panama City Sallie Mae jobs. "I am disappointed that the student loan issue is included in the health care bill," Boyd said in March. "I have had many conversations with Sallie Mae, the Department of Education, and the White House, and I believe there are a number of steps we can take to prevent job losses at the Lynn Haven facility. I will continue working with Sallie Mae and Education Secretary (Arne) Duncan to ensure that this new process will not jeopardize the future of the hardworking people in Lynn Haven." A month later Sallie Mae announced it was closing its Bay County location. The company said it was going to cut about a third of its 8,600-employee nationwide workforce and reduce its physical locations from 25 to five to seven. "We've been warning about the impact of this legislation, and this is a direct result of that," Sallie Mae spokesman Conwey Casillas told the Panama City News Herald. Boyd issued a news release that same day saying he was working the Department of Education and the White House to help protect the Sallie Mae jobs, hoping the employees could transition to a different type of loan processing position. He later lobbied BP claims administrator Kenneth Feinberg to place workers from the closing facility in oil spill-related damage claim processing jobs. News reports suggest he is still searching for jobs for the Sallie Mae employees. But not before the first round of layoffs -- affecting about 50 employees -- came in July. The facility is expected to be shut down by the end of the year. "The decision to close our Bay County facility is based on the fact that this is the location where the loan origination function was performed," said spokesman Conwey Casillas. "Effective July 1, 2010, the Federal Family Education Loan Program, first enacted in 1965, was eliminated along with the role Sallie Mae and other private sector companies performed in the origination of federal student loans." Our ruling In the ad, the National Republican Congressional Committee says "700 jobs" were lost because Allen Boyd voted for the federal health care bill. In the strictest analysis, the NRCC is slightly off on both points. The company plans to lay off about 540 full-time employees. It also chose not to rehire about 160 temporary employees. Boyd's vote, meanwhile, wouldn't have changed the outcome of the legislation. Still, the ad has some elements of truth. After voting against the first version of the health care bill, Boyd did vote for a final version that tacked on significant changes to the student loan program. Sallie Mae warned that those very changes could threaten the jobs at its Panama City facility, and one month after the health care bill passed, the company announced it was closing that facility. But it was Sallie Mae's decision to eliminate the Panama City jobs, cutting those specific jobs wasn't mandated by Washington. We are certain this will be an issue Boyd will confront over and over again between now and Nov. 2. And it's certainly complicated -- so much so that he might not be able to explain the nuance of his actions and what happened in 30-second commercials. Luckily, we have no such time or word limit. The fact is, the federal health care bill that passed in March contained massive changes to the health care system, as well as changes to how college students get student loans. Boyd in the end liked the health care provisions and didn't like the changes to the student loan system. He tried to eliminate the student loan provisions through an amendment to the overall legislation, but failed. And there is no "yes, except for that" vote in Congress. It's much more accurate, for instance, to say that the 700 jobs were lost because the health care bill passed. Boyd's vote didn't change the outcome of the legislation, it would have passed either way. And if you believe Sallie Mae, that means he wouldn't have been able to stop what's happening to Sallie Mae's Panama City-area employees. We rate the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03044	There is "a constitutional issue" that affects "the paychecks of members of Congress" during a shutdown.	true	/florida/statements/2013/oct/07/mario-diaz-balart/mario-diaz-balart-says-congress-paid-during-shutdo/	You know those members of Congress who are responsible for the federal government shutdown? While staffers have been furloughed, their bosses continue to collect their paychecks. During an Oct. 2 interview on CNN, Wolf Blitzer asked U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Miami, "Will you accept your paycheck as 800,000 other federal workers are being denied theirs?" Diaz-Balart replied that he hopes staffers get repaid when the shutdown is over. As for his own paycheck, Diaz-Balart didn’t say he would or wouldn’t accept his paycheck. Instead, he said this: "There is a bit of a constitutional issue by the way, as you know, when you are dealing with the paychecks of members of Congress." A few days later, Diaz-Balart voted to give back pay to furloughed federal workers. The measure passed unanimously in the House, 407 to 0. Still, we were intrigued by his comments that pay for legislators raises constitutional issues. What does the Constitution tell us about congressional paychecks amid a shutdown? What the Constitution says About 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed during the shutdown that started Oct. 1. During past shutdowns, furloughed workers received back pay once the shutdown was over. Other workers have been deemed essential (or in government-speak "excepted") and must work for now while getting paid when the shutdown ends. Finally, President Barack Obama signed a law to allow active military and the civilians and contractors who support them to get paid during the shutdown. But the rules that apply to federal workers don’t apply to members of Congress. Most members earn $174,000 a year, with leadership getting a little more. "Due to their constitutional responsibilities and a permanent appropriation for congressional pay, members of Congress are not subject to furlough," states a September report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Article I, Section 6, of the Constitution authorizes pay for members of Congress. "The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States," it states. Most of the experts we interviewed and news articles we read agreed that according to the Constitution, Congress continues to get paid, even during a shutdown. The purpose of the language about congressional pay "was to resolve the once-hot dispute over whether the elected representatives to the new federal government would be paid by the states or out of the federal treasury," said Ilya Shapiro, Senior Fellow in Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute. "So yes, Congress can’t reduce/eliminate its own pay during a shutdown. I guess that makes congressmen and senators the primo ‘essential’ federal workers." But we’ll offer one counterargument by University of Miami constitutional law professor Stephen Schnably. If people are saying the Constitution "is a barrier to their pay being withheld during the shutdown, I’d have to say the text doesn’t necessarily support that. It doesn’t say, ‘regardless of any appropriation requirement.’ " However, "what really counts in this area is Congress’s practice over the years," Schnably said. "Mostly these provisions have been left to Congress to interpret." Right now, Congress is scheduled to be paid. "Constitutionally, we have to disperse their pay, but we are honoring member requests to hold on to their pay until after the shutdown," said Dan Weiser, communications director for the House’s Office of the Chief Administrative Officer. At least 125 members have said that they will refuse their paycheck or donate it, according to the Washington Post, though some observers say that’s just a publicity stunt. And it might be a moot point because members get paid at the end of the month and it’s possible the shutdown will be over before then. (Diaz-Balart’s chief of staff declined to discuss with PolitiFact if Diaz-Balart wants to forgo his pay but when questioned about it on CNN he said that lawmakers need to avoid "gimmicks.") One final wrinkle about their paychecks: Congress can’t change its own pay until after an election happens. The 27th Amendment, adopted in 1992, states, "No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened." That amendment means Congress can’t vote to stop it's pay right now, said Kermit Roosevelt, an expert on constitutional law at the University of Pennsylvania’s law school. However, Congress could pass a law for future shutdowns, saying they won’t be paid, he said. Past efforts to do that have failed, though. In January, U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Bob Casey, D-Pa., introduced a bill that would would prevent Congress and the president from being paid during a shutdown or default. The Senate passed such a bill in 2011, but the House didn’t act. Similar efforts this fall leading up to the shutdown also failed. Our ruling When asked about whether he would forgo his own paycheck during the shutdown, Diaz-Balart said, "There is a bit of a constitutional issue ... when you are dealing with the paychecks of members of Congress." He is correct: Article I, Section 6, of the U.S. Constitution authorizes pay for members of Congress "ascertained by law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States." Members can ask the House to withhold their pay, but that’s just a temporary symbolic move -- particularly since they aren’t scheduled to get a paycheck until the end of the month.

pomt-14272	"Attorney General Roy Cooper refuses to do his job" by not defending House Bill 2 in a lawsuit.	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/apr/07/phil-berger/nc-sen-phil-berger-says-g-roy-cooper-failing-his-d/	N.C. Attorney General Roy Cooper took flak from many conservatives when he announced that he would not defend a controversial new state law, commonly called HB2, in court. The law says only biological gender, and not gender identity, can determine which bathroom someone may use. It also created a statewide anti-discrimination law that doesn’t include protections for gay or transgender people. The ACLU, Equality NC and several transgender or gay people who say it discriminates against them have filed a lawsuit. Cooper is named as a defendant, as are Gov. Pat McCrory, the UNC System, its board of governors and the board of governors chairman, W. Louis Bissette Jr. Republicans, including Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger, have accused Cooper of playing politics by telling the legislature to repeal the law or hire outside counsel to defend it. Cooper is the Democratic candidate for governor in this fall’s election. "Attorney General Roy Cooper refuses to do his job and defend us," Berger wrote in a Facebook post. "This isn't the first time Cooper has pandered to far-left special interests instead of fulfilling his oath to defend the people of North Carolina. Please join me and call on Roy Cooper to resign immediately, for refusing to do his job and protect our children." We already looked at claims in the HB2 debate about safety and protecting people from sex crimes. Chris Sgro of Equality NC said sexual predators have not used transgender anti-discrimination laws as cover to sneak into women’s bathrooms and commit crimes. We rated that claim Mostly True. But what about the crux of Berger’s call for Cooper to resign? Is the attorney general refusing to do his job here? "It’s clear I’m doing my job in this case," Cooper told a reporter at the news conference when he announced his decision in late March. Clearly Cooper and Berger disagree on the responsibilities of the attorney general. But that’s understandable – it’s a question that has kept legal scholars busy for years. First, let’s look at what state law says. Duties of the job The N.C. Attorney General has no constitutional duties. The office’s duties have instead been pieced together over the years by common law, court rulings and state statutes. The main source is General Statute chapter 114, which lays out eight duties of the office. One is to represent the state "in any cause or matter, civil or criminal, in which the state may be a party or interested." The N.C. Supreme Court reaffirmed that duty in a 1987 case. And just a few years ago, Cooper cited this duty in explaining why he would defend the state’s voter ID law despite his own opinion about it. "It is the duty under the law for this office to defend the state when it gets sued — even if I personally disagree with the public policy," Cooper said in a 2013 Los Angeles Times interview. "This office is going to follow the law." That appears at first to contradict what Cooper is saying now. The HB2 case, however, is different in two key ways. Cooper simply said he disagreed with the voter ID law. But he is calling HB2 unconstitutional. Furthermore, two state agencies – including his own – are challenging the law. Cooper has said he will represent them instead. That brings into consideration another duty of the job, to represent state "departments, agencies, institutions, commissions, bureaus or other organized activities" in legal issues. Legal precedent So what happens when a legal battle involves state government on both sides, as with HB2? This isn’t the first time it has happened under Cooper. In 2014, McCrory sued the General Assembly, saying it acted unconstitutionally in appointing members of an environmental committee. Cooper defended the legislature. McCrory hired private lawyers and recently won at the N.C. Supreme Court. This time, however, Cooper says he won’t defend the state, since his own office and the N.C. Treasurer’s office are calling the law unconstitutional. "This case presents the attorney general with a direct conflict – whether to argue the constitutionality of these executive branch policies and the rights of these employees or the constitutionality of HB2," said Cooper’s deputy campaign manager, Megan Jacobs. Scholarly opinions Berger’s office strongly disagrees with the argument that HB2 is unconstitutional, however. "Lawyers will always claim gray areas and make legalistic excuses," said Amy Auth, Berger’s deputy chief of staff. She said defending the state is foremost among Cooper’s duties and called his argument "a make-believe legal conflict to prop up his refusal to defend state law." However, constitutional law professor Gregory Wallace of Campbell University School of Law said the issue is more nuanced. State law doesn’t give any exceptions to the office’s duties, Wallace said, "but many scholars and attorneys have recognized certain implicit exceptions to the duty to defend at both the federal and state level­." Wallace said Cooper could be impeached for acting outside the scope of his duties, but also that his oath to uphold the constitution would arguably give him a valid excuse not to defend a law that he believes is unconstitutional. These types of questions are fairly new, and ambiguous. Last year the Yale Law Journal published a study whose title shows the complexity of the issue: "Fifty States, Fifty Attorneys General, and Fifty Approaches to the Duty To Defend." It found that these types of squabbles were almost unheard of before 2008 but have increased significantly since then. It argued that attorneys general can choose not to defend some laws. "With Democrats and Republicans squarely divided on issues like same-sex marriage, gun control, and campaign finance, we predict that attorneys general will increasingly seek political advantage by refusing to defend (or insisting on the defense of) laws that divide the parties," the law professors behind the article wrote. In 2009 the National Association of Attorneys General asked Jim Tierney – a law professor, former Maine attorney general and expert on the office – to lead a discussion about whether attorneys general should defend the constitutionality of laws and actions they believe to be unconstitutional. "Basically, when is it okay for an attorney general to lie to the public?" Tierney asked the crowd at the meeting. He later answered his own question: "The courts generally support broad discretion for attorneys general … stating that the real client of the attorney general is the people of the state." Nearly 30 years ago, former N.C. Attorney General Lacy Thornburg made a similar argument in a law review article, writing that the office's chief duty is to the people, not the government. Wallace, the constitutional law professor, said he thinks an attorney general must believe in good faith that a law is unconstitutional in order not to defend it. "By a ‘good faith’ belief in the law’s unconstitutionality, I do not mean mere disagreement with the law because it’s bad policy in the AG’s view or because recusing would give the AG a political advantage in an upcoming political campaign," Wallace said. Our ruling Berger said that by not defending HB2 in court, Cooper "refuses to do his job" as attorney general. State law does say Cooper's job includes the duty to to defend the state in court. However, that’s not the end of the debate. Cooper has other possibly conflicting duties. And legal scholars tend to side with Cooper's argument that attorneys general don’t always have to defend laws – especially ones they believe to be unconstitutional. However, the issue is a new one in North Carolina, and the law is still relatively unsettled. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Phil Berger	None	None	None	2016-04-07T18:53:17	2016-03-31	['None']
pomt-13337	Says Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine "want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/05/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-hillary-clinton-want-turn-obamacar/	Republican Mike Pence warned during the Oct. 4 vice presidential debate that the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, is only going to get bigger if Democrat Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, are elected Nov. 8. "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare," Pence said. "They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start." Converting Obamacare to a single-payer program would make it, like Medicare, a federal health insurance program run by the federal government. Currently, Obamacare promotes policies supplied by private insurance companies. Some Democrats — including, at one time, Barack Obama — pushed for a single-payer system comparable with what other developed countries have. But that turned out to be politically untenable. The result was the Obamacare patchwork of different commercial insurance plans offered in "marketplaces" by individual states and the federal government. We contacted the Donald Trump campaign seeking evidence that Clinton and Kaine, in fact, wanted to convert Obamacare into a national health insurance system. Spokesman Dan Kowalski pointed us to the health care page on Clinton's website. It indicates "that she supports a 'public option' for Obamacare," Kowalski said. "A 'public option' is a single-payer-like option for health care delivery." Clinton's website does, indeed, say that she wants a public option. But that would be just one option. Under a single-payer system, the government provides health care for everyone. Clinton's web page makes it clear that there would be other payers as well. Clinton has consistently said she wants to protect Obamacare from being repealed by the Republicans — and Trump — and expand it by protecting consumers from rising health care costs. Her expansion would include tax credits, eliminating the out-of-network hospital charges many plans levy, and reducing prescription drug costs by removing the ban that prevents the federal government from negotiating drug prices and allowing Americans to important their drugs from countries where the prices are dramatically lower. Other parts of her proposal were outlined in a 1,500-word commentary in the Sept. 28 New England Journal of Medicine. Trump declined to submit details on his plans. We asked the Trump campaign if they had seen any statements from Clinton or Kaine indicating that converting Obamacare into a single-payer system was their eventual goal. Kowalski responded that "Hillary has committed fully to the public option," and as evidence he directed us to comments Clinton made in 1994 when she was first lady. At the time, she predicted that if Congress didn't pass health care reform soon, "I believe, and I may be totally off base on this, but I believe that by the year 2000 we will have a single-payer system. I don’t think it’s — I don’t even think it’s a close call politically." She earns no Nostradamus points for that one. More to the point, later in her answer Clinton says there are three ways to get universal health coverage, only one of which is a single-payer system. The other two: an employer mandate or an individual mandate, which is how Obamacare works. Our ruling Pence said Clinton and Kaine "want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program," suggesting that they have proposed such a change. They have not. They have promoted a public option, which would be a government-sponsored insurance plan. A lot of Democrats, such as Bernie Sanders, would like to go in that direction. But throughout the current campaign, Clinton has consistently resisted that suggestion, saying she would work to prevent the repeal of Obamacare and try to improve on it. No one would be surprised if Clinton pushed for single payer if it became politically practical, but none of her campaign statements are calling for that.

pomt-01417	Leticia Van de Putte "opposed putting National Guard troops on the border, would send millions to Central American governments instead and wrote the law giving in-state tuition to illegal immigrants."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/oct/08/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-errs-leticia-van-de-putte-positions-/	Republican Dan Patrick, vowing to make border security his priority, says his Democratic opponent for lieutenant governor has been hiding her "failed record on illegal immigration." In a TV ad shared by the Houston state senator on Facebook Oct. 8, 2014, the narrator says: "Leticia Van de Putte," a San Antonio state senator, "opposed putting National Guard troops on the border, would send millions to Central American governments instead and wrote the law giving in-state tuition to illegal immigrants." A note: Patrick’s ad opened with his declaration that Islamic State group "terrorists threaten to cross our border and kill Americans." In September 2014, PolitiFact looked into a similar claim, concluding it’s highly unlikely that ISIS would operate in Mexico and stage an attack that involves crossing the border. But for this article, we focused on Patrick’s three charges about his opponent, finding two of them solid and the third a bit of a twist. Let’s take them one by one. Troops on the border As the ad says in type displayed on screen, Van de Putte said in a July 21, 2014, campaign press release that Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s decision to dispatch up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the border was the "wrong way to go." In her release, she said a better approach would be to provide local and state law enforcement agencies with resources they request and need. Van de Putte, referring to the uptick in unaccompanied children crossing the Rio Grande, conceded National Guard members are prepared for many missions. "But to strictly militarize the border won’t help us meet this unique humanitarian challenge," she said. So, the Democrat opposed the troop deployment. In-state tuition for undocumented immigrants Van de Putte also played a major role in presenting the 2001 legislation affording in-state college tuition rates to some immigrants unauthorized to live in the U.S., though contrary to Patrick’s ad, Van de Putte wasn’t the proposal’s author -- as in original sponsor. The lead author was then-Rep. Ric Noriega, D-Houston. She was darned close, however, by serving as the Senate sponsor of the House-approved proposal that came to the Senate before later making it to Perry to be signed into law, legislative records show; indeed, no other senators co-sponsored the act. Under the law, which Perry has long defended, children of Texas residents who entered the country without legal permission may qualify for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. In the 2001 legislative session, Perry has accurately said, very few legislators opposed the action. Millions to Central America And what of Patrick’s third dart -- that Van de Putte favors sending government aid to countries in Central America instead of putting Texas troops on the border? Patrick’s ad lists a June 14, 2014, news report by KGBT-TV, Channel 4 in Harlingen, as his basis for the government-aid claim. We watched the report and read a story posted with the station’s news video and didn’t notice Van de Putte directly saying she would prefer to send millions of dollars to such countries. According to the news report, Van de Putte told a station reporter after visiting a U.S. Border Patrol facility in Brownsville holding thousands of mothers and children that it’s time for Congress to embark on immigration reform. According to the station’s online write-up, Van de Putte also asked Congress to strongly consider accepting President Barack Obama’s $3.7 billion request to deal with the border crisis (though this described message for Congress wasn’t part of KGBT-TV’s video report). With a nudge from Alejandro Garcia, Patrick’s campaign spokesman, we spotted references to Obama’s proposal touching on money for border security and other needs in countries in Central America. When Obama unsuccessfully sought the $3.7 billion in July 2014, he said the government needed the spending to pay for new detention facilities to house the additional border-crossers coming from Central America and to conduct more aerial surveillance and hire immigration judges and Border Patrol agents. The Central America angle: Garcia pointed out a July 2014 breakdown of Obama’s $3.7 billion request by USA Today stating $295 million of his requested aid would go to the State Department and other international programs to "support efforts to repatriate and reintegrate migrants to Central America, to help regional governments better control their borders and to address the underlying root causes driving migration, i.e. creating the economic, social, governance and citizen security conditions. Beyond initial assistance, continued funding for repatriation and reintegration activities will be contingent on sustained progress and cooperation by the Central American countries," the paper said. We saw the same dollar figure and explanation in a July 8, 2014, White House "fact sheet." Then again, Patrick’s camp didn’t provide nor did we spot evidence Van de Putte said that instead of Texas paying to station troops near the Texas-Mexico border, state dollars should go to countries in Central America. It’s worth noting, too, that she talked up Obama’s $3.7 billion request about five weeks before Perry revealed he was considering dispatching troops to the border. Perry issued the deployment order July 21, 2014. Our ruling Patrick said Van de Putte "opposed putting National Guard troops on the border, would send millions to Central American governments instead and wrote the law giving in-state tuition to illegal immigrants." Van de Putte was the Senate sponsor of the House-originated 2001 proposal authorizing in-state tuition for immigrants not living here with legal permission. She also opposed this summer's National Guard deployment. However, she didn’t say that instead of placing troops near the border, the state should aid countries in Central America. Rather, Van de Putte earlier and separately urged congressional approval of an Obama request that included federal aid to such countries. Suggesting she conflated spending on the Texas troops with the sought federal funding amounts to a misleading stretch. On balance, we rate Patrick's statement Half True.

pomt-10892	"Tommy Thompson is the father of welfare reform, creating the groundbreaking Wisconsin Works program in Wisconsin that became the model for national and international reforms."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/jun/01/tommy-thompson/thompson-was-a-leader-in-welfare-reform/	While it is certainly risky to claim fatherhood of a major policy initiative, there is agreement across a spectrum of political thought that indeed, Thompson was there for the birth, and even for the 2 a.m. feedings. Former U.S. Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fort Lauderdale, said, "Among the governors, he certainly can take that position. He was more or less the quarterback." Ron Haskins, Senior Fellow, Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, agrees the claim is fair. "In terms of ideas for welfare reform and demonstrating it could work – as political claims go -- it makes sense for Tommy Thompson to make this claim. The role Thompson played at every stage was substantial." Lawrence Mead, professor of Politics at New York University, and the author of a book on the first "welfare to work" program in the U.S., "Government Matters: Welfare Reform in Wisconsin," agrees "those are fair statements. He didn't do it single-handedly, but he was the crucial, most important single leader." In 2004, Mead told a conference on welfare reform at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research "Wisconsin took the idea (of welfare to work) to extremes not seen anywhere else in the country. Wisconsin Works, the eventual system that it implemented, is the most radical reform in the country…and is a triumph of government."

pomt-07722	Says many local governments in Wisconsin already require employees to pay 20 percent, 30 percent or even 40 percent of their health insurance premiums.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/03/jennifer-shilling/wisconsin-rep-jennifer-shilling-says-many-local-go/	It’s hard to imagine any group of public employees in Wisconsin having a sweeter deal on health insurance costs than city employees in Madison. Most make no payment toward their insurance premiums and are in plans that require no co-pays and have no deductibles. So Madison wasn’t cited by state Rep. Jennifer Shilling (D-La Crosse) when she blistered Gov. Scott Walker’s controversial budget-repair bill. The measure would require workers to pay more of the costs of pensions and health care, effectively forcing them to take a pay cut. One of Walker’s justifications for trying to sharply curtail public sector collective bargaining rights in the process is to give local units of government the same opportunity to impose similar costs on their employees. In turn, that money could be used to offset reductions in state aid in the two-year budget starting July 1, 2011. Walker has said state employees should pay 12.6 percent of their health insurance premiums. Shilling called Walker’s argument false and "ridiculous" because, she said, many local government already get more than that from employees. "The truth is, local school districts and municipalities that have been requiring employees to pay for health and pension benefit costs are going to be hit hard by Walker’s cuts," Shilling, a member of the Legislature’s budget-reviewing Joint Finance Committee, said in a Feb. 27, 2011 news release. She added: "Walker claims municipalities will be able to force employees to pay 12 percent of their health insurance premiums, but many cities already require employees to pay 20, 30, or even 40 percent of their health insurance premiums." Now, that’s a big number and, potentially, a big development. We’re going to tackle Schilling’s statement with this caveat: We’re not looking in this item at the assumptions Walker and his budget crunchers used to calculate the prospective savings for local government. We’re looking at whether many school districts and cities already make employees pay between 20 percent and 40 percent of health care costs. We asked Shilling for backup on her claim. Her legislative aide, Anthony Palese, pointed us to a survey of school district cost-sharing on health insurance, conducted annually by the Wisconsin Association of School Boards. That annual survey showed that only 6 of the 130 school districts that responded are asking for more than 12 percent in premiums on family coverage. The average: 4 percent. Only one district, Abbotsford, fell into the 20 percent to 40 percent range that Shilling claims is common -- the district asks 46 percent of employees on family plans. The district pays more in salaries than nearby districts, said district administrator Reed Welsh. But the current year data is not complete, in part because many contracts are still unsettled. So let’s take a look back to the previous year’s survey. In the 2009-10 survey, the schools association found that out of 388 districts, the average ask from employees was 5 percent. Only 14 districts were getting more than the 12 percent benchmark set by the governor. Only five of the 388 fell into the wider range -- 20 percent to 40 percent -- that Shilling outlined. We noticed a possible explanation for Shilling’s belief that "many" local units were already getting more than that 12 percent: there were two school districts in western Wisconsin -- Onalaska and Holmen -- that got 20 percent from employees in 2009-’10. The city of Onalaska also receives 20 percent from its employees. Both communities are near La Crosse and Shilling’s district. So her perspective on it may be skewed. In her statement, Shilling also referred to "municipalities" already charging employees similar amounts. There is no equivalent annual survey of cities, and Shilling’s staff could point to none asking 20 to 40 percent, as contended. We sampled a few big cities. Madison: The city’s no-cost insurance option, selected by most full-time union workers there, is one end of the scale -- and nowhere near 20 percent to 40 percent. La Crosse: City workers in the family plan pay 3.1 percent if they undergo a health assessment, which almost all do. Single people pay about 12 percent. Milwaukee: City workers -- union or nonunion -- pay 3 percent to 8 percent in the family plan if they do the wellness tests. Wausau: Workers pay 10 percent with a co-pay only for emergency room visits. That 10 percent in Wausau is pretty typical, according to the labor union that represents municipal employees in nearly 600 bargaining units across Wisconsin. Most full-time employees in those locales now pay about 10 percent of their premiums, up significantly in the last decade, said Jack Bernfeld, associate director, AFSCME Wisconsin Council 40. So, what’s the bottom line? Shilling contended that Walker was misguided in claiming that communities had a lot of room for savings by getting employees to kick in more of health insurance costs because "many" already get double or even triple what Walker is asking. But the school data she points to shows that’s true in only a tiny scattering of districts. In cities, 10 percent is typical, and Shilling could name only one city in the 20 to 40 percent range. We rate Shilling’s statement False.	None	Jennifer Shilling	None	None	None	2011-03-03T12:04:11	2011-02-27	['Wisconsin']

pomt-05676	The Wisconsin state Assembly chambers extend to the bathroom and the parlor, and rules allow members to vote for each other if the member is in the chambers.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/15/joel-kleefisch/wisconsin-rep-joel-kleefisch-says-he-didnt-break-a/	The unidentified person with the camera phone recording the state Assembly proceedings Feb. 21, 2012, thought he scored a coup -- a chance to show the public images of lawmakers breaking chamber rules and engaging in outright hypocrisy. The shooter saw a vote being taken and state Rep. Joel Kleefisch, R-Oconomowoc, stand up, reach over and press a button on his neighbor’s desk to vote on his behalf. Kleefisch then moved to the next desk and hit that missing member’s button as well. Counting his own vote, Kleefisch voted three times. When the video hit the Internet, it promptly drew squeals of hypocrisy. After all, Kleefisch -- who is married to Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch -- joined Republicans to pass a new photo ID law for voting while arguing the change was needed to prevent election fraud. The day after the video was made, WTMJ-TV aired an "I-Team" report that included the cell phone multiple-vote footage. Asked if he had broken chamber rules, Kleefisch defended his actions. "It depends on how you interpret the rule," he said. "The rule says you have to be present in the chamber. The bathroom counts as the chamber. And the parlor counts as the chamber if you are grabbing something to eat." Ultimately cable TV talk show host Keith Olbermann branded Kleefisch his "Worst Person in the World" for Feb. 23, 2012. That has to sting. But is Kleefisch actually right? Are Assembly members really considered in the chambers when they are, um, on the chamber pot? And can members vote for colleagues who are in the chamber and not at their desk? We emailed and left voicemail for Kleefisch to ask him to elaborate on his claim. He did not respond before this item was completed. So we went to the rule book, and consulted with a couple of experts, including those in charge of running the Assembly. Turns out, the chamber is more than the room itself. The written rules define the chamber as: "The entire area west of the easternmost doors of the Assembly, including the visitor's galleries, lobbies, offices of the speaker, majority leader, and minority leader, and hallways." The rules also say: "Only the members present in the Assembly chamber may vote." So what about the practice of voting for your neighbor? Turns out, it’s done all of the time. That’s not in the formal rules, as Kleefisch indicated. But, like many legislative bodies, there are informal yet powerful rules of courtesy and tradition. And that’s where the claim by Kleefisch needs some additional explanation. "Traditionally, we’ve done it as a courtesy," said state Rep. Bill Kramer, R-Waukesha, the Assembly Speaker pro tem, whose job it is to maintain order, handling votes cast by 99 people and generally keeping business moving along during floor sessions. "Otherwise, we’d be breaking down every time we had a vote." Indeed, he said it’s very rare that everybody present is in their seats to vote. "It’s less than 10 to 20 percent of the time that everybody votes for themselves," said Kramer. Only in rare instances is there a vote where each member’s name is called. More commonly, a vote is "open" for a short window, during which times members press their buttons. and their votes are tallied on a large scoreboard. On a day when the Assembly has a lot of business to conduct, votes can begin and end in a minute or less. Strict enforcement of the "present in chambers" rule could dramatically slow down the voting process or result in many members not voting. Sometimes the proxy voting can backfire. That happened to state Rep. Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, on the same day Kleefisch was caught voting three times. State Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, voted on behalf of Barca against a measure regarding penalties for aiding a felon. But Barca wanted to be a "yes" vote, so when he returned to the floor he asked for -- and was granted permission -- to have his vote recorded as a "yes." Where was Barca when Pasch stepped in? "He was in here," in his office, said aide Rich Judge. And "here" means in the chambers, because Barca is the minority leader and his office is among those included in the formal definition. A total of seven requests for corrected votes were made by Assembly members on the day in question, Feb. 21, 2012. Business began about 11 a.m., and then there was a recess from 12:30 p.m. to 4:45 p.m. Dozens of matters were then taken up in a session that lasted until 10:58 p.m., and there were more than three dozen votes taken. From the video, it appears that Kleefisch voted for his neighbors, Rep. Paul Farrow, R-Pewaukee, and Rep. Dean Knudson, R-Hudson, who, according to the Assembly seating chart, are assigned to the desks next to Kleefisch. Neither Farrow nor Knudson returned a telephone message to discuss their whereabouts during the vote. There’s no indication of what matter was being voted upon. So voting on behalf of another member is a routine practice by members of both parties. In fact, members sometimes press the button for a colleague not even in the building. This is done as the chamber is called to order and attendance taken -- which is, strictly speaking, not a vote but attendance. "It was not uncommon to see one or two people punch 30 buttons," said Stephen Freese, a Republican who served 12 years as speaker pro tem until 2006. Why? The Assembly’s business day often begins with routine, procedural matters and special recognitions. Then there is a recess so the two parties can caucus and get their issues and votes lined up for the day. It may be hours before the body reconvenes for the real action. In some cases, Freese said, an Assembly member might be coming from a great distance. So rather than leaving in the middle of the night to make the opening gavel, the member skips the procedural stuff but is there for the caucus and voting. Colleagues cover for him by registering him present. Such votes usually are cast by another member of the tardy member’s party. But not always. Said Freese: "I’ve seen that, in the case of close friendships that have developed, a Republican will vote for a Democrat and a Democrat vote as a Republican," Our conclusion Caught on video voting for his neighbors, Kleefisch claimed he didn’t break Assembly rules. The chambers, he said, extend beyond the floor, and include hallways, a parlor and the bathroom. He’s correct, but that’s only part of the story. As Kleefisch said, "It depends on how you interpret the rule." The rules are clear on what is the chamber, but don’t specifically allow the vote-for-your neighbor approach. However, that is the longstanding, informal tradition of the body. We rate Kleefisch’s claim Mostly True.	None	Joel Kleefisch	None	None	None	2012-03-15T09:00:00	2012-02-22	['None']
pomt-07363	"We have the highest corporate income tax in the world right now."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/06/gary-johnson/gary-johnson-says-us-has-highest-corporate-income-/	If there’s one issue that binds Republicans, it’s a preference for low taxes. So it’s no surprise that in the first debate of the 2012 presidential campaign -- held May 5, 2011, in Greenville, S.C. -- the topic came up. At one point, Fox News commentator Juan Williams asked Gary Johnson -- the former Republican governor of New Mexico and a strong libertarian -- about corporate taxation. "Gov. Johnson," Williams said, "the nation's unemployment rate is 8.8 percent and this week, jobless claims rose to their highest level in eight months. Among your proposals for getting the private sector to start hiring are eliminating corporate income tax, doing away with the federal minimum wage law and to stop extending unemployment benefits. Isn't that just a windfall for big business?" Johnson responded, "Well, absolutely not. I think that repealing, or doing away with the corporate income tax is simply getting us back to where we were. And we need to understand that the corporate income tax is a double tax -- that we all own the corporations, and when income gets distributed to us, we pay the tax on that. So, we have the highest corporate income tax in the world right now. Let's abolish it." We have looked at the question of whether the United States has "the highest corporate income tax in the world" in previous items, so we thought we’d revisit it now. There are two primary ways to compare corporate tax burdens. One is to compare statutory corporate tax rate -- the rate that’s actually on the books. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of more than two-dozen large, industrialized democracies, publishes the rates of its member countries. The most recent data shows Japan on top at 39.54 percent, vs. 39.21 percent for the United States. Japan had been scheduled to cut its corporate tax rate to a level below the United States, but the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster that crippled portions of the country earlier this year has left that in doubt. The other way to look at it is to gauge what firms actually pay, once exclusions and other adjustments are taken into account. This is called the "effective" tax rate. The World Bank has assembled data from 183 nations and made a series of statistical adjustments to produce a full international comparison of effective tax rates. By this measurement, the U.S. rate is considerably lower than the published rate -- 27.6 percent. But in a comparative sense, that's still pretty high: Among larger international economies, only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand imposed a higher effective rate, according to the World Bank study. The World Bank also produces another -- and broader -- statistic. It factors in not only the corporate profit tax but also a range of other taxes paid by businesses, including the cost of employee taxes borne by the employer. When the World Bank ranked countries from the lowest level of taxes to the highest, the U.S. ranked 124th out of 183 -- meaning corporate taxes were relatively high. A number of other large and/or democratic countries were higher, including Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Spain and Sweden. This last measure provides a wider snapshot of U.S. tax policy toward businesses, but it also introduces some complications. Factoring in the employer-paid portion of labor taxes makes the corporate tax rate seem higher in countries that provide higher benefits such as pensions or health care through business taxes, while making the rate seem lower for countries that provide less generous benefits through the tax code. So making apples-to-apples comparisons can be tricky. There's also broader context that Johnson doesn't get into. In a previous item, we noted that when all taxes, including those such as personal income taxes and property taxes -- not just corporate taxes -- are taken into account and compared to gross domestic product, the U.S. doesn't rank near the top of the OECD table in total tax burden. Still, Johnson’s claim was more limited, addressing only corporate taxation. To be more accurate, Johnson should have said the United States has the highest "corporate tax rate" rather than the highest "corporate taxes." By using the term "corporate taxes," Johnson opens the door to the broader World Bank figure, which would put a number of other major countries above the U.S. in the rankings. That way of looking at it would undercut Johnson’s argument. On the other hand, he is close to correct when using the two more common benchmarks -- statutory tax rates (in which the U.S. trails only Japan, for now) and effective rates (where the U.S. trails only Japan, New Zealand and Thailand). On balance, we rate Johnson’s statement Mostly True.	None	Gary Johnson	None	None	None	2011-05-06T12:20:51	2011-05-05	['None']
pomt-03894	New Hampshire is currently the only state in the nation that does not have a full-service veterans hospital or equivalent access.	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/mar/04/carol-shea-porter/us-rep-carol-shea-porter-claims-nh-only-state-with/	U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, D-N.H. has reinvigorated efforts to increase veterans’ access to health care in the Granite State -- and has repeated a familiar claim in the process. In a press release issued in January, she reintroduced the Veterans Health Equity Act, which requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure every state has a full-service veterans hospital, or similar services through contracts with state hospitals. "New Hampshire is currently the only state in the nation that does not have a full-service veterans hospital or equivalent access," Shea-Porter said in a press release Jan. 16. New Hampshire residents, and veterans, have heard this several times in recent years. U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster, D-NH mouthed the same claim in January as a cosponsor to Shea-Porter’s bill. And U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. and Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. have each shared the same point before in support of similar legislation. But to determine what is a "full-service" veterans hospital and whether New Hampshire really is the only state without one, we decided to consult our Truth-o-Meter. First, we contacted Shea-Porter’s staff for some answers. They said three states in the country do not have a full-service VA hospital: Hawaii, Alaska and New Hampshire. "Alaska and Hawaii both have Tricare military hospitals," which veterans can access, said Shea-Porter’s chief of staff, Naomi Andrews, in an email. "New Hampshire alone has no VA or Tricare full service hospital." Bringing more veteran’s health care to the Granite State has been a bipartisan issue for about a decade. Andrews also pointed to statements by Shaheen and former U.S. Rep Charlie Bass, R-N.H., saying the same thing to validate the claim. Ever since New Hampshire’s VA Medical Center in Manchester was downsized more than 10 years ago due to financial reasons, several members of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation have offered bills similar to Shea-Porter’s. In 2009, Shaheen filed similar legislation with her own Veterans Health Equity Act in the Senate as Shea-Porter authored the companion bill in the House. Neither bill went anywhere during the 111th Congress and each drew just one co-sponsor (Sen. Judd Gregg in the Senate; Rep. Paul Hodes in the House), never emerging from their respective committees. In 2011, Shaheen and Ayotte introduced the Veterans Health Equity Act of 2011, which then-U.S. Reps. Bass and Frank Guinta, R-NH, co-sponsored, and now it has been reintroduced in 2013. Manchester VAMC lost its "full-service" designation after an assessment by the U.S. Office of the Inspector General in 2000. At the time, it was a 28-bed primary and secondary care facility that employed roughly 500 people, operated on a $41.8 million budget and was providing care to more than 15,000 veterans. Today, the Manchester’s VA Medical Center provides urgent care, primary care, ambulatory surgery, specialty clinics, mental health, hospital based home care, community acute care and long term care services to veterans, according to its website. Since then, New Hampshire veterans had to travel to Boston or White River Junction, Vt., for emergency care they used to be able to get closer to home. In 2009, VA officials opted to outsource some medical services by contracting with Concord Hospital and other care providers, rather than open a VA hospital in Manchester, calling Concord Hospital a "centrally located regional medical center that offers traditional acute care services in 42 medical specialties."It also upgraded mental health facilities at the VAMC Manchester. A press release on the partnership said it allowed the VA to provide coordinated care and services "equivalent to a general medical and surgical hospital locally within New Hampshire." So does this constitute a full-service equivalent contrary to Shea-Porter’s assertion? The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs says there is no industry-wide definition of a "full-service" hospital; even "highly tertiary" private sector hospitals don’t provide all health services. In the veterans health administration, a medical center, by policy definition, is a site that offers acute inpatient services and at least one additional service such as outpatient care, long-term care or mental health care, said Sue Hopkins, a public affairs officer with the VA’s regional office. By that measure, New Hampshire and Alaska are the only states that don’t have a true VA medical center, even though the New Hampshire facility uses "medical center" in its name, Hopkins said. Hawaii, which provides inpatient acute and inpatient psychiatric care for veterans, would be considered a VA medical center, Hopkins said. But veterans’ medical and surgical care is obtained through agreements with Tripler Army Medical Center whose staff are "closely integrated with VA clinicians." Alaska does not have a VA medical center, but has agreements for acute medical and surgical care at neighboring facilities, most of which is provided at the Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson Hospital, adjacent to a VA outpatient clinic, Hopkins said. In New Hampshire, veterans can get non-emergency care at the Manchester VA Medical Center’s urgent care facility, Hopkins said. Those who need an acute inpatient care stay for conditions like pneumonia, unstable angia, or appendicitis are typically sent to Concord Hospital or in more ‘emergent situations," Elliott Hospital or Catholic Medical Center, Hopkins said. In a medical emergency, veterans can go to the nearest healthcare facility that will provide the care needed, she added. The VA will pay for emergency care in non-VA facilities for certain service-disabled veterans or as payer of last resort under other conditions. The VA measures access by distance, not state boundaries, Hopkins said. New Hampshire veterans can access VA acute inpatient care outside the state, via: White River Junction, Vt. (0.3 miles from the state border) Bedford, Mass. (15 miles from the state border) Boston, Mass. (33 miles from the state border to West Roxbury Campus of the VA Boston Healthcare System) Togus, Maine (78 miles from the state border) In other larger states that have full service hospitals, veterans have to travel farther than veterans in New Hampshire for similar care. In South Texas, for example, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn is pushing a bill to add inpatient health care and an emergency room to a new veterans medical facility in Harlingen to serve the thousands of rural Texas veterans who have to travel more than six hours to get the care they need in San Antonio. Even in New Jersey, some veterans who need specific procedures have to spend more than four hours in a car or bus to visit VA facilities in East Orange, Philadelphia or Wilmington, Del., according to published reports. In New Hampshire, veterans in need of complex, specialized services for conditions like hip replacements, neurosurgery, or a bypass are typically sent to the VA Boston Healthcare System. According to statistics cited by The Boston Globe in 2011, one quarter of New Hampshire veterans -- 2,741 cases -- in need of acute care for issues such as heart failure, pneumonia and others were sent out of state. "While VA is working to keep more New Hampshire veterans in the state for their medical care whenever possible, admission to inpatient care is based on medical need and the clinical judgment of the VA provider," Hopkins said. Our ruling Shea-Porter wasn’t completely right to say New Hampshire is the only state without a "full-service" veterans hospital.The VA doesn’t use the definition "full service." Instead it uses the definition of a medical center, and Alaska doesn’t have one either, even though it does offer many needed medical services to veterans on base. As for "equivalent access," most New Hampshire veterans can access medical centers that will provide the services they need through contracts with non-VA, in-state hospitals, but in some cases, veterans in need of specialized services are sent to Boston. Even when New Hampshire veterans are sent out of state, they don’t have to travel as far as some veterans in larger states, like Texas. Shea Porter’s statement leaves out some important details. We give her a Half True.	None	Carol Shea-Porter	None	None	None	2013-03-04T07:46:01	2013-01-16	['None']
pomt-01823	DeKalb County has been recognized in recent years as having one the best sheriff’s departments in the nation.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/19/jeff-mann/dekalb-one-nations-best-sheriffs-offices/	The DeKalb County battle to replace Sheriff Tom Brown is a rare local political fight this year. And it cries out for fact checks. Brown stepped down in March to focus on his unsuccessful race to unseat U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson. Former DeKalb County CEO Vernon Jones and Jeff Mann, Brown’s former chief deputy who became interim sheriff last spring, beat back six other candidates in May’s nonpartisan special election. Whoever wins Tuesday will fill out Brown’s unexpired term. Jones and Mann have appeared together recently only once, in a debate taped to air at 10:30 a.m. Sunday on Georgia Public Broadcasting. Each candidate made claims about the other at the session. But Mann focused more on his tenure with Brown and their work to professionalize the department. At the GPB debate, Mann implied that DeKalb has been recognized in recent years for having one of the best sheriff’s departments in the nation. "We have received the National Sheriff’s Association Triple Crown distinction," Mann said. "We are in the top 1 percent of sheriff’s offices in this nation." Those are bold claims anywhere. But they especially set the AJC Truth-O-Meter in action given corruption investigations, indictments and convictions that ended the careers of three DeKalb sheriffs between 1972 and 2000. All that happened before Sidney Dorsey, the defeated incumbent sheriff, ordered the assassination of winning candidate Derwin Brown just days before he was to take office in 2000. The department has had no major scandals in recent years. Some observers of DeKalb’s history find that fact remarkable in itself. The National Sheriffs’ Association confirms that DeKalb did receive its Triple Crown honor in 2008 under Brown. The award recognizes those departments that have earned simultaneous accreditation from three agencies: The Commission on the Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies, which sets standards on the law enforcement function of the department whose main roles are to protect the courthouse and run the jail. The American Correctional Association's Commission on Accreditation for Corrections, which lays out policies and rules governing hiring practices and staffing in the department. The National Commission on Correctional Healthcare, which focuses on the health care aspect of running the jail. Each agency has its own standards and requires a sheriff’s office to submit files and submit to site visits to confirm compliance. Meeting the standards generally requires thousands of dollars and a significant time investment. The ACA accreditation, for instance, takes at least 18 months to complete. "To get all three is a significant accomplishment," said Fred Wilson, the NSA’s director of operations. "It shows a commitment to and an intent to achieve high standards." The NSA counts about 39,000 sheriff’s offices nationwide and lists 51 agencies that have achieved the Triple Crown. That would make DeKalb among the 1 percent to earn that honor. Wilson said DeKalb and other award winners would benefit from lower insurance costs connected to the distinction. So a focus on professionalization can minimize liability for taxpayers. But does it mean those sheriff’s offices are the best? Consider that also on the Triple Crown list is the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office, which earned the achievement in 2003 under then-Sheriff Jacqueline Barrett. But faulty jail locks, understaffing and other problems have prolonged a nearly decade-old lawsuit over jail conditions in Fulton. The litigation has cost taxpayers more than $200 million, including bills for renovations and outsourcing inmates. Being plagued with those kinds of problems can sometimes be a function of size, said Frank V. Rotondo, the executive director of the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police, which does not handle sheriffs’ standards. But for any department, earning accreditation is not a silver bullet, he added. "It certainly doesn’t mean you’ll never have problems," Rotondo said. "It really says you’ve established you will meet a very high set of standards, to try to preclude problems." That means the distinction works both ways. So Mann was accurate to claim DeKalb had achieved a rare accomplishment. That honor can have financial benefits for taxpayers but not protect them entirely from big expenses associated with improving operations. Mann’s statement certainly contains an element of truth but overstates the significance of the award. We rate Mann’s claim as Half True.

pomt-13246	"Many of (Hillary Clinton's) friends took bigger deductions (than me). Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. (George) Soros, who is a friend of hers, took a massive deduction."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/18/donald-trump/trump-base-buffett-soros-deductions/	Facing scrutiny over possibly not paying federal income tax for almost two decades, Donald Trump turned the tables on Hillary Clinton during the heated second presidential debate. The New York Times obtained a few pages of Trump’s 1995 personal tax returns, revealing a $916 million loss that would have allowed him to legally avoid paying taxes for 18 years. Trump didn’t deny this and instead claimed Clinton backers Warren Buffett and George Soros did the same to a larger extent. "Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who is a friend of hers, took a massive deduction," he said. We wondered if this was accurate. The Trump campaign did not respond to our requests for comment, but we found an instance where Trump gave exact numbers. "Soros declared $1.5 (billion) losses, $1.5 billion in just six months, and Warren Buffett declared $873 million. Ask them, did they write off those losses? Oh, I doubt it," Trump told Fox Business News on Oct. 4, 2016. While both Soros and Buffett had losses, Trump is not exactly making an apples-to-apples comparison. Buffett’s loss was claimed on his business’s tax returns, not his own. Soros’ losses are from his hedge funds, so any deductions would not be on Soros’s private tax returns. Trump, meanwhile, claimed a personal deduction. It’s unclear exactly what loss of Soros’ Trump is referring to. The Soros Fund Management lost $1.3 billion between May and August 2011. Soros’ Quantum Fund lost $2 billion in 1998. But again, deductions caused by these losses wouldn’t appear on Soros’s personal tax returns, according to Lawrence Zelenak, a Duke University law professor. Buffett’s business Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is a publicly traded company, and acts as a holding company for other businesses. In 2013, the company suffered a $873 million loss after a failed investment. The company had profits that year as well, but received a $514 million deduction in 2013, according to its annual report. In other words, the deduction was applied to the company’s taxes, not Buffett’s own taxes. Trump’s companies are his own private ventures, meaning he can claim their losses in his personal income taxes by declaring them "pass-through" income. In 1995, Trump lost $916 million, according to a report by the New York Times. The article says Trump’s loss is from three Atlantic City casinos, a failure in the airline business, and a purchase of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. The almost $1 billion loss could have allowed Trump to legally avoid paying taxes for the next 18 years through an IRS provision called a "carry-forward." A carry-forward is an income tax rule that allows a taxpayer to save an unused deduction, credit or loss, and use it in the future. Trump’s loss could have allowed him to have a $50 million per year carry-forward over 18 years. However, Eric Toder, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said it’s hard to tell exactly how Trump handled his taxes the following years without the tax returns. "We don’t know exactly what he did," Toder said. "We know he took a large loss -- unusually large." So we can’t know just how much Trump deducted without his personal tax returns (which he promised to release but has not). The same goes for Buffett’s and Soros’ personal taxes. Neither of their spokespeople got back to us, but Buffett released a statement detailing his personal taxes. In that statement, Buffett said his income was $11.6 million in 2015, and his deductions equaled $5.5 million. Buffett also said that $3.5 million of this was allowable charitable contributions, and the rest -- except for $36,037 -- was for state income taxes. Soros’s personal income taxes may have benefited from a tax rule that allows hedge fund managers and private equity executives to pay a lower income tax rate. Buffett does not run a hedge fund, and so would not have benefited from that same rule. Buffett’s low tax rate of 16 percent is because he earns the majority of his money from investments. In his statement, Buffett said he paid income tax every year since 1944, and none use a carry-forward. Our ruling Trump said, "Many of (Hillary Clinton’s) friends took bigger deductions (than me). Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who is a friend of hers, took a massive deduction." Trump’s $916 million loss could have allowed him to have a $50 million deduction each year for 18 years. As for Buffet and Soros, Trump is likely referring to a $514 million deduction Buffett’s company, not Buffett himself, took in 2013. (We’ll note that this amount is actually smaller than what Trump would have been permitted to take.) Buffett says he personally took a $5.5 million deduction. Soros manages a hedge fund.

pomt-12570	The Obama administration’s 2013 Syria proposal "had no clear objective," while Trump’s Syria strike "had a clear strategic objective."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/12/marco-rubio/trumps-strikes-syria-look-lot-obamas-2013-proposal/	It was "the right move" for President Donald Trump to launch airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack, said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on CNN April 7. But almost four years ago, Rubio opposed President Barack Obama’s plan to order airstrikes in Syria, also after dictator Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his people. Rubio explained why 2017 is different than 2013 on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos. "Here's the first thing that's changed from 2013 to now: The Russians are now there," Rubio said in an April 9 interview. "Assad was losing back in 2013. If we had armed non-jihadist elements on the ground, they could have overthrown him. That's what I thought was the better approach at the time. "The second is that the administration, what they were proposing, had no clear objective. They wanted to blow up some things to send a message. I don't think you use the U.S. military simply to send a message. This strike was limited, but it had a clear strategic objective, which was the destruction or degrading of a key airbase installation that is used in these chemical attacks." Rubio is one of several Republicans — including Trump — who have flipped from opposing post-chemical weapons airstrikes in 2013 to supporting them in 2017. Rubio has a point that the geopolitical situation in Syria has changed; Russia, Iran and the Islamic State are all bigger players in the Syrian civil war than they were three and a half years ago. But we were also interested in Rubio’s assertion that the Obama administration’s proposal, compared to Trump’s actions, didn’t have a clear objective. The argument rings hollow. Obama and his team spent several days making the case to Congress and the public that they should support military action in Syria, and the goals and plans they laid out were quite similar to the actions Trump took in 2017. We reached out to Rubio's staff for comment but didn't hear back. Making the case In August 2013, Assad’s regime killed more than 1,400 people in a chemical weapons attack on the city of Damascus. Obama wanted to strike Syria in retaliation, but he chose to ask Congress to authorize his use of military force. Obama couldn’t get enough votes to pass his proposal, so he did not order strikes fired in direct retaliation for the chemical attacks. The 2017 chemical weapons attack was much smaller, killing about 80 people. Two days later, without advance notice or requesting congressional approval, Trump launched nearly 60 cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield used to carry out the chemical weapons attacks. Because the Obama administration spent several days lobbying Congress and the public to support his proposed military action, there are numerous speeches, media interviews, documents and congressional hearings during which his team laid out the strategy. For Trump, in contrast, we have to look at what members of his administration have said to justify the airstrikes after the fact. Here are three examples each of the Obama and Trump administrations laying out their goals. Both describe sending a message to Assad that chemical weapons use is unacceptable. Both involve a targeted attack plan designed to degrade Assad’s chemical weapon capabilities by taking out related facilities and resources. If anything, the Obama White House’s objectives, as well as the scope of the operation, were more clear than Trump’s because the Obama administration had to lobby the public instead of acting unilaterally.

(Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press) • Obama’s proposal to Congress: "The objective of the United States' use of military force in connection with this authorization should be to deter, disrupt, prevent, and degrade the potential for, future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction." • Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey in a House hearing: "(Obama) has directed me to plan for a militarily significant strike that would do the following: deter the Assad regime's further use of chemical weapons and degrade the regime's military capability to employ chemical weapons in the future. We've assembled target packages in line with those objectives. We have both an initial target set and subsequent target sets should they become necessary. The planned strikes will disrupt those parts of Assad's forces directly related to the chemical attack of 21 August; degrade his means of chemical weapons delivery; and finally, degrade the assets that Assad uses to threaten his neighbors and to defend his regime. Collectively, such strikes will send Assad a deterrent message, demonstrating our ability to hold at risk the capabilities he values most and to strike again if necessary." • Secretary of State John Kerry in a Huffington Post article: "It would be a tailored action to make clear that the world will not stand by and allow the international norm against the use of chemical weapons to be violated with impunity by a brutal dictator willing to gas hundreds of children to death while they sleep. Our action would be a limited and targeted military action, against military targets in Syria, designed to deter Syria's use of chemical weapons and degrade the Assad regime's capabilities to use or transfer such weapons in the future." Trump: In this image provided by the U.S. Navy, a guided-missile destroyer launches a missile in the Mediterranean Sea, April 7, 2017. (via Associated Press) • Trump in a statement to Congress two days after the strikes: "United States intelligence indicates that Syrian military forces operating from this airfield were responsible for the chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians in southern Idlib Province, Syria, that occurred on April 4. I directed this action in order to degrade the Syrian military's ability to conduct further chemical weapons attacks and to dissuade the Syrian regime from using or proliferating chemical weapons, thereby promoting the stability of the region and averting a worsening of the region's current humanitarian catastrophe." • National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster in a press briefing: "Obviously, the regime will maintain the certain capacity to commit mass murder with chemical weapons, we think, beyond this particular airfield. But it was aimed at this particular airfield for a reason because we could trace this murderous attack back to that facility. And this was not a small strike." • Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on This Week: "The president was very clear in his message to the American people that this strike was related solely to the most recent horrific use of chemical weapons against women, children and, as the president said, even small babies. And so the strike was a message to Bashar al-Assad that your multiple violations of your agreements at the U.N., your agreements under the Chemical Weapons Charter back in 2013, that those would not go without a response in the future." Rubio himself had the opportunity to question Obama administration officials about Syria in a September 2013 Senate hearing. There, he said he was concerned that Obama’s proposed operation was too narrow to degrade Assad’s chemical weapons abilities and deter future attacks — a position that conflicts with his current stance that Obama administration’s plans weren’t focused enough. "Quite frankly, I'm a bit skeptical that the act, that what the president is asking for will provide the support needed to achieve these objectives and that these objectives are even realistic at this point," Rubio said. "It leads me to my second question: How confident are you, and how confident can you express to this committee, you are that we can, in fact, put in place a military plan that's limited in scope and duration, that can effectively degrade Assad's capability to carry out future chemical attacks?" Dempsey replied, "I'm confident in the capabilities we can bring to bear to deter and degrade. And it won't surprise you to know that we will have not only an initial target set, but subsequent target sets should they become necessary." Philip Gordon, who was the White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf Region from 2013 to 2015, told PolitiFact that he doesn’t see any material difference between the Trump administration’s actions in 2017 and Obama’s proposed actions in 2013 that could lead a politician to change their position, other than political calculation. Yes, the dynamics of the Syrian civil war have changed, in that Russia, Iran and ISIS now play larger roles, Gordon said, "But none of those are relevant to the core question at hand: Is this strike capable of deterring chemical weapons? That’s the stated goal of both presidents." Our ruling Rubio said the Obama administration’s 2013 Syria airstrike proposal "had no clear objective," while Trump’s Syria strike "had a clear strategic objective." In 2013 Obama’s team made their goals clear through a days-long lobbying effort: to degrade Assad’s chemical weapons abilities and deter future attacks through targeted military strikes on facilities and resources related to the attack. Trump in 2017, conversely, didn’t lobby Congress and the public because he launched his strike unilaterally. After the strike, his team said the action was designed to degrade a facility related to the chemical weapons attack and send a message that the United States doesn’t tolerate chemical weapons use. There is little material difference between what Obama planned to do and what Trump actually did, in terms of goals and scope. We rate Rubio’s claim False.

pomt-14804	"Illegal immigrants mow the grass around the (Texas) Capitol."	false	/texas/statements/2015/nov/27/facebook-posts/facebook-comment-says-illegal-immigrants-mow-texas/	Commenting on Gov. Greg Abbott pressing sheriffs to detain individuals living in the country without legal authorization, a reader brought up workers who groom the grounds of the Texas Capitol. "Illegal immigrants mow the grass around the Capitol," said a Facebook comment posted Nov. 10, 2015, in reaction to the Austin American-Statesman’s summary of the paper’s Nov. 5, 2015, news story about Abbott telling Texas sheriffs he might withhold criminal justice grant aid if they don’t fully comply with federal requests for detaining "criminal immigrants" held in their jails. The newspaper published that comment, among others, prompting us to wonder: Do undocumented workers really mow the Capitol lawn? We attempted to reach the commenter to see how he reached his conclusion and didn’t hear back. Nationally, according to a July 2015 web post by the Pew Research Center, undocumented immigrants make up 5.1 percent of the nation’s labor force. "In the U.S. labor force," the post says, "there were 8.1 million unauthorized immigrants either working or looking for work in 2012. Among the states, Nevada (10%), California (9%), Texas (9%) and New Jersey (8%) had the highest shares of unauthorized immigrants in their labor forces. Closer to home, we reached the State Preservation Board, which manages the Capitol and nearby state facilities. By email, spokesman Chris Currens said the board contracts with a private company to care for the grounds and that company is required to use the online federal E-Verify system, authorized by Congress in 1996, which enables users to determine whether employees are citizens or have a required visa to work legally here. "In short," the government says, "employers submit information taken from a new hire's Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification Form) through E-Verify to the Social Security Administration and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to determine whether the information matches government records and whether the new hire is authorized to work in the United States." U.S. employers submit the Form I-9 for each employee; on the form, an employee must attest to his or her employment authorization. In addition, a government summary says, the employee must present his or her employer with "acceptable documents" showing who they are and that they’re eligible to work in the country. Documents that fit the description, according to the form, include passports and permanent resident or alien registration cards. A note: E-Verify may be a flawed method of weeding out ineligible workers. In a July 2015 report, the Cato Institute pointed out that a government-commissioned analysis estimated that 54 percent of "unauthorized workers submitted to E-Verify were incorrectly found to be work authorized because of rampant document fraud." The cited Westat report, published in 2009, elaborated: "This finding is not surprising, given that since the inception of E-Verify it has been clear that many unauthorized workers obtain employment by committing identity fraud that cannot be detected by E-Verify." An upshot, Alex Nowrasteh of Cato told us by phone, is that "even if" workers "cleared E-Verify, that doesn’t mean they’re legal." Back to Texas: In December 2014, then-Gov. Rick Perry ordered agencies to use E-Verify. Perry told reporters then that 17 agencies already employed the system. Currens told us the State Preservation Board initially placed a clause requiring contractors to use E-Verify in April 2009 and grounds contracts have included the clause ever since. Also, Currens noted, each contract requires the contractor to certify that each employee is in compliance with federal immigration laws. The current Capitol groundskeeping contract, which is with Clean Scapes, an Austin company, requires the contractor to subject employees to pre-employment and annual criminal background checks. The company also must obtain photocopies of the worker’s driver’s license or state-issued photo identification and Social Security card or Resident Alien work visa/identification card. And the company "must provide documentation showing that this request has been met for all employees working" on preservation-board-overseen properties. We asked the agency for the latest documentation. By email, Currens sent an undated notice to the board from Marilu Sanchez, a Clean Scapes human resources specialist, stating the company had run E-Verify for six employees, each one listed by name. Currens said the notice was submitted to cover the workers at the Capitol in the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2015. By phone, Carmen Zayas, a Clean Scapes vice president, said the landscaping company has long checked all its workers through the E-Verify system. "People are always going to make assumptions about the landscaping industry" employing immigrants without legal permission to live here, Zayas said. "We take that process as seriously as anyone can." By email, Currens told us the board "is confident that the groundskeeping workers have proper legal status." Our ruling A Facebook comment published in the American-Statesman said: "Illegal immigrants mow the grass around the (Texas) Capitol." If so, such immigrants have fooled the federal E-Verify system and the agency that oversees the Capitol grounds. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-02799	"We’re the Sunshine State, and we’re hardly doing any solar energy production."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/dec/03/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-florida-sunshine-state-were-har/	As he gears up to run against Republican Gov. Rick Scott, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist is making an issue of renewable energy. On the Nov. 18, 2013, edition of MSNBC’s The Ed Show, Crist touted alternative energy as a way to attract new industries and new jobs to Florida. "We’re the Sunshine State, and we’re hardly doing any solar energy production," Crist told host Ed Schultz. "We should be the global leader in solar energy." Crist later told PolitiFact that Florida Power & Light has a "pretty significant solar field," but added that "we can be doing so much more, in my humble opinion. ... My understanding is that many other states encourage the use of solar energy much more than Florida" does. After looking at Crist’s claim, we concluded that he has a valid point. One key way to look at the question is to measure installed solar capacity -- that is, the electricity-generating potential of installed solar equipment, including everything from a few solar panels on top of a home to an array of thousands of solar panels in the desert. As of June 2013, California leads the nation with 3,761 megawatts of installed solar capacity. Arizona comes in second with 1,250 megawatts. New Jersey, which isn’t exactly known for its sunny skies but where roof-mounted units have proven popular, ranks third with 1,119 megawatts. Florida, by contrast, has 202 megawatts, making it No. 10 in the nation. This might sound pretty good, but it’s well below the state’s potential. Florida actually ranks third in the country for solar potential. Yet its installed capacity trails such smaller and less-sunny states as North Carolina, Massachusetts, Hawaii and Pennsylvania. "Relatively speaking, Florida is doing little to no solar," said Jim Fenton, director of the Florida Solar Energy Center at the University of Central Florida. Another measurement is what goals a state is setting. Twenty-nine states, plus Washington, D.C., and two territories, have a renewable portfolio standard policy -- utilities risk being fined if they don’t fulfill a certain percentage of a state’s energy needs through renewables such as solar or wind. Another eight states and two territories have less formal renewable energy goals. Another 13 states have neither -- and Florida is one of them. As it happens, when Crist was governor, he directed the Florida Public Service Commission to develop a state renewable portfolio standard policy, with a goal of 20 percent renewable energy production by 2020. The PSC did approve a draft of the plan in 2009, and it was submitted to the Florida Legislature for consideration. But the Legislature didn’t approve it, so it never went into effect. There's another hurdle. Under Florida law, only a few utilities -- Florida Power & Light, Duke Energy and Tampa Electric -- can sell power directly to consumers. If a solar power generator wants to get into the state market, it must first sell to one of those utilities at cheaper wholesale rate. This undercuts the economic incentives to invest in solar, especially given the prevailing price of power in the state. "Electricity rates have been relatively low in Florida so that’s the main reason why we haven’t done much here," Fenton said, adding that the cost of solar energy systems has dropped by 40-50 percent since 2009. "Alternative energy will always be an alternative until it’s cheaper. It’s cheaper in New Jersey. It’s not cheaper in Florida -- yet." In fact, to the extent that Florida has put solar capacity into use, most of it occurred when Crist was governor. In 2008, during Crist’s tenure, the state Legislature passed a renewable energy law that allowed utilities to build solar or wind projects generating up to 110 megawatts of energy without going through the normal regulatory review process. Florida Power & Light secured the entire amount, used in three installations. The FPL plants now account for more than half the state’s solar output. FPL spokesman Erik Hofmeyer said solar power is part of the utility’s overall energy mix and the utility "is looking at more solar opportunities." Still, considering the amount and intensity of sunlight hitting the ground in Florida, the amount of energy being produced is relatively small. "Florida is in the dark ages, and we lag behind many, many other states that have goals and incentives and other policy mechanisms to promote and advance clean, renewable solar energy," said Wayne Wallace, president of the Florida Solar Energy Industries Association. Our ruling Crist said that Florida is the "Sunshine State, and we’re hardly doing any solar energy production." On the one hand, Florida ranks in the top 10 states nationally for installed solar energy capacity. On the other hand, given how much sun Florida gets, it is something of an underperformer nationally, and its policies -- a lack of a renewable portfolio standard and the existence of strict laws governing electricity sales -- pose challenges to future development of the state’s solar resources.

pomt-14148	China is "going to have twice the number of submarines we have in just over a decade."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/may/02/randy-forbes/forbes-says-chinas-submarine-fleet-will-double-uni/	U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes says the Navy’s periscope is focusing far across the Pacific Ocean. "They’re seeing the Chinese, that they’re going to have twice the number of submarines we have in just over a decade," Forbes, R-4th, said during a recent interview on "The John Fredericks Show," a Portsmouth-based radio program broadcast across Virginia. Forbes long has called for strengthening the military. He’s chairman of the 21-member House Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, which oversees the Navy and Marine Corps. The Fourth Congressional District, which he has represented since 2001, has its population center in Chesapeake and Suffolk and relies on defense spending that supports the world’s largest naval base in Norfolk and nearby shipbuilding. This year, Forbes is seeking election in the Second Congressional District, which is centered in Virginia Beach and also is home to naval installations. Forbes made the switch after court-ordered changes to his old district made it friendly to Democrats. He faces a June 14 Republican primary challenge from Del. Scott Taylor, a former Navy seal, and Pat Cardwell, a Virginia Beach attorney. We wondered if Forbes is correct in saying that China’s submarine fleet will double that of the U.S. in slightly more than a decade. Hailey Sadler, the congressman’s communications director, pointed us to a series of reports about the U.S. and Chinese submarine fleets. The U.S. submarine fleet Sadler cited a March 17 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. It contains a table showing that in 2026, the U.S. submarine fleet is projected to have 47 general purpose boats - 45 attack subs and another two cruise missile subs. That chart is the latest update of the Navy’s projected 30-year shipbuilding plan. But the 47-sub estimate is a low figure, because it doesn’t count 14 ballistic missile submarines that can launch nuclear warheads. With those boats counted, the U.S. Navy projects it will have 61 subs in 10 years. After that, the total number of subs is expected to drop to 58 in 2027; 55 in 2028; and 53 in 2029 and in 2030. Then, the size of the submarine fleet is expected rise again through most of the 2030s and beyond. China’s submarine fleet China is guarded about its military numbers, making it hard for analysts to quantify its submarine fleet. While Congress publicly debates the U.S. military budget every year, China decides its defense spending behind closed doors, said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Still, there are some estimates about the size of China’s submarine fleet now and into the near future. Sadler said Forbes was referring to 2015 comments by James Fanell, a retired U.S. Navy captain. An article in Defense News quoted Fanell as saying that during the next 15 years, China’s submarine fleet would expand to 99 vessels. It should be noted that Fannell, a year earlier, was fired from his post as the Pacific Fleet’s director of intelligence and information for making unauthorized statements accusing China of preparing for a possible attack on Japan. Forbes’ office also pointed to estimates of China’s submarine fleet that appeared in a second Congressional Research Service report released in March. The research service noted that an analysis by the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence shows that China’s total submarine fleet -- mostly attack boats and a handful of ballistic missile subs - was 66 to 75 in 2015. In 2020, it’s expected to be 69 to 78 submarines. If that growth rate of three more subs over a five-year period was to continue till 2026, then China would have about 72 to 81 submarines that year, Sadler said. The Department of Defense, meanwhile, has said that by 2020, China’s submarine force would grow to 69 to 78 submarines. Forbes’ office focuses on the high-side estimate of 81 extrapolated from Congressional Research Service figures and the 99-sub estimate that Fanell cited. "The U.S. Navy projects it will have 47 submarines. Twice that is 94 - which is the middle ground between the figures projected by the Congressional Research Service and the Pacific Fleet’s former chief intelligence officer, rendering Congressman Forbes’ assessment an accurate projection," Sadler said. As we noted previously, the 47-submarine figure for the U.S. doesn’t take into account ballistic missile subs - which are included in the projections of China’s strength that Forbes cited. By the late 2020s, the number of all U.S. submarines would drop to 53, and if you double that figure it would outpace slightly the high-side estimate of 99 submarines Fanell cited. But other projections in the Congressional Research Service report show China’s submarine force could be lower than that about 10 years from now. We ran Forbes’ statement by Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based think tank that examines national security and defense spending issues. Clark estimated that between 2025 and 2030, China will have 80 to 100 submarines. With the U.S. having more than 50 submarines at that time, Forbes’ numbers have validity, Clark said. Beyond the numbers But we need to consider more than numbers when comparing the two nations’ submarine fleets, Clark added. He noted all U.S. subs are nuclear-powered, while China’s fleet, in a decade, still will contain many diesel-powered vessels. "It is notable, however, that all of the U.S. submarines are highly capable of long endurance, whereas about half of China’s submarine fleet will be non-nuclear submarines best suited for regional operations close to home," Clark wrote in an email. Harrison, the analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told us that nuclear subs can stay submerged for months, while diesel subs have to surface periodically to recharge their batteries. One of the Congressional Research Service reports that Forbes cites cautions against using ship numbers to compare the naval strength of nations. "The potential for obscuring differences in the capabilities of ships of a given type is particularly significant in assessing relative U.S. and Chinese capabilities, in part because China’s navy includes significant numbers of older, obsolescent ships," the Congressional Research Service wrote. "Figures on total numbers of Chinese submarines, destroyers, frigates, and coastal patrol craft lump older, obsolescent ships together with more modern and more capable designs." On the other hand, the report notes that the U.S. Navy has global responsibilities and that many ships are based in on the Atlantic coast, meaning the American fleet would be strained to respond to a conflict near China. Our ruling Forbes said that in just over a decade, China will have twice the number of submarines as the U.S. The congressman has a point in that, in sheer numbers of subs, China’s fleet is expected to increase during the next 14 years as the U.S. submarine force is scheduled to decline. China is close-mouthed about its military plans, and the U.S. doesn’t know exactly how many subs that nation will have in 10 years or more. Defense analysts have made projections that vary between 80 and 100 Chinese subs. Forbes relies on the very highest of these wide-ranging projections to state as fact that China will double the U.S. fleet. We should point out that even if China built up to 100 subs by 2030, it still would not quite double the 53-submarine fleet the U.S. Navy has planned for that year. Forbes’ statement also glosses over major differences between the nations’ subs. The U.S. fleet is entirely nuclear-powered and capable of long underwater deployments far from home. Most of the Chinese fleet, in a decade, still will be diesel-powered and designed for relatively shorter assignments in regional waters. So Forbes’ statement contains has some accuracy but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a45a422d-2e68-4ec1-9d71-a808a785e0ca	None	Randy Forbes	None	None	None	2016-05-02T12:00:00	2016-04-21	['China']
pomt-14454	"Statistics show 2 to 3 Texas women per week have major complications and 10 women per week seek help at an ER after an abortion."	false	/texas/statements/2016/mar/04/ken-paxton/ken-paxton-micharacterizes-abortion-risk-texas/	This week, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments for Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, a landmark abortion case that will decide the fate of Texas’ 2013 abortion law, known as House Bill 2. The law, among other things, requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and requires abortion clinics to comply with the state-set standards for ambulatory surgical centers. Before the case went in front of the Supreme Court, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton prepared to defend the law. In a Feb. 5, 2016, press release, his office highlighted that the court received "more than 30" amicus briefs in support of the law. "Statistics show 2 to 3 Texas women per week have major complications and 10 women per week seek help at an ER after an abortion," the release said. "Texas believes abortion facilities have no special privilege to operate outside the parameters of the medical profession and it is the right and responsibility of the state to ensure the safety of patients." We wanted to check: Is it true that two to three Texas women have major complications from abortion per week, and that 10 women in that time seek help at an emergency room after an abortion? Attorney General’s numbers First, we asked the attorney general’s office where it got its statistics. Deputy Press Secretary Cynthia Meyer told us via email that those statistics came from an expert for the petitioners in this case. The expert, Elizabeth Gray Raymond, is an obstetrician-gynecologist and medical researcher who currently is a senior medical associate at Gynuity Health Projects, a women’s health research organization, and an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Medicine, an appendix for the case says. Gray Raymond cited a University of California at San Francisco study, Meyer said, that found that "the incidence of major complications following an abortion (hospital admission, abdominal surgery, hysterectomy, or blood transfusion) was 0.23 percent, and that 0.87 percent of all abortions resulted in a visit to an emergency department in which treatment was provided for an abortion-related condition." The events that qualified as "major complications" were hospital admission, abdominal surgery, hysterectomy, or blood transfusion, according to Gray Raymond’s testimony. The attorney general’s office then multiplied those statistics by an estimated 60,000 abortions per year in Texas, a number taken from Department of State Health Services data. (The exact total for 2013, the most recent data available, is 63,849.) That came out to a projection of 138 major complications a year, which, divided by 52 weeks in a year, works out to 2.6 complications per week, and 522 ER visits per year, which comes out to 10 visits per week. Using the more exact 63,849 abortions per year in Texas, we get 2.8 complications and 10.7 emergency room visits per week. Numbers in context In the study that was the basis for these calculations, researchers characterized the complication rates they found as "low." The complication rates, a press release about the study on the university’s website said, are about the same as rates for complications following colonoscopies. That exact comparison came up during oral arguments before the Supreme court, when Justice Stephen Breyer said abortions had "28 times less than a risk of a colonoscopy," and that the risks were "roughly the same as the risks that you have in a dentist office when you have some surgery." The rate of major complications also was similar for vasectomies, according to Gray Raymond’s testimony. Gray Raymond concluded: "The clear message of these data is that complications of induced abortion, and particularly complications that cannot be managed at the original abortion facility, are rare." The University of California at San Francisco study, published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, began with the goal to determine rates of complications after abortions, in part because those rates previously may have been underreported; researchers thought that complications diagnosed at a separate facility, rather than immediately following an abortion procedure, previously had been missed. Their results showed that wasn’t the case. The study concluded: "These findings show abortion complication rates to be low and comparable to previously published rates even when there is no loss to follow-up and ED visits are included." The study that was the basis for the Texas attorney general’s weekly and annual calculations was based in San Francisco, and all study participants had abortions paid for by California’s Medicaid program. While the study is reliable, it may not be a one-to-one comparison between low-income women in northern California and all abortions in Texas. Ushma Upadhyay, one of the study’s authors, said by phone that the rates from her study could be comparable to rates in other states. However, the abortions in the UCSF study included, at 16 percent, a higher proportion than usual of second-trimester and late-term abortions, which have a higher risk of complication. That is twice the percentage of abortions performed in the second or third trimester in Texas in 2013, the last year for which data are available from the state. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, of the 63,849 abortions recorded in the Lone Star State in 2013, 92 percent were performed in the first trimester, when the risk of complication is lower compared with the second and third trimesters. The best way to apply the study’s complication rates to Texas, Upadhyay said, would be to separate abortions by types of procedure, rather than multiply the rate by the total 60,000 abortions in Texas. Our ruling Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office said in a press release that "statistics show 2 to 3 Texas women per week have major complications and 10 women per week seek help at an ER after an abortion." These statistics were based on a study of abortions in California, not Texas. That study included a higher percentage of abortions performed in the second and third trimesters than occurred in Texas, making a direct extrapolation to attribute those numbers to women in the Lone Star State problematic. Moreover, the researchers who calculated the number of abortion-related complications in the study characterized those rates as "low." The numbers do not lead to the conclusion that abortion providers are operating "outside the parameters of the medical profession," as the attorney general’s office says. To recap, Paxton characterized Texas abortion practices and outcomes based on a California study that included twice the number of women at risk for complications as exists in the Lone Star State. He also presented the figures in a misleading way to suggest that abortion providers were operating outside of medical norms. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-14290	"Millionaires working side by side with George Soros are bankrolling (John Kasich’s) super PAC."	false	/ohio/statements/2016/apr/04/trusted-leadership-pac/no-george-soros-not-bankrolling-john-kasichs-campa/	There’s a secret, left-wing conspiracy to prop up John Kasich’s presidential candidacy, according to an ad linking the Ohio governor to liberal billionaire and investor George Soros. "Millionaires working side by side with George Soros are bankrolling his super PAC," the ad’s narrator says of Kasich, as images of Kasich and Soros appear above the words "Hundreds of thousands of dollars from George Soros." This idea of Soros controlling a shadowy network of Kasich-backing cronies is also circulating on blogs like DCClothesline.com. The television ads, which were running in Wisconsin ahead of the state’s April 5 primary, are paid for by Trusted Leadership, the super PAC supporting Ted Cruz for president. Could there be any truth to it? The idea that Soros would clandestinely donate to a super PAC is silly based on campaign finance rules, said Tom Sutton, political science professor at Baldwin Wallace University. There is no maximum limit on super PAC donations, and donors are public. "Soros could give a million to New Day for America," said Sutton, referencing the super PAC supporting Kasich. "He doesn’t have to hide it, why would he do that? If he’s artificially manipulating Kasich’s campaign in the name of other people, just look at the list of donors and explain all these other companies that have given more." We looked at the list of donors ourselves. There are donations to the New Day for America PAC from two individuals linked to Soros. Scott Bessent is a former chief investment officer for Soros Fund Management who left to start his own hedge fund company last year, with $2 billion in seed money from Soros. Campaign finance records show that he donated $200,000 to New Day for America, as well as $2,700 to Kasich directly. Bessent has donated to other conservative causes since 2015, including the Right to Rise PAC that supported Jeb Bush ($5,000) and to the Republican National Committee ($39,800). But he's donated to Democrats too; in 2013 he gave $25,000 to the Ready for Hillary PAC. Similarly, Stanley Druckenmiller, who managed assets for Soros from 1988 to 2000, gave $450,000 to New Day for America last year. If Druckenmiller shares any of Soros’ political philosophies, they aren’t apparent in his donor history. He has also consistently given money to Republican candidates’ super PACs and the Republican National Committee. A Trusted Leadership PAC spokeswoman confirmed that Bessent and Druckenmiller are the donors that connect Soros to Kasich. According to OpenSecrets.org, which tracks campaign contributions, Soros has given $7 million this cycle to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC that supports Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. He also gave $25,000 to the pro-Clinton Ready PAC, and $1 million to American Bridge 21st Century, which funds opposition research against Republican candidates and causes. There is a "firewall" between candidates and the super PACs backing them, said Sutton, and while Kasich may not be happy about contributions from people connected to Soros, he can’t tell them to knock it off. Candidates cannot have any contact with PACs or their donors. For these reasons, Sutton said, "If there was a conspiracy, it’s the worst conspiracy ever, because it’s not working." He added: "Kasich’s people would love to have power at this level, because then they might be able to raise enough money to rival anything near what’s going on in other campaigns." The most recent campaign finance filing from the pro-Kasich PAC shows nearly $10 million in contributions from individual donors, and $14 million in expenditures. Connie Wehrkamp, spokeswoman for New Day For America, told PolitiFact Ohio that the organization sent station managers in Wisconsin a letter on March 29, reading, "We demand that your station investigate the false, misleading, and deceptive claims contained in this advertisement and remove it from the air." So far, three television statements in Green Bay and one station in Wausau have pulled the ad, Wehrkamp said. Our ruling A pro-Cruz ad says, "Millionaires working side by side with George Soros are bankrolling his (Kasich’s) super PAC." Donations totalling $650,000 from two guys who once worked with Soros hardly equate to "bankrolling" Kasich. The ad’s on-screen text goes even further to mislead voters with a blatantly false claim that Soros is directly giving to Kasich. Campaign finance records prove otherwise, with Soros donating handsomely to pro-Clinton groups. We rule the claim False.

pomt-11482	Says abortion is "the leading cause of death for black Americans and kills as many as 1,000 black children every day."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2018/mar/02/jason-isaac/jason-isaac-makes-mostly-false-claim-abortion-lead/	A candidate seeking the Republican nomination to succeed Lamar Smith of San Antonio in the U.S. House says more black Americans die from abortion than any other cause. We wondered about that. State Rep. Jason Isaac of Dripping Springs, asked what policies he’d pursue to address safety and inequalities facing women and people of color, opened his reply: "I will work to end abortion, which is the leading cause of death for black Americans and kills as many as 1,000 black children every day." That question and Isaac’s full reply appear in a voters guide published before the March 2018 party primaries by the League of Women Voters of Texas and League of Women Voters Austin Area. Katie Tahuahua of Isaac’s campaign, asked the basis of Isaac’s claim about black deaths, responded by email that according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease caused the deaths of the most U.S. black residents in 2015 (75,249). She noted that the year before, according to CDC figures representing data from 47 states, over 200,000 "black babies were aborted." Upshot: "This is far more than the leading reported cause of death for black Americans," Tahuahua wrote. We’ll unpack those figures. But it’s worth noting for starters that Isaac’s characterization of abortions as killing babies is disputed. Abortion rights advocates, noting the Supreme Court legalized abortion in every state in 1973, typically refer to unborn fetuses. Also, the CDC doesn’t say abortions kill babies; it defines a "legal induced abortion" as "an intervention performed by a licensed clinician (e.g., a physician, nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant) that is intended to terminate an ongoing pregnancy." In addition, an unknown share of aborted pregnancies wouldn’t have resulted in live children, due to the natural risk of miscarriages and stillbirths. Causes of death We confirmed from a CDC table pointed out by Tahuahua that heart disease killed the most black residents (75,249) in 2015 and also was the leading cause of death for all Americans. Lesser causes of death for black Americans included cancer, stroke and diabetes, the table indicates. The table doesn’t list abortion as a cause. Our own search of CDC-posted statistics led us to a table stating that nationally in 2015, 6,907 black infants died. Among the table’s 15 listed leading causes of death, disorders related to short gestation and birth weight accounted for the most deaths, 1,513, nearly 22 percent of the total. The table lists congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities as the second most-prevalent cause, accounting for 930 deaths, nearly 14 percent of the total. The table doesn’t list abortion as a cause. Abortions by ethnicity Tahuahua said Isaac got to his declaration of more than 1,000 black child deaths a day because the CDC "reports that 35% of aborted babies are black." For our part, we confirmed that the CDC says that in 2014, there were 652,639 legal induced abortions nationally. Apply the 35 percent figure offered by Isaac and it looks like black women obtained 228,423 abortions for a rate of 626 a day. Then again, Tahuahua noted, the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights, separately estimated 926,200 U.S. abortions in 2014 which, if you apply Isaac’s methodology, signals that black women obtained 324,170 abortions for a rate of 888 a day. The Guttmacher count of abortions appears in a January 2018 institute "Fact Sheet" that also says that white patients accounted for 39 percent of U.S. abortion procedures in 2014, blacks for 28 percent, Hispanics for 25 percent and patients of other races and ethnicities for 9 percent, according to an institute survey of abortion patients. Applying the institute’s 28 percent figure to the institute’s abortion count suggests that black women obtained 259,336 abortions for a rate of 711 a day. The institute’s May 2016 recap of its survey results also walks through the proportion of abortion patients in given subgroups (e.g., a particular age-group) relative to the proportion of all U.S. women aged 15–44 who are in that same subgroup--what the authors call an "abortion index." By this metric, the recap says, white "women were slightly underrepresented among abortion patients in 2014, having an abortion index of 0.7, while black women were substantially overrepresented, with a relative abortion rate of 1.9. Hispanic women were slightly overrepresented among abortion patients in 2014 (1.2)." Institute: Black women experience higher rates of unintended pregnancy The institute’s Rebecca Wind, responding to our query about Isaac’s claim, said by email that higher abortion rates among black women reflect higher rates of unintended pregnancy. A 2008 institute paper by Susan A. Cohen states: "These higher unintended pregnancy rates reflect the particular difficulties that many women in minority communities face in accessing high-quality contraceptive services and in using their chosen method of birth control consistently and effectively over long periods of time." As of 2004, Cohen wrote, about one-third of abortions were obtained by white women with 37 percent obtained by black women. Overall, she wrote, "black women are three times as likely as white women to experience an unintended pregnancy; Hispanic women are twice as likely. Because black women experience so many more unintended pregnancies than any other group—sharply disproportionate to their numbers in the general population—they are more likely to seek out and obtain abortion services than any other group," Cohen wrote. "In addition, because black women as a group want the same number of children as white women, but have so many more unintended pregnancies, they are more likely than white women to terminate an unintended pregnancy by abortion to avoid an unwanted birth," Cohen wrote. We circled back to Isaac about our findings. He replied by email: "You're correct that the CDC identifies heart disease as the #1 cause of death for black Americans; however, were abortion considered a cause of death, it would be the #1 cause by far." Our ruling Isaac told the voters guide that abortion is "the leading cause of death for black Americans and kills as many as 1,000 black children every day." Opinions about this claim likely divide over Isaac’s definition of a fetus as a child--and by Isaac’s reasoning, we find this claim has an element of truth in that black women in 2014 accounted for about 711 U.S. abortions a day. In fact, however, heart disease was the leading cause of death for black and other Americans in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency didn’t list the abortion procedure among causes of death. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-14080	Says "Mike Coffman is with Trump."	mostly false	/colorado/statements/2016/may/18/colorados-voice/group-says-mike-coffman-trump-he-says-billionaire-/	It’s the Democrats’ favorite game this election season: Pin the Trump on the down-ballot Republican candidate. One of the bigger targets is Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, a four-term Republican incumbent in the 6th Congressional District, a crescent-shaped swath of Denver suburbs considered one of the country’s most competitive swing districts. Coffman is in a fierce contest with Democratic state Sen. Morgan Carroll. Since last year, Democratic groups and Carroll have been working hard to shackle Coffman to the now-presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his controversial comments about immigrants, minorities and women. The latest broadside came from Colorado’s Voice -- the state chapter of America’s Voice, an immigration reform group. It issued an email news release headlined, "Mike Coffman Is With Trump." So is he? February statement, subsequent remarks Colorado's Voice is using a statement Coffman’s spokeswoman gave to the Colorado Statesman as evidence he’s "with Trump." But the statement, from Kristin Strohm, also clearly said Coffman supported Marco Rubio. Here it is. "Will Mike Coffman support the Republican nominee over Bernie or Hillary?" Strohm said in a story published Feb. 2. "The answer is obviously yes. And he believes strongly it is going to be Marco Rubio." At the time, Trump was one of 11 Republicans still in the race. However, Coffman political director JD Key suggested to PolitiFact that Coffman might be having second thoughts about automatically supporting the GOP nominee. "Rep. Coffman has not endorsed or voiced support for Donald Trump," Key said. In fact, Coffman has issued blistering criticisms of his party’s de facto presidential nominee. When Trump blasted the Colorado GOP’s caucus system as "rigged," Coffman, a Marine Corps combat veteran, fired back with this April 18 Facebook post: "If there is anyone who knows what a rigged system looks like it’s Donald Trump who was able to evade the draft during the height of the Vietnam War when the U.S. was losing, on average, 1,000 troops every month. That system was clearly rigged in favor of young men from politically influential families but Donald Trump never complained about that." And on May 4, Coffman said in a statement that Trump has yet to earn Coffman’s support. "Both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have tapped into a legitimate anger about the failures of Washington but instead of running a campaign built on a positive vision for overcoming these failures, Donald Trump has conducted a polarizing and divisive campaign," Coffman said. "Hillary Clinton is a non-starter and lacks the integrity to lead this nation but Trump has a long way to go to earn the support of many – me included." Coffman isn't alone in walking back previous comments. House Speaker Paul Ryan had said he would back whoever won the Republican nomination, only to hold back on endorsing Trump. And former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush broke a pledge to support the GOP nominee no matter who it was. A May 6 Politico story headlined, "Which Republicans have endorsed Donald Trump?" listed both Coffman and Ryan under "Not there yet." Lining up on positions So Coffman certainly is hedging on his campaign’s previous statement that he would support the GOP nominee, who is now almost certainly Trump. But do the two candidates line up issue-wise? The Colorado’s Voice news release pointed to Coffman’s position on immigration legislation. "Colorado already knows Coffman supports the Trump agenda on immigration. He voted … multiple times to deport DREAMers by ending the DACA program. He opposes DAPA, the policy that offers a modest but critical step forward for the parents of U.S. citizens." DACA is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which President Barack Obama created by executive order in 2012. It allows undocumented immigrants brought to the country unlawfully as children a two-year reprieve from deportation along with the opportunity to receive a renewable work permit and a driver's license. DAPA is short for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents. Obama used a 2014 executive order to create the program that would shield parents of children who are citizens or are living in the country legally from deportation and make them eligible to work in the United States. The fate of DAPA and an expanded DACA is being deliberated on by the U.S. Supreme Court after Texas and 25 other states led by Republicans sued over the programs, saying the Obama administration had usurped power that belongs to Congress. Here, too, Coffman’s position isn’t cut and dried. Coffman voted against the DREAM Act in 2010, a bipartisan bill to allow children brought into the country unlawfully a path to citizenship if they attended college or served in the military. (DACA was in many ways Obama’s response.) "The Dream Act will be a nightmare for the American people," Coffman said at the time. "No doubt, we need immigration reform but the Dream Act is written far too broadly and it will only encourage more illegal immigration, promote chain migration, and will be a magnet for fraud." But Coffman's immigration positions softened in 2011, when his district was redrawn and its population became 20 percent Hispanic. He began taking Spanish lessons to better communicate with his constituents, and in January 2013, he introduced the Military Enlistment Opportunity Act, which sought to provide immigrant children an opportunity to serve in the U.S. military and gain a path to citizenship. During the 2014 election, Coffman and his Democratic opponent, former state House speaker, Andrew Romanoff, debated in Spanish. "There’s a narrative out there about Republicans being not just anti-illegal immigrant, but anti-immigrant," Coffman told the Wall Street Journal in January. "It was very important to me to break the narrative." Colorado’s Voice director Alvina Vasquez said while Coffman "makes sweeping and broad statements about immigration reform, his actions show his true beliefs." Critics cite Coffman’s June 2013 vote to defund DACA and his March 17 vote supporting the House filing an amicus brief with the Supreme Court "opposing the Obama administration's executive overreach" on immigration reform programs. Yet, in 2014, Coffman broke with the GOP to vote against efforts to end the DACA program for young "Dreamers." Our ruling Colorado’s Voice says "Mike Coffman is with Trump." That’s hardly clear. In February, Coffman’s spokeswoman said he would "support the Republican nominee," while hoping that person would be Marco Rubio. Since then, Coffman has criticized Trump’s "divisive campaign" and said the billionaire has a long way to go to earn his support. The group also says Coffman "supports the Trump agenda on immigration" as evidence. Yet the congressman’s views have moderated, and Coffman has at times broken with hardline GOP positions on immigration. Claims that Coffman is in lockstep with Trump go too far.

pomt-12833	"I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/feb/07/donald-trump/trump-overstates-credit-700-million-savings-f-35s/	President Donald Trump told military commanders in Tampa that he will deliver new airplanes at a massive savings to taxpayers. "We're going to be loading it up with beautiful new planes and beautiful new equipment," he said at U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base Feb. 6. "You have been lacking a little equipment. We are going to load it up. You are going to get a lot of equipment. Believe me." Trump then gave himself credit for saving millions of tax dollars during his first two weeks in office: "But we will ensure no taxpayer dollars are wasted. I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35. You know about that." The savings with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter are real, but they were in the works before Trump cried foul about the price tag. A Trump spokesman did not reply for this fact-check. (The Washington Post Fact Checker previously looked at a claim that Trump took credit for cutting $600 million and gave it Four Pinocchios.) Trump’s transition tweets about the F-35 program The Defense Department is in the middle of the largest aircraft procurement ever for different versions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The F-35 is built by Lockheed Martin. Plans call for acquiring more than 2,400 aircraft over about 20 years at a cost of around $379 billion. Trump raised concerns about the F-35 program while campaigning. "I’m hearing that our existing planes are better," he told radio show host Hugh Hewitt in October, 2015 questioning why the United States was spending "billions and billions of dollars." He upped his criticism of the cost after he won the election. "The F-35 program and cost is out of control," Trump tweeted Dec. 12. "Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th." Following Trump’s tweet, Lockheed Martin’s stock plummeted, and government officials defended the program. A week later, the F-35 Joint Program Office released the final price for the contract, which showed the airplanes for the Air Force and Marine Corps reduced by $5.9 million and $2.4 million respectively, while the Navy model saw an increase of $3.2 million. Air Force Lt. Gen Chris Bogdan told reporters that he anticipated that costs would "come down in price significantly" and put the savings "somewhere on the order of 6 to 7 percent per airplane, per variant." The Washington Post calculated total savings between $549 million and $630 million for the full lot of 90 planes. During his transition into office, Trump convened top military brass, including Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson, at his estate at Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach on Dec. 21 to discuss how to bring costs down for the F-35 program. (Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was also there. Boeing is the contractor for Air Force One, another project that Trump said was too expensive.) The next day, Trump tweeted: "Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!" A week before Trump’s inauguration, Hewson said her company was close to a deal to significantly lower costs after the Mar-A-Lago meeting. Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35 program in late January. On Feb. 3, the Defense Department announced it had reached an agreement with Lockheed Martin for a $728 million reduction, leading to the "lowest priced F-35s in program history." Lockheed Martin issued a statement praising Trump’s involvement: "President Trump’s personal involvement in the F-35 program accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus on driving down the price." That, however, is not the end of the story. Costs predicted to drop for years Defense and budget experts offered a big caveat to Trump’s claim: Costs had been coming down for years. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said that the cost reduction for the Air Force variant of the F-35 had been in the works since before Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015. "The savings are a little higher than was initially projected, but all President Trump did was elevate attention to the issue," Ellis said. "He’s not responsible for the savings, they were already in the pipeline long before he came on the scene." The cost per plane has always been a moving target, The Arizona Republic reported in 2014, and Lockheed Martin officials had said that costs had been coming down. The initial production model delivered in 2010 cost about $220 million, while the projection for 2020 ranged from $75 million-$85 million. The general manager of Lockheed's F-35 program, Lorraine Martin, said in 2015 that costs would drop further, "allowing us to provide our warfighters a fifth-generation F-35 jet at a fourth-generation price by the end of the decade." The savings can be attributed to a normal learning curve, said Todd Harrison, a military budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "As you build more copies of an item you naturally get more efficient at the work," he said. "That is a big part of what we are seeing here, and that would have occurred regardless of who won the presidential election." However, Harrison said that Trump can take credit for the fact that the government was able to negotiate a deal with Lockheed so quickly for the next batch of airplanes. "For the previous lot of F-35s, DOD negotiated with Lockheed for about a year and a half and never reached a deal," he said. "DOD ultimately used a somewhat unusual method for finalizing the contract unilaterally in late 2016." Ben Friedman, a military budget expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that the savings have nothing to do with Trump since they were already in the works. "First, there are no savings yet, as they are anticipated, perhaps hopefully," he said. "Second, it is normal for costs to fall as production goes forward and problems are solved. Third, it's not as if no one before Trump was looking to cut F-35 costs. It has been a fixation in the Pentagon for a long time." Our ruling Trump said, "I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35." The Department of Defense announced a $728 million reduction on Feb. 3 for the aircraft. But Trump ignores that the government and Lockheed Martin were working toward reducing the costs for years — long before Trump’s tweets in December criticizing the price tag.

pomt-13883	"When he served as governor, Schwarzenegger preserved more land than any other gubernatorial administration in California’s history."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/jul/01/bonnie-reiss/did-arnold-schwarzenegger-protect-more-land-any-ca/	Arnold Schwarzenegger’s achievements are many: Body builder. Movie star. Governator. Honorary Forest Ranger. Yes, he was named an Honorary Forest Ranger by the federal government. But was he California’s environmental champion, its greenest governor in history, in terms of protecting the state’s natural beauty through land conservation? That’s what a top official with the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, Bonnie Reiss, claimed in a recent opinion column. "When he served as governor, Schwarzenegger preserved more land than any other gubernatorial administration in California’s history," Reiss, the institute’s global director, wrote in the Malibu Times on June 8, 2016. She continued: "He established the Sierra Nevada Conservancy that oversees more than 25 million acres of land in Northern California, reached an agreement to preserve Hearst Ranch with its 13 miles of pristine coastline in Central California and brokered the Tejon Ranch Conservation Agreement that permanently preserved 90 percent of the 270,000-acre ranch in Southern California." Schwarzenegger’s publicist made the same claim about protecting "more land" than any other California governor recently on Twitter. Reiss, who served as a senior advisor to then Gov. Schwarzenegger, also highlighted the recent completion of the National Park Service’s Backbone Trail project near Malibu, to which Schwarzenegger donated 40 acres of his personal property. On the big screen, the Hollywood icon regularly saves the day. So we decided to fact-check whether he’s saved "more land" than any governor "in California’s history." Our research Environmentalists and state officials said they are not aware of records that track land conservation by a governor. Reiss told us she knows of no official rankings. To back up her claim about Schwarzenegger, she pointed to articles by Wikipedia and an environmental nonprofit that describe the Sierra Nevada Conservancy as the largest of its kind in California and the nation. It operates across a huge swath: 25 million acres stretching from the Oregon border to Kern County. But that’s the boundary inside which land can be protected. The total acreage conserved by the agency is much less -- about 58,000 acres over the past decade, according to a conservancy spokeswoman. That is still a large patchwork of protected land. But Reiss’ emphasis on the 25 million acre boundary muddies the water. "It’s not like they created a new park," said Bill Magavern, who was director of Sierra Club California at the same time Schwarzenegger was governor. "They established a new government entity." Schwarzenegger did not originate plans for the conservancy -- he signed a bill into law in 2004 creating it. The state agency administers grants to local governments and trusts seeking to preserve land. Also in response to our questions, Reiss pointed to the conservation of Hearst Ranch along the Central Coast and Tejon Ranch north of Los Angeles, two mammoth conservation deals, both completed during Schwarzenegger’s tenure. Those protected 80,000 acres and 240,000 acres, respectively, according to websites for each. Environmentalists say Schwarzenegger deserves credit, not as the architect of the deals, but as a significant player in both. The Tejon Ranch Company describes its agreement as the largest private conservation deal in California history. Then California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks in May 2008 at Tejon Ranch. State officials we spoke with, including researchers at the California State Library, said they are not aware of any other governor whose administration protected larger collections of land. Conservation money While it’s difficult to track governors by acreage protected, there’s another way to measure their green works: Money raised for land conservation. During the early and mid-2000s, California voters approved nearly $20 billion for conservation through six bond measures. This was "a huge influx of money," dwarfing amounts raised in previous decades, said Bryan Cash, who serves as deputy assistant secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency under current Gov. Jerry Brown and also worked for the agency under Gov. Schwarzenegger. Four of the bond measures were approved under Gov. Gray Davis, but later implemented by Schwarzenegger. The voter-approved bond money led to the preservation of 1.5 million acres across California from 2000 to 2011, Cash said. "The statement," about Schwarzenegger protecting more land than any California governor, "is probably true," Cash added. Cash said money still flows to conservation under the Brown Administration, but significantly less than in the 2000s. The USDA named Schwarzengger an 'Honorary Forest Ranger' in 2013. Our ruling Bonnie Reiss of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute said: "When he served as governor, Schwarzenegger preserved more land than any other gubernatorial administration in California’s history." State officials and environmentalists agree Schwarzenegger helped protect vast tracks of California’s hills, forests and coastline. No other governor, they said, compares in this category. They also said Schwarzenegger benefitted from conservation efforts initiated before he took office, including plans for the Sierra Nevada Conservancy and state bond measures that helped fund much of the land protected under his watch. Also, Reiss’ emphasis on Schwarzenegger’s establishment of the "25 million acre" Sierra Nevada Conservancy needs the clarification that only a small fraction of that acreage has been preserved over the last decade. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-02118	State Rep. Elena Parent "supported Governor Nathan Deal’s plan to slash the HOPE scholarship."	false	/georgia/statements/2014/may/13/kyle-williams/can-candidate-be-too-conservative/	A Democrat vying for a Georgia Senate seat is trying to convince voters his opponent is too far to the right for this left-leaning area. "Elena Parent. A Disturbing Record: Too Conservative for Us," read a flier from Friends of Kyle Williams. One claim about Parent, a Democrat who served in the Georgia House of Representatives, seemed ripe for a fact check. "Supported Governor Nathan Deal’s plan to slash the HOPE Scholarship," it said. "The HOPE Scholarship has allowed a generation of Georgians the opportunity to afford college. There’s no excuse for Parent’s vote to limit these opportunities and hurt our children’s futures." One PolitiFact Georgia reader said she received a robocall from Roy Barnes, the last Democrat to serve as Georgia’s governor, who claimed the ad was full of inaccurate information about Parent. The reader wanted to know which candidate is correct here. So did we. Parent and Williams are running to represent District 42 in the Georgia Senate, which includes several west-central DeKalb County communities such as Decatur, North Druid Hills and Avondale Estates. The current officeholder, Jason Carter, a Democrat, is running for governor. Parent served one term in the House and is the executive director of Georgia Watch, a consumer rights nonprofit. Williams is an attorney based in Decatur and involved in several community organizations. During one recent debate, Williams defended himself against Parent’s complaint that the flier distorted her record on HOPE. "You don’t cut HOPE to save it," Williams said. The flier contained a footnote concerning a bill passed by the Georgia Legislature in 2011 that altered the HOPE program. The Williams campaign forwarded us two documents that show Parent voted in favor of a bill Deal and other Republicans proposed to make changes to HOPE, but those items did not include a key element. Let’s explain. HOPE, for those of you unfamiliar with it, once covered all tuition costs if the student maintained a grade-point average of 3.0 or better. Since being created in 1993, HOPE had paid for more than 1 million students to attend college. By 2010, about one-third of students enrolled in public colleges relied on the award. In January 2011, Nathan Deal, a Republican, took office as governor and shortly thereafter announced plans to revamp the state’s popular HOPE Scholarship program to prevent it from going broke. HOPE is funded by the Georgia Lottery, but the lottery wasn’t raising enough revenue to keep up with rising enrollment and tuition. The state dipped into reserves to cover costs, but that well was running dry. On March 1, 2011, the House voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill that made some changes to HOPE. The changes included: Varying the amount students receive annually, depending on lottery revenue. Dropping the HOPE award private students will see from $4,000 to $3,600. Limiting the awards for full tuition at public colleges to students who graduate from high school with at least a 3.7 GPA and 1200 SAT score under a new Zell Miller Scholarship. These students will have to maintain a 3.3 GPA in college to keep the full scholarship Parent voted for the bill. That version of the House bill had the support of several key Democrats, such as Minority Leader Stacey Abrams of Atlanta and Calvin Smyre of Columbus, the House’s longest-serving Democrat. Many Democrats supported the bill as part of a strategy to negotiate with Deal to make some changes they believed would make the changes less drastic to low-income students, said state Rep. Stacey Evans, D-Smyrna. One week later, on March 8, the Senate passed a revised version of the House bill. All four Republican amendments were added to the bill, but none of the amendments proposed by Democrats were included in the revised bill. The Senate revisions included allowing only the top two graduates from each high school to get a Zell Miller Scholarship and offering low-interest loans to cover the difference between tuition and the amount of the HOPE award. When the bill came back to the House, with those changes, on March 10, Parent voted no. "Elena didn’t feel like it was up to her standards, so she voted against the revised version," said Matt Weyandt, a senior adviser to the campaign. Evans, who previously endorsed Parent, said she was upset and disappointed by the Williams flier. Evans called Williams a friend and said she would have supported him if he were running against anyone but Parent. Evans voted against both versions of the House bill. Barnes also vouched for Parent’s role in the 2011 HOPE debate in the robocall, saying she "led the fight to preserve the HOPE Scholarship." Beth Cope, a spokeswoman for Williams, stressed that Parent should not have voted for the bill the first time. Williams has complained that Parent was too willing to compromise with Republicans. "We don’t always get a chance to get it right the second time," Cope said. To sum up, Williams said Parent supported the governor’s plan to "slash the HOPE Scholarship." Parent voted for one version of the bill. But she voted against the final version of the legislation, which contained Republican revisions. There are a lot of problems with Williams’ claim. First, Deal, with the support of key Democrats, was trying to prevent HOPE from going broke. To accuse Parent of conspiring with a Republican governor to "slash" the popular program is way off base. And to say Parent supported a plan that she ultimately voted against seems to be a significant distortion of her record. We rate Williams’ claim False.

pomt-07534	"Franklin Roosevelt (was) the last president to come to the Congress to ask for permission to engage into war."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/05/charles-rangel/charlie-rangel-says-last-president-seek-congressio/	During an April 4, 2011, interview with the Fox Business network, Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-N.Y., discussed the recent U.S. intervention in Libya with host Andrew Napolitano. Napolitano introduced Rangel to viewers as "an intellectually honest, progressive member of Congress who believes that we have not followed the law and the moral rules of engagement in Libya." During the interview, Napolitano asked Rangel, "Have you received a request from the president for authorization to use the military? Have you received a request for the president to bring about regime change? Have you received a request from the president for a declaration of war in Libya?" Rangel replied, "No. It is true that he did send his Cabinet to brief us as to the reasoning that he made it, but you know, it's three things, the Constitution, the constitution, the constitution. And ever since Franklin Roosevelt, the last president to come to the Congress to ask for permission to engage into war, what I really don't understand … is that when you talk about -- you use the word put our young people in harm's way, what a sacrifice." Was Franklin Roosevelt really the "last president to come to the Congress to ask for permission to engage into war"? The answer is -- sort of. First, some background on presidential and congressional war powers. The Constitution (Article I, Section 8) assigns the right to declare war to Congress. But the last time that actually happened was at the beginning of World War II, when Roosevelt was president. Since then, presidents have generally initiated military activities using their constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief without having an official declaration of war in support of their actions. Most controversially, in August 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson asked Congress to back his effort to widen the U.S. role in Vietnam. He received it with enactment of the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, which passed both chambers of Congress, including the Senate with only two dissenting votes. As the Vietnam War turned sour, lawmakers became increasingly frustrated at their seemingly secondary role in sending of U.S. troops abroad. So in 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution, which was enacted over a veto by President Richard Nixon. The resolution required that, in the absence of a declaration of war, the president must report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into hostilities and must terminate the use of U.S. armed forces within 60 days unless Congress permits otherwise. Since its enactment, the War Powers Resolution has triggered consultations and official communications about foreign interventions more than 100 times, according to the Congressional Research Service. (All of them occurred while Rangel was a Member of Congress.) We’ve pored over the full list and have whittled it down to a half-dozen examples in which presidents have actively sought legislative support -- rather than just informing lawmakers of a military fait-accompli. In several cases, votes were held and authorizing resolutions were passed. President Gerald Ford: On April 10, 1975, three weeks before the fall of Saigon, Ford asked Congress, in the words of the CRS, "to clarify its limitation on the use of forces in Vietnam to insure evacuation of U.S. citizens and to cover some Vietnamese nationals, but legislation to this effect was not completed." Ford went ahead and used helicopters, Marines and fighter aircraft to evacuate U.S. citizens and others from South Vietnam. President Ronald Reagan: Shortly before the expected signing of an agreement initiating a peacekeeping force to oversee the Israeli handover of the the Sinai to Egypt, Reagan asked for congressional authorization for the U.S. military to take part. Congress passed such a resolution, and Reagan signed it on Dec. 29, 1981. Two years later, with U.S. Marines participating in a multinational force in Lebanon, Congress passed a resolution, signed by Reagan on Oct. 12, 1983, that authorized forces to remain for 18 months. Less than two weeks later, a pair of trucks packed with explosives rammed into a barracks compound in Beirut, killing 241 American service members and 58 others. The suicide attack prompted Reagan to withdraw U.S. forces. President George H.W. Bush: After Iraq’s Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, Bush ordered troops to the region to protect Kuwait’s neighbors and prepare for a possible counterattack against Hussein. After pressure from lawmakers who wanted a voice in the military buildup, Bush, in a Jan. 8, 1991, letter, requested support from Congress to act -- militarily if necessary -- to enforce United Nations Security Council resolutions related to the conflict. The resolution would not be an official declaration of war but rather an "authorization for use of military force." Both chambers passed the resolution on Jan. 12, 1991, and the U.S. and its allies began an offensive less than a week later. President Bill Clinton: Amid a a civil war and humanitarian crisis in Somalia, Bush sent forces to the east African nation in late 1992 in advance of a U.N. deployment. Shortly after Bush left office, his successor, Clinton, set about securing congressional backing for the mission. The Senate passed a resolution on Feb. 4, 1993, and the House followed on May 25, 1993. But the two resolutions were different, and they were never passed by both chambers in reconciled form. After a difficult deployment, Clinton withdrew U.S. troops by March 1994. President George W. Bush: Within a week after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Bush secured an Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution that provided support for, among other things, U.S. entry into Afghanistan, where al-Qaida terrorists had set up bases. The resolution said that "the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons." Attacks on Afghanistan commenced within weeks of enactment. Bush’s second, and more controversial, Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution was passed in advance of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which aimed to oust Hussein from power. Enacted Oct. 16, 2002, the resolution authorized the president to "use the armed forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to (1) defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and (2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq." The invasion began in March 2003. All told, then, at least six of the 12 presidents since Franklin Roosevelt have come to Congress to seek support for military actions. So how does this square with Rangel’s comment? A Rangel spokeswoman told PolitiFact that "the congressman's argument is that presidents have the constitutional obligation to seek congressional authorization before engaging our country in a military conflict, not through resolutions afterward. The last official war declared by Congress was World War II. Subsequent conflicts were initiated by the executive branch." But we see the evidence as more mixed. • Rangel is correct that no president has sought a formal declaration of war since Roosevelt. • Each president has been careful about the phrasing of his request to Congress. Even as presidents ask for Congress’ support -- something seen as politically useful, even necessary -- they always take pains to note that they are doing so voluntarily, without ceding any presidential prerogatives. So when Rangel says that "Franklin Roosevelt (was) the last president to come to the Congress to ask for permission" to go to war, he has a point. No president since Roosevelt has come to seek "permission" from Congress for military action. However, presidents have repeatedly come to Congress to seek "support" for military action. • What is the definition of "war"? Of the seven post-War Powers Resolution examples listed above, one came at the end of a genuine war (the fall of Saigon) and three involved more limited peacekeeping or humanitarian missions (Sinai, Lebanon and Somalia). None of these would be solid examples of a president seeking congressional backing to engage in "war" by its strictest definition. However, we think most people would consider the other three cases -- the Persian Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq -- genuine wars. And in each of those cases, the president sought congressional support (reluctantly or otherwise) before initiating hostilities and ultimately received it (with varying degrees of unanimity). So where does this leave us? Rangel is right that Roosevelt is the last president, strictly speaking, "to come to the Congress to ask for permission to engage into war." But at least two presidents -- both George Bushes -- have waited to launch wars until they had an official vote from Congress backing them up. On balance, we rate Rangel’s statement Half True.

pomt-00054	Veterans should vote Republican "because the damn Democrats blocked the VA Healthcare bill again."	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/03/blog-posting/facebook-meme-miscounts-votes-claim-democrats-bloc/	One of Donald Trump's campaign pledges was to improve healthcare for veterans. The problem has long been recognized, although we rated Trump's claim that thousands of veterans were dying because they couldn't get treatment fast enough as Half True. Now a meme is making the rounds on Facebook, shared more than 187,000 times, accusing the Democrats of trying to thwart improvements to medical care through the Veterans Affairs system. "I urge all veterans to vote Republican this November because the damn Democrats blocked the VA healthcare bill again," James Hauser asserts in an all-caps message posted Oct. 4. This meme was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We sent a Facebook message to Hauser asking for specifics, but didn't hear back. In fact, legislation to improve the system passed Congress last spring with bipartisan support, contrary to the meme's assertion. In May, the U.S. Senate gave final passage to a major overall of the health care system and sent it to Trump for his signature. The measure, S-2372 known as the VA MISSION Act, was designed to make it easier for veterans to get care from private physicians who are not in the VA system and, in theory, speed the delivery of care. It passed the House 347 to 70 on May 16, 2018. Democrats made up 116 of those 347 winning votes. All of the opponents were Democrats. It passed the Senate 92 to 5 on May 23, 2018. Democrats made nearly half the winning votes. The "Nay" votes were cast by two Democrats, two Republicans and one Independent. In short, precisely two thirds of the Democrats in Congress voted for the bill. To make the claim that "Democrats blocked the VA healthcare bill" strikes us a meme malpractice.

On Sept. 5, the New York Times Opinion desk published the op-ed, authored by an unnamed top official in the Trump administration. The author says he or she is one of many top officials "working diligently from within to frustrate parts of (Trump’s) agenda and his worst inclinations." People inside and outside the White House continue to speculate on the writer’s identity, and some bloggers have jumped on the opportunity to spread misinformation. One example comes from TheLibertyNews.us with this headline: "BREAKING: White House ‘Resistance’ mole a fake – NY Times admits they were trolled." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story was copied word-for-word from one of America’s Last Line of Defense websites, and it attributes the op-ed to Art Tubolls, "an infamous liberal troll on the Soros payroll." Art Tubolls’ anagram Busta Troll is a pen name for Christopher Blair — the man who runs those sites, which are among the biggest sources of false news online. In addition to the fake author, the false article quotes a fake source: "senior editor John Pragerski." The New York Times does not have an editor with that name. While the America’s Last Line of Defense websites call themselves satire, TheLibertyNews.us did not include a disclaimer on its home page or on the story.

pomt-02432	"In 1968, a full-time worker earning minimum wage, could actually support a family of three above the poverty line. Today, that same worker would earn less than the poverty line for a family of two."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/mar/03/virginia-interfaith-center-public-policy/va-interfaith-center-says-minimum-wage-households-/	Pro and con, about a dozen speakers came forward last month when the House of Delegates Commerce and Labor Committee invited comment on bills to raise Virginia’s minimum wage. Robin Gahan, the director of programs at the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, urged an increase, saying families can’t get by on the bottom rate of $7.25 an hour, which is also the national floor. "In 1968, a full-time worker earning minimum wage could actually support a family of three above the poverty line," Gahan said. "Today, that same worker would earn less than the poverty line for a family of two." The Republican-controlled committee went on to kill three bills this winter that would have increased the minimum wage, maintaining that raising the rate would force employers to cut jobs. But the issue remains alive in Washington, where the U.S. Senate this spring is expected to vote on legislation that would raise the national minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. So we looked into the Interfaith Center’s claim. Gahan pointed us to a December 2013 report by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank that advocates boosting the wage. A graph measures the minimum wage over the years against household poverty levels. In 1968, the minimum wage for most workers was $1.60 an hour. An employee working at that rate for 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, would have earned $3,328. That was above the poverty thresholds that year for a three person-household: $2,817 annually for a home headed by a man and $2,516 for a home headed by a woman. The minimum wage was bifurcated back then, however, and a small group of employees -- including workers at schools, public hospitals, laundries, hotels and motels -- could be paid as little as $1.15 an hour. Those employees, working full time every week of the year, would have earned $2,392 annually and fallen below the poverty line for a three-person household. Congress ended the dual minimum wages in 1978. Now, let’s move forward to modern times. The $7.25 hourly minimum was established in 2009. A full-time minimum wage earner makes $15,080 a year. That falls slightly below the average 2013 poverty threshold for a family of two, which is $15,156. There are a few details about all these numbers that should be noted: In the 1960s and 1970s, the yearly earnings for full-time minimum wage workers skirted the poverty line for supporting a family of three. It rose above when the wage was increased and fell below when the new rate languished for a few years. The minimum wage has not supported a family of three above the poverty line since 1980. The minimum wage has supported a household of two above the poverty line only during six years since 1984. The longest run came from 2009 through 2012, after the wage was raised 70 cents an hour to its current rate of $7.25. In 1968, the year cited by the Interfaith Center to begin its comparison, the buying power of most minimum wage workers was at an all-time high, according to the Congressional Research Service. The $1.60 an hour rate paid to most of the earners, when adjusted for inflation, translates to $10.75 an hour today. Our ruling There’s a slight snag in the first part of the Virginia Interfaith Center’s claim that, in 1968, a full- time minimum wage earner could support a household of three above the poverty line. The wage was bifurcated then. The majority earning $1.60 an hour could support a family of three, but a small group of workers qualifying for $1.15 an hour would have lived below the poverty line The second part of the center’s claim -- that a full-time worker today could not raise a family of two on the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour -- holds up. Clearly, the buying power of the minimum wage has decreased in recent decades. The center tried to illustrate that point with a statement that is accurate but needs a little clarification. So we rate its claim Mostly True.	None	Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy	None	None	None	2014-03-03T00:00:00	2014-02-04	['None']
pomt-11063	"$1 billion—that’s how much Bruce Rauner has wasted with his budget crisis."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/jun/25/jb-pritzker/did-rauner-really-pour-1-billion-down-drain/	Big, round numbers play well in politics and this election year, "$1 billion" is having its moment in the race for Illinois governor. First there was Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner proclaiming in a commercial that the budget he proposed earlier this year contained a $1 billion tax break for Illinoisans. We rated the same claim Mostly False after he unveiled his budget plan in February. Now, Rauner’s fall challenger, Democrat J.B. Pritzker, is out with an ad skewering the incumbent for squandering the same amount in taxpayer dollars. "$1 billion—that’s how much Bruce Rauner has wasted with his budget crisis," the ad asserts. "Bruce Rauner poured that money down the drain." There’s no doubt Rauner, as the state’s chief executive, played a starring role in the prolonged budget showdown with the legislature that left the state without a spending plan for two years. But he had plenty of co-stars, among them House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton, both Chicago Democrats. Pritzker’s attack is as short on detail as it is sharp on condemnation. Where does that $1 billion figure come from and why should Rauner own it? The ad doesn’t say, so we decided to take a look. Adding it all up The answer to the first question is simple. A spokesman for the Pritzker campaign said the number comes from Democratic State Comptroller Susana Mendoza, the keeper of the state’s books and a frequent Rauner critic. Mendoza calculated that the state racked up $1.03 billion in late payment penalties in 2017, largely because the budget standoff led to major delays in paying state vendors for their services. The budget impasse dragged on because the governor and Democrats who run the legislature had very different policy, tax and spending priorities. As a lawyer might put it, there was plenty of contributory negligence—not to mention gamesmanship and plain old stubborness—to go around. In short, the budget became hostage to an ideological debate centered on so-called Turnaround Agenda demands from Rauner that Democrats argued were largely unrelated to a state spending plan. In dispute were issues that included the imposition of term limits for legislators, a freeze on local property taxes, and workers’ compensation cuts. Also fueling the budget crisis and the bill backlog that grew with it was a significant drop in revenue after a temporary state income tax increase expired, reducing the rate from 5 percent to 3.75 percent just days before Rauner was sworn into office in 2015. Rauner had pressed the legislature to let it lapse, and Madigan and Cullerton obliged over the objections of then Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, who lost to the Republican in November 2014. State law mandated the rate reduction at the end of that year, but Quinn urged lawmakers to step in and prevent it. "I warned there would be dire catastrophe in my budget address and I laid out what the catastrophe could look like in an attempt to try and get the legislature to extend it, but no Republicans came forward and many Democrats were leery before November's election," Quinn told us in a phone interview. "They simply did not want to vote on revenue before November—Democrats and Republicans." It’s also worth noting that, even before the 2014 tax cut, the state had been accruing large penalties for tardy bill payments. A report from the Civic Federation, a Chicago-based budget watchdog, shows late payment interest penalties totaled more than $600 million in the three years prior to the budget standoff. David Merriman, an economist who heads the Fiscal Futures Project at the University of Illinois, sees the penalties as evidence of the state’s legacy of poor fiscal management, with government leaders of both parties approving budgets for nearly two decades that balanced out only on paper. "The fiscal situation has been unsustainable, [Rauner] inherited it, it got worse under Rauner because they didn't have a budget for two years and because he didn't control spending," Merriman said. "That’s his fault, but it’s also the legislature's fault." Eventually, after two years of operating on autopilot and jeopardizing a number of critical services in the process, lawmakers last summer did put a budget in place that included an income tax rate hike, which provided a big jump in revenue. Rauner had vetoed that plan, but a handful of Republicans joined Democrats to override his rejection. Our ruling A recent Pritzker campaign ad says Rauner "wasted" $1 billion "with his budget crisis." Pritzker’s ad seeks to blame Rauner for the entirety of a huge tab the state ran up last year on interest penalties for late payment of bills. The problem was significantly aggravated by a two-year budget standoff in Springfield that left many state services running on autopilot but with insufficient revenues to cover the costs. Rauner clearly played a key role in that logjam and it may be smart politics on Pritzker’s part to try to blame the mess entirely on the incumbent. But Rauner hardly acted alone. What’s more, running up an expensive late payment tab isn’t unique to the Rauner era. Chronic fiscal mismanagement over many administrations has made it harder for the state to pay bills in a timely fashion—even when the income tax rate was higher and more revenue was flowing in. Pritzker’s ad has its number straight, but uses it to blame Rauner alone for an unfortunate legacy that is shared by many. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14865	"After Sandy Hook, Ted Cruz stopped Obama’s push for new gun control laws."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/nov/13/courageous-conservatives-pac/pro-ted-cruz-pac-says-cruz-stopped-obama-push-gun-/	A group supporting Ted Cruz for president took a jab at another big-state Cuban American hopeful in a video ad that debuted before the Nov. 10, 2015, Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee. The 60-second spot from the Courageous Conservatives PAC suggests that unlike Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida doesn’t have a record to celebrate. The group is a super PAC, meaning it may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money from sources including corporations and unions to campaign independently for candidates for federal office. We noticed this pro-Cruz claim in its ad: "After Sandy Hook, Ted Cruz stopped Obama’s push for new gun control laws." The ad’s reference to the Dec. 14, 2012, shootings at a Connecticut school drew a rebuke from Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who said the ad made him want to throw up, according to a news story in the Hartford Courant. Murphy said: "If Ted Cruz wants to brandish his pro-gun credentials to Republican primary voters, that's his right. But it's sick that he thinks he'll win votes by specifically pointing out that in the wake of 20 dead first-graders, he was the face of the fight to ensure no action was taken." To be fair, Cruz doesn’t control the Courageous Conservatives PAC; that would be a legal no-no. Still, did Cruz stop Obama’s gun-control plans, as the group says? That seemed unlikely in that the Texan was only elected to the Senate a few weeks before a man entered Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and killed 20 children and six adults, prompting calls for stiffer gun laws from President Barack Obama and others. We asked a PAC contact for its backup information. In a Facebook message, consultant Rick Shaftan said the ad was based on Cruz's comments in an Oct. 29, 2015, interview with Bret Baier, chief political anchor for Fox News. Cruz told Baier: "Over two years ago, following the tragic shootings in Newtown, Conn., the Democrats came out with a massive raft of new gun control proposals. I led the opposition against it. … We defeated every one of those proposals on the floor of the Senate, defending the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms." Cruz opposed gun-control proposals To get a fix on Cruz’s role in the 2013 debate, we checked news accounts and the Congressional Record, which recaps each speech and floor vote. On Jan. 3, 2013, the day he was sworn in, Cruz hammered his opposition to gun-control proposals, saying the tragic school shootings didn’t justify efforts to curb Second Amendment rights. "I think every parent who saw what happened in Newtown was understandably horrified," Cruz told reporters, but "I also think, predictably and sadly, within minutes of that horrific crime we saw politicians out trying to exploit that tragedy and to push their gun control agenda." About a week later, Cruz responded to Vice President Joe Biden’s vow that Obama would use executive action where he could to help stop gun violence. Cruz said on Facebook: "Let us hope that this is just another one of the vice president's infamous gaffes and not another end-run of Congress and the constitutional balance of powers through unilateral action by the president. I stand ready to defend the Second Amendment and efforts to undermine our God-given rights." Cruz subsequently stuck to his guns. At a Jan. 30, 2013, hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for instance, the former solicitor general of Texas urged members to "be vigorous and unrelenting in working to prevent, to deter and to punish violent criminals. I have spent a substantial portion of my professional life working in law enforcement. And the tragedies that are inflicted on innocent Americans every day by criminals are heartbreaking, and we need to do more to prevent them. "At the same time," Cruz said, "I think we should remain vigilant in protecting the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. And I think far too often, the approaches that have been suggested by this Congress to the issue of gun violence restricts the liberties of law-abiding citizens rather than targeting the violent criminals that we should be targeting." On April 11, 2013, Cruz was on the losing end of a 68-31 Senate vote to let the body — which then had a Democratic majority — move toward considering a proposal to "ensure that all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a firearm are listed in the national instant criminal background check system and require a background check for every firearm sale." Some 16 Republicans joined Democrats in agreeing to proceed. Six days later, though, the Senate blocked or defeated every major gun-control proposal championed by Obama, The Washington Post reported. A CNN news report said "fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association led a backlash by conservative Republicans and a few Democrats from pro-gun states that doomed key proposals in the gun package, even after they had been watered down to try to satisfy opponents." The failed proposals included attempts to ban certain military-style assault rifles and limit the size of ammunition magazines, the Post story said. "But the biggest setback for the White House was the defeat of a measure to expand background checks to most gun sales," designed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill, the story said. The described proposal, presented by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Patrick Toomey, R-Penn., would have expanded criminal background checks to gun shows and Internet sales, but did not require them of family members and friends giving or selling guns to each other. It was seen as a compromise, replacing stricter language from Majority Leader Harry Reid’s Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Senators voted 54-46 to proceed, but that margin still left supporters short of the 60 votes needed to ward off a filibuster. It wasn’t an entirely partisan split; several Republicans voted to proceed, several Democrats voted "no." In other votes that day, the Post said, 40 senators supported a renewal of a federal assault-weapons ban and 46 supported limiting the size of ammunition magazines. In addition, an NRA-backed measure that clarified gun-trafficking laws fell short, with just 58 votes, stunning Democrats, the newspaper said. Afterward, Obama blamed the NRA for stoking unreasonable fears. He also laid the blame on Republicans, the Post reported. "Ninety percent of Democrats in the Senate voted for that idea, but it’s not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans just voted against it," Obama said. Opponents maintained the Manchin-Toomey background check proposal eventually would have led to a national gun registry, though the proposal outlawed a federal registry. The opponents also said it would do little to prevent mass shootings while creating an imposition for law-abiding citizens, especially those in rural areas. The Post story quoted Cruz telling colleagues: "My biggest concern with the legislation, the Democrat legislation on the floor, is it doesn’t address the problem. It doesn’t target violent criminals. Instead, what it does is, it targets law-abiding citizens." An alternate approach Cruz was among the critical 46 "no" votes. He also separately joined Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, in authoring a substitute proposal, reportedly supported by the NRA. At the substitute’s unveiling, according to a news story in The Hill, a Washington, D.C., newspaper, Cruz said that while the Obama administration was continuing to "politicize a terrible tragedy to push its anti-gun agenda, I am proud to stand beside my fellow senators to present common-sense measures." The Grassley-Cruz alternative did not impose background checks on transactions at gun shows or on sales over the Internet. But it would have provided incentives for states to submit relevant mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and required federal courts to do so. It also would have allocated money for prosecuting violations of the background check requirement. In the Senate, the Grassley-Cruz proposal was favored 52-46, hence stalling out due to the 60-vote hurdle. Our ruling The pro-Cruz PAC said that after the Sandy Hook shootings, "Cruz stopped Obama’s push for new gun control laws." Actually, Cruz had company in stopping the Obama-supported push for new restrictions. Crucially, most Senate Republicans and a few Democrats kept the expansion of background checks favored by Obama from winning further consideration. Still, we see an element of truth here. Despite just joining the Senate, Cruz frequently spoke out on the issue and shared authorship of an unsuccessful alternative to the failed background-check plan. We rate the statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-14884	"There’s only one of us who’s actually cut government spending -- not two, there’s one and you’re looking at him."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/10/bobby-jindal/bobby-jindal-says-hes-only-one-whos-cut-spending-c/	Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal went on the attack during the Nov. 10, 2015, Fox Business debate, at one point offering New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie a theoretical blue ribbon and a juice box for talking the conservative talk. But Jindal said only he has been doing the conservative walking. "Here’s the dirty little secret," Jindal said. "You’re gonna hear a lot of Republicans tonight in this debate and the next one talk about cutting government spending. It’s gonna sound great. There’s only one of us who’s actually cut government spending -- not two, there’s one and you’re looking at him." Jindal has previously boasted that he’s the only one to cut government spending. Is it true? The answer: it depends on the analysis. Jindal’s evidence Jindal also makes the claim that he’s "the only candidate to actually cut spending" on his website, citing a report by libertarian think tank the Cato Institute. (When we last looked into this claim in August, a spokesperson for Jindal confirmed that this is what he was referring to.) According to Cato, Jindal is indeed the only governor out of the six running to have cut spending (Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry dropped out after the Cato report was published). During his seven-year tenure as Louisiana's chief, Jindal reduced spending by an average of 1.76 percent every year. Every other governor increased spending, Cato said. Here’s a graph from Jindal’s campaign, which is based off of Cato’s analysis: "Bobby Jindal shows the most fiscal restraint," the Cato report concludes. Much of the reduction, reported the Times-Picayune in 2011, is "explained by waning hurricane recovery appropriations and the end of federal stimulus aid." However, the Cato report is just one way, and something of a simplistic way, to look at the state budget picture. It fails to consider the different per-capita income levels across different states (higher incomes bring more government services and thus spending), different approaches to handling federal money (Ohio Gov. John Kasich, for example, took the Medicaid expansion while Jindal did not), and different time periods, lists Alan Auerbach, a professor of public finance at the University of California at Berkeley. Unlike Jindal and other sitting governors, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee and George Pataki weren’t leading their states through economic downturns. Auerbach explains: "During recessions, balanced-budget requirements have typically forced states to cut spending, in addition to legislating tax increases." Kasich himself takes issue with Cato’s analysis, arguing that Cato focused on a specific pool of money known as the general revenue fund. Kasich prefers instead to look at the all-funds budget, a much larger pot of federal and state money. (Cato’s response: "Our data is correct, and so is his. Kasich seems to pick the dataset that shed the best light on him.") Chris Edwards, Cato’s director of tax policy, argued that the general fund data is more recent and perhaps more relevant than the all-funds. "Governors have more direct control over the general fund budget," he said. "A lot of the non-general fund budget comes from the federal government, which governors don’t have much control over." Another way to run the numbers Others have looked at this question and come up with different results. If we look at all-funds and adjust for the time differences, four governors actually out-cut Jindal, according to a fact-check by Fox News, which compared each governor’s budgets to their contemporaries (in other words, how Bush stacked up against other governors in the 2000s, and how Jindal is doing compared to sitting governors). The two top spenders by Cato’s count, Bush and Kasich, actually ranked best in Fox News’ analysis. Bush and Kasich slashed spending by 3.66 percent and 1.76 percent respectively. Jindal, meanwhile, came in at No. 5 on the Fox News analysis, with an average reduction of 0.25 percent per year. Here’s Fox’s breakdown: This is still an imperfect way of comparing the budget records of the various governors, but to an extent, it’s fairer, Auerbach said. "Controlling for what other states did at the same time certainly is better than not controlling for time period," he said. "One might do better still by controlling for relative economic conditions in the different states but … the controls are reasonable." Our ruling Jindal said, "There’s only one of us who’s actually cut government spending -- not two, there’s one and you’re looking at him." To his credit, a Cato report backs his claim. However, there’s more than one way of looking at spending cuts. One other approach that an expert said is valid suggests that Jindal was out-cut by four other governors. Jindal’s claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.	None	Bobby Jindal	None	None	None	2015-11-10T22:40:27	2015-11-10	['None']
pomt-07423	"Large majorities" of the public "oppose major changes to Medicare" and favor higher taxes on the wealthy.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/25/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-said-large-majorities-favor-higher-ta/	The debate to balance the federal budget and reduce the nation's debt has raged in recent weeks, with Democrats and Republicans arguing about spending, taxes and entitlements such as Medicare. Paul Krugman wrote recently in his New York Times column that a knock-down, drag-out fight may be inevitable, given that the two parties have such different visions for the country. "So when pundits call on the parties to sit down together and talk, the obvious question is, what are they supposed to talk about? Where’s the common ground?" Krugman wrote. Krugman, who sides with the Democrats over Republicans on budget issues, said the Democrats have a winning case to present to the public. "For what it’s worth, polls suggest that the public’s priorities are nothing like those embodied in the Republican budget," Krugman said. "Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy. Large majorities — including a majority of Republicans — also oppose major changes to Medicare. Of course, the poll that matters is the one on Election Day. But that’s all the more reason to make the 2012 election a clear choice between visions." We decided to check Krugman’s numbers on the polls after a reader asked us to look into it. Let’s take the issues one at a time. "Large majorities support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy." Different polls phrase the question differently, but the bottom line is the same. We found three recent polls that back up Krugman’s point. "In order to reduce the national debt, would you support or oppose raising taxes on Americans with incomes over 250 thousand dollars a year?" Support: 72 percent. Oppose: 27 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. (ABC News/Washington Post Poll. April 14-17, 2011) "Do you support or oppose doing each of the following to deal with the federal budget deficit? … Increase taxes on income over $250,000." Support: 64 percent. Oppose: 33 percent. Unsure: 3 percent. (McClatchy-Marist Poll. April 10-14, 2011.) "Now looking ahead to next year's federal budget, do you think it should or should not include higher taxes for families with household incomes of $250,000 and above?" Should: 59 percent. Should not: 37 percent. Unsure: 4 percent. (USA Today/Gallup Poll. April 11, 2011.) Krugman seems on firm ground here. Large majorities "also oppose major changes to Medicare." Again, we found several recent poll questions addressing this point. "In order to reduce the national debt, would you support or oppose cutting spending on Medicare, which is the government health insurance program for the elderly?" Oppose: 78 percent. Support: 21 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. (ABC News/Washington Post Poll. April 14-17, 2011.) "I'm going to read you two statements about the future of the Medicare program. After I read both statements, please tell me which one comes closer to your own view. Medicare should remain as it is today, with a defined set of benefits for people over 65. OR, Medicare should be changed so that people over 65 would receive a check or voucher from the government each year for a fixed amount they can use to shop for their own private health insurance policy." Should remain as is: 65 percent. Should be changed: 34 percent. Unsure: 2 percent. (Also from the ABC News/Washington Post Poll. April 14-17, 2011.) "Do you think the government should completely overhaul Medicare to control the cost of the program, make major changes to Medicare but not completely overhaul it, make minor changes to Medicare, or should the government not try to control the costs of Medicare?" Not try to control costs: 27 percent. Minor changes: 34 percent. Major changes: 18 percent. Completely overhaul: 13 percent. Unsure: 8 percent. (USA Today/Gallup Poll. April 11, 2011.) "In order to reduce the federal budget deficit, would you be willing or not willing to reduce spending on Medicare, the government health insurance program for seniors?" Not willing: 76 percent. Willing: 22 percent. Don't know/No answer: 2 percent. (CBS News Poll. March 18-21, 2011.) "Do you think it will be necessary to cut spending on Medicare, the federal government health care program for seniors, in order to significantly reduce the federal budget deficit?" No: 54 percent. No opinion: 27 percent. Yes: 18 percent. Not sure: 1 percent. (NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll. Feb. 24-26, 2011.) "For each (government program), please tell me if you think significantly cutting the funding is totally acceptable, mostly acceptable, mostly unacceptable, totally unacceptable: Medicare." Totally unacceptable: 46 percent. Mostly unacceptable: 30 percent. Mostly acceptable: 16 percent. Totally acceptable: 7 percent. Unsure: 1 percent. (Also from NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll. Feb. 24-26, 2011.) Those numbers express widespread opposition to cutting Medicare. And indeed, when the Wall Street Journal reported its results in February, Republican pollster Bill McInturff said the results were "a huge flashing yellow sign for Republicans on how much preparation will be needed if they propose to change Social Security and Medicare." As we were working on this report, a new poll was released suggesting that the public might not be so opposed to changes in Medicare. We should note that these results were released publicly after Krugman's column appeared. As explained in the Principles of PolitiFact and the Truth-O-Meter, our rulings are based on the information known at the time the person made the remarks. "In order to reduce the budget deficit, it has been proposed that Medicare should be changed from a program in which the government pays doctors and hospitals for treating seniors to a program in which the government helps seniors purchase private health insurance. Would you approve or disapprove of changing Medicare in this way?" Approve: 47 percent. Disapprove: 41 percent. Don't Know/No answer: 12 percent. (New York Times/CBS News Poll. April 15-20, 2011.) The New York Times noted in its story that the response was at odds with other recent polls, and concluded that results may vary depending on how the question was asked. When we contacted Krugman for a comment, he noted that the poll came out after his column was published and that it's at odds with the other previous polls. "I strongly suspect that the Times result is an outlier -- it looks so different from everything else we're hearing," Krugman said via e-mail. We should note that Krugman parenthetically added that a majority of Republicans also opposed major changes to Medicare. We were not able to find party breakdowns for all of these polls, but the ones we did see showed that Republicans opposed changes to Medicare as well. A CBS News Poll from March showed that 67 percent of Republicans were not willing to reduce spending on Medicare. In the USA Today/Gallup poll, 33 percent of Republicans said the government should not try to control the costs of Medicare, with another 28 percent of Republicans said the government should make only minor changes. Our ruling Krugman said that "large majorities" support support higher, not lower, taxes on the wealthy, and recent polls support that point. On Medicare, several polls suggest that large majorities, including a majority of Republicans, oppose major changes to the program. One poll, released after Krugman wrote his column, showed an advantage for the Ryan plan. But the preponderance of evidence at the time Krugman made his statement bears him out. We rate his statement True.	None	Paul Krugman	None	None	None	2011-04-25T15:30:04	2011-04-18	['None']
pomt-11507	"Gov. Rick Scott made it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun, even a mental health professional. This law was so dangerous that a court had to strike it down."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/feb/22/giffords/florida-gov-rick-scott-made-it-illegal-doctors-tal/	A TV ad airing in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting targets Florida Gov. Rick Scott over his support for a controversial gun measure. The ad was produced by Giffords, an organization that fights gun violence and is named for former Arizona U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Giffords was shot in the head in 2011. The ad references three recent Florida shootings, in Parkland, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, and then goes after Scott. "We need to stop dangerous people from getting guns. But Gov. Rick Scott made it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun, even a mental health professional. This law was so dangerous that a court had to strike it down." Does the ad cast Scott’s position, and the reaction of the court, correctly? We decided to find out. The law behind the ad, ‘docs vs. glocks’ In 2011, Florida lawmakers crafted a bill to strengthen patient protection related to firearms after hearing a report of a woman in Central Florida who was turned away from her pediatrician. The bill said that health care providers couldn’t ask questions to patients or their families about whether they own a gun, unless the provider "believes that this information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others." It also stated that health care providers couldn’t discriminate against patients because they own firearms. The penalties included facing fines up to $10,000 or loss of a medical license. The bill passed the House and Senate, with a few Democrats joining in with Republicans to support the plan. Scott signed the bill into law on June 2, 2011. The ad correctly says the law applied to a "mental health professional" because Florida law defines health care practitioners as including those who are licensed to provide psychological, clinical, counseling, and psychotherapy services. But did the law make it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun? The 2011 law didn’t expressly state that doctors couldn’t ask patients if they owned a gun. But it did limit their ability to do so by stating that providers "should refrain from making a written inquiry or asking questions concerning the ownership of a firearm" unless in "good faith" they believe "that this information is relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the safety of others, may make such a verbal or written inquiry." The law failed to detail what would qualify as meeting that standard. Critics say it created a chilling effect for doctors who stopped asking questions out of fear they would face discipline. Court struck down some provisions as unconstitutional After nearly six years of litigation, in February 2017 the 11th Circuit Federal Appeals Court ruled that some provisions of the law were unconstitutional, including the part that prevented providers from asking patients about guns. The bill’s "record-keeping and inquiry provisions prevent doctors and medical professionals from asking all patients, or all patients with children, whether they own firearms or have firearms in their homes, or from recording answers to such questions." A medical professional, for example, would violate the law "if he or she gives all new patients an intake questionnaire which asks about firearms in the home," the court wrote. "This law was so dangerous that a court had to strike it down." The ruling addressed the danger of the law in a few ways. First, the court addressed the danger of doctors facing a "credible threat of prosecution." The court wrote that when the alleged danger of legislation is self-censorship harm, "can be realized even without an actual prosecution." Second, the court concluded that the legislation did not provide a means by which patients could hear from their doctors about firearms and firearm safety. In the fields of medicine and public health "information can save lives" and doctors, therefore, "must be able to speak frankly and openly to patients," the court wrote. The court wrote that some medical organizations believe that unsecured firearms increase risks of injuries and are a leading cause of death for some age groups. That’s why major medical groups "recommend that doctors and pediatricians routinely ask patients about firearm ownership, and educate them about the dangers posed to children by firearms that are not safely secured." Thomas Julin, a First Amendment lawyer who represented a coalition of medical groups as "friends of the court," told PolitiFact that the court was not attempting to determine whether the law was so dangerous that it had to strike it down. "It was trying to determine whether the state had sufficient evidence to show that the law would advance the interests that it supposedly had been enacted to serve," he wrote. However, the law did create a danger that health care providers would censor their own speech -- which they did do to avoid possible discipline. "When one speaks of the law being dangerous, I think most people would understand that to mean not simply that it created a danger of self-censorship, but that the law deterred health care providers from providing advice to patients that would be used to prevent firearm accidents," Julin said. "I think that is a fair characterization of what the law likely did because it apparently did deter health care providers not only from making inquiries of their patients but also from providing advice to their patients regarding the dangers of firearms and ammunition ownership and how that could be mitigated." We asked Scott’s press office if he had any evidence to refute the claims in the ad, but his spokeswoman did not directly answer our question and said that Scott was "focused on finding real solutions to keep students safe." Scott showed support when the Legislature passed the bills. "I look forward to seeing those bills," Scott said in April 2011. "I believe in the right to bear arms." Our ruling A Giffords TV ad said, "Gov. Rick Scott made it illegal for a doctor to ask a patient if they owned a gun, even a mental health professional. This law was so dangerous that a court had to strike it down." Scott didn’t act alone -- he signed the law after the Legislature passed it in 2011. The bill didn’t flat out prevent doctors from asking patients if they owned a gun, but said they should refrain from asking about guns unless they believed in good faith the information was relevant to the patient’s medical care or safety. That was a vague standard, which effectively silenced some doctors, critics claimed. A federal appeals court ruled in 2017 that the inquiry provisions prevented medical professionals from asking questions about firearms. The ruling also stated that doctors faced the threat of discipline and doctors must be able to speak openly with patients to provide life-saving information. As a result of these caveats, we rate this statement Mostly True. ' See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Giffords	None	None	None	2018-02-22T15:57:16	2018-02-20	['None']
pomt-07439	"It is a fact that it costs more to run the schools in August."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/22/kathleen-angelucci/school-board-member-claims-later-start-date-says-m/	School or Six Flags? In Cobb County, home to the famed amusement park, there’s been debate for years about when is the best time to start the school year: the beginning of August or a week or two later? Students would likely choose mid-August so they can have fun at places like Six Flags. The county school board? They’ve had a hard time with this question. In 2009, the board voted to start the school year at the beginning of August. In February, the board, with some new members, voted 4-3 to start the 2011-12 school year on Aug. 15. Kathleen Angelucci, one of the new board members, tried to explain her vote at a March community meeting. Angelucci said she reviewed economic impact studies and concluded it was more cost-effective for Cobb to start classes later. "It is a fact that it costs more to run the schools in August," Angelucci said. A few Cobb parents didn’t buy her claim and asked us to investigate. We called and e-mailed Angelucci several times in recent weeks and didn’t get a reply. We finally caught up to her at an April 13 board meeting. Angelucci said she thought the issue was in the past, explaining why she didn’t get back to us. Angelucci said she would send us some data that backed up her claim by April 15. We didn’t receive a call, e-mail or letter. Cobb, with its 106,000 students and 5,925 teachers, is the second-largest school district in Georgia. Cobb initially planned to use a balanced calendar for three consecutive years, beginning with the 2010-11 school year. Students would start earlier, but get weeklong breaks during Thanksgiving, September and in February. Like other districts, Cobb would still wind up with 180 school days. Balanced school year calendar supporters contend the shorter summer vacation under a balanced calendar makes it easier for students to retain what they learned during the prior school year as opposed to the longer recess under the traditional calendar. Some academics and educators say there’s no significant difference in test scores. Some folks use the term "balanced calendar" to refer to year-round schools, but educators say there is a difference. Year-round schools typically hold classes for nine consecutive weeks and then give students the following three or four weeks off and begin the cycle again. Traditional school year proponents argue there is a financial savings in starting the school year later in August because it costs more to keep schools cool in early August, which are some of the hottest days of the year. Georgia Power spokeswoman Lynn Wallace said customer demand typically rises with the hot August temperatures. She did note that customer use rose 21 percent in February 2010 from the prior February when a cold snap hit the South and President Barack Obama approved emergency home heating funds to several southern states. Local school district officials who use a balanced calendar said they did not have data to determine if there is a cost savings, but they offered some interesting insights. Cherokee County Superintendent Frank Petruzielo told us they’ve seen fewer students dropping out and have noticed other potential financial benefits, such as fewer student and faculty absences. "The [school] days become a little more important" with a balanced calendar, said Petruzielo, offering his reason why there are fewer absences. The Cobb County school communications office provided us a spreadsheet that shows there were 41,148 substitute teacher days through March of this school year, a decline of about 15,000 days from a similar time period in the 2009-10 school year. As a result, the district paid about $1.1 million less to substitute teachers to work those days. Cobb County saw an average of about 56,437 substitute days used the prior three school years. Jack Parish, who was the superintendent of the Henry County school district when it went to a balanced calendar, said he didn’t notice much of any financial difference between starting the school year in early August as opposed to mid-August. "You are still operating your school for the same number of days," said Parish, now a lecturer at the University of Georgia. "You are running your buses the same number of days. You are running your food service operation the same number of days." Nationally, there’s little research over whether there is a cost savings by using a traditional calendar or a balanced calendar. School system officials in Vancouver, Canada, looked into whether balanced calendar school years are more cost-effective, but found much of the analysis in the blogosphere was "inadequate." Some Texas officials conducted research of its schools and concluded it is less expensive to operate on a traditional calendar. A 2004 report called "Saving Summer" by the comptroller of public accounts found electricity, gas and water bills were twice as high in August than in May. Traditional school year proponents point to Tulsa, Okla., where officials found they saved nearly $500,000 by delaying the start of the school year until after Labor Day, according to 2002 newspaper accounts. Sean Beavers, a Cobb parent who contacted PolitiFact Georgia about the Angelucci claim, sent us utility budget information he said came from the Cobb district. Beavers’ numbers show in August 2010, when the district began classes a week earlier than in the past, that utility costs were slightly lower than August 2009. Cobb officials said Thursday those numbers were accurate, but cautioned that utility costs can vary because of weather. Cobb is spending less money this school year from factors associated with the balanced calendar, according to data produced by the district. Some officials, like in Texas, have produced data that shows starting the school year earlier can cost a district more money. Area school officials who have used a balanced calendar for years say there’s not much financial difference either way. There is scant evidence that Angelucci made a valid point, and she failed to provide us anything to back up her statement. We rate her claim as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11974	"The First Amendment’s the First Amendment. It goes start to finish. We can’t say to one football coach you’re fired if you kneel in silent prayer at the end of the game, but to a player, if you kneel in protest to a game, you’re celebrated."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/02/james-lankford/sen-james-lankfords-misleading-comparison-about-nf/	What’s the difference between a football coach kneeling in prayer and an NFL player taking a knee in protest? A reader asked us to look into this question after Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., suggested the two were being treated differently under the law at a press conference on Sept. 25, 2017. "Now the First Amendment’s the First Amendment. It goes start to finish. We can’t say to one football coach, you’re fired if you kneel in silent prayer at the end of the game, but to a player, if you kneel in protest at a game, you’re celebrated," Lankford said. Is the First Amendment setting a double-standard being set when it comes to kneeling and football games? Not quite. Lankford’s comparison is misleading, as the First Amendment is only applicable to one of these cases. In addition, he doesn’t have all of the facts straight. The football coach Lankford said high school coaches have kneeled in silent prayer and have "been fired." There’s one case that fits the description, though it’s wrong to say the coach in question was fired. Lankford was referring to Joseph Kennedy, an assistant football coach at Bremerton High School in Bremerton, Wash. Kennedy led students in locker-room prayers before and after most games and prayed on the 50-yard line after games. He also gave motivational speeches on the 50-yard line that he said "likely constituted prayers," according to subsequent court documents. "Students, coaches, and other attendees from both teams were invited to participate. During the speeches, the participants kneeled around Kennedy, who raised a helmet from each team and delivered a message containing religious content," according to court documents. The school only let him pray on the 50-yard line after students and parents had left the field, which he did for awhile, but eventually returned to praying before they departed. When it came time for annual review, "the athletic director recommended that Kennedy not be rehired because Kennedy ‘failed to follow district policy’ and ‘failed to supervise student-athletes after games due to his interactions with (the) media and (the) community,’" according to court documents. In the end, Kennedy wasn’t fired. After his contract expired, alongside the five other assistant football coaches’ year-long contracts, the district opened up his position and Kennedy did not reapply. Instead, Kennedy "sought an injunction ordering the district to ‘cease discriminating against him in violation of the First Amendment.’" The district court denied the injunction and the 9th Circuit panel upheld that decision. Lankford, co-chair of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, drafted a challenge to the school district in 2015 on the issue. Lankford’s office did not provide additional examples that fit the description of his claim. The First Amendment The First Amendment protects the expression of private citizens, which the coach would have exercised if praying in the stands or the sidelines, according to Gene Policinski, chief operating officer of the Newseum’s First Amendment Center. Students (in this case comparable to the NFL players) are free to pray silently, but as public employees, coaches are only allowed to do so under circumstances in which they don’t offer an overt endorsement of their religious views. "When Kennedy kneeled and prayed on the 50-yard line immediately after games while in view of students and parents, he spoke as a public employee, not as a private citizen, and his speech therefore was constitutionally unprotected," the 9th Circuit wrote in its opinion denying Kennedy’s injunction claim. The court found that Kennedy "took advantage of his position to press his particular views upon the impressionable and captive minds before him." While there may be disagreements with the court’s ruling (like Lankford’s), the key distinction between the coach’s case and NFL players is that restriction of free speech by the First Amendment only applies to the former, as it constitutes government action. The First Amendment doesn’t apply to a privately owned company like the NFL. When kneeling, NFL players are acting as private individuals, so they enjoy the same free speech and free exercise rights that Kennedy’s players would enjoy. However, the First Amendment isn’t enough to protect them against their employers because their employers aren't the government. Only state laws, and in some cases employment contracts, can rein in the limits set by their employer, experts told us. "It does not violate the First Amendment for a private employer (or for customers/fans) to disapprove of an employee's speech," said Richard Garnett, a law professor at Notre Dame University. So while some fans may celebrate players’ kneeling in protest, it’s up to the NFL whether to take action. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Lankford said, "Now the First Amendment’s the First Amendment. It goes start to finish. We can’t say to one football coach you’re fired if you kneel in silent prayer at the end of the game, but to a player, if you kneel in protest to a game, you’re celebrated." His complaint of the First Amendment’s double standard is misleading because the First Amendment only applies to government action, or the public high school football coach. The First Amendment doesn’t protect NFL players’ speech, which is under the purview of their employer. Additionally, the football coach Lankford discussed wasn’t fired; he failed to reapply once his contract ended. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-03067	"For the last decade, Floridians’ salaries have shrunk substantially" when adjusted for inflation.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/oct/01/dan-gelber/dan-gelber-says-florida-paychecks-arent-going-far-/	Gov. Rick Scott is using "gimmicks" to take credit for an economic recovery in Florida, Miami attorney and former state Sen. Dan Gelber writes in an article for the online website, ContextFlorida. "Scott’s self-congratulatory claims of success simply don’t comport with the harsh facts that for the last decade, Floridians’ salaries have shrunk substantially while the cost of living has increased," Gelber wrote. We decided to fact-check Gelber’s claim. First, however, we have to clear up some confusion Gelber created with his statement. Taken literally, Gelber argues that salaries in Florida decreased over the past decade, while the cost of living increased. But what Gelber was trying to say is that Floridians’ paychecks don’t go as far today as they did a decade ago. Put another way, salaries "have shrunk substantially" when adjusted for inflation. Inflation is another way of saying cost of living. As evidence to that claim, Gelber pointed to a report produced by economists at Florida International University called the "State of Working Florida 2013." The report looks at the "economic lives" of Floridians, mostly working in the private sector, from periods of time between 2000 and 2012. Using statistics from 2004-12, the report concludes that the median wage of all salary and wage employees fell 4.34 percent when adjusted for inflation. Put another way, people’s paychecks in 2004 went further than they do today. We sought out other economists and studies to see what they had to say on the topic, which produced several caveats. Alan Hodges, an extension scientist the University of Florida’s Food & Resource Economics Department, noted that issues with salaries are not isolated to Florida. Salaries "have been stagnant over the last decade nationally," he said, the result of the economic slowdown following Sept. 11, 2001, and the later global economic recession. Florida’s economy was "interrupted by two pretty severe shocks to the economy," said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness. But saying that salaries have shrunk substantially "is painting a more grim picture than what the reality is as far as wages and income in the state," he said. The U.S. Census Bureau, which collects information from individuals and households, provides figures on median earnings -- that’s the midway point where half of households earn more and half earn less. Many economists prefer median figures because "average" salaries can be skewed by outliers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 1999 (when information was collected for the 2000 census), median wages in Florida for men 16 and over who worked full-time, year-round were $32,212 and for women, $25,480. Adjusted for inflation, men would have to earn $44,389, and women, $35,112, in 2012 to keep pace. But in 2012, census figures showed that men made a median salary of $40,889 annually while women earned $34,202. That's about an 8 percent decrease in buying power for men and about a 3 percent decrease for women over that time period. The 8 percent decline for men is "substantial," Hodges said. Another way to crunch the numbers comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles average annual pay. Using their statistics from 2000 to 2012, economists said that average pay -- when adjusted for inflation -- actually increased 6 percent. (Remember, economists generally prefer median figures because "average" salaries can be skewed by outliers.) Another issue -- besides what years you use and whether you measure median or average wages -- is how you measure inflation, economists told us. The most-typical way is by using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The CPI measures what urban consumers (about 87 percent of the population) are buying. It doesn’t reflect the spending of people living in rural areas, farm families, military and people in prisons and other institutions. The Consumer Price Index is compiled for the nation, the four regions of the country and 26 metropolitan areas. In Florida, the index measures spending in the St. Petersburg-Tampa-Clearwater area and the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area, but there isn't a Consumer Price Index compiled on a state-by-state basis. That can be an issue when considering a Florida-based claim. In the FIU study Gelber cited, cost-of-living figures are based on numbers for the southern region, which is comprised of Washington, D.C., and 16 states, including Florida, Texas, Alabama and Virginia. Jessica Sims, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Economic Opportunity, said that "using a regional or national CPI would not be appropriate" to adjust Florida salaries for inflation. Added Troy Martin, an economist with the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis: "Consumers in different areas are consuming different goods and services that make comparison difficult. Someone in a Manhattan condo pays $4,000 a month for a one-bedroom condo while someone in Nebraska living in a five-bedroom house may be spending $1,000 a month. How do you compare those?" That said, while CPI is not a perfect measure of cost of living, "it is the best information we have available," Hodges said. Our ruling Gelber wrote that Floridians’ "salaries have shrunk substantially while the cost of living has increased." In an un-artful way, Gelber is claiming that a Floridian’s salary doesn’t go as far today as it did a decade ago. While one calculation bucks Gelber's claim, the evidence generally backs him up. Reports show that salaries have shrunk when adjusted for inflation. The one calculation that does not is also the least persuasive. Still, economists we spoke with noted several caveats and cautioned against reaching broad conclusion. As such, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-14328	An image in a Chris Abele TV ad depicts "wealthy citizens" who would benefit from a "lake" created by the controversial Estabrook Dam.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2016/mar/29/chris-abele/image-chris-abele-ad-shows-lake-s-created-estabroo/	A new television ad from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele shows a large body of water with a sizable boat tied up in front of a two-story boathouse. That image forms the backdrop for a statement printed on the screen about his opponent’s support of repairs to the Estabrook Dam on the Milwaukee River: "Chris Larson: $5 million of taxpayer money to benefit a few wealthy citizens." The narrator takes the claim further, saying the repairs give the wealthy residents "their own lake." The message conveyed by the image is clear: These are the properties of those wealthy residents living along the lake created by the Estabrook Dam. Only they’re not. A deeper dive Before we, um, dive into this one, here is some background on the long-running debate over whether to repair the dam. Built in the 1930s, the dam -- which sits on the river just north of Milwaukee, at the border of Shorewood and Glendale -- was installed to help control flooding and to maintain swimming and water recreation in an urban setting, especially in and around Lincoln Park. It has also created generations of what amounts to lakefront living for some people. When the dam gates are closed, the river forms a 100-acre impoundment upstream. There are about 165 property owners in the area whose property abuts the water, according to a 2015 report prepared for the county. Today, the dam is in poor condition,. The state Department of Natural Resources has ordered the county to keep the gates open until the structure is either repaired or abandoned. That means the lake has been, in effect, drained, and it’s a plain-old river again. Abele and the County Board have disagreed about how to proceed. Larson himself was a member of the board before he was elected state Senator. Abele sides with the Milwaukee Riverkeepers, a coalition of environmental groups that wants the dam removed so the river can be kept in its natural state. Years ago, the North Avenue Dam, several miles downstream, was removed and experts have said the faster current has led to improved water quality, a thriving fish population and new wildlife habitat. A majority of the County Board disagrees and wants to spend about $3.4 million on repairs and $2.2 million in operating and maintenance costs over the next 20 years. As a county supervisor, Larson voted in 2009 to repair the dam. That’s the genesis of the $5 million figure Abele used in the ad. However, in a recent interview, Larson said he’s willing to consider removing the dam. Image is all wet That leads us to the image used in the ad. It looks more like Door County than the Milwaukee River. And that’s not the kind of boat or property you’d find in that area. The boat pictured is either a fishing boat or cruiser and could be up to 36-feet long, said Charles Plueddeman, an Oshkosh-based freelance writer who focuses on the marine industry. "A boat this size could be used on large lakes or offshore in salt water," he said. "When I looked at the photo my first thought was ‘this does not look like Wisconsin,’" Plueddeman said. "I've not been to that site, but I don't think it would be surrounded by the high, rocky bluffs in this photo. And that would be a very big boat to use on that little impoundment." Indeed, pontoons and jet skis are more commonly found in the area, said Clark Blachly, who owns a nearby home. "I have been up and down this river hundreds of times there is nothing remotely like this," he said. We asked Abele’s campaign manager Tia Torhorst about the image in the ad. She said it was "stock footage" and was unaware of where it was shot. In short, it’s not the Milwaukee River. We’ve seen previous -- admittedly higher profile -- instances of the wrong images being used to make point in a political ad. Earlier this year, Republican Donald Trump aired a TV ad purporting to show Mexicans swarming over "our southern border." But the footage was of African migrants streaming over a fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla. That claim was rated Pants on Fire. Our rating An Abele TV ad uses a lakefront image to criticize Chris Larson for supporting $5 million in Estabrook Dam repairs to benefit "a few wealthy citizens." But the photo used is not the Milwaukee River and the boat pictured would be woefully out of place there. We rate the claim that the image represents the area Pants on Fire.

pomt-14675	Wisconsin dropped "from second in the country to 41st" among states where more than half the students took the ACT exam.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jan/15/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/blaming-scott-walker-democrats-say-wisconsins-rank/	For years, Wisconsin leaders have expressed pride in how the state’s high school students perform on the ACT exam, which assesses students’ academic readiness for college. From 2008 through 2014, with Minnesota ranking first, Wisconsin has battled, usually with Iowa, for second or third. That is, among states where more than half of the students take the ACT. So, it was a surprise on Jan. 14, 2016 when the Wisconsin Democratic Party issued a news release declaring that Wisconsin’s ACT rank had plunged to near the bottom. "Newly released information from the (Wisconsin) Department of Instruction shows a dramatic decline in student ACT results in the past year," the news release stated, blaming Republican Gov. Scott Walker. "Test scores dropped Wisconsin from second in the country to 41st in the nation among states where more than half the students took the exam." Such a free-fall should have produced blaring headlines. But there was not even a mention of a 41st ranking in stories by Wisconsin’s leading news organizations about the scores, which had been announced a day earlier by the Department of Public Instruction. It turns out the Democratic Party came up with 41st on its own -- by mixing apples and oranges. Scores announced What made headlines from the announcement by the Department of Public Instruction were scores by younger students on a different test, the Badger Exam. More than half of Wisconsin's public school students in grades three through eight -- 51.2 percent -- were proficient or advanced in English language arts in 2014-’15, and 43.7 percent did as well in math. Meanwhile, the department’s release of the ACT scores got lesser billing in the news reports. That release stressed that the 2014-’15 school year marked the first time in Wisconsin that all juniors (11th grade) in public high schools had the opportunity to take the test. That’s because testing fees were paid by the state. In other words, the more than 64,000 juniors comprised a unique group in terms of Wisconsin students who have taken the ACT over the years. Traditionally, when state rankings on the ACT are done, the scores are for graduating seniors -- and include students from private as well as public high schools. Now to the scores. The ACT -- which tests in English, reading, writing, math and science -- is scored on a scale of 1 to 36. Wisconsin’s composite score for the public school 11th-graders for 2014-’15 was 20, according to the department’s news release. But the way to think about that score is a baseline. There won’t be a score to compare it to until the next set of public school 11th-graders takes the test. Meanwhile, the composite for the more than 46,000 graduating seniors -- the group whose scores are traditionally used to rank the states -- was higher: 22.2. The department made a point to state that comparisons between the two scores -- given that they are for two different groups of students -- are "invalid and flawed." But that’s what the Democratic Party did in its news release. The party took the 20 score for Wisconsin’s juniors and plugged it into the ACT database that compares state scores for graduating seniors. That database clearly shows that Wisconsin’s score for the traditional group, the graduating seniors in 2014-’15, was 22.2 (the same score as the previous year). The new score put Wisconsin, once again, second among states where more than half of the graduating seniors took the ACT -- behind Minnesota, which had a score of 22.7. Among all states, Wisconsin’s 22.2 ranked 18th. But the Democratic Party, using the 20 score for the group of juniors, said that score meant Wisconsin tied with Kentucky for 41st place. A spokesman for the ACT told us the party’s claim "cannot be supported" because it is "not an apples to apples comparison." And when we shared that with Brandon Weathersby, spokesman for the Democratic Party, he acknowledged the party had "flubbed" the data. Our rating The state Democratic Party said Wisconsin dropped "from second in the country to 41st" among states where more than half the students took the ACT college preparation exam. The party admits it erred, by comparing scores of two different groups of students. In fact, Wisconsin ranked second in the 2014-’15 ACT testing among states where more than half the students took the exam, not 41st. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire.	None	Democratic Party of Wisconsin	None	None	None	2016-01-15T17:03:19	2016-01-14	['None']

pomt-03068	Says "Nathan Deal killed pro-gun bills in 2013."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/oct/01/georgia-gun-owners/group-blames-deal-bill-defeat/	Gov. Nathan Deal has typically received high marks from gun advocacy groups, so we were surprised by a flier one group put together that accused him of derailing pro-gun legislation earlier this year. "Nathan Deal killed pro-gun bills in 2013. Will he do it again in 2014?" the flier read with a photo of the governor. Next to the photo were several demands. "No new mental health mandates. No new mandatory training requirements. No Gun Control, No Deals!" The fliers were paid for by Georgia Gun Owners, which describes itself on its website as "the ONLY no-compromise, no-sell out grassroots gun organization in the State of Georgia." So, we wondered, what pro-gun bills did the governor eliminate this year? Patrick Parsons, the executive director of Georgia Gun Owners, talked about the matter with the Atlanta-based weekly Creative Loafing. "Governor Deal, his staff, and others worked behind the scenes to water down pro-gun bills," Parsons said. "They wanted to run out the clock. And that's exactly what they did. We want the governor to publicly support passage of clean, pro-gun bills, not bills watered down with anti-gun amendments." The group handed out fliers in August at the governor’s "Grillin' with the Governor" event at Lake Lanier. Deal is facing a quandary, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted in April after two pro-gun bills were not passed during this year’s legislative session. The governor doesn’t want to be labeled as an obstructionist among gun supporters and have new conservative enemies during his re-election bid next year. "We do think that over this next recess period that there will be an opportunity to bring the different points of view together in a more orderly fashion than the last few days of the session allowed," Deal told the AJC. "And perhaps some middle ground can be found." PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out more about the veracity of the group’s claim. Parsons said he would provide information to back up the claim in the flier. PolitiFact Georgia called and emailed Georgia Gun Owners four times over the past month, but we did not get a response. We even took a drive to Kennesaw to the address listed on the organization’s website. The address was a UPS store. Brian Robinson, the communications director for the governor, said he was baffled by the claim. The fliers are apparently focused on two bills that included language concerning firearms training and gun laws for anyone with a mental illness. Republican lawmakers pushed legislation during this year’s legislative session that would allow concealed weapons in new locations, including the more than 50 campuses of the state's university and technical college systems. Current Georgia law permits students to keep firearms locked in vehicles in university parking lots, but nowhere else. Two bills aimed at easing some restrictions concerning guns on campus, House Bill 512 and Senate Bill 101, passed their respective chambers with some tweaks to the legislation. Neither bill, however, reached the governor’s desk for his signature. The Georgia Board of Regents, which provides oversight for the University System of Georgia, fought the bills. So, too, did University System Chancellor Hank Huckaby, a former legislator who still holds sway in the Legislature. Deal had concerns about some parts of the legislation, the AJC reported. On March 13, the newspaper reported that the governor offered support for only one portion of the bill that would strengthen the rules about how people with mental illness qualify for a weapons "carry" license. "It expands the population who will be flagged by an instant background check, which the governor believes will protect innocent Georgians, " Robinson said at the time. The Associated Press reported Deal’s staff forwarded an email from Huckaby to a state representative that noted that few states allow firearms on campus. The AP also reported his chief of staff made it clear in a meeting that Deal was not personally backing the proposal, although one of the governor’s Senate floor leaders was backing the bill. Deal’s staff said the lawmaker was backing it for his own reasons. House and Senate leaders worked on a compromise of their respective bills to come up with something that both chambers and Deal could support during the final two weeks of the session. On March 28, the final day of the session, the negotiations continued near midnight. No bill was passed. Sine die. "We thought we had a deal," the AJC quoted an exasperated Rep. Alan Powell, R-Hartwell, chairman of the House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee. Powell said in March that House and Senate negotiators had agreed, after Deal stepped in, to allow concealed weapons permit holders to carry weapons on college campuses with the stipulation that permit holders between the ages of 21 and 25 would have to complete an eight-hour safety course first. Senators then told House negotiators that they wanted to require anyone, regardless of age, to complete the safety course before being allowed to carry a firearm on campus. "We had a conflict over some of the language that the Senate was opposed to," Powell told PolitiFact Georgia. Some lawmakers have said they oppose any mandatory training. Powell took issue with the description in the flier that the bills had been killed. "Those bills are still alive and well and still kicking," Powell told us, adding they could be adopted in 2014. Powell said the governor did not talk to him about anything in the legislation. Powell said Georgia Gun Owners "blamed our committee for a lot of things that were not correct." To sum up, Georgia Gun Owners claimed Deal killed some pro-gun bills earlier this year. It does appear from public statements from Deal’s office earlier this year that he was concerned about some elements of the bills under consideration. So, too, were other key voices. House and Senate lawmakers are still debating the matter six months later. The flier suggests the failure of these bills to pass earlier this year was the governor’s fault. We think that’s a bit of a stretch. Our rating: Mostly False.	None	Georgia Gun Owners	None	None	None	2013-10-01T00:15:30	2013-08-10	['Nathan_Deal']
pomt-04150	"Did U know? Block Island Wind Farm would mean 40% est. drop in BI electric rates."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/dec/29/deepwater-wind/deepwater-wind-says-electricity-rates-block-island/	Around the world, businesses and governments are looking for alternatives to fossil fuels. One of those choices is wind power, and one place where it has been getting an especially close look is Block Island. A company called Deepwater Wind wants to build a five-turbine wind farm in Rhode Island waters about three miles off the Block Island coast. The turbines would generate more than enough electricity for the island, with the surplus being sent to mainland Rhode Island. The company also has plans for a larger wind farm of up to 200 turbines in Rhode Island Sound that could provide power to multiple states, including Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New York. One aspect of the smaller project that supporters have touted is how much it would save electric power customers on Block Island. Besides providing wind-generated electricity to the island, the project calls for an underwater power cable that would connect it to the New England power grid. Currently, the island relies on its own electric company that uses diesel-powered generators to serve about 1,800 customers. Their electric rates are the highest in the state and among the highest in the country. Deepwater highlighted the potential savings in a Tweet the company put out Dec. 12: "Did U know? Block Island Wind Farm would mean 40% est. drop in BI electric rates." We wondered whether that figure was accurate or whether Deepwater was just blowing a lot of hot air. Block Island, or New Shoreham, as the island’s town is legally known, is in a unique position among Rhode Island municipalities when it comes to electric power. On the mainland, except for the section of Burrillville served by the Pascoag Utility District, the state’s cities and towns get their electricity from National Grid. On Block Island, it’s the Block Island Power Company, whose on-island generators run on diesel fuel, which must be shipped to the island by boat. A 2010 Providence Journal story on the island’s power system noted that diesel fuel regularly costs $1 more per gallon on the island than on the mainland. In fiscal 2011, according to a report by the town’s Electric Utility Task Group on the fiscal costs and benefits of the wind-farm project, the average cost of electricity on the island was 47 cents per kilowatt hour. In the rest of Rhode Island it was 14.8 cents. Once the cable is laid and the wind farm project is on line, in 2014 or 2015, Block Island Power will be able to purchase electricity from the New England power network at much lower costs. The task group estimated that electric rates on the island -- based on a 20-year agreement between Deepwater Wind and National Grid -- would fall to 30.7 cents per kilowatt hour, a 35.4-percent decrease from 2011 rates. (The island’s rates would still be substantially higher than those on the mainland because its customers would be paying for a portion of the costs for installing the cable and for maintenance of the island’s power system.) The task group’s analysis noted that current power costs on Block Island have risen to 54 cents per kilowatt hour because of the increasing diesel costs. Based on that figure, the decrease would be a 42-percent drop -- about what Deepwater said in its Tweet. Our ruling Deepwater Wind’s Tweet claimed electricity rates on Block Island will fall by 40 percent if a planned wind farm is built. The island’s Electric Utility Task Group says that, based on current prices of diesel fuel, the rates would drop 42 percent. We rule Deepwater’s claim True.

pomt-03190	Offshore wind power is "significantly less expensive than solar energy."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/aug/31/jeffrey-grybowski/deepwater-wind-ceo-jeffrey-grybowski-says-offshore/	EDITOR’S NOTE: On Aug. 28, 2013, PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as False a statement by Deepwater Wind CEO Jeffrey Grybowski that offshore wind power is "significantly less expensive than solar energy." We based that ruling on a comparison of the estimated price of Deepwater’s planned 1,000 megawatt windfarm with a recent contract price for a solar project in Rhode Island. Deepwater Wind objected to the ruling, pointing to contract prices of several other Rhode Island solar projects. Based on that information and a second review, we have changed our ruling to Mostly True and are providing this new analysis. July 31 was a red letter day for Deepwater Wind, a Providence company that hopes to build the first offshore wind farm in the United States. That was the day Deepwater was announced as the winner of a federal auction to lease space for the farm in a 257-square-mile area of waters off Rhode Island and Massachusetts. (The company plans an initial demonstration project of five turbines off Block Island. The larger project would have more than 100 turbines.) It was in that context that Jeffrey R. Grybowski, chief executive officer of Deepwater Wind, appeared Aug. 4, 2013 on the TV public affairs show "10 News Conference." Host Bill Rappleye asked Grybowski how much the electricity generated by the turbines would cost. "Yes, 13- to 14-cent power [offshore wind energy per kilowatt hour] is probably what we’re talking about, significantly lower than the cost of what we’ve seen for offshore wind to date," Grybowski said. "Also, by the way, significantly less expensive than solar energy." We wondered whether offshore wind is, in fact, cheaper than solar. We started with the state Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Public Utilities Commission, which both have important roles in setting the prices for renewable energy. Deepwater has negotiated with energy distributor National Grid, which is required to buy power from renewable sources, a wholesale price of 24.4 cents per kilowatt hour for the five-turbine demonstration project, steadily ranging up to 46.9 cents per kilowatt hour in the last year of a 20-year contract, according to division officials. The demonstration would have a generating capacity of 30 megawatts -- a measure of peak output over an hour. (A megawatt is 1,000 kilowatts. The average U.S. home uses about 940 kilowatt hours per month, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.) If the demonstration wind farm, called Phase I, works out as planned, Deepwater Wind expects to move forward on plans to build a large-scale wind farm, called Phase II, in the leased federal waters. Phase II would generate up to 1,000 megawatts -- enough, the company says, to power 350,000 homes. In an interview with PolitiFact Rhode Island, Grybowski said his comments on "10 News Conference" were about Phase II. He predicted that in the coming years, Deepwater will be able to negotiate with National Grid a wholesale price of 13 cents to 14 cents per kilowatt hour, escalating annually over the life of a contract. To check Grybowski’s claim, we first had to determine the price of offshore wind energy. That’s a challenge because no such project has yet been built in the United States. As proof that his 13- to 14-cent-per-kilowatt-hour estimate is realistic, Grybowski pointed to a formal offer by Deepwater in 2012 to sell Phase II energy in New York state for as low as 10 cents per kwh. The closest point of comparison is in nearby Massachusetts, where the Cape Wind project in Nantucket Sound is under contract with National Grid for a year-one price, adjustable with contingencies, of 18.7 cents per kwh. How do these prices compare with the price of solar locally? The Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources, which also has a rate-setting role in renewable energy, provided a list of 18 solar projects that have entered into contracts with National Grid since December 2011. The wholesale prices ranged from 18.5 cents per kilowatt hour to 33 cents, with the largest projects having the lowest prices. Deepwater provided a similar list compiled from National Grid data, showing 21 Rhode Island solar projects, with prices also ranging from 18.5 cents per kilowatt hour to 33 cents. By law in Rhode Island, solar projects enter into contracts with National Grid at a fixed price for 15 years and offshore wind at a price with annual escalators for 20 years. Four of the 21 solar projects on Deepwater’s list have initial prices lower than Deepwater’s Phase I price. All of them would be substantially less expensive than the final Phase I price because of the annual escalator. But let’s look at the Deepwater Phase II project that Grybowski was talking about, and let’s assume that his 13-to-14 cent estimate holds true. That’s cheaper initially than all of the Rhode Island solar projects. Phase II also has an escalating price -- Grybowski said the company expects to obtain a contract of about 20 years with prices escalating about 3 percent a year. The initial Deepwater price would be cheaper than all the solar prices. At year 12, the Deepwater price would surpass the cheapest solar project’s price. After 20 years, the Deepwater price would be about 23 cents -- still cheaper than 19 of the 21 solar projects. It should be noted that comparisons of solar and offshore wind prices in Rhode Island are tricky because of scale. There’s not much room in our crowded, tiny state for the sort of large-scale solar projects that exist in the Southwest, for example. The largest solar project on Deepwater’s list, planned for the former Forbes Street Landfill, in East Providence, would have a capacity of 3.7 megawatts. Fifteen of the 21 are less than 1 megawatt, compared with the 1,000 megawatts of Deepwater’s Phase II. On the national level, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that the most widespread kind of solar power, photovoltaic, has a "levelized cost" of 22.4 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with offshore wind at 29.5 cents. "Levelized cost is often cited as a convenient summary measure of the overall competitiveness of different generating technologies," the administration explains on its website. For a large-scale offshore wind project, Grybowski contends that the 29.5-cent estimate is inaccurate, based on faulty methodology. Our ruling Deepwater Wind’s Jeffrey Grybowski said offshore wind power is "significantly less expensive than solar energy." Deepwater’s small Phase I demonstration project would, in fact, be more expensive over time than all of the Rhode Island solar projects the company cited. But if Grybowski’s estimated electricity price for the much larger Phase II holds true, its price would ultimately be cheaper than 19 of the 21 solar projects. The gap would be a few cents for the larger solar projects and up to 10 cents for the smallest. Because Grybowski’s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, the judges rule it Mostly True.	None	Jeffrey Grybowski	None	None	None	2013-08-31T00:01:00	2013-08-04	['None']
pomt-08905	"In 2009, Yost spent 2.5 times more money than it took to run the (prosecutor’s) office before he got there."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/29/progressohio/liberal-group-progressohio-near-mark-attack-ohio-a/	David Pepper, the Democratic candidate for state auditor, has consistently characterized his Republican opponent Dave Yost as an out-of-control spender whose budget skyrocketed in his eight years as a county prosecutor. Pepper says Yost, the Delaware County prosecutor and a Republican with some Tea Party support, increased his office’s spending by 150 percent. The claim also was made by the liberal group ProgressOhio in an online video posted in March. "In 2009, Yost spent 2.5 times more money than it took to run the office before he got there," according to the ProgressOhio video. The charge is based on a comparison between the Delaware County prosecutor's general fund budgets in 2002, the year before Yost was appointed prosecutor, and 2009. While the prosecutor’s office has access to other funds, such as an account stocked with a portion of the county’s delinquent tax collections, general fund spending is widely regarded as a barometer of an elected official’s fiscal restraint because it is typically used to pay for day-to-day operations. Pepper, currently a Hamilton County commissioner, has been especially eager to point out Yost’s spending habits because they seem to defy his stance against bloated government spending. The ProgressOhio video shows Yost railing against the increasing cost of government at a 2009 Tea Party event in Columbus. "I’m concerned about the way we are spending money in the state of Ohio," Yost said to the crowd. The video juxtaposes Yost's speech against shots of budget documents from his office. They are the same documents the county provided us for Yost's general fund budgets. And records show the budget in fact was higher in 2009 than it was in 2002, his predecessor’s last full year in office. In 2002, the office had a budget of $591,798, according to county records. In 2009, the budget was $1.54 million — 2.6 times the amount budged in 2002. The county also keeps track of actual spending from the general fund. Spending totaled $577,887 in 2002 and $1.49 million last year. The 2009 figure for actual spending also is about 2.6 times the amount spent in 2002. But Yost said those documents don’t tell the whole story, and offers these explanations. In 2002 the office received a $130,000 subsidy from the county’s child support enforcement agency to pay lawyers and other staff who worked on child support cases. That subsidy is not reflected in the 2002 prosecutor’s budget, skewing the budget comparison to 2009, Yost said. The subsidy pushed the 2002 total closer to $710,000. Using this figure as the basis for the comparison, Yost spent about twice as much in 2009 as his predecessor did in 2002. The child support enforcement agency was removed from the prosecutor’s office in September 2003 and placed under the Delaware County commissioners. To cover the staff costs for legal work on those cases, the commissioners, who set the county budget each year, allocated more money to the prosecutor. The demands on the prosecutors office for services increased as the county’s population increased. Yost also pointed to prosecutor’s budgets in five other counties with populations between 150,000 and 200,000: Greene, Licking, Medina, Clermont and Portage. Delaware County had the second-lowest general fund budget in 2009 in the group. While the ProgressOhio video is correct that the amount of spending in the Delaware County prosecutor’s office jumped during Yost’s tenure, it leaves out the caveat that bookkeeping changes within the county finances helped explain part of those increases. Yost’s argument to mitigate the degree to which his budgets increased is well taken. We find ProgressOhio’s statement Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-01888	David Perdue said he’d raise taxes.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/08/jack-kingston/would-david-perdue-raise-taxse/	Republican candidates tend to embrace the same familiar themes. At the top, if not a desire to roll back Obamacare, would likely be the longtime GOP stance opposing any tax increase. So it’s no small thing for U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston to brand businessman David Perdue, his rival in the Republican runoff for the U.S. Senate, as a tax supporter. The ad in question, featuring a voicemail for Kingston left by a President Obama impersonator, is to the point: "Perdue said he’d raise taxes. You never even voted for a tax increase." The Kingston camp pointed us to two Perdue statements: one from a May meeting with the Macon Telegraph editorial board and the other from a candidate forum from January. "Mr. Perdue has repeatedly advocated for tax increases," Kingston campaign manager Chris Crawford said. That seems clear enough. But digging into the details, as PolitiFact does, clouds things up a bit. Perdue, a former CEO who has built his campaign focused as an outsider to politics, told the editorial board he supported "both" curbing spending and increasing revenue to boost the economy. When a member of the board calls revenue increases "a euphemism for some kind of tax increase, of course," Perdue talks about the need to grow business and grow revenue. Crawford notes that Perdue chuckles before he speaks but doesn’t outright deny support for a tax increase. In an interview with PolitiFact, Perdue said his point in the meeting was to focus not just on the economy but how to use the economy to help pay down the national debt. "We can balance the budget by cutting spending, and that’s where you start," Perdue said. "But an $18 trillion debt will require an economy that’s growing, with people back to work, like we did in the ‘60s, ‘80s and even the ‘90s." An Internet sales tax, or a tax on online sales similar to those made at physical stores, would also increase revenue. Now, people who buy from online retailers are supposed to report their purchases on their state tax returns and pay. Few do. Georgia lost an estimated $410 million in uncollected online sales tax in 2012, according to a study from the University of Tennessee’s Center for Business and Economic Research. The Marketplace Fairness Act would permit state and local governments to collect sales taxes from internet retailers that do not have a physical location in their jurisdictions. It passed the Senate last year but has been held up in the GOP-run House, with conservative members labeling it a tax hike. Perdue said at the January candidate forum that he supported the concept of the bill to make sure there was "an even playing field" for all retailers. "Frankly, I think whether you have brick-and-mortar or Internet sales, we should have the same rules apply to both," Perdue said at the event. He recently clarified with PolitiFact that his support falls under his advocacy of a Fair Tax, which would replace existing federal income taxes with a national 23 percent sales tax on all new goods and services, including those bought on the internet. Critics the Fair Tax, note that the proposal is regressive – that is, it disproportionately hurts people with lower incomes who spend more of their wages and therefore pay a higher tax rate. Perdue acknowledges that the current proposal would need tweaks to avoid that problem. But he believes taxing consumption – including buying new products from Amazon or elsewhere on the Internet – is a change that needs to happen. "I would argue that it would reduce taxes, because it would have greater growth in the economy," Perdue said. Kingston has made that argument, too, notes staffer Crawford. In fact, Kingston reiterated support for the Fair Tax during the same January forum but refused to support an internet sales tax as an incremental measure. "If David Perdue wanted to equivocate on that, he had five months to do it," Crawford said. "He didn’t until it was politically expedient and that doesn’t ring true." Speaking of truth, where does all of this leave us on whether David Perdue would raise taxes? Basing the statement alone on Perdue’s meeting with a newspaper editorial board takes his statements out of context. Equating revenue increases with tax hikes is a stretch that breaks upon closer examination. Perdue is far more clear, though, on support for extending sales taxes to goods and services bought online. Though the Fair Tax includes such a tax as part of its proposal, there is a separate bill that would levy the Internet sales tax in the exact way that Perdue said he supported. Taken together, we rate the claim Half True.	None	Jack Kingston	None	None	None	2014-07-08T00:00:00	2014-06-19	['None']

pomt-01715	"All Aboard Florida is receiving millions in Florida taxpayer dollars."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/aug/07/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-all-aboard-florida-receiving-mi/	Democrats have been attacking Republican Gov. Rick Scott for a controversial passenger rail line project with ties to his administration. While Scott has said All Aboard Florida won’t get state subsidies, Democratic front-runner former Gov. Charlie Crist says that’s inaccurate. "All Aboard Florida is receiving millions in Florida taxpayer dollars," Crist stated in a July 10 fundraising email. How much -- if any money -- is All Aboard Florida receiving from the state? Hop aboard and let’s see what we learned. Sources of money All Aboard Florida is a $2.5 billion passenger rail line that will connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in 2016, with hopes to extend to Orlando in 2017. Proposed by Florida East Coast Industries, LLC, All Aboard will use private financing for a large portion of its costs and has applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan. Scott has taken heat because of the role of Adam Hollingsworth, now Scott’s chief of staff. In 2010, Hollingsworth was a transportation adviser to Scott’s transition team. Then Hollingsworth went to work for All Aboard Florida’s parent company for part of 2011 and 2012 and lobbied Scott’s administration for the project, the Naples Daily News reported. In 2012, Hollingsworth became Scott’s chief of staff. While Scott has supported the All Aboard Florida project he killed high-speed rail slated to get $2.4 billion in federal funds in 2011. In this case, the controversy lies with various pots of state money. A Crist campaign spokesman pointed to a July article by the Scripps/Tribune Capital Bureau, which ran in the Naples Daily News headlined, "All Aboard Florida private rail project has government financial support." The article stated that "the state already has set aside more than $220 million that will benefit the project." Several other news outlets weighed in; a Tampa Bay Times editorial called for Scott to "stop misleading voters about its public cost." The Florida Department of Transportation, led by a Scott-appointee, pushed back. We read several news articles, transportation department press releases and interviewed officials connected to the project to figure out the project’s finances. Orlando International Airport: The airport is building a complex to include the airport’s people mover, parking and ground transportation. Connected to that project, the airport is also building an intermodal transportation facility -- and that’s the piece that will get about $214 million from a loan and grant from the state. The intermodal facility will accommodate rail -- including All Aboard Florida -- and potentially two other future rail projects, Phil Brown, airport director, told PolitiFact Florida. Having airport connections to rail has been in the airport’s plan for decades. However, Brown said the airport couldn’t seek state money until it had an entity committing to build it -- and that’s All Aboard Florida. "What we had was an opportunity with All Aboard Florida to get some state funding to accommodate that," facility, Brown said. All Aboard Florida will pay the airport $2.8 million a year for a lease, which the airport will use to repay a portion of the state loan. In addition, All Aboard will pay the airport between $1 and $1.50 per passenger. (All Aboard Florida estimates that combined the total will add up to about $4.5 million a year.) "Whatever they are using of that facility they are going to pay for," Brown said. The airport is required under federal regulations to charge fair market rate. "All Aboard Florida is not getting a free station in Orlando," Brown wrote in an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel. "In fact, the airport will be required to repay the state the portion of the terminal-construction cost to be used by All Aboard Florida." All Aboard will pay off the cost to build their platform at the airport, Brown told PolitiFact Florida. Quiet zones: In 2014, the Legislature agreed to provide $10 million for "quiet zones" related to horns at railroad crossings. Local government agencies can apply for the money -- so All Aboard Florida can’t get the money. The bill language doesn’t name any particular type of rail or All Aboard Florida, but it was added to the state’s spending plan due to residents’ concerns about noise. Tri-Rail connection: The Naples Daily News wrote that an investor pitch by All Aboard Florida outlined its plan to connect with Tri-Rail, an existing public passenger rail service in South Florida. "Project officials want the state to pay the estimated $44 million cost of the connection," the article stated. All Aboard’s bond documents stated: "We are exploring a number of different financing alternatives for this construction, including a possible state-funded grant for some or all of the construction cost." All Aboard and transportation officials talked about the idea of seeking $44 million in state money for a Tri-Rail connection but that never materialized. Before All Aboard Florida was announced, Tri-Rail Coastal Link already had plans for future stations in the downtowns of Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. In 2013, All Aboard Florida and the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority, which oversees Tri-Rail, began to coordinate on potential design plans. Susie Wiles, a consultant for All Aboard Florida who ran Scott’s 2010 campaign, said that it was Tri-Rail that wanted the connection, so All Aboard wasn’t going to pay for it. All Aboard officials provided transportation officials with a breakdown of the cost. But the news report about the $44 million prompted the Scott administration to push back. "As we previously discussed with your company, the department will not invest state dollars in your project," stated a July 15 letter sent by the Florida Department of Transportation Secretary to All Aboard Florida. (Scott had said in June that there would be no state subsidies for All Aboard.) Our ruling Crist said on July 10, "All Aboard Florida is receiving millions in Florida taxpayer dollars." All Aboard is not receiving millions directly from the state. Instead, it could get federal loans, and the state is spending millions on infrastructure that will end up benefiting the rail line, especially an intermodal center at Orlando International Airport. All Aboard will have to pay rent and passenger fees at the airport. Overall, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2014-08-07T14:45:17	2014-07-10	['None']
pomt-10975	Says Brett Kavanaugh "refused to uphold key patient protections in the past."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/18/demand-justice/pro-aca-group-court-pick-kavanaugh-refused-uphold-/	A new ad from a group with strong Democratic ties aims to pressure three Democratic senators in North Dakota, West Virginia and Indiana to vote against Brett Kavanaugh as the next Supreme Court justice. The ad, made by the liberal group Demand Justice, focuses on protections for people with pre-existing conditions in the Affordable Care Act, saying all would be at risk with Kavanaugh on the court. "The Senate is about to consider Brett Kavanaugh to be the next Supreme Court justice," the ad says. "Kavanaugh refused to uphold key patient protections in the past, and if he joins the court he could vote to end these protections for good." No one can say for sure what Kavanaugh might do in the future, but we can look at whether he refused to uphold patient protections in the past. Key takeaways The statement hangs on Kavanaugh’s dissent in a 2011 case that challenged the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act. The argument made to Kavanaugh and two other appellate court judges was that Congress had overstepped its constitutional powers. Two of the judges nixed the challenge, saying that, yes, Congress actually did have the power. Kavanaugh also rejected the challenge, but for a totally different, technical reason. Basically, he said it was too early for the court to rule. So, both the two judges and Kavanaugh reached the same place, but his fellow judges upheld Congress’s power to impose the mandate, and Kavanaugh, by sidestepping that question, did not. Notice that the case wasn’t directly about patient protections, most notably the ban on denying coverage based on a pre-existing health condition. But all the judges agreed that those protections and the mandate were joined at the hip. They all said that the mandate made the patient protections work economically. The dividing line was two judges affirmed Congress’s power to make the package work and Kavanaugh did not. But he still rejected the challenge. More detail: What Kavanaugh’s dissent means, and doesn’t In the case of Seven-Sky vs. Holder, a group of taxpayers argued that the health care law’s requirement to buy health insurance went beyond the legitimate power of Congress. Two out of the three appellate judges rejected the challenge outright, saying that the mandate was allowed under the Constitution’s Commerce Clause. In his dissent, Kavanaugh shot down the challenge but pointedly avoided ruling on the plaintiffs’ big issue. "I do not take a position here on whether the statute as currently written is justifiable under the Taxing Clause or the Commerce Clause," he wrote. Instead, he rejected the claim based on tax law. He said the suit itself was flawed because an 1867 law — the Anti-Injunction Act — blocks courts from ruling on tax laws before they take effect. It was 2011, and the mandate didn’t come into force until 2014, so "a suit challenging the individual mandate cannot be entertained until 2015." Where do patient protections come into this? Well, key protections, most prominently the ban on denying coverage based on a pre-existing condition, come hand-in-hand with the mandate in Obamacare. As Kavanaugh saw it, you can’t have one without the other. Another name for that ban is guaranteed coverage, and during oral arguments, Kavanaugh said that part of the Affordable Care Act was fine. "Congress has the power to impose a guaranteed issue requirement on insurance companies," he said. Going further, there’s no mistaking that Kavanaugh saw the link to the mandate. "It won’t work without an individual mandate attached to it," he said. "We know that from the states that have tried it that way. It didn’t work. Massachusetts tried it with the mandate and it’s worked extremely well, at least in terms of the goal of coverage." So Kavanaugh was content to give patient protections the constitutional thumbs up, but when it came to the other half of the equation, the mandate, he said it was too soon to make a decision on its constitutionality. Interpreting what Kavanaugh did For the makers of the ad, this is very simple. "Two judges upheld the Affordable Care Act and its patient protections, and he declined to uphold it," Demand Justice executive director Brian Fallon said. "He could have joined their opinion and upheld it on the merits and he didn't." For outside legal experts, the situation is much cloudier. "The group’s statement is technically true, although a bit misleading," said Allison K. Hoffman at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. "Kavanaugh never said that the mandate was unconstitutional. He painstakingly avoided opining on its constitutionality. He spent 65 excruciatingly dense pages of opinion repeatedly calling it a tax, the very thing Congress avoided doing because they knew it would be unpopular." James Blumstein at Vanderbilt agreed that by taking no position on the reach of the Commerce Clause, Kavanaugh succeeded in placing himself in the gray zone regarding congressional power. "Kavanaugh was unwilling to endorse the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause," Blumstein said. "He wanted to avoid having to decide what was for him a hard question." In his dissent, Kavanaugh emphasized an important principle that stands apart from assessing congressional power: judicial restraint. That’s the idea that courts should not get ahead of the political process that plays out in the nation and Congress. "I see in his declining to address that issue (the mandate) only normal judicial prudence of not deciding issues unless the case requires them to be decided," Wake Forest University’s Mark Hall told us. And law professor David Gamage at Indiana University said Kavanaugh’s dissent makes him neither "pro-Affordable Care Act, nor anti-Affordable Care Act." Our ruling The group Demand Justice said that Kavanaugh refused to uphold patient protections. Looking at the record, it is fair to say that he did not uphold the power of Congress to impose the individual insurance mandate. That is one step removed from upholding patient protections, but Kavanaugh said that the two are tightly linked, and there’s broad agreement on that point. But while he didn’t uphold that power, his dissent didn’t specifically negate it. Outside legal scholars said there’s only so much one can read into his opinion.

pomt-07213	The Central Falls School system "spent $100,000 on a time clock."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jun/05/john-tassoni-jr/state-sen-john-tassoni-says-central-falls-school-s/	State Sen. John Tassoni Jr. is waging an aggressive campaign to oust the leadership of the embattled Central Falls school system In a news release, he called for the immediate resignation of Supt. Frances Gallo, saying that management of the state-funded district is "erratic at best and incompetent at worst. … State money is being used to operate the schools, and some of that money is being wasted and used irresponsibly." We’re not about to wade into a controversy over who should be leading the school system. Gallo and the schools have made national news for reform efforts that have kept administrators and the teachers locked in a nasty fray for more than a year. But we were curious about one example Tassoni gave of questionable financial decisions. In his press release, he stated that "he has learned that the department spent $100,000 on a time clock." Really? Could a time clock cost that much? Without punching in, we got right to work on this one. When we met with Tassoni, he showed us three Central Falls school district documents that he called "purchase orders." He noted that each made reference to a time clock and that each had a different total: $40,543.64, $55,414.68 and $5,581.68. So he added them up. Grand total: $101,540. "That $100,000 disturbed me -- $100,000 for a time clock?" he said. A first glance at the documents, however, reveals that there’s a great deal more to the purchase than a "time clock." Two of the documents specify the order was for "TimeClock Plus 6.0 Professional." There’s enough detail to make clear it’s a computerized system. "It’s not just a clock. It’s a whole system," Gallo said when we contacted her. "It’s automated and has brought us out of antiquity into a truly networked system." We pictured Fred Flintstone ending his day at Slate Rock and Gravel Company by simply sticking his time card into a dinosaur’s mouth. And we recalled those classic wall-mounted clocks, the kind Moocher, in the movie "Breaking Away," smashes with his fist when his boss says, "Don’t forget to punch the clock, Shorty." What can the new system do better? And how does it work? No one sticks a card into a clock in Central Falls schools anymore. Hourly employees place a finger on a scanner to record their arrival and departure. Their fingerprints are checked to verify their identity. Forget punching in for a friend who hasn’t shown up for work. The clocks relay employees’ hours to payroll systems, reducing the time staff must spend processing cards and avoiding human error that could result in payment mistakes, according to Giovanna Venditti, the School Department’s director of finance, and Kathy Gaouette, director of human resources. The system can notify administrators when employees are approaching overtime. TimeClock can also ease record-keeping by tracking which hours should be paid out of the general fund or from an account set up for a specific grant, they said. Of the 500 full- and part-time employees who support the 2,800-student district, only 182 mostly non-salaried employees -- including maintenance workers, crossing guards, bus monitors and drivers -- use the new system. But the district wants its 340 teachers to agree to use it, too. Now back to those documents that Tassoni used to support his $100,000 claim. Only two are actual purchase orders, said Venditti. One for $55,598.68, dated March 15, 2010, was for hardware, software, licensing fees, training and systems support. The purchase included 11 time clocks -- not one -- for nine school buildings. The other purchase order, for $5,581, dated Feb. 23, 2011, was to renew a technical support agreement for the TimeClock system for another year. And that third document, the one with the $40,539 total? It’s just a packing slip. Unlike the other two documents, it does not say "purchase order" at the top in large bold letters or include any similar information, such as a "P.O. date" or "P.O. issued to." Data Management Inc., of San Angelo, Texas, simply included it in a shipment of items it sent to Central Falls. The packing slip didn’t total $55,598, the amount of the purchase order, because the $13,442 fingerprint scanning equipment and one other item were shipped separately. So Tassoni, by simply adding the totals of the three documents, counted some items twice, inflating the original purchase of $55,598.68 (excluding the systems support renewal) by nearly 75 percent. "It is not $100,000," said Venditti, the finance director. TimeClock was recommended by UniFund, the New Hampshire company that sold Central Falls its BudgetSense financial software, which helps the schools meet state financial reporting requirements. The programs are compatible. Like Central Falls, Barrington purchased TimeClock at the advice of UniFund. The town paid only $18,996, said Ronald Tarro, director of administration and finance -- a lot less than Central. Falls. But Barrington bought two fewer clocks and decided not to pay extra for the fingerprint technology. Barrington schools use badges instead. Barrington’s costs are also substantially lower because only 25 non-salaried maintenance and custodial staff are using TimeClock. Data Management charges a fee based on the number of users--$15 for each of the 500 employees that Central Falls wants to use the clocks. With the clock still running, where does this leave us? For starters, Tassoni could have asked school officials about the documents he was shown. Instead, the senator -- who publishes a union newspaper and is a former union administrator -- simply added up the totals on the three documents to push his case against the school leadership. That’s flimsy backup for saying he "learned" of a $100,000 expenditure and, then, choosing two words out of context, calling the purchase a "time clock." It clearly was not just a time clock. And it didn’t cost $100,000. The total was just over half that (plus the annual support contracts which are typical of software purchases). When he turned over the documents to PolitiFact, Tassoni even admitted, "I could be all wet." He IS all wet. But not to worry. We’re going to flame-dry his Dockers with a Pants on Fire!

pomt-09547	On whether he supports 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/04/john-mccain/mccain-flips-dont-ask-dont-tell/	The military's controversial "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy is back in the spotlight after President Barack Obama pledged to repeal it in his State of the Union speech. On the campaign trail, Obama frequently attacked the policy, which prohibits gays and lesbians from openly serving in the military. His opponent Sen. John McCain signaled he was open to changing the policy, but made it conditional to what military leaders wanted. Here's what he had to say about the issue back in 2006: "I listen to people like Gen. Colin Powell, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and literally every military leader that I know. And they testified before Congress that they felt the 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy was the most appropriate way to conduct ourselves in the military. A policy that has been effective. It has worked. ... But the day that the leadership of the military comes to me and says, 'Senator, we ought to change the policy,' then I think we ought to consider seriously changing it because those leaders in the military are the ones we give the responsibility to." McCain made those comments while speaking to a group of students at Iowa State University during a special taping of Hardball with Chris Matthews in October 2006, when he was considered a likely presidential candidate. McCain didn't formally announce his campaign until the spring of 2007. McCain offered variations of that position during the campaign, at times sounding more firm in his support of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. "We have the best-trained, most professional, best-equipped, most efficient, most wonderful military in the history of this country," McCain said during a debate on June 5, 2007. "There just aren't enough of them. So I have to rely on our military leadership, in whom we place the responsibility to lead these brave young Americans in combat as we speak. ... I think it would be a terrific mistake to even reopen the issue. It is working, my friends. The policy is working. ... Let's not tamper with them." In May 2009, McCain said in an interview on This Week that he'd be glad "to have a thorough review of the policy by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and their recommendations," but added that, "right now the military is functioning extremely well in very difficult conditions. We have to have an assessment on recruitment, on retention and all the other aspects of the impact on our military if we change the policy. In my view, and I know that a lot of people don't agree with that, the policy has been working and I think it's been working well." McCain used similar rhetoric several times throughout 2009, emphasizing his belief that "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" was working and should not be changed. After Obama pledged to repeal the policy in his State of the Union speech, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Michael Mullen and Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the Senate Armed Services Committee, which McCain co-chairs, how they planned to fulfill Obama's promise. During the testimony, Mullen said, speaking "for myself and myself only," that he is in favor of "allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly" in the armed forces. "No matter how I look at the issue, I cannot escape being troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their fellow citizens,” he said. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said, "I fully support the president's decision." Gates told the committee that a working group would review ways to properly repeal the policy, though Congress must ultimately vote to change the law. The group is due to report on its findings a year from now. McCain -- who had said back in 2006 that he would be guided by military leaders -- told Gates and Mullen that he was "disappointed" with the testimony. Overturning the law would "be a substantial and controversial change to a policy that has been successful for two decades," he said in his opening statement. "It would also present yet another challenge to our military at a time of already tremendous stress and strain... At this moment of immense hardship for our armed services, we should not be seeking to overturn the 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell' policy." Nevertheless, McCain said he would welcome a report on the subject so long as it steered clear of politics and focused only on military readiness and effectiveness. We asked McCain's spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan whether her boss had experienced a change of heart on the policy, and she told us he had not. "Obviously, Sen. McCain does not believe we should repeal 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,'" she said. Mullen had spoken for himself when he said the policy should be repealed, not for the entire military, she said. If, after the one-year review, the Joint Chiefs agree, "then Sen. McCain would obviously consider a military leader's decision." Three years ago, McCain said that he would "consider seriously changing ['Don't Ask, Don't Tell']" should the administration's top brass say it was a good idea. On Feb. 2, 2010, those officials showed up in McCain's committee room and said just that. Yet McCain's statements -- reiterated by Buchanan -- make it clear he hasn't budged. So we rate this a Full Flop.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2010-02-04T18:06:36	2010-02-02	['None']

pomt-07941	"The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they're in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them when they're in saltwater."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/26/barack-obama/obama-says-one-department-regulates-salmon-freshwa/	One of President Barack Obama's big laugh lines from his State of the Union address came when he talked about fish: salmon, to be specific. Obama's set-up was a call for efficient government. "We shouldn't just give our people a government that's more affordable. We should give them a government that's more competent and more efficient. We can't win the future with a government of the past," Obama said. "We live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black-and-white TV. There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports. There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy. Then there's my favorite example: The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they're in freshwater, but the Commerce Department handles them when they're in saltwater. I hear it gets even more complicated once they're smoked." We didn't much doubt the example. (We'll note again that White House speech writers have weeks to research and write the address.) But it did make us curious. So we decided to check the facts behind salmon swimming across regulatory lines. And swim they do: Most salmon are born in rivers and streams, then swim out to the ocean to become adults. Once they're full-grown, they return to the rivers and streams to breed. The technical term for this is "anadromous." When fish are out in the ocean, they're regulated by the National Marine Fisheries Service, which "predicts the status of fish stocks, ensures compliance with fisheries regulations and works to reduce wasteful fishing practices," according to its website. The service is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is, as Obama said, part of the U.S. Commerce Department. When fish are in the rivers and streams, they're regulated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which focuses on the conservation and protection of fish and wildlife and their habitats. The Fish and Wildlife Service is indeed part of the Department of Interior. When the fish is smoked, it would generally be regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates most packaged foods. Obama might even have been underselling the complexity. A major effort in the Pacific Northwest to protect and conserve salmon in the Columbia River Basin involves a "federal caucus" of 10 agencies working together for that purpose, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Geological Survey, to name a few. And while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service claims jurisdiction over salmon, freshwater fishing is also regulated heavily by state agencies. "It is a stretch to say that salmon in freshwater are regulated by the Interior Department," said Ray Hilborn, a professor at the University of Washington's School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. "Harvest in freshwater is almost totally regulated by states, and in some case tribes," he said in an e-mail. "In salt water the ocean harvest beyond 3 miles is federally regulated, but almost all the catch in the U.S. takes place in Alaska, and the state of Alaska regulates that fishery." "In reality, most of the things that affect salmon in freshwater are managed by dozens of agencies," he added. A conservationist we spoke with said that more agencies doesn't necessarily mean more inefficiency. "It can cut both ways. In a good sense, it can bring more resources," said Andrew Goode of the Atlantic Salmon Federation, a group that works to protect wild salmon. "It can get bogged down if the agencies have different ideas on how the species should be managed." Finally, a spokesman with the National Fisheries Institute, which represents commercial fishers, said salmon isn't even the half of it when it comes to overlapping rules. "There's more where that came from, unfortunately, when it comes to seafood," said Gavin Gibbons, a spokesman for the group. His group is particularly critical of a provision included in the 2008 farm legislation that allows the U.S. Department of Agriculture to regulate catfish. Not all fish, just catfish. He called those rules a "a demonstrable special interest effort." American catfish farmers asked for the new rules; they say foreign fish farmers are selling inferior products in the U.S. Gibbons praised the National Marine Fisheries Service, though, for its work conserving fish stocks. "They're not perfect, and there are controversies about catch shares and limits and that sort of thing," he said. "But broadly speaking, they're a world-class organization in terms of sustainability" In ruling on Obama's statement, we found that he's right about the regulatory division on salmon, with different agencies responsible for the fish when they're in freshwater versus when they're in saltwater. In fact, he leaves out a lot of detail, including the role of the states. The actual regulatory scene is even more complicated. But Fish and Wildlife in the Interior Department does have authority over fish when they're in freshwater, and the National Marine Fisheries Service in the Department of Commerce regulates them in saltwater. Because he left out some of the complexity, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-13679	"A few weeks ago, (the) education committee in Congress is deciding what’s going to be in your local salad bar."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/aug/02/dave-brat/dave-brat-education-committee-deciding-whats-going/	Uncle Sam’s overreach is so great that his fingers are in your local salad bar, according to U.S. Rep. Dave Brat, R-7th. During a podcast interview on TheBlaze, a news network founded by conservative commentator Glenn Beck, Brat said Washington should cede control over many of its programs to state and local governments. And he called for the crumbling of some federal pillars. "The Department of Education for starters, right?" Brat said on June 29. "A few weeks ago, (the) education committee in Congress is deciding what’s going to be in your local salad bar. For real. You can’t make it up." Our thoughts went to the salad bars at local groceries and restaurants, and we wondered whether the education panel really is deciding their contents. Lettuce tell you what we found. For starters, Brat’s statement was overly broad. Barbara Boland, the congressman’s press secretary, said Brat was referring to salad bars in schools. Boland pointed us to a reauthorization bill, called the "Improving Child Nutrition Education Act of 2016," which would put new restrictions on a federal program that offers free breakfasts and lunches to low-income students. The measure was approved by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, by a 20-14 vote, on May 18. Under the Republican-sponsored bill, schools would qualify for free meals for all of their students if 60 percent of their students come from low-income homes. The current threshold for school-wide free meals is 40 percent. The bill also adds momentum to Republican efforts to give states control over free-meals programs. It would start a pilot program in which three states would be given block grants to pay for food and would be freed from some federal nutritional mandates on the meals. The nutritional standards have been a big deal since 2010, when Congress - at the urging of first lady Michelle Obama - required free-meal schools to serve healthier food. Subsequent regulations by the U.S. Department of Agriculture established minimum weekly requirements for servings of meats, vegetables, fruits, grains and milk. They also established minimum and maximum calorie standards for each breakfast and lunch. Many Republicans, including Brat, say the standards are burdensome on schools and have resulted in hungry students being served unappetizing meals that barely are eaten. What about salad bars? Many schools have found that salad bars are popular with students and a good way to satisfy vegetable requirements for children who receive free meals. Federal regulations encourage their use. But only one sentence in the 180-page House bill addresses salad bars. It instructs the USDA to create regulations that would give free-meal schools "flexibility" in setting up and running salad bars. That’s contrary to Brat’s claim that the education committee was "deciding" what’s going to be in any salad bar - school or otherwise. Salad bars came up for only two minutes during a five-hour debate the committee held on the bill on May 18. That occurred when Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., withdrew an amendment that would have required the USDA to draw up a plan to expand the use of salad bars in free-meal schools and offer one-time federal grants to pay for their purchase and installation. "There is nothing in the House bill that regulates what schools can serve in their salad bars," we were told by Lorelei Disorga, vice president for the United Fresh Produce Association, a lobbying organization that monitors school lunch legislation. We received a similar statement from Tyler Hernandez, deputy communications director of the House Education and Workforce Committee. "HR 5003 does not dictate what must be served on salad bars," he wrote in an email, referring to the bill by its congressional number. But there’s one more thing consider. Brat’s office makes a point we noted earlier: This year’s legislation largely reauthorizes the 2010 free-meals bill that instructed the USDA to devise regulations for healthy breakfasts and lunches. The regulations, enacted in 2012, include weekly standards for the amount of vegetables served: 3.75 cups for grades K-8; 5 cups for grades 9-12. Within those rules are a subset of minimum requirements for the types of vegetables served, identified as "dark green," "red-orange" and "beans and peas." The USDA, in a 2013 memo, said it has received "numerous inquiries" on how free-meal schools with salad bars can make sure they’re complying with the vegetable regulations. The department recommended prepackaging salads with the proper mix, posting instructional signs by salad bar, or stationing staff at the end of the salad bar to ensure each student leaves with a federally reimbursable meal. We finally should note that Republicans on the education committee voted 20-1 to pass this year’s reauthorization bill. Brat was the lone GOP dissenter. In a May 19 news release, Brat said the healthy-meal regulations have resulted in students being served "stomach-churning school lunches." Boland, Brat’s press secretary, also told us in an email that the congressman is concerned by the rising cost of the free breakfast and lunch programs. The price is about $16.5 billion this year and is expected to reach $31 billion in 2025, according to projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Boland said Brat thinks the programs would be run more efficiently by states. Our ruling Brat said, "A few weeks ago, (the) education committee in Congress is deciding what’s going to be in your local salad bar." The congressman misspoke. The committee never has considered what should be in the salad bars of, say, restaurants or grocery stores. Brat’s office said the congressman was referring to school salad bars. Brat points to the committee’s May passage of a bill providing free breakfasts and lunches for students from low-income homes. The measure does not specify what vegetables should be served, and the panel spent no time haggling over amounts of lettuce, carrots and tomatoes. Setting nutritional standards would be left to the USDA. The bill largely would reauthorize free-meals legislation passed in 2010 that prioritized serving healthy food to students. In the aftermath, the USDA established copious regulations that include minimum weekly servings of green and red-orange vegetables and legumes. Many schools have salad bars, and it can be argued that Congress has allowed the USDA to regulate their contents. But it’s hard to imagine any salad bar worth its salt not offering a mixture of vegetables. So Brat’s statement that the education committee is deciding salad bar contents - in schools or, perhaps, anywhere - is a stretch, and we rate it False.

pomt-09170	Says EPA regulation of greenhouse gases will endanger 575 Texas dairy facilities, 58 swine operations, 1,300 corn farms and 28,000 beef cattle operations.	false	/texas/statements/2010/jun/07/todd-staples/staples-says-epa-regulation-greenhouse-gases-endan/	Todd Staples, the state agriculture commissioner, this year joined Gov. Rick Perry and Attorney General Greg Abbott in objecting to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designating half a dozen greenhouse gases as endangering public health. Staples says on his campaign website, which we visited in late May, that he’s fighting the December “endangerment” finding because the consequences would be disastrous for Texas farmers who, he implies, would suffer from government monitoring and regulation of gases emitted by animals and equipment. “Companies that will be endangered in Texas include 575 dairy facilities, 58 swine operations (and) 1,300 corn farms," Staples says. "No industry is more threatened than the cattle industry. If this rule is implemented, an estimated 28,000 beef cattle operations in Texas will fall under EPA regulation.” Milk, pigs, corn, cows – the feds whuppin' all these grown-in-Texas products? We wondered if Staples plows a straight row. Cody McGregor, Staples’ campaign manager, said the commissioner, a Republican seeking re-election, derived his Texas figures from a July 2008 letter written by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in response to the EPA’s draft advance notice to regulate greenhouse gases. In its letter, the USDA said that if greenhouse gas emissions were regulated under the Clean Air Act, numerous farms then not required to seek gas-emission permits would be so burdened. The 1970 act directs the EPA to establish air quality standards; the law requires the agency to concentrate on major polluters, which are defined as those that emit more than 100 tons of unhealthful pollutants a year. The USDA letter says that even “very small agricultural operations" would fall in that category: "For example, dairy facilities and farms with over 500 acres of corn may need to get a Title V permit. It is neither efficient nor practical to require permitting and reporting of (greenhouse gas) emissions from farms of this size. Excluding only the 200,000 largest commercial farms, our agricultural landscape is comprised of 1.9 million farms with an average value of production of $25,589 on 271 acres.” O June 23, 2009, Staples sent a letter to Lisa Jackson, the EPA administrator, objecting to the greenhouse gas endangerment finding. That letter says that based on the USDA’s herd and acreage estimates, Texas in 2007 had approximately 575 dairy facilities, 28,000 beef cattle operations, 58 swine operations and 1,300 corn farms that met the “regulatory threshold.” So, Staples aired his Texas estimate nearly a year ago based on the USDA’s assessment of the impact of EPA plans to regulate greenhouse gases drafted about a year before that. Presuming his math is solid, we wondered if the nearly 2-year-old concerns shared by USDA still hold. To our queries, Staples did not say precisely why or how the EPA's permitting will endanger the Texas operations he tallies. In Washington, EPA spokeswoman Catherine Milbourn looked over the information provided by Staples’ campaign. She said the analyses reflect expectations about the EPA’s plans that are no longer valid because the EPA effectively excused farms from complying with the requirements cited in the USDA’s letter. EPA spokesman Brendan Gilfillan followed up with an e-mail: “These types of doomsday scenarios are simply untrue. EPA issued a rule that would specifically ensure small businesses and farms are shielded from clean air act permitting for” greenhouse gases. The EPA’s May 13 final "tailoring rule," a descriptive reflecting the agency's decision not to impose the same pollutant thresholds on greenhouse gases that were spelled out for pollutants in the Clean Air Act, specifies the types of entities that will initially have to toe the line on greenhouse gas emissions. An accompanying fact sheet states: “Facilities responsible for nearly 70 percent of the national (greenhouse gas) emissions from stationary sources will be subject to permitting requirements under this rule. This includes the nation’s largest (greenhouse gas) emitters—power plants, refineries, and cement production facilities. Emissions from small farms, restaurants, and all but the very largest commercial facilities will not be covered by these programs at this time.” At this time? The fact sheet says the EPA is committing to additional rule-making by July 2012 which may discuss “whether certain smaller sources can be permanently excluded from permitting.” Permits for smaller sources of any type won't be required until at least April 30, 2016, the agency says. In a May 13 blog post headlined "EPA Greenhouse Gas Rules Likely Target for Suits," Legal Times magazine in Washington notes that the Clean Air Act requires entities that emit 100 to 250 tons of pollutants per year to get government permits to do so. Because greenhouse gases are emitted in much larger quantities than traditional pollutants, the 100 to 250 ton threshold would require permits for small farms, restaurants and apartment buildings, for example. In raising the threshold, the agency is admitting the absurdity of applying the lower limits to more prevalent greenhouse gases, the blog says. McGregor of Staples’ campaign conceded the EPA's May 13 rule excludes farms. McGregor said, however, that what the EPA says today "can likely change tomorrow." He pointed us to an online analysis of the rule by Washington lawyer Richard Stoll, whose clients include industrial operators including Portland cement manufacturers. Stoll told us he expects the rule to be challenged in federal court because the pollutant thresholds in the rule are far above what the Clean Air Act mandates. More broadly, Stoll said, the EPA wants Congress to pass laws related to greenhouse gas regulation; one way of touching off such action is to issue rules likely to be tossed in court. “There is a good chance that the DC circuit (court) will throw that regulation out and then all of a sudden EPA is going to be confronted with having to do something about all these farms and everything (else),” Stoll said. “There’s grounds to be fearful here.” However, Stoll said, should the EPA ever get to the point of requiring farmers to monitor and report on localized gas emissions, Congress almost certainly will intervene. "If all of a sudden you’re having farmers worried about monitoring cow farts, Congress will be all over this," he said. "It might not be immediately; it could be a damn mess for a while." Shannon Goessling, executive director and chief legal counsel of the conservative-leaning Southeastern Legal Foundation, which has challenged the endangerment finding, contends the EPA had another reason for excusing farms and other small businesses from greenhouse gas regulation: The government hopes they will drop their resistance to the endangerment finding. There's another legal view. Melinda Taylor, former director of the Environmental Law Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, agreed with Stoll that the EPA wants Congress to step in and take on greenhouse gas emissions. But, she said, it’s also likely the EPA would prevail in court if its May 13 rule is challenged. Generally, she said, “courts will not substitute their own judgment for that of an agency.” Besides, she said, “farmers have always been very successful in making the case they can’t comply with regulations that would be onerous and inordinately costly to them — to the detriment of the environment, I might add.” Phew. Where does all this leave Staples’ statement? The commish had a basis for his numbers in the 2008 USDA letter. But his assumption that farms would be subject to the regulations expired when the EPA issued its final rule weeks ago. Since, Staples has neither adjusted nor reasonably explained his outdated complaint. His statement is False.	None	Todd Staples	None	None	None	2010-06-07T00:00:00	2010-05-25	['Texas']

On Aug. 10, the party tweeted, "ICYMI: For only the second time since 2000, there are more job openings than Americans who are unemployed. Tax reform and a pro-growth agenda have unleashed America's economic engine. #WVGOP #WVComeBack" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Is this correct? We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal data source for employment figures. The bureau collects both statistics -- job openings and unemployed workers. We produced a chart to show how those trend lines interact: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The chart makes it clear: For the first time since both statistics were recorded at the same time, the number of job openings, shown in blue, has exceeded the number of unemployed workers, in red, in recent months. This was the case in March, April, May and June. So the tweet understated the number of times, but was otherwise accurate. Our ruling The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, "For only the second time since 2000, there are more job openings than Americans who are unemployed." In March, April, May and June, the number of job openings was higher than the number of unemployed Americans -- the first time since that has happened since both statistics were calculated. That’s four times rather than two, so the tweet actually undersold the accomplishment. We rate the statement True.

pomt-02908	Says Rick Scott "didn’t even come to his own education summit. But he did take time to go to the tea party convention the same week."	true	/florida/statements/2013/nov/04/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-skipped-out-educatio/	One of the most applause-grabbing lines Charlie Crist deployed in the rally announcing his candidacy for governor on Nov. 4, 2013, honed in on just one week in the life of his Republican rival. "(Rick Scott is) a governor who cares so little about education that he didn’t even come to his own education summit," Crist said. "But he did take time to go to the tea party convention the same week." The crowd of Democrats in St. Petersburg loved the line. But we wanted to know if it was accurate. Scott announced a three-day "education accountability summit" on Aug. 22. The event capped a heated summer for education in Florida, with the Board of Education deciding to pad school grades, opposition mounting against Common Core standards from across the political spectrum, and Education Commissioner Tony Bennett resigning amid accusations he helped shield a charter school led by a Republican donor from getting a "C" back in Indiana. It was time to talk it out -- or to at least talk about something else. Scott asked then-interim Education Commissioner Pam Stewart to convene the summit at St. Petersburg College in Clearwater Aug. 26-28. "Florida's education accountability system has become a national model, but we are at a critical point in our history," Scott said in a statement before the meeting. Invitations went to three-dozen people with stakes in education, including three county teachers of the year, eight legislators, activists from Florida PTA and Florida Parents Against Common Core, Board of Education chairman Gary Chartrand, Florida Education Association president Andy Ford, Miami-Dade superintendent Alberto Carvalho, and Patricia Levesque, executive director of former Gov. Jeb Bush’s Foundation for Florida’s Future. On the agenda: new Common Core standards, new tests that will come in place of the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, school grades and teacher evaluations. And yes, Scott was a no-show. His press office said that was intentional. "Gov. Scott wanted the benefit of an honest discussion on school grades, state standards, standard assessments and teacher evaluations," Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz said at the time. "The focus of the summit was to ensure that each Florida child is prepared to succeed." Scott did send representatives, including Stewart, communications director Melissa Sellers, policy chief Chris Finkbeiner and members of his education policy team, deputy communications director Frank Collins told us. So what was Scott up to that week? We compiled his activities based on his public schedule on the governor’s website and news stories. (We asked for a more complete account of his activities from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement but did not get it by our deadline.) Monday, Aug. 26: Scott’s schedule included a meeting with Gray Swoope, CEO of Enterprise Florida, and time in his Capitol office. Meanwhile, the summit’s first day was mostly spent on introductions and background presentations, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Tuesday, Aug. 27: Another day in Tallahassee. Scott’s schedule contained several hours of "staff and call time," a meeting with agency heads, and a dinner with community leaders at the governor’s mansion. Wednesday, Aug. 28: Scott met with Republican speaker-designate Steve Crisafulli in Cocoa, Fla. In Fort Myers, he pledged millions for a project aiming to improve natural water flow to part of the Everglades and limit water releases from Lake Okeechobee. Later, he marked the opening of the new headquarters for Univision and its new English-language network Fusion in Doral. The summit wrapped early without him in Clearwater, with attendees calling for reforms to school grades and teacher evaluations. Thursday, Aug. 29: The morning after the summit ended, Scott had a jobs announcement with Boeing in Virginia Gardens. What he did that night caused a stir: He met with state Sen. John Thrasher, Chartrand of the Board of Education and former Gov. Bush at an undisclosed location in Miami at suppertime. The news of his behind-the-scenes meeting with education power players irked parent activists, according to the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald. "This is how education reform gets done in Florida," Rita Solnet, founder of the advocacy group Parents Across America, told the Times/Herald. "The summit was a façade. The real decisions have always been made by Jeb Bush." Friday, Aug. 30: At a luxury hotel in Orlando, Scott spoke before a crowd of conservative activists with tea party leanings for 15 minutes at the two-day Americans for Prosperity Foundation "Defending the Dream" summit, about the state’s economic turnaround (and took too much credit for an expected tax revenue record, we determined). Americans for Prosperity is a conservative political action committee founded by libertarian billionaires David and Charles Koch and widely seen as sharing the concerns of and organizing the grassroots tea party movement. Americans for Prosperity Foundation, which sponsored the event, is its less political brother, a 501(c)(3) that focuses on education. Both groups believe in free markets, low taxes and limited government. Our ruling Scott delegated oversight of the education summit to his education commissioner, and other members of his team also attended. Still, Crist is right on the facts: Scott steered clear of one summit that week and made a speech at another laced with politics and connections to the tea party movement. We rate the statement True.

pomt-04196	"A man using bath salts reported that raccoons had set fire inside his home and stolen his cell phone."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/dec/07/mike-dewine/mike-dewine-says-abuse-bath-salts-led-man-make-biz/	Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine recently told some disturbing and odd stories about bath salts – an emerging drug that he said is a growing problem in Ohio. The stories were part of DeWine’s announcement last month that his office will target bath salts in its ongoing fight against drugs. Bath salts and other synthetic drugs have a tendency to induce violent and paranoid behavior, said DeWine, the state’s top law enforcement officer. One example DeWine, a Republican, gave involved a man having hallucinations of raccoons in his house. "The Ohio State Highway Patrol confronted a man who after using bath salts reported that raccoons had set fire inside his home and stolen his cell phone. He proceeded to chop up his deck with a hatchet while looking for the fire-setting raccoons," DeWine said. That got PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity going, so it decided to look into the facts behind the bizarre tale. Examining the statement might provide useful information to people unfamiliar with the drug and its effects. When we called DeWine’s office for information to back up his account, spokesman Dan Tierney provided an Ohio State Highway Patrol study to educate the law enforcement community about bath salts. Bath salts, which became illegal in Ohio in 2011, are a synthetic drug that can be snorted, injected or mixed with a fluid to drink. Users have said the drug gives an intense high and a rush similar to cocaine, according to the highway patrol study, which was completed in May. Others have described users as violent, unpredictable and paranoid. The study includes a short description of the raccoon event DeWine described – along with five other incidents involving bath salts – but it doesn’t provide any details about the time, place and people involved. We called the highway patrol and were told the incident happened in Reynoldsburg, near Columbus. The police department there provided a report with written accounts from three responding officers. The police report includes a transcript of the 911 call in August 2011 from the 31-year-old Reynoldsburg man who was seeing raccoons: "I got raccoons in my house that are starting fires. I wonder how the hell they are doing it," he said. "I keep putting them out but they start another one. I had to drive down here because I couldn’t find my cell phone. I think one of them took it and did something with it." The report also said the man told police he took bath salts three times that day and could be hallucinating. A local fire department determined there were no fires inside the house. One of the officers noticed the deck at the house was destroyed and there was a hatchet nearby. The man told police he chopped up the deck because he was looking for a dead raccoon. So where does that leave us? DeWine’s account at the press conference last month was backed up by the Reynoldsburg police report. His only misstep was saying state patrolmen confronted the man. The mistake is immaterial because it doesn’t change the circumstances of the incident and the role of bath salts, according to police. The Reynoldsburg man, for what it’s worth, eventually pleaded guilty to a charge of making false alarms. DeWine’s statement is accurate and there is nothing significant missing. That rates True on the Truth-O-Meter.	None	Mike DeWine	None	None	None	2012-12-07T06:00:00	2012-11-14	['None']
pomt-09420	People "can't go fishing anymore because of Obama."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/17/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-because-obama-people-cant-go-fi/	Since President Barack Obama took office, he's been accused of overturning a number of all-American traditions, including Christmas trees at the White House and gun rights. Now, Obama apparently wants to ban a popular American pastime: fishing. On his March 9, 2010, talk show, Rush Limbaugh claimed that, "fishing is on the verge becoming a privilege controlled by Barack Obama." He went on to say that he's only had a few experiences with the sport, but that, "I know a lot of people, former professional athletes, who go into shock after hearing they can't go fishing anymore because of Obama." Like so many claims we check at PolitiFact, this one was messy. It started, of all places, with a story from ESPNOutdoors.com, was picked up by conservative bloggers, and then made its way to Limbaugh's radio show and other outlets including Glenn Beck's evening program on Fox News. In the process, the story changed. So, we'll do our best to sort through the rhetorical rubble. To support his claim, Limbaugh points to an article that appeared on ESPNOutdoors.com on March 9, 2010. The article, written by Robert Montgomery, reported that, "The Obama administration will accept no more public input for a federal strategy that could prohibit U.S. citizens from fishing the nation's oceans, coastal areas, Great Lakes, and even inland waters." This quote was pulled from the Web site of left-wing media watchdog Media Matters. Montgomery later changed his column, so the original language is no longer on the ESPNOutdoors site. But more about that later. Montgomery was writing about Obama's Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force, a 24-member group headed by the chair of Obama's Council on Environmental Quality. In June 2009, Obama created the task force to develop a national policy to protect, maintain and restore oceans, coasts and the Great Lakes. He asked the group recommend a framework for improved stewardship and effective coastal and marine spatial planning; the group released a draft of its recommendations in December 2009. Among other things, it recommends creating nine regional planning areas to carry out the framework. In plain English, the Obama administration is drafting new plans for waterway conservation. "Spatial planning" is jargon for making sure that waterways are being used in the most economically and environmentally friendly way, explained Beth Lowell, federal policy director for ocean conservation group Oceana. If a body of water has no biological value, perhaps it's best used for a wind farm, she gave as an example. Or if there's a vulnerable coral reef in the area, the framework will help sort out what kinds of fishing can be done on the surface so as not to disturb the ecosystem below. So, the framework may mean changes in fishing practices in some areas, depending on the location, the local economy and specific ecological problems. Indeed, the draft framework states that plans "are expected to vary from region to region according to the specific needs, capacity, and issues particular to each region." Almost instantaneously, conservative bloggers picked up on Montgomery's story. Michelle Malkin wrote, "Sacrificing jobs for the green agenda. Conducting Kabuki theater on public input. Business as usual for the Obama White House." And from Gateway Pundit: "Obama’s latest assault on your rights– He wants to ban sport fishing. Barack Obama has a message for America’s 60,000,000 anglers – We don't need you." The meme found its way to the desks of Limbaugh and of Beck, who implied on his March 10, 2010, show that Obama was banning fishing by executive order. "Obama will no longer listen to the public as he tries to prohibit U.S. citizens from fishing on some of the nation's oceans, coastal areas and Great Lakes and even some inland waters," he said. "No more fishing. . . . Some environmentalists want to save the fish. Forget about the frickin' fish! People are losing their rights." (We should point out that Obama has not banned fishing through executive order, so Beck is wrong on that point.) The firestorm prompted ESPNOutdoors executive editor Steve Bowman to issue a statement on the story. He wrote that the news organization should have made it clear that the story was an opinion column in a series of stories on the implications of Obama's new task force. "While our series overall has examined several sides of the topic, this particular column was not properly balanced and failed to represent contrary points of view," Bowman wrote. "We have reached out to people on every side of the issue and reported their points of view -- if they chose to respond -- throughout the series, but failed to do so in this specific column." Media Matters also noted that the first paragraph of Montgomery's story now reads that the administration's plan "could prohibit U.S. citizens from fishing some of the nation's oceans, coastal areas, Great Lakes, and even inland waters." (The emphasis is ours to show the difference between Montgomery's first and second iteration of the column.) The column still fails to mention that the administration has made no final decisions on the recommendations. And while the framework could change some fishing practices as Lowell points out, the draft proposals do not say anything about banning recreational fishing as the column implies. Here's what Christine Glunz, spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, had to say about the issue: "The draft reports issued by the Ocean Policy Task Force have involved extensive stakeholder input and public participation as they were being prepared, which has included the interests of conservationists and the recreational fishing community. These draft reports are not map-drawing exercises, they do not contain a zoning plan, and they do not establish any restrictions on recreational fishing or on public access, nor make any judgments about whether one ocean activity or use is better than another.'' And Eric Schwaab, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's assistant administrator for fisheries, simply stated in a March 10, 2010, statement that "the Ocean Policy Task Force has not recommended a ban on recreational fishing." Like many things we check at PolitiFact, this claim is like sausage: It went in the meat processor that is the Internet as one thing and came out quite different. An opinion piece that argued Obama's effort could ban some fishing was chopped up, reprocessed and put back together as a claim that Obama wants to ban all fishing. In fact, the draft framework says nothing about banning fishing. Limbaugh has taken an early discussion about the use of waterways and twisted it to make it sound like Obama is outlawing a popular pastime. While the panel's recommendation could change fishing practices in some areas, the framework is still in draft form; the administration has not made any final decisions on what the framework will look like. But Limbaugh is grossly distorting the truth. Pants on Fire!	None	Rush Limbaugh	None	None	None	2010-03-17T13:58:16	2010-03-09	['None']

pomt-07971	Says that "data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggest that the Texas budget gap is worse than New York’s, about as bad as California’s, but not quite up to New Jersey levels."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/jan/21/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-compares-projected-shortfalls-texas-c/	Texas, a model of fiscal soundness? Not so, writes Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and liberal op-ed columnist for the New York Times. In his Jan. 6, 2011 column, titled "the Texas Omen," Krugman opines that the Texas-style "modern conservative theory of budgeting" ain’t all it’s cracked up to be, now that fiscal reality has intruded. Though he notes that "comparing budget crises among states is tricky," Krugman does just that, writing that "data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggest that the Texas budget gap is worse than New York’s, about as bad as California’s, but not quite up to New Jersey levels." We wondered if Krugman’s comparison was on target. In response, he pointed us to a table in a Dec. 16, 2010 report by the Washington-based center, which studies the impact of state and federal budget decisions on low-income Americans. The report, headlined "States Continue to Feel Recession’s Impact," says the national recession has caused the steepest decline in tax receipts on record, resulting in "a state fiscal crisis of unprecedented severity." Table 3 in the report lists nearly every state confronting a projected fiscal 2012 budget shortfall and compares each shortfall to the state’s fiscal 2011 budget. The table says Texas faces a $10 billion shortfall, amounting to 22.3 percent of its 2011 budget. The New York budget gap equals $9 billion, 9 percent of its 2011 budget, while the expected gaps for California and New Jersey equal $19.2 billion (22.2 percent) and $10.5 billion (37.4 percent), respectively, of each state’s 2011 budget. So, the 2012 Texas shortfall appeared to be worse than New York’s, about as bad as California’s, but not quite up--actually, hardly close--to New Jersey’s level. The report says the center’s sources for the Texas breakdown includes an analysis of state agency budget requests and other information by the Austin-based Center on Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs that serve low-income Texans. The two similarly-named organizations occasionally collaborate on projects. We called Eva DeLuna-Castro, the Austin center’s senior budget analyst, who said the shortfall figure cited for Texas reflected her earlier research indicating that the state would need about $20 billion in additional revenue to extend current programs and services through 2012-13. One year’s worth of the shortfall estimate is $10 billion. DeLuna-Castro noted that at the time of the Washington center’s research, Texas state government expected to spend $45 billion in fiscal 2011, a figure since reduced to $42.6 billion to account for agencies’ spending cuts last year. DeLuna-Castro said she has studied the California shortfall projection and thinks the Washington center’s research is solid there. She said she hasn’t studied projected shortfalls for New York or New Jersey. Finally, she cautioned that comparisons might overlook the fact that Texas lawmakers could tap billions of dollars in the state’s rainy day fund. She said other states, which budget annually, may have already dug into such funds. That seems a reasonable point. The Texas rainy day fund could ease the state’s shortfall--a fact not mentioned in Krugman’s column. Then again, tapping the fund requires a two-thirds vote of the GOP-majority Legislature, and some Republican legislators have said the fund is off-limits. Finally, the lead author of the state-by-state comparison, Elizabeth McNichol, a senior fellow with the Washington center, told us the comparison would soon be updated to reflect increases in projected shortfalls for Texas and California. "The problem that Texas is facing is on a similar level to these other states," McNichol said. As we noted recently, the Center for Public Policy Priorities now estimates that Texas needs nearly $27 billion more than the state expects to raise from taxes and other sources to maintain current government services and programs through 2012-13. McNichol told us by e-mail that the Washington center consequently considers the updated 2012 Texas shortfall to be $13.4 billion, equal to nearly 30 percent of the 2011 budget. At the time of Krugman’s column, the projected Texas shortfall was nowhere near New Jersey’s level. The comparisons of expected shortfalls in Texas, New York and California were accurate.

"World’s most popular candy to be removed from shelves by December 2017," stated a Dec. 18 headline on musclecarusa.info. The website is mostly about cars and had no contact information. "RIP Reese’s peanut butter cups," said the article, which cited a news conference about declining sales that did not happen. "Make sure to get you one before they are gone!" Peanut butter cup lovers have no reason to panic -- the candy remains available. A Hershey’s spokeswoman, Anna Lingeris, told PolitiFact in an email that the story is inaccurate. "Rest assured, the only people removing Reese’s products from shelves are consumers, who are taking them home to eat," she said. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. Because we were curious, and a little hungry, we researched whether Reese’s is the world’s most popular candy. Lingeris told PolitiFact that Reese’s is the No. 1 franchise in the candy-mints-gum category based on dollar sales, according to IRI Market Advantage, a market insights and analytics provider.

pomt-01379	Under Scott Walker's "tax plan, the average Wisconsin taxpayer got just $11 a month. But corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. Millionaires got at least $1,400 per year."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/16/mary-burke/scott-walkers-tax-plan-favors-rich-corporations-ov/	In a Mary Burke TV ad released Oct. 8, 2014, the narrator begins by asking: "What’s $11 buy you in Wisconsin? How about a pizza?" Sounds good. We're hungry. Then the ad quickly turns to one of Burke's key campaign themes -- that Gov. Scott Walker favors big business and the well-to-do over average folk. Under Walker's "tax plan," the narrator continues, "the average Wisconsin taxpayer got just $11 a month. But corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. Millionaires got at least $1,400 per year." The ad ends with "Scott Walker -- Millions for them, pizza for you." Doesn't sound quite as tasty any more. Burke’s reference to a "tax plan" suggests Walker has had only one, when there have been several measures affecting income and property taxes. And, notably, she expresses each dollar amount differently -- a small per-month figure for the average taxpayer, versus a large lump sum for corporations and a large per-year figure for millionaires. So let’s slice up Burke's claim into its three pieces and see what we have. Average taxpayer: $11 per month When the narrator speaks about the average taxpayer and Walker’s tax plan, a footnote appears on the screen referencing the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, and a date: July 28, 2014. But the footnote doesn’t give the viewer a clear idea of what Burke is citing -- or that it just provides a partial picture. A memo issued by the bureau on that day details two state income cuts signed into law by Walker in 2013. It says a taxpayer with an adjusted gross income of $40,000 to $50,000 will save an average of $133 in 2014. That comes to about $11 per month. Walker’s campaign, meanwhile, noted that the same memo pegs the average savings -- rather than the savings for the average taxpayer -- slightly higher, at $189 per year. That would be about $16 per month. The larger point, however, is that besides income tax cuts, Walker has approved a number of property tax relief measures. These are ignored by Burke, who made a broad claim but then supported it only by citing reductions in one type of tax. When Walker claimed that his various income and property tax cuts amount to $322 in the 2014 tax year for the average family, our rating was Mostly True. That comes to about $27 per month. We found that the income and property tax cuts would save the median-income family at least that much in 2014, although not every average family would save that much, particularly if they are not property owners. Corporations: $610 million Burke overstates the second part of her claim -- that corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. That figure is based on another fiscal bureau memo, which calculates tax savings over Walker’s full four-year term. The memo describes those tax reductions as being "targeted to businesses," not necessarily corporations, which suggests large operations. In other words, some of the tax cuts apply to small businesses as well. For example, $126 million of the $610 million comes from reducing the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses. Businesses organized like limited liability companies -- whose shareholders pay the firm's tax as personal income tax -- benefit from the reduction. Millionaires: $1,400 per year The third part of Burke’s claim goes back to the 2013 income tax cuts. The fiscal bureau estimated that people with an adjusted gross income of $300,000 or more would see a tax decrease averaging $1,402 in 2014. It’s worth noting that the $133 decrease for what Burke described as the average taxpayer was a reduction of 8 percent, while the the reduction for millionaires is 2.32 percent. And, again, she uses an annual figure for the millionaires, but a monthly one for the average folks. Our rating Burke said that under Walker's "tax plan, the average Wisconsin taxpayer got just $11 a month. But corporations got $610 million in tax cuts. Millionaires got at least $1,400 per year." The $11 refers only to income tax cuts, when in fact the typical taxpayer has also enjoyed property tax reductions. The $610 million applies to small businesses as well as corporations. And it’s correct that millionaires got at least $1,400 per year in tax reductions. In short, the claim uses different figures that when mashed together are misleading. For a statement that is partially accurate, but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True. To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-10282	Barack Obama has "pledged to reduce the size of the military."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/20/jerome-corsi/obama-wants-to-increase-the-size-of-the-military/	A new book — The Obama Nation by Jerome R. Corsi — attacks Barack Obama as a political extremist. Taken as a whole, the book's primary argument is that Obama is a likely communist sympathizer with ties to Islam who has skillfully hidden his true agenda as he ruthlessly pursues elected office. We found factual problems with Corsi's book and question its overall tone; read our extended story here. One of Corsi's attacks on Obama is that Obama advocates nuclear disarmament ( a statement we checked previously and rated False) and that he wants to reduce the size of the military. Here, we'll check whether Obama "pledged to reduce the size of the military" as Corsi charges. We consulted Obama's proposals on defense that are detailed on his campaign Web site. "Barack Obama supports plans to increase the size of the Army by 65,000 soldiers and the Marines by 27,000 troops," says the plan. "Increasing our end strength will help units retrain and re-equip properly between deployments and decrease the strain on military families." The policy also discusses building up "special operations forces, civil affairs, information operations, and other units and capabilities that remain in chronic short supply." Corsi says Obama has promised to reduce the size of the military, but he seems to be drawing that assumption from Obama's criticism of the Iraq war and Obama's promises to bring more transparency and rigor to the defense contracting process. Obama's written policy proposals say Obama intends to increase the size of the military. We find Corsi's statement False.	None	Jerome R. Corsi	None	None	None	2008-08-20T00:00:00	2008-08-01	['None']
pomt-09074	Langevin votes “the party line about 98 percent of the time."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jun/27/mark-zaccaria/zaccaria-says-langevin-votes-party-line-about-98-p/	Mark Zaccaria, one of three Republicans hoping to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. James Langevin in the 2nd District, issued a news release June 3 reacting to a Providence Journal story that concluded with this paragraph: "People are tired of partisan politics in Washington and they are tired of the bickering," Langevin said. "People know that I'm not [partisan]. They know that I try to find commonsense solutions to problems." Zaccaria's news release said: "Mr. Langevin is right that people are tired of partisan politics," Zaccaria said. "But I find it laughable that he would describe himself as 'non-partisan.' Langevin has been the most reliable vote for Speaker Pelosi, voting the party line about 98 percent of the time. If he doesn't see that as being partisan, then he is delusional. Rhode Island cannot afford to allow Mr. Langevin and Speaker Pelosi to continue to put people out of work and drive businesses out of this country while catering to their special interests." We were interested in two elements: Has Langevin voted the party line as often as Zaccaria says, and has he been "the most reliable vote for Speaker Pelosi?" We deal with the Pelosi claim in a separate item. We called Zaccaria’s campaign manager, Parker Lacoste, who told us that the actual percentage is even higher -- 99.2 percent -- and he referred us to a WashingtonPost.com web page of votes during the current Congress, which also shows whether Langevin’s votes conformed to the Democratic party line. The site reported that "James Langevin has voted with a majority of his Democratic colleagues 99.2% of the time during the current Congress. This percentage does not include votes in which Langevin did not vote." That's well above the 92.2 percent rate among all Democrats, which seems to bear out Zaccaria's point that Langevin, at least by his voting record, can't claim to be non-partisan. If anything, Zaccaria's original statement understates Langevin's Democratness. We rate it as True.	None	Mark S. Zaccaria	None	None	None	2010-06-27T00:02:00	2010-06-02	['None']

pomt-01301	"I fought 38 Studios from the beginning."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/30/gina-raimondo/gina-raimondo-says-she-battled-against-ill-fated-3/	The role played by Democrat Gina Raimondo in Rhode Island's investment in 38 Studios, the now-defunct video game company created by former Boston Red Sox star Curt Schilling, has been a source of contention throughout her run for governor. Raimondo’s Republican opponent, Allan Fung, has attacked her for urging the state to pay investors who bought the moral obligation bonds used to raise money for the company. In response, since Oct. 7, 2014, the Raimondo campaign has repeatedly aired a television commercial called "From the Beginning," which is intended to address the controversy. "You might have seen Allan Fung’s ad attacking me over 38 Studios," it begins. "I fought 38 Studios from the beginning." Raimondo has repeated that claim in debates, with Fung challenging that claim, saying that one email doesn't constitute a fight. So who’s right? First, a little background. In 2010, the General Assembly passed a bill authorizing the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation to guarantee up to $125 million in economic development bonds. The bill did not mention any potential beneficiary. But within weeks, the beneficiary became clear when the EDC approved a $75-million loan guarantee for 38 Studios. The company ultimately went bankrupt; the EDC, now the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation, owes a total of $115.9 million in principal, interest and fees to repay the bonds. At least two prominent Rhode Island politicians vigorously opposed the deal when it was proposed. Lincoln Chafee, when he was running for governor as an independent in 2010, repeatedly urged the EDC to reject the proposal. He repeatedly tried to address the EDC directly and showed up at one of its meetings, only to be rebuffed. Then-General Treasurer Frank Caprio, a Democrat also running for governor, eventually joined Chafee in his opposition, to the point where Gov. Donald Carcieri, who chaired the EDC, complained, "The attitudes and positions taken by Mr. Caprio and Mr. Chafee serve only to undermine the positive economic development steps the state has taken in recent years." Where was Raimondo, then a candidate for general treasurer, in all this? On July 16, 2010, she wrote an email to Keith Stokes, then EDC's director, expressing "significant concerns." "I would proceed very carefully on this," she wrote. "The fact that many have looked at it and passed is a red flag," a reference to other groups that had decided not to help finance the 38 Studios venture. So she was clearly voicing serious concerns. In addition, Raimondo's TV commercial references The Providence Journal of July 22, 2010, where an Ed Fitzpatrick column quotes Raimondo as saying, "Truly, this is a gamble. This company hasn’t launched a game yet. It’s pre-revenue; they haven’t made one penny. This could very easily be out of business in a year or two." The column appeared two days before the EDC took its final vote on the 38 Studios deal. Fitzpatrick, paraphrasing Raimondo, wrote: "Venture capitalists prefer to spread risk among a portfolio of 20 to 30 companies, but this $75-million loan guarantee is a big chunk of the state's new $125-million Job Creation Guaranty Program." Then he quoted Raimondo as saying, "This strategy is like, 'put all your chips on red and cross your fingers. It makes me nervous.'" But neither example shows Raimondo actively fighting the project. We asked Raimondo's campaign if it had any evidence of the candidate trying to block the deal. Spokeswoman Joy Fox said Raimondo met with Stokes and separately with Karl Wadensten, the only EDC member to vote against the proposal. We checked with Wadensten. He said he asked her about the pending deal during commercial breaks when he had her on his WPRO radio show. Asked about Raimondo's claim that she fought the deal, he responded, "With who? That's what I'm trying to figure out. With who? I had already made up my mind at that point." He said he couldn't recall how strongly she advised against the deal. Our ruling Gina Raimondo says, "I fought 38 Studios from the beginning." It's clear Raimondo had concerns about the deal. But calling something "a gamble," saying a deal makes you "nervous" and urging someone to "proceed very carefully" signals opposition but doesn't rise to the level of fighting. We couldn't find -- and her campaign couldn't produce -- any evidence that she actively tried to block the 38 Studios loan or that she specifically told anyone in authority that the deal should be rejected. To say she "fought 38 Studios" is a big stretch. We rate her claim as Mostly False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-14126	"We have been focusing so much, especially the Texas Department of Transportation, on that 97 percent of people in single-occupancy vehicles."	false	/texas/statements/2016/may/06/sylvester-turner/sylvester-turner-overstates-number-solo-drivers/	When Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner announced Carrin Patman as the new chairwoman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of Harris County board, he emphasized the vital role Patman would play in reducing Houstonians’ dependence on cars. "We have been focusing so much, especially the Texas Department of Transportation, on that 97 percent of people in single-occupancy vehicles," he said. Since Turner became mayor in January 2016, he’s emphasized public transit and other ways of fighting congestion in contrast to building more highways, a traditional focus of TxDOT. Turner, introducing Patman, brought up TxDOT’s focus on single-occupancy vehicles because he disagrees with the strategy of building roads to ease traffic congestion. We wanted to check his facts. Are 97 percent of people in single-occupancy vehicles? Origin of the 97 percent statistic The 97 percent statistic wasn’t limited to the March 4, 2016, event at City Hall. In fact, it’s been a regular part of Turner’s stump speeches of late, according to Houston Chronicle transportation reporter Dug Begley. He also mentioned the number at an announcement for other Metro appointments March 18, 2016, and at the Texas Active Transportation and Trails Conference in Houston on March 9, 2016, Begley said. We called the mayor’s staff to see where the 97 percent figure came from. His press team referred us to the city’s Planning and Development Department, which they said wrote Turner’s March 4 speech. By phone, Suzy Hartgrove, the planning department’s public affairs manager, told us the statistic referred to drivers in all of Texas -- not just Houston -- and that it had come from TxDOT Commissioner Bruce Bugg of San Antonio. Hartgrove said Bugg brought up the statistic at a January 25, 2016, meeting in to discuss traffic congestion in the Houston region. By email, Hartgrove forwarded Bugg’s slide show from a Jan. 28, 2016, presentation to Houston TranStar, the body that coordinates city and state agencies to respond to Houston-area traffic incidents. A slide in the presentation says that Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio were "home to 97 of the top 100 most congested roadway segments in Texas in 2015." In the email Hartgrove forwarded to us, planning department staff discussed how Bugg’s 97-of-100 point may have been misinterpreted in its drafting of Turner’s remarks. We turned to TxDOT; Austin-based spokeswoman Veronica Beyer responded by email, saying that Bugg "never used the words ‘single-occupancy vehicle.’" On the other hand, Beyer said, Bugg has offered a few similar statistics, including that "97 percent of Texans who choose to travel do so by car, truck or van." What that statistic means When Turner first started bringing up this statistic in January, the Houston Chronicle took a close look at his facts. In Jan. 28, 2016, remarks before the Texas Transportation Commission, Turner said that "TxDOT has noted that 97 percent of Texans currently drive a single-occupancy vehicle for their daily trips." That comment differs slightly from his statement at hand -- it refers to daily trips, not 97 percent of all people. Begley’s analysis of that number in an annotated transcript of the speech helps with the number we’re looking at, too: "This number is commonly used in various ways but is misapplied most of the time," the Chronicle said. "In a 2006 study by Texas A&M University, it was stated 95.4 percent of workers over age 16 use a car, van or truck to get to work. However the number included carpoolers and only covered trips to [and] from work, as opposed to all driving. According to the Census Bureau, 79.9 percent of commuters drive alone to work in the state. Around 11 percent share a ride to work. About 4 percent work at home and 1.6 percent statewide use public transit." The upshot: "Solo drivers dominate any breakdown of how Texans travel, but it is not as high as many people claim," the story said. Beyer, from TxDOT, also offered some backup that points to these numbers from the Chronicle as the most reliable. She sent us a chart from the U.S. Department of Commerce indicating that in 2013, 96.1 percent of Texans who commuted to work chose a car, truck or van. Notably, that figure folded in carpools so it wasn’t referring solely to single-occupancy vehicles. How many people are in single-occupancy vehicles? Absent other data, then, we suspect it’s not quite 97 percent of people driving single-occupancy vehicles. So, how many are driving solo? It’s hard to say exactly. We have the numbers on commuters from the Census Bureau: 79.9 percent of Texas workers in 2013 drove alone to work. For all driving, however, it’s tougher to pinpoint how many people driving solo. We reached out to the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University, which connected us with Phil Lasley, a researcher there. Lasley told us by phone that it is difficult to get numbers related to all trips. Surveys that measure that data are rarely done, he said. Lasley was looking at the Census data that says 79.9 percent of people drive alone to work. Lasley, asked if that number would be higher or lower if it took into account all driving, said he thought it would be higher. "People who carpool are generally going to work. People wouldn’t jump in a carpool to go to the dry cleaners or pick up kids from school," he said. During the school day especially, when many people are on the road getting errands done, drivers tend to be by themselves, he said. Lasley also pointed out that trips to and from work -- which is the data the 79.9 percent refers to, and the closest survey result we found to generally gauge single-occupancy drivers -- only made up 16 percent of all trips in Texas from April 2008 to April 2009, according to the 2009 National Household Travel Survey, the most recent (the 2016 survey is underway). Most driving was for social and recreational trips, errands and shopping before commuting. The average vehicle in that time frame, driving for all purposes, had 1.67 people in it, according to the National Household Travel Survey. Our ruling Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, decrying traditional emphases on road building to ease traffic congestion, said 97 percent of people drive single-occupancy vehicles. This figure looks like it was based on a misread of another official’s declarations. And while we found little data about how many of us always drive solo, Census research suggests that about 80 percent of commuters drive alone, but commuting accounts for less than 20 percent of total driving, according to the latest survey we could find. It is 100 percent time to park this stat; we rate his claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

The Coalition has not yet achieved 50 per cent female membership of government boards, but this target was only set in March 2016. In the two years since, the Government has boosted female representation on boards. Data available at the time of Ms McGowan's claim, for December 2017, shows women had achieved a record 44.5 per cent board membership. This is up from 40.5 per cent recorded in June 2016, three months after the Government set the target, and from 42.7 per cent in June 2017. In total, this amounts to an increase of 4 percentage points in 18 months. Under the Coalition, between June 2016 and December 2017, female representation increased by an average of 0.22 percentage points per month. Under Labor, between June 2010 and June 2013, the average monthly increase was 0.2 percentage points. The proportion of women on boards fell back under former Coalition prime minister Tony Abbott. However, Ms McGowan's claim relates to the period since March 2016 when the Turnbull government set the 50 per cent target. On current trends, that target would be met by January 2020. Experts consulted by Fact Check said that while governments effectively control the selection of board appointees, there are constraints on how quickly they can change the composition of government boards. These include, for example, fixed terms for current board members, which typically last three to five years. Professor Meredith Edwards said that given these constraints, the rate achieved since introducing Mr Turnbull's 50 per cent target was quite good. During 2016-17, the proportion of new board appointments that went to women was 46.2 per cent, down slightly from 46.5 per cent in 2015-16, and lower than the record 47.6 per cent achieved in 2012-13, Labor's last year of government.

pomt-00835	Job growth in the United States is now at the "fastest pace in this country's history."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/24/david-simas/white-house-aide-says-job-growth-now-fastest-pace-/	With the economy finally seeming to turn a corner, the Obama administration has been more aggressive recently about touting its accomplishments in creating jobs. But a claim made by one White House official recently was novel enough to catch our attention. The claim was made on CNN’s New Day by David Simas, the assistant to the president and director of the White House’s office of political strategy and outreach. "We're more than happy to compare the record of this administration over the past six years that inherited the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and is in the fifth year of record job creation, which is the fastest pace in this country's history," Simas told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota. Is job growth at the "fastest pace in this country's history"? We took a closer look. We found that he actually had mangled his talking point: He meant to talk about how many months of consistent growth there’s been, not how fast the pace is. We’ll look at both metrics. Because the current recovery began 69 months ago, we looked at total job gains during the first 69 months of each of the previous recoveries, going back to World War II. (Employment data is not easily comparable further back than that.) We ignored the first dip of the double-dip recession in the early 1980s; we counted only from the end of the second dip. Here are the results: End month of recession Percent increase in nonfarm employment in first 69 months from end of recession October 1945 25 percent October 1949 18 percent May 1954 11 percent April 1958 12 percent February 1961 21 percent November 1970 13 percent March 1975 18 percent November 1982 19 percent March 1991 11 percent November 2001 5 percent June 2009 8 percent This shows that far from being the "fastest" job growth in history, the pace of growth after the Great Recession was actually the second slowest out of these 11 time periods. "I don't see any way to claim that the speed of growth in this recovery, even recently, is any kind of record," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Indeed, that's how many Americans seem to feel about the current recovery. "Accounting for the severity of the recession, the speed of the jobs rebound was disappointing, especially in the first three or so years of the recovery," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. So what’s going on? The White House told PolitiFact that Simas was referring to something else -- that the ongoing streak of 60 months of private-sector job growth is the longest on record. Here, the White House has a point. Sinclair agreed that the United States is currently enjoying the "longest string of consistently positive monthly job growth since the payroll employment data we typically rely on began being reported in 1939. The late 1980s comes close, but there was a pesky one-month fall in employment in June 1986. Similarly, in the 1990s, there were a couple of small dips." Overall, it’s the duration of this recovery -- rather than the rate of growth for job creation -- that has made it impressive. Our ruling Simas said job growth in the United States is now at the "fastest pace in this country's history." He would have been right if he’d stuck to the duration of the recovery: At 60 months and counting, it’s the longest post-war recovery, though earlier recoveries would have been longer had brief blips not intruded. However, looking at how Simas phrased it on CNN, he’s wrong: The current recovery actually ranks second-to-last among post-World War II recoveries when judged by the rate of growth in jobs. We rate the claim False.	None	David Simas	None	None	None	2015-03-24T16:35:41	2015-03-18	['United_States']
pomt-11157	Republican candidate for California governor Travis Allen "gave campaign donations to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Barbara Boxer."	mostly true	/california/statements/2018/may/25/john-cox/did-gop-candidate-california-governor-really-donat/	Did Travis Allen, arguably the most conservative candidate for California governor, donate campaign money to three of the state’s leading liberal Democrats? That’s the Republican-on-Republican attack levied by John Cox’s campaign for governor in a recent TV ad that goes after Allen, an Orange County assemblyman who’s positioned himself as a GOP populist. Here’s the full text of the ad, which includes three attacks on Allen: Narrator: "For Republicans, the race for governor is crystal clear: There’s conservative businessman John Cox, leading the opposition to Jerry Brown’s Sanctuary State and chairman of the initiative campaign to repeal the gas tax. Then there’s career politician Travis Allen. He gave campaign donations to Jerry Brown. Gavin Newsom and Barbara Boxer. And on the floor vote, Allen refused to join Republicans opposing driver licenses for illegal aliens. The conservative choice is clear: John Cox for governor." The ad was paid for by John Cox for Governor 2018. We’ll examine the other two attacks on Allen in future fact-checks. In this piece, we’ll focus on the claim he donated to top Democrats. Background on GOP rivals Recent polls show growing support for Cox’s campaign for governor, less than a week after President Trump endorsed the San Diego businessman. A survey released Wednesday night from the Public Policy Institute of California shows Newsom, the state’s lieutenant governor, leading Cox, 25 percent to 19 percent. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa was third, at 15 percent, followed by Allen with 11 percent, State Treasurer John Chiang at 9 percent and former state schools chief Delaine Eastin with 6 percent. Cox and Allen have sparred at campaign events over who is the most conservative candidate. They’ve both criticized California’s Democratic leadership over the gas tax increase and sanctuary state protections. The top two candidates in the June 5 primary, regardless of party affiliation, will move on to the November runoff. Donating to Democrats? The ad accuses Allen of donating to three of the state’s top Democrats. The irony, of course, is that Allen’s run for governor has centered on criticizing those same politicians, particularly Brown and Newsom. We found clear evidence supporting the claim, though Cox’s ad ignores the fact that the contributions took place nearly a decade ago, before Allen ran for elected office, and that he also donated to Republicans. Campaign finance records show that in October 2010, Allen donated $1,000 to Jerry Brown for Governor, through Wealth Strategies Group, his wealth management firm in Huntington Beach. In August 2010, Allen gave $100 to Gavin Newsom for Lieutenant Governor. And, in October 2010, he donated $250 to Barbara Boxer for Senate. SOURCE: Campaign finance records from the California Secretary of State's website. Asked about this, a spokeswoman for Allen’s campaign said in an email that the contributions took place "before Travis was an elected official, as a businessman, he purchased tickets to some events." A November 2017 Mercury-News article summarized these and additional donations Allen made to Democrats in 2010 and 2011. He told the paper at that time: "As a businessman I was invited to some events by friends, and I purchased tickets to these events. Attending these events, however, opened my eyes to the damage the Democrats were doing to California, and brought about my decision to do everything in my power to stop them, including running for public office." Similar claim In April 2016, PolitiFact California rated Mostly True a similar claim about then Presidential candidate Donald Trump donating to Democrats. Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, at the time Trump’s rival for the Republican presidential nomination, claimed Trump "has given $12,000 to Jerry Brown, Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris." Campaign finance data showed the claim was accurate, though we noted Cruz left out that the donations took place long before Trump announced his run for president. The contribution to Jerry Brown took place in 2006, while the donations to the other Democrats took place in 2009, 2011 and 2013. Our ruling In a recent TV ad, John Cox’s campaign for governor claimed rival GOP candidate Travis Allen donated to three of California’s top Democrats. Campaign records prove the claim, though the contributions took place a decade ago, before Allen entered politics. The statement is accurate but needs this clarification. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-14874	"Obamacare isn't helping anyone."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/11/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-obamacare-isnt-helping-anyone/	The Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare to some -- is a perennial target of Republicans. But at the GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee, Carly Fiorina made a particularly strong statement about the law’s ineffectiveness. "Look, I'm a cancer survivor, okay?" Fiorina told moderator Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network. "I understand that you cannot have someone who's battled cancer just become known as a pre-existing condition. I understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help. But, I also understand that Obamacare isn't helping anyone." Fiorina’s staff did not respond to an inquiry, but during the debate, she listed a number of problems she has with the law. "It is crony capitalism at its worst," she said. "Who helped write this bill? Drug companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies. … Health insurance has always been a cozy, little game between regulators and health insurance companies." Fiorina also said that "Obamacare is crushing small businesses, it is not helping the families it was intended to help. So, let us allow states to manage high risk pools. Let us try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried, the free market. Let us ensure that as patients, and customers, that we have information to shop wisely for our health care." Reasonable arguments can be made against the law and its many provisions. But is no one at all getting any actual help from the law? We decided to take a closer look. Here are some of the provisions of the law and estimates of how many people have benefited from each. The estimates are from Charles Gaba, who has spent several years crunching the numbers for usage of the law at the blog ACAsignups.net. Gaba’s estimates are current through November 2015 unless noted: • Americans currently enrolled in policies bought on the ACA’s online exchange: 9.5 million, of which roughly 8 million are receiving subsidies under the law. Another 2.5 million were enrolled in such policies during 2015 but have since dropped their coverage. • Net number of Americans added to Medicaid due to the law: 15 million. This includes 10 million added through direct expansion of Medicaid under the law, 4 million new but previously eligible beneficiaries who signed up for Medicaid after the ACA passed, and about 1 million transferred to Medicaid from existing, state-based programs. • Number of young adults age 19 to 26 who have been able to stay on their parents’ insurance due to the law: Possibly 1 million to 3 million, but the numbers change so often it’s hard to get a solid number. Of the 25 million-plus total from these three categories, Gaba estimates, roughly 17 million are newly insured specifically because of the law -- approximately 5 million through the exchanges, 11 million through Medicaid, and 1 million assorted others. Here are a couple of more ways people are benefitting: • Americans no longer at risk for coverage denial due to pre-existing conditions: As PolitiFact has previously reported, between 19 percent and 50 percent of Americans fall into this category, or between 60 million and 160 million people. • Americans no longer at risk of being kicked off policies for developing expensive medical conditions: Smaller than the previous categories, but unknown. There is some overlap between these categories. But whatever the number is, it’s in the tens of millions -- and most of those people, Gaba said, "would disagree that it's ‘not helping anyone.’ " Jonathan Oberlander, a professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, added two additional categories of Americans who have benefited from the ACA: • Medicare Part D beneficiaries, who are getting better prescription drug coverage: 39 million Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in the program. These and other Medicare beneficiaries are also getting such new benefits as free preventive screenings and an annual wellness checkup. • Americans with private insurance who now have access to preventive services at no charge: Unknown, but likely in the millions. Another way to look at it holistically is to gauge the net impact on national uninsurance rates. They have fallen sharply since the law has been put into practice, as this chart from the Kaiser Family Foundation illustrates: "The statement is utter nonsense. Put simply, it is a wild exaggeration that amounts to a lie," Oberlander said. "You can certainly debate the overall impact and desirability of Obamacare. But to say it isn’t helping anyone is to ignore both reality and overwhelming evidence to the contrary." Policy experts who have mixed feelings about the law or oppose it outright say that some of these benefits have come at too high a cost, or have left more people significantly hurt than significantly helped. For instance, Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and who has provided unofficial advice to Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign, said the law has squeezed out many of the more limited-benefit and catastrophic-coverage plans that beneficiaries may have liked, forcing them to pay for more expensive policies. "This has been a problem for people above 300 percent of the poverty line who get small subsidies, and it’s been a real problem for people above 400 percent of the poverty line who get no subsidy," Wilensky said. Michael Tanner, a scholar at the Cato Institute, said there have been both winners and losers, and that he expects that "the losers far outnumber the winners." That said, both Wilensky and Tanner agreed that Fiorina went too far in saying that "Obamacare isn't helping anyone." "People on expanded Medicaid or who were previously uninsured and substantially subsidized in the exchange are better off than they were," Wilensky said, even if "they may or may not be as well off as they could be." Tanner added that, despite his qualms with the law, "you can’t truthfully say that no one has benefited. Even if you believe that the previously uninsured are paying too much for crummy policies under the ACA, as I do, I don’t think you can say that none of them have benefited at all. That’s a pretty low bar, of course. If you flew across the country dumping money from an airplane, some people would benefit." Our ruling Fiorina said that "Obamacare isn't helping anyone." Even taking the low end of estimates, tens of millions of Americans have benefited from the ACA, in big ways (such as securing insurance for the first time) or smaller ways (paying less for drugs under Medicare Part D). One does not have to buy into every aspect of the law or feel comfortable with its overall price tag to acknowledge that lots of people have benefited from it.

pomt-13833	"Independent analysts say (Donald Trump) would add $30 trillion to the national debt."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/13/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-according-analysts-donald-tru/	Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have found common ground criticizing Donald Trump’s policy agenda, with Sanders formally endorsing Clinton as the Democratic nominee for president at a rally in New Hampshire. "Compare what Sen. Sanders and I intend to do with Donald Trump's plan," Clinton said. "His tax plan would make our current system even worse. Independent analysts say he would add $30 trillion to the national debt in order to give a massive gift to the wealthiest Americans, Wall Street money managers and our largest corporations. But after all, what else should we expect from someone who calls himself ‘The King of Debt?’ " We wondered whether Clinton was right that "independent analysts say (Donald Trump) would add $30 trillion to the national debt." As we have previously noted, the figure originated in a report from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that, among other things, regularly analyzes the broader economic effects of presidential candidates’ tax proposals. In its report, the center found that "including interest costs, the proposal would add $11.2 trillion to the national debt by 2026 and $34.1 trillion by 2036." This estimate assumes no major spending cuts would be made, which tracks with the historical pattern, the authors said. The Clinton campaign also noted that Trump has never specified any cuts to offset his plan. So Clinton has a point that the $30 trillion-plus figure has been used by an independent organization. Still, it’s worth noting a couple caveats. • That analysis uses a 20-year time frame. When groups like the Tax Policy Center analyze the budgetary impact of policy proposals, they typically use a fixed "window" of time to measure the effects. Usually, it’s a 10-year window. In this case, the center offered both a 10-year window and a somewhat more unconventional 20-year window. Over 10 years, the center projected, Trump’s policies would increase the debt by $11.2 trillion. Over 20 years, they would increase the debt by $34.1 trillion. So Clinton cherry-picked the bigger one for her talking point -- a figure that was three times as big, and which used an unconventional window of time. Regardless of the time frame she used, failing to indicate a time period for the figure is somewhat misleading, said Roberton Williams, a Tax Policy Center fellow. • Clinton overlooked a study with a smaller projected debt increase. Another study of Trump’s policies, by the economic forecasting firm Moody’s, offered three scenarios, depending on whether one takes Trump’s policy proposals at face value, whether he enacts them with some compromises, or whether he ends up unable to enact much of his agenda. All the scenarios look at the impact of the resulting policies over 10 years. The first scenario produces additional debt of $9.7 trillion above current policies. The second produces a debt increase of $6.9 trillion above current policies. And the last produces a debt increase of less than $1 trillion above current policies. That final scenario is about 3 percent of the amount Clinton cited in the speech. Our ruling Clinton said that "independent analysts say (Donald Trump) would add $30 trillion to the national debt." The number does come from an independent, nonpartisan report. But Clinton didn’t cite the 20-year time frame for her statement, an important omission. And, she ignored smaller (though still substantial) projected increases from independent analysts. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate the statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8a31cb99-354b-40e1-a2c7-4eae5158d98b	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-07-13T15:05:52	2016-07-12	['None']

pomt-08748	The DeWine campaign is "receiving money from so many more people. (Cordray's) money is coming almost exclusively from the party, labor unions, and special counsel that he has given business to."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/30/mike-dewine/mike-dewine-says-attorney-general-richard-cordrays/	One notion that Democrats in Ohio and elsewhere haven’t been able to shake over the last generation or so is that their campaigns are funded by cigar-puffing party big wigs and labor bosses. In the race to become Ohio’s next Attorney General, Republican candidate Mike DeWine played up to just this kind of stereotype during an interview with ONN anchor Jim Heath on the Aug. 15 edition of Capitol Square. Heath asked DeWine if he was concerned about trailing Democratic Attorney General Richard Cordray in fundraising. Cordray reported he had $3.5 million at the end of July, while DeWine, a former U.S. senator, had $2.1 million. After explaining that recent campaign finance reports showed the fundraising gap narrowing, DeWine turned the focus back onto Cordray, insinuating that he is a tool of the Democratic party and labor union bosses with a much narrower base of support. "The good thing I think is that we are receiving money from so many more people," DeWine said. "His (Cordray) money is coming almost exclusively from the party, labor unions, and special counsel that he has given business to." Surely, Cordray has received donations from the state party, labor unions and lawyers who got special contracts that are routinely doled out by the attorney general’s office. But is it "almost exclusively" from those sources? And can DeWine really lay claim to a much broader grassroots fundraising base? It sounded like a perfect job for PolitiFact, so we rolled up our sleeves, printed out a stack of campaign finance reports from 2009 and 2010 and got to work with multiple highlighters at the ready. The easiest part to figure out was the total number of donations each candidate received. DeWine was absolutely right about getting money from "so many more people." He got 4,811 individual donations compared to 1,529 for Cordray through the July 2010 reporting period. Clearly, DeWine has a much wider donation base. This is fueled in part by DeWine having a lot more micro-donors — the Republican had 428 people who gave $10 bucks or less while Cordray only had 43 in the last two years. Overall, Cordray has raised about $3.28 million, with the biggest single source coming from money from county and state parties which totals about $1.25 million—about 38 percent of his fundraising total. Most of that $1.25 million came from the state party coffers which kicked in about $1.15 million. And -- just as DeWine had surmised on the television program -- labor unions accounted for another big chunk of change. Cordray has received about $500,000 from Big Labor—which works out to be about 15 percent of his $3.28 million pile. The trickiest part was to try to figure out how many folks who got special counsel contracts from Cordray’s office also gave money to his campaign. To figure this out, we asked the attorney general’s office for a list of lawyers with special counsel contracts, as well as those approved to do collections for his office. It turns out that a number of firms with contracts did contribute — a total of almost $195,000 by our count — or about 6 percent of what Cordray has raised. (To be fair, a number of folks with special counsel contracts haven’t given anything at all to Cordray.) Leading the way are the attorneys for Calfee, Halter & Griswold. Employees from that Cleveland-based firm have donated $24,350. Calfee, Halter & Griswold has contracts that could be worth up to $1.13 million working primarily on patent matters for Cleveland State University, Ohio State University, Ohio University, Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine as well as the Department of Development. Add it up and here’s what you get: State and county Democratic Party accounts, labor unions and law firms with special contracts gave about 60 percent of the money raised by Cordray during this election cycle. That’s a clear majority of the dollars raised by Cordray but a far cry from "almost exclusively" providing the funds, as DeWine had claimed. So while DeWine was absolutely right in saying that he has a wider base, he missed the mark in claiming that Cordray’s dough came "almost exclusively" from a trio of sources. As a result, we rate his claim to be Half True. Comment on this item.	None	Mike DeWine	None	None	None	2010-08-30T10:45:00	2010-08-15	['None']

The question has swirled around in recent weeks as she runs for president, in large measure on her record as a policymaking first lady. She answered, in part: "Well, actually, Tim, the (National) Archives is moving as rapidly as the Archives moves. There's about 20-million pieces of paper there and they are moving, and they are releasing as they do their process. And I am fully in favor of that. Now, all of the records, as far as I know, about what we did with health care, those are already available." Clinton must be misinformed. It's true that many of the documents from the unsuccessful health care effort that Sen. Clinton helmed are available, but there are several gaps in the record, such as her calendar and internal memos. Judicial Watch, a conservative think tank and longtime Clinton critic, is suing to have its Freedom of Information Act request on the records filled. Also missing from the records are any correspondence on health care between her and former President Clinton. That has been designated for review at the former president's request. It's not knowable whether the documents will be cleared in time for either the primary or general election, but given delays at the National Archives and in the reviewing process, it seems questionable. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11061	"Obama administration kept illegal Mexican kids in detention camps as ‘experiment’"	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/25/blog-posting/did-obama-detain-illegal-mexican-children-experime/	Public outcry over President Donald Trump’s now-terminated family separation policy inspired several defenses of the practice, with many conservative politicians and pundits arguing that it was a continuation of policies from earlier administrations. According to one blog site, Trump’s policy was no worse than a pilot program put in place under President Barack Obama. "Obama administration kept illegal Mexican kids in detention camps as ‘experiment,’" said a June 16, 2018 headline from the Lid, an online blog. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Citing a Feb. 11, 2015, report from the Washington Post, the Lid story compared Trump’s policy to Obama’s Juvenile Referral Process, a pilot program in south Texas that sought to cut down on smuggling by detaining and questioning unaccompanied minors — known as "circuit children" — suspected of helping Mexican drug cartels transport people and narcotics across the border. The story said Obama’s program resulted in border agents "tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment." "Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in ‘facilities’ so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels," the story said. "A program to detain kids is okay under a Democratic Party president, but preventing kids from going to jail with their parents is considered un-American when the president is a Republican." We decided to check this claim out and see how Trump’s policy compared with the Obama program; we found significant differences between the policies and their outcomes. The Lid did not respond to a request for comment sent via Facebook Messenger. Trump’s policy Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an April memorandum announcing a "zero-tolerance" policy, according to which all immigrants apprehended for illegally crossing the U.S. border were referred for federal prosecution. Many immigrants subject to the zero-tolerance policy were adults traveling with children. Due to a 2015 district court decision, children cannot be held in federal jails with adults facing prosecution. Previous administrations shied away from prosecuting adults with children and, after the 2015 decision, tended to release families rather than separate them. But the Trump administration, citing its zero-tolerance policy, was separating families and placing children in shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services until they could be released to a sponsor. More than 2,300 children were separated from adults between May 5 and June 9, according to the Department of Homeland Security. There was no law requiring the separation of families, and Trump was not "preventing kids from going to jail" by ordering it, as the Lid story suggested. The Juvenile Referral Process Obama’s Juvenile Referral Process operated from May 2014 to September 2015 as a pilot program meant to combat smuggling. The program was the brainchild of former Border Patrol agent Robert Harris, whose intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of guides smuggling migrants and drugs into the U.S. were Mexicans younger than 18. Mexican drug cartels often hire or conscript teenagers to smuggle people and drugs across the border because teenagers are not prosecuted if caught. Under laws governing treatment of "unaccompanied alien children," minors from Mexico and Canada can be immediately sent back to their country. Sometimes they are deported by bus the same day they are apprehended. Minors from other nations, by contrast, must be transferred within 72 hours to the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement and placed in the least restrictive setting possible until they can be flown home. Mexican teenagers smuggling on behalf of drug cartels are known as "circuit children," and Harris told the Washington Post that several were caught and released multiple times before the Juvenile Referral Process, which was designed to deter repeat crossings. In short, Mexican children suspected of smuggling drugs were held by the U.S. government rather than immediately being sent home. "It was used for unaccompanied Mexican minors who had multiple apprehensions – up to 30 a year in a few cases – and thus were thought to be working on behalf of human and drug smuggling organizations," said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute. The pilot progam also was established to create "some type of consequence for children involved in smuggling, as they are usually just returned to Mexico and often cross again," said Maureen Meyer, director for Mexico and migrant rights at the Washington Office on Latin America. Under the program, Border Patrol worked with the federal prosecutors to determine whether to criminally prosecute a repeat border-crosser suspected of smuggling. Those not selected for prosecution were referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement like minors from non-contiguous countries instead of being deported. While detained — sometimes for months — and awaiting the chance to appear before an immigration court, minors under the Juvenile Referral Process faced questioning from U.S. authorities about their affiliations. Most minors who completed the program were eventually deported after seeing an immigration judge, according to a 2015 report from the Washington Office on Latin America. Denise Gilman, a law professor who directs the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, said conditions under the Juvenile Referral Process were not great. "It was a small pilot program for sure, although the detention facilities were certainly problematic and the length of detention uncertain," she said. Gilman noted that other facilities in Karnes City and Dilley, Texas, which the Obama administration used as licensed childcare facilities to detain families seeking asylum, did "resemble internment camps." She said this practice was "carefully circumscribed" by the end of the Obama administration as a result of legal challenges. But those facilities were separate from the process created under the Juvenile Referral Process, which handled only unaccompanied "circuit children" and placed them in the same Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities used for unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries. According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement website, these facilities are state-licensed and provide a range of care — including foster care, group homes, shelter, staff secure, secure and residential treatment centers — and they offer classroom education, health care, socialization and recreation opportunities, mental health services, legal services and case management. Meyer said these children were usually placed in the "‘secure’ juvenile detention centers that are more restrictive" because of their criminal activities. "I never heard of any Mexican child in a ‘detention camp,’" she said. Still, human rights advocates objected to the Juvenile Referral Program as an intelligence-gathering enterprise that could jeopardize minors’ post-deportation security. Violent drug cartels often retaliate against members suspected of talking with law enforcement by taking action against them or their families. Our ruling An online blog claimed, "Obama administration kept illegal Mexican kids in detention camps as 'experiment.'" The statement sounds far more sinister than the facts in evidence. The "experiment," the Juvenile Referral Process, detained older unaccompanied minors suspected of smuggling drugs or other immigrants across the border. These minors otherwise would have been immediately deported. They were housed in Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities in order to extract intelligence and cut down on smuggling. The pilot program lasted for slightly more than one year. Finally, the minors were not experimented on; rather, the program itself was a test. The statement has an element of truth, but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-05268	"In the state of Rhode Island 25 percent of our current physicians are graduates of for-profit medical schools."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/may/29/joseph-mcnamara/ri-rep-joseph-mcnamara-says-25-percent-rhode-islan/	State Rep. Joseph M. McNamara has been out front supporting a virtually unheard of idea in America: a for-profit medical school. McNamara, a Warwick Democrat who chairs the House Health, Education and Welfare Committee, is pushing a bill that would place a "Rhode Island School of Osteopathic Medicine" on the same local stage now dominated by Brown University’s nonprofit Warren Alpert Medical School. In advocating for the school, McNamara took to the House floor recently. Responding to insinuations from a Brown dean that for-profit schools produced less competent doctors, McNamara told fellow legislators "in the state of Rhode Island 25 percent of our current physicians are graduates of for-profit medical schools." And, McNamara said, no one’s suggesting they’re any less qualified than doctors from nonprofit schools. We’re aware of the growing number of for-profit colleges and universities around the country, particularly on the web. But for-profit medical schools are much rarer. We wondered whether so many of Rhode Island’s doctors could be graduates of such schools. So we called McNamara and asked where he got his 25 percent figure. McNamara said it was cited in a letter he received from Steven C. Rodger, the principal proponent of the for-profit medical school. Rodger is president and CEO of R3 Education, a Massachusetts-based holding company that runs three for-profit medical schools in the Caribbean offering MD degrees. Rodger had earlier told McNamara’s committee that the new Rhode Island school would help ease the state’s shortage of primary care physicians, create up to 300 new jobs and generate more tax revenue, while charging significantly lower tuition than other medical schools. When McNamara faxed us Rodger’s letter, we immediately saw a couple of problems with his statement. The most obvious: the letter doesn’t say what McNamara said on the House floor, that 25 percent of Rhode Island’s doctors graduated from for-profit schools. Instead, it says Rhode Island has "over 25 percent of its active physicians workforce comprised of IMG’s," an acronym for international medical graduates. In other words: more than a quarter of Rhode Island’s doctors, according to the letter, graduated from international medical schools. That doesn’t mean they are all for-profit schools. We called Rodger to find out where his figure came from. He pointed us to the 2011 State Physician Workforce Data Book, published by the Association of American Medical Colleges. That report includes a table (actually prepared by the American Medical Association) showing that 908 of Rhode Island’s 3,513 active physicians in 2010 graduated from international medical schools, or 25.8 percent. That places Rhode Island 11th in the country in terms of the percentage of doctors who graduated from international medical schools. But again that doesn’t get to McNamara’s statement that a quarter of the state’s doctors graduated from for-profit medical schools. The United States has only one for-profit medical school, according to several sources:Rocky Vista University College of Osteopathic Medicine, in Parker, Colo., which opened in 2008. There are more than 2,246 medical schools around the world (including 137 accredited U.S. schools), according to the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research. That’s a nonprofit group associated with the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, a private Philadelphia organization that certifies the readiness of international medical students into U.S. graduate programs. Rodger said he believes that most international medical schools, such as the three his company runs, are for-profit ventures, but he didn’t have any hard facts. His letter to McNamara made the same general statement without any attribution. PolitiFact Rhode Island tried to verify if that was true by checking with the Association of American Medical Colleges, the American Medical Association, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine and finally the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates. None could say how many international medical schools were for-profit. Our ruling McNamara concedes he misspoke on the House floor. He said "25 percent of our current physicians are graduates of for-profit medical schools." He meant to say that a quarter of Rhode Island’s doctors graduated from international medical schools. McNamara says he was relying on information Rodger presented: "We [legislators] assume that people give us information that is accurate." But Rodger did provide accurate information -- as far as it went -- McNamara just cited it inaccurately. We rule his statement False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-13912	The National Park Service has "an annual budget that is less than the city of Austin."	true	/texas/statements/2016/jun/24/jonathan-jarvis/national-park-service-director-correct-its-budget-/	From the mountains to the valleys and to the oceans, the U.S. government spends less money running parks than Austin devotes to city government, a federal honcho told Congress. Jonathan Jarvis, director of the National Park Service, prefaced his June 14, 2016, mention of Austin with some agency self-celebration, telling the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: "The NPS manages many of our nation’s most iconic and beloved landscapes and historic sites. We are responsible for managing more than 400 individual parks with more than 84 million acres of land, stretching from Acadia National Park in the State of Maine to the National Park of American Samoa in the South Pacific. The NPS also manages numerous wild and scenic rivers and national trails; programs that recognize our nation’s historic structures; and programs that help local governments and organizations provide recreational opportunities and protect open space. We are seeing record-breaking visitation -- more than 300 million last year -- and the resulting economic activity created by the parks topped $16 billion." "We are accomplishing all of this," Jarvis said next, "on an annual budget that is less than the city of Austin, Texas." Right off, Jarvis seemed right on the numbers. For the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 2015, the park service’s budget amounts to $3.4 billion, which folds in $2.85 billion appropriated by Congress plus expected fee revenue, a park service spokesman, Jeff Olson, advised by email. The service has 22,000 employees, he said. Olson, asked how Jarvis came to single out Austin, said that in preparing for the House hearing, Jarvis "was looking for another government entity's budget with which to compare the NPS." Jarvis settled on Austin for his comparison after looking online for the budgets of various cities, Olson said. For the same fiscal year, the Austin City Council approved a $3.5 billion budget, according to the published city budget. A city spokesman, David Green, conceded the numerical differences though he indicated that comparing the total budgets obscures vast differences between the federal agency and Austin city government. "While it is accurate to say Austin’s $3.5 billion budget is larger than that of the National Park Service," Green said by email, "it is difficult to make a direct comparison. The City of Austin has over 13,000 employees spread across more than 40 departments – including our own Water and Electric utilities – that provide daily direct service to more than 900,000 residents. The scope and mission of the city is simply too varied to make an apples-to-apples comparison," Green said. Olson, reacting to Green’s analysis, said by email: "It may be difficult to compare Austin to the NPS. While the city serves 900,000 residents, the NPS serves more than 300 million visitors each year, many of them from Austin, no doubt." A federal wrinkle? We asked a pro-parks group, the National Parks Conservation Association, about Jarvis’ claim. By email, spokeswoman Kati Schmidt said association experts pegged the service’s fiscal 2016 budget at $3.377 billion "after adding appropriated funds plus fees and other mandatory funding." But Schmidt also illuminated additional money coming to the park service for federal road projects. "Park service roads also benefit from Highway Trust Fund dollars for maintenance totaling $268 million this year," Schmidt wrote. That $268 million would drive up the agency’s total expected 2016 spending to $3.645 billion by our calculation--which would exceed Austin city government’s $3.5 billion budget. But hold on: We ran this thought past the park service’s Olson who said by phone it’s fair to say the additional roads money is being spent by the agency. Yet Olson said by email the $268 million is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation budget. The association’s Schmidt further told us the park service’s "resources/facilities also benefit at times from a variety of other random smaller sources like state grants and private donations (both monetary and in-kind), but we don’t have any sum total of all funding sources that benefit the" system. "These other sources are not technically part of the NPS budget so in terms of Jarvis’ reference to an ‘annual budget,’ indeed the claim appears to be defensible," Schmidt said. Citing insufficient knowledge about the city’s budget, Schmidt declined to speculate about whether the director made a fair apples-to-apples comparison. Some differences beyond budget totals It’s worth noting the park service and Austin’s city government draw on divergent revenue sources. Congress, which spends tax revenue, appropriated 84 percent of the park service’s budget. In contrast, just 24 percent of the city’s 2015-16 budget, or $818 million, was penciled in to come from tax revenue. On the other hand, the city budget shows $1.9 billion in revenue from "utility charges," largely meaning income from the sale of electricity, water and wastewater services; that chunk of money covers 54 percent of the city budget. Notably, too, the city has a capital improvements budget supported by debt, grants and fund transfers. In 2015-16, the Austin City Council appropriated $629.6 million for such projects; that amount is not part of the $3.5 billion total budget, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean told us by phone. So, the city plans to spend more than $4 billion in fiscal 2016, counting the regular and capital improvements budgets. Olson told us the park service’s 2016 budget folds in more than $192 million budgeted by the agency for comparable construction and repair/rehabilitation purposes. Put another way, he said, that money is part of the $3.4 billion total budget. Our ruling Jarvis said the National Park Service has an annual budget that is less than the budget for the city of Austin. For the fiscal year through September 2016, this is so by $100 million--though there are arguably plenty of differences between the agency and Austin city government that keep this comparison from meaning a great deal.

pomt-12446	The Republican replacement for Obamacare does not give massive tax cuts to wealthy Americans.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/12/sean-duffy/republican-replacement-obamacare-does-not-contain-/	Regarding taxes, headlines about the Republican replacement for Obamacare were blunt: GOP Health Care Bill Will Result In A Huge Tax Cut For The Rich -- Forbes One Certainty of GOP Health Plan: Tax Cuts for the Wealthy -- New York Times Republican health-care bill will 'cut the hell out of taxes' for the rich, says Warren Buffett -- CNBC Indeed, Buffett, the billionaire investor, said his personal tax bill would be 17 percent lower under the plan —a cut of about $680,000 on his tax bill of a little less than $4 million. So, it was puzzling to hear this exchange on May 9, 2017 between Erik Bilstad, a radio host at WTMJ in Milwaukee, and U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis.: Bilstad: Congressman, does this bill give massive tax cuts to wealthy Americans? Duffy: No; no. Duffy’s next words were a bit confusing, as he appeared to argue that in repealing Obamacare tax hikes, the GOP bill would benefit non-wealthy people, too: I mean, what happened was, if you look at even the medical device tax. Well, you can say the makers of medical devices may not be taxed, for example, but we all know that those medical device makers pass that tax on to middle-, average- and low-income Americans. They are the ones who actually pay that tax. I think that’s just a Democrat -- they’re throwing everything at the wall. Who wouldn’t expect Democrats, at every turn they could, to go, "Tax breaks for the wealthy"? Well, that’s what they do. The upshot is: Duffy said the GOP replacement for Obamacare does not give massive tax cuts to wealthy Americans. As we’ve covered in a previous fact-check, there’s no question that people at the top of the income scale would be singled out for tax cuts that, over 10 years, are estimated to be worth what can be considered a massive amount: hundreds of billions of dollars. The bill In a major political victory for President Donald Trump and U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the GOP bill was narrowly approved by the House of Representatives five days before Duffy’s statement. Even Republicans, though, say the legislation will likely be changed in the Senate. The House version would repeal nearly all taxes contained in Obamacare and make other tax changes. No official estimates have been done on the current version of the bill, which was changed after the original bill was voted down by the House in March 2017. But the tax cut figures are expected to be similar. The tax cuts Obamacare imposed a series of tax increases, primarily in an effort to provide health coverage to nearly all Americans. Some of those were aimed squarely at the wealthy. We found U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., went too far when he said that under "Trumpcare," as some Democrats call the GOP health bill, "$600 billion worth of tax breaks will go to the wealthiest in this country." Our rating was Half True. The tax breaks don’t help only the wealthiest -- but people on the high end of the income scale certainly benefit. Estimates on the original bill by Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, which is staffed by independent professionals, put the value of the tax cuts at $600 billion over 10 years (2017 through 2026). Fully $275 billion would go only to high-income earners -- families with $250,000 or more in income ($200,000 for singles). That would be accomplished by repealing two of the key tax increases that fund Obamacare: a 3.8 percent tax on investments (capital gains, dividend and interest income) and a 0.9 percent Medicare surtax. According to the nonprofit Tax Policy Center: 85 percent of the benefits of repealing the investment tax would go to the top 1 percent of income earners. Ultimately, repealing the investment and the Medicare taxes would mean a 2 percent increase in income for the top 1 percent -- or $43,000 per year. Duffy’s staff argued that the GOP plan does not include tax cuts because it merely repeals tax increases, and that the tax increases themselves were never portrayed as "massive." But the $43,000 in additional income that the top 1 percent would get from the tax reductions begins to approach the median household income in the United States -- $55,775 per year. As for Duffy’s reference to repealing a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical device makers, that could result in lower prices for average consumers. And some other tax changes in the GOP health plan would benefit the middle class. But that doesn’t negate the fact that other tax breaks specifically help the rich. Our ruling Duffy says the Republican replacement for Obamacare does not give massive tax cuts to wealthy Americans. The bill that some call "Trumpcare" includes the repeal of tax hikes that specifically target the rich. Indeed, over 10 years, hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts would benefit only those earning $200,000 a year or more. We rate Duffy’s statement False.

pomt-04515	"We’re now spending 42 percent of our economy on government."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/03/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-us-now-spending-42-percent-our-ec/	During the first presidential debate in Denver, Mitt Romney warned that the U.S. risks harming its economy if government spending continues at its current pace. "Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government," Romney said. "We’re now spending 42 percent of our economy on government. I don’t want to go down the path to Spain." We looked into the scale of government in a previous item, which we’ll update here with the most recent figures. The Office of Management and Budget produces a table every year that tracks total government expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product. Here are the statistics for the past few fiscal years in question: Fiscal year 2007: 30.9 percent Fiscal year 2008: 32.6 percent Fiscal year 2009: 37.1 percent Fiscal year 2010: 35.4 percent Fiscal year 2011: 35.4 percent So by this measurement, Romney’s 42 percent figure is a little high. However, there is another measurement that backs up Romney’s claim. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development -- a group that includes most of the world’s advanced industrialized countries -- found that government expenditures accounted for 42 percent of the U.S. economy in 2009 (compared to 45.8 percent for Spain). Since the OMB data showed that government spending as a share of the economy peaked in 2009 before declining, likely because it was the first year of the recession, it seems reasonable to assume that the percentage will drop for subsequent years once the next OECD calculations are released. Still, it’s likely that Romney’s 42 percent figure is pretty close to accurate. However, using only the big-picture numbers tells only part of the story. Here’s the breakdown of spending for 2011, according to OMB: Federal expenditures for defense and international accounts: 5.0 percent Federal net interest expenditures: 1.8 percent Federal Social Security and Medicare expenditures: 8.6 percent Federal payments to individuals exclusive of Social Security and Medicare: 7.1 percent Federal spending in all other categories: 1.9 percent State and local government: 11.0 percent Total: 35.4 percent So payments to individuals accounted for almost half of federal expenditures. Why is this important? It’s a question of control, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution told us when we originally looked at this question. These transfer payments, as they are known, "can be more or less freely spent by private individuals," Burtless said. "Your mom can spend her Social Security check any way she wants -- on food, shelter, vacations at Disney World or deposits in her bank account or her favorite mutual fund. Even cash public assistance recipients have pretty wide freedom over how they spend their welfare checks." Some transfer payments are more restrictive, such as food stamps or Medicare and Medicaid benefits, but these still allow some degree of consumer choice. "This distinction is important for a simple reason," Burtless said. While lawmakers and government officials have direct say over many types of government expenditures, "their say over government transfers is a lot more restricted." In addition, he said, many government transfer payments "are paid for with earmarked taxes – FICA and unemployment insurance taxes. When we get transfers from the government under Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance, we’re getting back the money that we or our employers contributed when we were working." While these are undoubtedly government expenditures, one could argue that they are actually pass-throughs of payments from the American public to itself. And it’s worth noting that Social Security and Medicare -- the drivers of government growth -- are among the most popular of all government programs. (PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.) Our ruling Depending on which data set you use, Romney’s numbers are either correct or close. But they don’t tell the whole story. A large share of the spending has come not from the cost of government employees, buildings and equipment but from transfer payments that individual Americans ultimately control (and, in many cases, under programs which they had paid into to begin with). On balance, we rate Romney’s statement Mostly True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-10-03T23:11:43	2012-10-03	['None']
pomt-13853	"We’re losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the AIDS epidemic at its peak."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2016/jul/08/andrew-cuomo/fewer-people-are-dying-heroin-and-opioid-overdoses/	Before signing legislation to combat New York State’s growing heroin and opiate addiction problem, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo compared the epidemic’s death toll to the number of people who died during the peak of the AIDS crisis. Cuomo, who created a heroin and opioids task force this year, said the number of people dying from a heroin or opiate overdose today is comparable to the number of people who died from AIDS at its worst. "Over the past 10 years we’ve lost 10,000 people to heroin overdoses and the numbers are increasing exponentially. It is spiking. It is becoming more and more available, especially among the younger community, it’s becoming more and more accepted, and it is truly, truly a frightening and staggering increase. We’re losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the AIDS epidemic at its peak. That’s how bad this is. Think about that: The AIDS epidemic – one of the worst things that society has had to deal with, and the loss of life is just about the same with this heroin epidemic. So the numbers are staggering, and it’s frightening, and it’s getting worse," Cuomo said, referring to the country’s growing problem with heroin and opiates. Cuomo’s office said the governor was referring to New York State residents when citing the loss of 10,000 lives over the past 10 years. In comparing recent heroin and opioid deaths to the AIDS death toll, Cuomo’s office said he was referring to national figures. So did the number of deaths from heroin and opioid overdoses actually match AIDS at its peak? Prescription Drug Overdoses vs. Heroin and Opioid Overdoses The number of people in the U.S. who died from a drug overdose in 2014 was 47,055, which rivals the worst year of the AIDS epidemic. But only about 60 percent - 28,647 - were from heroin and opioid overdoses, according to 2014 data from the Centers for Disease Control. The federal agency hasn’t finished compiling 2015 numbers yet, and no other government entity has released anything more recent. Deaths From AIDS That doesn’t come close to the deaths from AIDS at the peak of the AIDS epidemic in 1995. The CDC’s mortality database, confirmed by a CDC representative, shows 43,115 deaths directly caused by AIDS that year. That’s different from the number of people who died with AIDS, which counts people who died following an AIDS diagnosis regardless of whether their deaths were related to the disease or not. What about overdoses after 2014? From 2014 to now, have the number of people who died from a heroin or opiate overdose increased to match the number of deaths from AIDS in 1995? To reach that level, data would have to show an increase of about 50 percent in the number of deaths from heroin and opioid overdoses between then and now. When contacted, the CDC would not speculate on whether such an increase was likely. In Erie County, deaths from heroin or opioid overdoses more than doubled between 2014 and 2015, according to the Erie County Health Department. Dr. Gale Burstein, the Erie County health commissioner, attributed the spike partly to what’s now being dealt on the streets. Dealers now often mix fentanyl, a painkiller, with heroin to increase potency. Cuomo’s office confirmed he was referring to the latest national data in his claim. In a phone conversation, a representative from the CDC said the agency has not finished compiling data for 2015. We base our ruling on the 2014 heroin and opioid overdose numbers. Our Ruling Cuomo, in a press conference in Buffalo, said, "We’re losing as many people to heroin and opioid overdoses as we lost to the AIDS epidemic at its peak." About 28,000 people died from a heroin or opioid overdose in 2014. About 43,000 people died from AIDS in 1995. Cuomo’s comparison is a reach. If he had been referring to the total number of drug overdoses, his claim would have been fine. There are more people dying from drug overdoses overall than the number who died from AIDS at the peak of the AIDS crisis. But the number of deaths from heroin and opioids alone continues to rise, more than doubling in Erie County alone between 2014 and 2015. We rate this claim as Mostly False.

pomt-04401	Says Mitt Romney suggested that "employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/17/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-suggested-employers-should-be-ab/	President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney clashed over contraceptives coverage in their second debate, with Romney ultimately declaring, "the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong." That sounded like a request for some fact-checking. So, was Obama totally wrong? The issue emerged in the Oct. 16, 2012, debate at Hofstra University after a question from the audience about how the candidates intended to fix income inequality for women. Obama touted signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, then said: "Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace. For example, their health care. You know a major difference in this campaign is that Gov. Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making. "I think that's a mistake. In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured. Because this is not just a -- a health issue, it's an economic issue for women. It makes a difference. This is money out of that family's pocket. Gov. Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage." Romney later responded: "I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not. And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives. And the president's statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong." It's worth noting that they were talking past each other. Obama was referring to whether an employer should dictate whether employees’ insurance covers contraceptives. Romney sidestepped the issue about insurance coverage and said he opposes a different concept — whether employers can tell someone whether they can have contraceptive care. For this fact-check, we’re asking whether Romney has suggested that "employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage." The Blunt amendment Obama’s support for his claim centers on something called the Blunt amendment. Early this year, congressional Republicans made a big push to roll back a provision by Health and Human Services under Obama’s health care law that requires most employers to provide birth control coverage without any out-of-pocket costs, with a limited exception for certain religious institutions. In the Senate, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sponsored an amendment that would exempt employers from providing any service that went against their "beliefs or moral convictions." At the time, the issue put the Obama administration on the defensive and the president himself appeared at the White House briefing room to explain a work-around for religious affiliated hospitals, universities and the like. A few weeks later, with a vote on the Blunt amendment pending, Romney was asked where he stood. He told a Boston radio interviewer "Of course I support the Blunt amendment." CNSnews.com, a conservative news service, put the question directly to the Romney campaign. "Will Mitt Romney, on day one, rescind this mandate in its entirety — as the Catholic Church has urged the current administration to do — so that individuals, employers and insurers who have a ‘moral or religious objection to contraception or sterilization’ will not be forced to violate the tenets of their own faith or act against their consciences?" Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams responded: "Yes. Gov. Romney would rescind the mandate in its entirety." In April, Romney reiterated his opposition to the rule at a meeting of the National Rifle Association. He said, "As president, I will abolish it." So the Obama campaign argues if Romney supports an employer’s ability to decline to provide a service that goes against "beliefs or moral convictions," that means he supports employers making "the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage." Romney’s response We asked the Romney campaign to explain his objection to Obama’s claim. Here's a statement from spokeswoman Andrea Saul: "Gov. Romney’s statement speaks for itself. He does not believe that bureaucrats in Washington or employers should tell a woman whether she can use contraceptives, and no policy that he has proposed or supported would do so. To the contrary, he has repeatedly made clear that he believes all women should have access to contraception and make such personal choices themselves. The disagreement between the governor and President Obama on this issue is over whether the federal government should impose a nationwide insurance mandate for contraception. The president wants bureaucrats to make that decision for all Americans, even where it violates their religious liberty. Gov. Romney does not." The statement acknowledges that Romney opposes a nationwide mandate for contraception coverage. In the absence of a federal mandate, that would sometimes leave the decision to employers whether to offer coverage for birth control. (Before Obamacare, some 27 states already required such coverage, though we’re not sure how many had religious exceptions.) Our ruling Obama said Romney "suggested" that "employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage." Romney says he doesn’t believe bureaucrats or employers should make the call whether a woman can use contraceptives. But his support for the Blunt amendment endorses the approach that employers should be able to make the decision about whether contraception is covered by employees’ insurance.

pomt-00524	The Confederate battle flag in South Carolina was first flown at the statehouse in 1961. "It was flown as a symbol of massive resistance to racial desegregation."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/22/eugene-robinson/confederate-flag-wasnt-flown-south-carolina-state-/	The Confederate flag flying outside of South Carolina’s statehouse has sparked debate across the nation following the brutal shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. At the center of much of the fervor is what the flag stands for. For some, the flag is a symbol for a shared Southern heritage. For others, the flag is linked to the Confederate War Memorial, which sits next to it and honors fallen Confederate soldiers. And yet others, such as Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson, see the flag as a symbol for racial oppression and prejudice. "Do you know when that flag was first flown at the Columbia statehouse in Columbia?" he asked during an interview on Meet the Press June 21. "1961 … it was a middle finger directed at the federal government. It was flown there as a symbol of massive resistance to racial desegregation. Period." "It was only after Brown vs. Board, after Little Rock, after desegregation began, that South Carolinians put up the flag on the statehouse, that other states in the South adopted the battle flag as part of their state flags," Robinson said. "So it was massive resistance." Here we wanted to to answer two questions. One is simple, when did the Confederate battle flag first fly above the South Carolina statehouse? And second, why? The first time it flew Daniel Hollis, a member of the commission responsible for planning South Carolina’s Confederate War Centennial, recalled the exact day the flag was first hoisted during an interview published in 1999. Hollis said the flag itself went up on April 11, 1961, for the opening of the Civil War centennial "at the request of Aiken Rep. John A. May." "May told us he was going to introduce a resolution to fly the flag for a year from the capitol. I was against the flag going up," Hollis said, "but I kept quiet and went along." The resolution was approved in 1962, but never included a date for the flag’s removal. "It just stayed up," Hollis said. "Nobody raised a question." Hollis died in 2008. The flag’s changing meaning So, yes, the flag didn’t start flying until 100 years after the start of the Civil War. But why the flag was flown is -- like the flag itself -- subject to some debate. Robinson cited a study conducted by the state Senate of Georgia to help make his case. Although the study focuses on the history and evolution of Georgia’s state flag, it also explores the different Confederate flags that have existed and how those flags have been used by states. The study pays special attention to what the different flags mean. "It must be understood how the meaning of the battle flag has changed since the Civil War and explore what it meant at the time Georgia and other states adopted it or paid homage to it," the report reads. The study says that "from the end of the Civil War until the late 1940s, display of the battle flag was mostly limited to Confederate commemorations, Civil War re-enactments, and veterans’ parades. The flag had simply become a tribute to Confederate veterans." However, in 1948, the meaning of the flag began to change. That year, Dixiecrats flew the flag at their convention in Birmingham, Ala., as "a symbol of Southern protest and resistance to the federal government." In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown vs. Board that segregation in education was unconstitutional. Georgia changed its state flag to embody the Confederate battle flag two years later. The period also saw Rosa Parks refuse to give up her seat on the bus (1955), the forced integration at Little Rock, Ark. (1957), and student sit-ins across the South (1960). We asked K. Michael Prince, author of Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys: South Carolina and the Confederate Flag, if he could pinpoint the root cause behind the raising of the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina. "As far as I've been able to determine, the bare facts … provide no clear evidence either way," Prince said. "It's possible that nobody had anything else in mind other than commemorating the war. But we would be remiss not to take the larger context into consideration in judging the meaning of the display," Prince said. Specifically, Prince cites arguments that broke out between a New Jersey centennial delegation and South Carolina. The National Civil War Centennial Commission meeting was to be held at a segregated hotel in Charleston, and a black delegate from New Jersey was denied admittance. New Jersey threatened to boycott all Charleston events in response. Eventually, a compromise was reached through the efforts of President John F. Kennedy. The meeting was moved to Charleston Naval Base where segregation was not in effect. "The official opening of the Civil War Centennial became a divided event, with dual headquarters and dual programs," Prince wrote in his book. "Except for a few luncheon speeches and the events held at Fort Sumter, centennial function followed separate (but equal) tracks." The dispute between New Jersey and South Carolina would go on to become the "Number 1 Story of the Year" in South Carolina’s Sumter Daily Item. Our ruling Robinson stated that when the Confederate flag was first flown over South Carolina’s statehouse in 1961, and it was hoisted as a symbol of "massive resistance to racial desegregation." Robinson is right on the date. The flag first flew over the statehouse to mark the opening ceremonies of a Civil War Centennial celebration. Whether it was raised as a deliberate symbol of a "resistance to racial desegregation" is not completely clear. Experts and research find a circumstantial link between the spread of the flag and the racial divisions of the 1950s and 1960s. We rate Robinson’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-13556	"Since President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanics have joined the ranks of those in poverty. … The number of Hispanic children living in poverty increased by 15 percent in that short period of time."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/25/donald-trump/donald-trump-offers-misleading-statistics-about-hi/	Furthering his efforts to reach out to minorities, Donald Trump at a rally in Tampa decried how Hispanics have fared economically under President Barack Obama. "Hispanic citizens have been suffering under this president," Trump said Aug. 24, 2016. "Since President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanics have joined the ranks of those in poverty. Two million have joined the ranks of poverty, not of wealth. I want you to join the ranks of people that are making phenomenal livings. ... The number of Hispanic children living in poverty increased by 15 percent in that short period of time." To test the accuracy of Trump’s comment, we turned to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, which tracks poverty by age and race, among other characteristics. The most recent full year for which data has been published is 2014. Overall Hispanic poverty The data shows that Trump is on target if you start the clock in 2008, the year before Obama took office. Between 2008 and 2014, the number of Hispanics in poverty rose by a little over 2.1 million. But using that time span means using the year before Obama took office -- not "since" he took office -- and it also cherry-picks the data to largely precede the severe recession that began before Obama took office. Starting the clock in 2009 produces a smaller increase (754,000). If you started the clock in 2010, Hispanic poverty decreased by 418,000. Meanwhile, Trump’s comment also uses raw numbers of people in poverty, when statisticians usually prefer poverty rates, since rates take into account changes in the overall population being studied. If you use poverty rates instead of raw numbers, then Hispanic poverty has risen slightly since 2008 (0.4 percentage points), but has fallen by 1.7 points since 2009 and by 2.9 points since 2010. The chart below shows that Hispanic poverty rates have been declining for the latter part of Obama’s tenure. So Trump has presented a misleading picture of overall Hispanic poverty trends. Hispanic child poverty As for the Hispanic child poverty figures, the Census Bureau does show an increase of 15 percent in raw numbers between 2008 and 2014. But the same caveats from the previous statistic apply -- namely, starting at 2008 is problematic. If you instead start the clock in 2009, the increase in raw numbers was less than 1 percent, and if you start in 2010, it fell by 5 percent. As for the poverty rate among Hispanic children, it’s up by 1.3 percentage points since 2008, but down by 1.9 percentage points since 2009 and down 3 points since 2010. So, here too, Trump’s statistic is misleading. Our ruling Trump said that "since President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanics have joined the ranks of those in poverty. … The number of Hispanic children living in poverty increased by 15 percent in that short period of time." The numbers are close to accurate only if you start counting in 2008, before Obama took office and before the full effects of a recession that Obama inherited. And overall, the comment ignores that since the recession hit, Obama has overseen a general decline in Hispanic poverty. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1470c814-acc9-4771-b28f-79ed83d914a8	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-08-25T11:30:33	2016-08-24	['Barack_Obama', 'Hispanic']
pomt-15210	There is debate among constitutional scholars about whether the First Amendment will continue to protect faith leaders from being forced to perform marriages against their religious beliefs.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2015/aug/12/david-ralston/ralston-misfires-comment-about-debate-over-faith-l/	Georgia House Speaker David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, says June’s 5-4 Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriages is motivating him to pursue passage next year of a "pastor protection" bill. A working version of the bill reads: "No minister of the gospel or cleric or religious practitioner ordained or authorized to solemnize marriages according to the usages of the denomination, when acting in his or her official religious capacity, shall be required to solemnize any marriage in violation of his or her right to free exercise of religion." It was drawn up shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled June 26 in Obergefell v. Hodges that the U.S. Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage. The decision has been met with resistance in some states. "In Georgia, we're going to come down clearly on the side of the separation of church and state, and as long as you have constitutional scholars debating among themselves whether this is covered, then I think we need to remove all uncertainty and all doubt." Ralston said in an interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on July 13, two days after he announced plans for his "pastor protection" bill. Ralston said his efforts are not connected to the "religious liberty" bills that have been at the center of some of the fiercest debates at the Capitol since 2014. Supporters see the "religious liberty" legislation as an extra layer of protection against government intrusion on religious beliefs, while critics say it would enable businesses to discriminate against gay customers. But what of the speaker’s claim of a debate among constitutional scholars? PolitiFact decided to dig deeper. First, a little background. Ralston was meeting with House Republicans on Jekyll Island in July when he first disclosed his plans to introduce a "pastor protection" bill in the 2016 General Assembly session. Several states have passed or are considering nearly identical bills, and two of these bills just became law in Texas and Oklahoma . Ralston says that in his House district in North Georgia, "there’s a lot of unease in the faith community over the reach and ramifications" of the Supreme Court’s decision. "What we are trying to do is dispel the unease, dispel the uncertainty and replace it with clarity," he told a radio reporter last month. What do scholars say? As soon as Ralston announced plans for the bill, some began to question: Was it necessary? Anthony Michael Kreis, a constitutional scholar at the University of Georgia, said nothing in the gay marriage ruling affects the religious freedom protections provided faith leaders under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. They still have the right to refuse to perform any marriage ceremony, Kreis said. Based on Ralston’s statement, suggesting a debate among constitutional scholars, we went in search of other opinions. We contacted constitutional law scholars in Georgia and across the country, including George Washington University law professor Ira C. Lupu and Georgia State University constitutional law professor Eric J. Segall. All said the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment prevents any minister, priest, rabbi or any other cleric from having to perform any religious ceremony - wedding or otherwise - against his or her faith. "Many, for example, will not perform interfaith weddings," said Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law expert and founding dean and distinguished professor of law at the University of California. The U.S. Supreme Court "has never said otherwise," Segall said. "And nothing in the same-sex marriage decision is to the contrary," he said. PolitiFact talked by telephone with Ralston, a lawyer by profession, and asked, "Do you believe they (faith leaders) are protected under the First Amendment?" "Arguably they are," the speaker said. He voiced concern that, with a U.S. Supreme Court that evolves, this could one day be an issue litigated in federal court. He also repeated his stance that, within the faith community, "there’s certainly uncertainty and unease." But, he acknowledged, "I don’t think it is the reality." He went to say: "We also have to deal with the perception." In a recent op-ed piece, Ralston wrote that "the Pastor's Protection Act will make absolutely clear our state government does not view clergy as state actors." Lupu, a nationally recognized scholar in constitutional law, said a civil marriage, based on its definition, "is not a matter that has historically been the domain of religious leaders -- certainly not the exclusive domain." "Think about divorce laws and how far they depart from Catholic or Orthodox Jewish teaching," he said. Lauren Sudeall Lucas, a constitutional law expert and Georgia State University law professor, said the high court in Obergefell v. Hodges was careful to emphasize that it is "the state" that cannot refuse to recognize same-sex marriages. Lupu said he knows of no constitutional scholar who believes that the state can dictate to a pastor regarding who qualifies for religious marriage. "So if Ralston says the Pastor Protection Act is legally necessary and adds something to the substance of the law, then he is speaking falsely," Lupu said. "If he says ‘I know it's not necessary, but it will provide reassurance to some,‘ that cannot be a falsehood, because it will indeed do that." Our ruling Georgia House Speaker David Ralston has announced he will propose a pastor protection bill, spelling out that faith leaders in the state have the right to refuse to perform any marriage ceremony that goes against their religious convictions. "In Georgia, we're going to come down clearly on the side of the separation of church and state, and as long as you have constitutional scholars debating among themselves whether this is covered, then I think we need to remove all uncertainty and all doubt," Ralston said in an interview two days after announcing plans for the bill. We don’t claim to have reached every constitutional scholar. But we could find no evidence that there are any constitutional scholars who believe the ruling diminishes the First Amendment protections of religious freedom or forces religious leaders to marry people against their personal religious beliefs. Ralston, himself, acknowledges that. But he says there’s unease in the community and a "perception" to contend with. That’s a different argument for the bill. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-09179	“The Democrats have over 20 field agents to our zero."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jun/04/tom-mechler/challenger-gop-chair-says-democrats-have-20-field-/	Republicans hold all 29 statewide elected offices in Texas. Check. Plus, no Republican has lost statewide since ‘94, Republicans hold solid majorities in the Texas Senate and Texas congressional delegation and the GOP could widen its edge in the Texas House in November’s elections. Check, check, check and (maybe) check. Such pro-Republican realities didn’t deter a candidate for the chairmanship of the Republican Party of Texas from sending out a press release May 27 generally charging the current chair, Cathie Adams of Dallas, with poor management. Tom Mechler of Amarillo also let loose with this: “The Democrats have over 20 field agents to our 0.” Really? The GOP's forces outnumbered? Before imagining wild scenarios—operatives speeding country roads, texting on the straightaways—keep in mind that a political “field agent” is simply a person entrusted with representing a party, interest group or candidate in a region or community. Agents are an entity’s eyes and ears, expected to track what matters to local residents and to fan support for their client in election years, like this one. Responding to our inquiry, Mechler spokesman Russ Duerstine, a member of the State Republican Executive Committee, told us the state GOP let its only field organizer go early this year, a claim that a party spokesman declined to address. Later, Mechler said he reached his count, which he called an estimate, by looking at Texas-based workers for Republican and Democratic political groups, which seemed like a reasonable methodology. Starting our own check, we perused the major parties' websites. The Texas Democratic Party site lists 19 staff members though no one with a title indicating they work outside of its Austin headquarters. The state GOP’s site lists six staff members, likewise no one with a title suggesting they’re in the field. Next, we contacted the parties. GOP spokesman Bryan Preston declined comment on the party's field staff, while Kirsten Gray, spokeswoman for the Democrats, said in an email the party now has no field staffers but some staff members occasionally go into the field. End of story? Not. In April 2009, the Democratic National Committee dispatched an organizer, Luke Hayes, to Texas to direct the state’s chapter of Organizing for America, the national group that succeeded then-Sen. Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign committee, Obama for America. At the time, the Austin American-Statesman said there was speculation in Democratic circles about the national party putting up to 30 organizers into Republican-leaning Texas. That apparently hasn’t happened, though an Austin Democratic activist, Eugene Sepulveda, posted a blog in August saying he’d attended an event including “12 or 14” Texas-based OFA field organizers. Hector Nieto, spokesman for Organizing for America – Texas, declined to say how many staffers are in the state. Separately, though, we looked through DNC financial filings with the Federal Election Commission. The committee’s “disbursements” filing for April, the latest report available, shows salaries paid to 11 individuals with Texas addresses; add Hayes, whose listed address is in the Bronx, and there appear to have been 12 DNC-paid staff members in the state. According to the filing, those payees were spread among Austin, Houston, Brownsville, Dallas, El Paso, Garland, La Feria and Lorena. A similar filing by the Republican National Committee revealed no committee-paid Texas workers in April, though a Dallas resident was paid consulting, speaking and training fees. So, the count of D-vs.-R organizers appears to be 12 to 0. But hold on. State Comptroller Susan Combs, a Republican seeking her third term in November, has announced she'll be helming the GOP's election-year get-out-the-vote committee, dubbed Victory 2010. On the Republican side, such committees usually enlist field staff. The GOP's 2008 "victory" committee paid six field workers, according to Leanne Ivey, that committee's senior adviser. Ivey said the workers were based in Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston (which had two), San Antonio and Central Texas. And Democrats have more afoot as well. The Texas Democratic Trust and Lone Star Fund funnel money to pro-Democratic groups. For the six months that ended Dec. 31, we identified about a dozen individuals or companies with Texas addresses that fielded payments from at least one of the entities, according to finance reports filed with the state and federal government. But no recipients were precisely listed as field staff. Finally, we’d be remiss if we overlooked field-staff hirings by the party’s well-funded candidates for governor. GOP Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign told us he has 10 regional field directors. Democratic nominee Bill White’s campaign didn’t volunteer its field staff level. Spokeswoman Katy Bacon said in an email: “That’s competitive information, kind of like the recipe for Dr Pepper.” We visited again with Mechler, who said for his count, he assumed that 75 percent of the individuals funded in Texas by the Lone Star Fund and Texas Democratic Trust were field workers. He stood by his 20-to-0 ratio, calling it a fair estimate. We're comfortable saying Democrats have up to a dozen people working in the field. And the state GOP has no one. Also, it's possible some workers in both parties aren't identified as field staff in finance reports. It's also likely that future hires will change the ratio of ground troops. Based on available information, Mechler is right about his party for now, but overstates Democratic Party numbers. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-00520	"Nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate," and Wisconsin is "one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/23/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-fares-better-nation-ve/	Gov. Scott Walker is touting his record on veterans as he tours the country preparing to make a presidential bid. At a "Politics and Pies" event May 30, 2015 in New Hampshire, Walker boasted of the success veterans have had finding jobs in Wisconsin. "Nationally the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate," Walker said, adding Wisconsin is "one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally." Are Wisconsin veterans doing that well in the Wisconsin job market? To support his claim, Walker's team sent a report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics about veteran and non-veteran employment. This is the best way to make the comparison, as opposed to measuring veterans vs the overall workforce. Let’s see how it breaks down. The national picture: Walker said "nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate." But the national unemployment rate for veterans is actually lower than the rate for non-veterans. For veterans, the rate was 5.3 percent, compared to 6 percent for non-veterans. That's true historically as well. A report from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs shows that from 2000 to 2013, veterans had lower unemployment rates than non-veterans. The Wisconsin picture: Walker also said in Wisconsin "unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population." Wisconsin's rate for veterans was 4.1 percent while the rate for non-veterans was 5.4 percent. So, the state's veterans are employed at higher rates than their civilian counterparts. How rare is it? In his claim, Walker said Wisconsin’s situation was a "rare" one. But 32 other states also had veteran unemployment rates lower than non-veterans. That’s not all that rare. Wisconsin vs. national: Finally, Walker said Wisconsin's veteran unemployment rate was "certainly lower than it is nationally." Federal data confirms this aspect of the claim, with Wisconsin's veteran unemployment rate at 4.1 percent, while nationally the rate was 5.3 percent. So, the data he provided supported two of the four aspects to his claim. More about the data Comparing the fraction of vets who are unemployed in the state to the fraction of unemployed vets nationally makes sense, said Steven Deller, a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. But unemployment rates don’t necessarily show the whole picture. The data takes an average from the last year’s monthly Current Population Survey of 60,000 households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. People who have worked at a regular job in the previous week are considered employed, while people who are jobless, looking for a job and available for work are considered unemployed. But the approach doesn’t account for workers who are underemployed or employed outside their field, and doesn’t take into account discouraged workers who stopped looking for a job. BLS does calculate other unemployment rates, though they are not often cited by politicians or the media. One is known as the U-6, which takes the total of the unemployed, all persons marginally attached to the labor force and involuntary part-time workers. A rule of thumb puts the U-6 rate as double the conventional unemployment rate. The U-6 rate for Wisconsin is 12.1, while the national rate is 13.8. BLS economist Steve Hipple calculated an estimated U-6 rate for veterans nationally at 9.7 percent. BLS doesn’t publish state U-6 rates specifically for veterans, . Our rating Walker said "Nationally, the unemployment rate for veterans is far greater than the national unemployment rate," and Wisconsin is "one of those rare examples where unemployment is actually lower for veterans than it is for the population as a whole and certainly lower than it is nationally." Data from BLS supported two of the four aspects of his claim and experts cautioned about use of raw statistics. Our definition for Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That fits here.

pomt-14089	"Almost 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/may/17/jack-lew/treasury-secretary-lew-says-about-100000-people-le/	Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew is urging Congress to pass legislation to deal with Puerto Rico’s debt crisis, saying that without action the economy and welfare of the U.S. territory will continue to deteriorate. During an interview on the Bloomberg network, Lew said that Puerto Rican hospitals are ill-equipped to deal with the spread of the Zika virus, that schools are closing and that the failing economy is driving people out. "You have broad economic stress causing people to leave the island," Lew said May 3, 2016. "Almost 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year." For an island with a total population around 3.5 million, that’s a serious exodus. We decided to see if Lew was right. Looking at the data Census data shows a small, but steady increase in the number of people leaving Puerto Rico for the mainland. More than 360,000 people went from Puerto Rico to the United States btween 2010 and 2014. However, the Census data isn’t out for 2015, which is the year Lew was talking about. So where did Lew get that figure? The estimate comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation, which tracks passengers departing from and arriving to the island. The Treasury Department has relied on this data before, according to department spokesperson Daniel Watson. The data show about 90,000 more people left Puerto Rico for the United States than came in. Census vs. Passenger data Create bar charts *The American Community Survey showing total out-migration of Puerto Rico to the US mainland **T-100 Domestic Market Data (US Carriers) None of this data includes people leaving Puerto Rico for somewhere other than the United States. Islanders mostly tend to head to the mainland, however, countries in Latin America, the Dominican Republic and Spain have been attracting Puerto Ricans as well. So the total number of migrants leaving the island is actually larger. Recent qualitative interviews by researchers from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies found that the people leaving Puerto Rico in the greatest numbers are nurses, paramedics, police officers, teachers, college professors and lawyers. They are often recruited and going to states with growing Hispanic populations in need of bilingual professionals. The surge in departures has led to the social media tag #yonomequito ("I am not going anywhere"). On Facebook this movement has been liked by 70,000 people. Our ruling Lew said that "almost 100,000 people left Puerto Rico last year." That appears to be close. Airline data suggests about 89,000 more people departed Puerto Rico for the United States then entered it in 2015. While that’s not a perfect estimate to measure out-migration, all the population trends suggest Puerto Rico is experiencing a surge in out-migration, as residents leave for better jobs and prospects in the United States.

pomt-11052	"We’ve already started (the border wall). We started it in San Diego."	mostly false	/california/statements/2018/jun/26/donald-trump/has-construction-already-started-trumps-border-wal/	Amid chants of "Build the Wall!" at a recent rally in Nevada, President Trump repeated the claim that construction has "already started" on the border wall in California. Here’s what Trump said, in context, at the Nevada rally on June 23, 2018: "We have to have strong borders. We’re going to have the (border) wall. We’re gonna have the wall. We’ve already started it .... (Audience cheers) "We’ve already started it. You know, we started it in San Diego." (Audience chants: "Build that Wall! Build that Wall! Build that Wall!") "Now we’re gonna have the wall. And we started it. We have $1.6 billion. We’ve started it. We’re fixing it. And we’re building new. And we’re starting it. … We’re getting the wall built." Has construction really started on Trump’s signature campaign promise: Building "a big, beautiful wall," on the U.S.-Mexico border? Trump has made similar statements in the past. In this fact check, we’ll focus on his claim: "We’ve already started (the border wall). We started it in San Diego." President Trump made his claim during a rally in Nevada on June 23, 2018. Projects at the border There are projects underway to replace fencing along the border in San Diego and further east in Calexico. Those call for new and taller, bollard-style barriers, which include a comb-like array of steel posts that border patrol agents can see through, some of which were planned long before Trump ran for office. A recent appropriation by Congress of $1.6 billion allows for the replacement of the old fencing, but not for the construction of any sort of concrete wall prototype as Trump requested. "The one thing we don’t fund is the one issue we all campaigned on — a border security wall — and that is not in the legislation," Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, founder of the House Freedom Caucus, said of the omnibus bill, according to an April article by FactCheck.org. In San Diego, the project underway will replace 14 miles of scrap metal fencing that’s now eight-to-10 feet high with the bollard-style barrier. That replacement will be 18-to-30 feet in height and include an anti-climbing plate, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the start of construction on June 1, 2018. The press release calls it the third "border wall construction project," which is misleading. That’s because none of the projects that have already started will produce the solid, 30-foot high concrete barrier Trump promised during his 2016 presidential campaign. More specifically, they won’t include any of the eight border wall prototype designs ordered by the Trump administration. "... this isn’t Trump’s wall" The same goes for the 2.25-mile barrier replacement project east of San Diego in Calexico. "First and foremost, this isn’t Trump’s wall," Jonathan Pacheco, a spokesman for the Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector, which includes Calexico, told the Los Angeles Times in March 2018. "This isn’t the infrastructure that Trump is trying to bring in. … This new wall replacement has absolutely nothing to do with the prototypes that were shown over in the San Diego area." Plans for the Calexico project, which also include a bollard-style structure, began in 2009 under the Obama administration and were funded in 2017, under Trump, according to the Times. A spokesman for the Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector said they could not specify when planning started for the San Diego project. "These were funded under FY2017 so planning was before or during that time," Ralph DeSio, the agency’s San Diego-based spokesman, wrote in an email. The White House did not respond to a request for evidence supporting the president’s statement. The reality of what’s being built at these sites, and how it differs from Trump’s campaign promise, hasn’t stopped the president from distorting the facts. In April, PolitiFact National rated Mostly False Trump’s similar statement: "We’ve started building the wall." It found Trump’s words "leave the impression that construction is underway for the border wall he promised, and that $1.6 billion is helping pay for it. That’s not the case." It concluded that "it’s disingenuous to claim" the projects underway "amount to the border wall Trump has long promised." Our ruling President Trump recently claimed: "We’ve already started (the border wall). We started it in San Diego." His statement gives the wrong impression that border fence replacement projects in California, including those in San Diego and Calexico, are the same as the solid, 30-foot-high concrete wall he promised during his run for president. The $1.6 billion authorized by Congress for these projects does not allow for the construction of any sort of wall prototype requested by Trump. Instead, the projects underway include arrays of steel posts, between 18 and 30 feet high, that allow border patrol agents to see through. The planning for at least some of these projects, which will replace shorter scrap metal fencing, started long before Trump ran for office. Congress, however, agreed to pay for them under Trump’s administration. We also grant that Trump at the Nevada rally added: "We’re fixing it. And we’re building new." This could be interpreted as a slight acknowledgement that the projects aren’t exactly what he promised, but they don’t add much clarity to what overall is a misleading statement. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-01222	In Wisconsin, unions can essentially give "unlimited" contributions to political parties, but business can't give any.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/nov/21/robin-vos/wisconsin-unions-can-give-unlimited-funds-politica/	Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos sounded euphoric on Milwaukee radio on Nov. 5, 2014, the morning after the mid-term elections. "How are you?" he was asked by conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes. "Charlie, I literally could not be better," Vos replied. Not only had Republican Gov. Scott Walker won re-election, but gains in the Assembly meant Republicans would enjoy their largest majority in that chamber since 1957. In the interview, Vos laid out a number of his priorities for the next legislative session, which starts in January 2015. One proposal would allow business contributions to the political parties. "Right now, if you are the Democratic Party, you can take unlimited union money, in many ways, but there's a prohibition on business being able to give to a political party," Vos claimed. "I’d like to get rid of that and create a level playing field." Vos presumably was singling out the Democratic Party because it typically gets more support from unions than the GOP does. We’ll check both parts of his claim -- that in Wisconsin, unions can essentially make unlimited contributions to political parties, while businesses can’t make any. Unions State law allows unions to contribute directly to political parties (and to candidates, for that matter). But since at least 2008, no union has used its "treasury" funds to directly make a contribution to a political party, according to the state Government Accountability Board, which oversees state elections. There is a strong disincentive to contribute that way. If they did, unions would have to register with the state as a political committee and would have to disclose all their sources of revenue and all their disbursements. Instead, what unions typically do is create political action committees, which in turn make contributions to political parties (and candidates). A union can give a PAC the equivalent of $20 per union member per year without having to disclose the names of the union members. Or, the union can give unlimited amounts to PACs, as long as the union members’ names are disclosed. PACs, though, are limited to contributing $6,000 per year to a political party. So, unions are allowed to contribute directly to political parties -- but, in practice, they don’t. They are allowed to give unlimited amounts of money to a political action committee, but a PAC is limited to how much it can give to a party. Business The second part of Vos’ claim is that "there's a prohibition on business being able to give to a political party." In Wisconsin, campaign contributions must originate from individuals. That means business owners -- those who own sole proprietorships or partnerships -- can make contributions to political parties (as well as to candidates and political action committees). That is, as long as the source is personal funds and not funds from the business -- and as long as they follow the limit for a particular race. But Wisconsin prohibits corporations, including limited liability companies, from making contributions to parties, candidates or PACs. Like unions, corporations can form political action committees to solicit campaign contributions from individuals. But as we’ve noted, unlike unions, corporations can’t make contributions to PACs. Vos told us he’d like to see state law changed so that it treats corporations like unions -- in other words, allowing corporations to make the same kind of political contributions as unions do. Our rating Vos said that in Wisconsin, unions can essentially give "unlimited" contributions to political parties, but business can't give any. The law allows unions to make unlimited contributions to the parties, but in practice, they make no such direct contributions at all. Rather, they give to political action committees, which in turn are limited in what they can give to parties. Business owners using their personal funds can contribute to political parties, within limits, but corporations can't make any such contributions. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-03917	Says that except for foreign policy, Ron Paul’s voting record and his voting record are virtually identical.	true	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/25/paul-broun/broun-claims-parallel-ron-pauls-voting-record/	Outspoken Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Broun announced earlier this month his intentions to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Georgia Republican Saxby Chambliss. Since announcing, Broun has been careful to publicly present himself as a collegial congressman. In public comments, Broun has touted his willingness to work with more liberal lawmakers to solve some of the country’s biggest problems. This is a far cry from Broun’s typical fiery demeanor and anti-Obama rhetoric that has come to symbolize his congressional leadership. In a fundraiser letter that surfaced recently, Broun went back to his roots. The four-page letter includes a rant against President Barack Obama and other Democratic leaders for "running roughshod" over the Constitution. In the letter, Broun makes a point of emphatically laying out his conservative beliefs and voting record. He also calls other conservatives like former Florida congressman Allen West and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky his friends. Broun also aligns himself with Rand Paul’s father, former Texas congressman and Libertarian Ron Paul: "Truth be told," Broun says in the letter, "except for foreign policy, Ron Paul’s voting record and mine are virtually identical." Politicians frequently align themselves with other party favorites, with varying results. PolitiFact Georgia examined whether Broun was correct about his voting record, and similarity to Ron Paul. Both Broun and Paul have embraced conservative positions on issues such as the role of government and government spending. In addition to their political opinions, the men share medical backgrounds. Paul was a military flight surgeon who went on to become an obstetrician-gynecologist. Broun practiced general medicine and operated a business based strictly on house calls. Paul served in the U.S. House on three separate occasions. His latest term, from 1997 to 2013, overlapped about six years with Broun’s congressional tenure, which began in 2007. Using the congressional tracking site, VoteSmart.org, PolitiFact reviewed 383 votes made by both men during their concurrent time in office, beginning in July 2007. That search revealed 42 times that the congressmen voted different ways on the same bill. Taking into account Broun’s foreign policy caveat, the number drops to 23 opposing votes. PolitiFact Georgia assumed votes involving defense topics as foreign policy. Based on those numbers, 6 percent of votes cast by Broun differed from those cast by Paul. We called and emailed questions about the letter to Broun’s staff for comment, but received no response. "Paul has this image of being conservative, so it’s not surprising that they would agree on many things except foreign policy," said Kennesaw State University professor Kerwin Swint. "On foreign policy, Paul is to the left of Obama." Last week, TheTeaParty.net, a conservative grassroots group, endorsed Broun in the U.S. Senate race. Broun will be up against well-funded "establishment moderates" and "deep-pocketed country club fundraisers like Karl Rove," organization founder Todd Cefaratti said in a news release, but that Broun’s campaign will have the support of thousands of citizens worried about the country’s future. Broun said except for foreign policy, his voting record and Ron Paul’s voting record were virtually identical. The men’s congressional terms overlapped from 2007 to January 2013. During that time, PolitiFact Georgia found that the congressmen’s votes differed just 6 percent of the time after the foreign policy exclusion. We rated Broun’s statement True.

pomt-09799	The Obama administration "was successful in rushing a massive spending bill through Congress in just two days — after which it sat on the president's desk for three days, while he was away on vacation."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/15/thomas-sowell/sowell-claims-stimulus-was-rushed-through-congress/	In a recent column in Investor's Business Daily , economist and political commentator Thomas Sowell said that President Barack Obama was trying to rush his health care bill through Congress. Sowell cited the quick passage of the economic stimulus bill in February 2009 as proof that Obama is too hasty in passing major legislation. Sowell wrote that "the administration was successful in rushing a massive spending bill through Congress in just two days — after which it sat on the president's desk for three days, while he was away on vacation." We wondered if Sowell was right, so we checked the bill's timeline. It's important to note that the bill had been under discussion for at least two months before it was formally introduced. When Obama announced his selection of economic advisers on Nov. 24, 2008, he said he had asked his team to come up with a stimulus plan to help struggling automakers, stabilize the financial system, create jobs and invest in infrastructure. A search of Thomas , the Library of Congress Web site that tracks legislation, shows that H.R. 1, the economic stimulus bill known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, was formally introduced in the House on Jan. 26. (In fact, four days before the bill was formally introduced, it was discussed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.) On Jan. 28, two days after the bill was introduced, it was passed by the full House in a party-line vote. The Senate took longer. Senators received the bill Jan. 29 and passed it Feb. 10. Then, the House and Senate had to work out their differences in a conference committee. It finished work on Feb. 12. Finally, on Feb. 13 — almost three weeks after the bill was introduced in the House — the final version was approved by both houses. So it took nearly three weeks to pass Congress, not two days as Sowell claims. And the bill had been under discussion since at least November. The second part of Sowell's claim was that that bill "sat on the president's desk for three days, while he was away on vacation." We checked with the White House, and a spokeswoman told us the president received the bill on Feb. 16, 2009, and signed it into law the very next day. The Thomas Web site confirmed that. Although the bill was cleared for the White House by the Senate on Friday, Feb. 13, it wasn't formally presented to the president until the following Monday, Feb. 16. He signed it Feb. 17. Obama did spend that weekend in Chicago to celebrate Valentine's Day with first lady Michelle Obama, but the bill had not been formally presented to him, contrary to Sowell's claim that it was sitting on his desk. (Sowell did not respond to an e-mail from PolitiFact.) Congress acted quickly on the stimulus bill — after all, the purpose was to rapidly pump money into the economy — but it took far longer than the two days that Sowell claimed. And Obama signed the bill the day after he received it, not three days later as Sowell claimed. We rate his claim False.

pomt-04087	Since 1968, "more Americans have died from gunfire than died in … all the wars of this country's history."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jan/18/mark-shields/pbs-commentator-mark-shields-says-more-killed-guns/	Since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., supporters and opponents of gun control have thrown out statistics to support their point of view. Here’s one that caught our eye, offered by liberal commentator Mark Shields on the Dec. 21, 2012, edition of the PBS NewsHour. Shields told host Judy Woodruff, "You know, Judy, the reality is -- and it's a terrible reality -- since Robert Kennedy died in the Ambassador Hotel on June 4, 1968, more Americans have died from gunfire than died in … all the wars of this country's history, from the Revolutionary through the Civil War, World War I, World War II, in those 43 years. ... I mean, guns are a problem. And I think they still have to be confronted." Is the death toll that high? Let's examine each half of his comparison. Deaths from warfare We found a comprehensive study of war-related deaths published by the Congressional Research Service on Feb. 26, 2010, and we supplemented that with data for deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan using the website icasualties.org. Where possible, we’ve used the broadest definition of "death" -- that is, all war-related deaths, not just those that occurred in combat. Here’s a summary of deaths by major conflict: Revolutionary War 4,435 War of 1812 2,260 Mexican War 13,283 Civil War (Union and Confederate, estimated) 525,000 Spanish-American War 2,446 World War I 116,516 World War II 405,399 Korean War 36,574 Vietnam War 58,220 Persian Gulf War 383 Afghanistan War 2,175 Iraq War 4,486 Total 1,171,177 Another 362 deaths resulted from other conflicts since 1980, such as interventions in Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Somalia and Haiti, but the number is not large enough to make a difference. Gunfire deaths The number of deaths from gunfire is a bit more complicated to total. Two Internet-accessible data sets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allow us to pin down the number of deaths from 1981 to 1998 and from 1999 to 2010. We’ve added FBI figures for 2011, and we offer a number for 1968 to 1980 using a conservative estimate of data we found in a graph in this 1994 paper published by the CDC. Here is a summary. The figures below refer to total deaths caused by firearms: 1968 to 1980 377,000 1981 to 1998 620,525 1999 to 2010 364,483 2011 32,163 Total 1,384,171 We should note that these figures refer to all gun-fire related deaths -- not just homicides, but also suicides and accidental deaths. In 2011, about one-quarter of firearm-related deaths were homicides, according to FBI and CDC data. Using total firearm-related deaths makes the case against guns more dramatic than just using homicides alone. When we rated a previous Facebook post, we lowered an otherwise True claim to Mostly True because it said that "nearly 100,000 people get shot every year." We found that the number of gun deaths and non-fatal injuries added up to 104,852, but we concluded that the term "get shot" could suggest victims who got shot by someone else rather than by their own hand. We don’t see a similar problem with the way Shields’ comment was phrased -- namely, "died from gunfire." Our ruling Since Shields’ comparison was otherwise accurate, with about 1.4 million firearm deaths to 1.2 million in war, we rated his claim True.

pomt-11184	Say Maxine Waters told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that her first act as president would be to "impeach Donald Trump."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/17/blog-posting/no-maxine-waters-comment-anderson-cooper-meme-made/	Maxine Waters may be just one of 435 members of Congress, but President Donald Trump has elevated the profile of the California Democrat. In March, at a campaign rally in southwestern Pennsylvania, Trump called Waters — a fierce opponent and the president’s ideological opposite — "a very low-I.Q. individual." "You ever see her?" Trump continued, to boos aimed at Waters. "You ever seen her? You ever see her? 'We will impeach him! We will impeach the president!' But he hasn't done anything wrong. ‘It doesn't matter, we will impeach him!’ She's a low I.Q. individual. You can't help it. She really is." Given Waters’ role as a foil for Trump, she has become fodder for social media posts by Trump’s allies. One we came across was the following post that appeared on May 15, 2018, on the Facebook page "Judge Jeanine Pirro has Fans." This Facebook group bills itself as an independent fan page for Pirro, a Fox News host who is closely allied with Trump. According to the Facebook group’s "about" page, "Judge Jeanine Pirro is out spoken and always on target. This site will expound on what the Judge is talking about and report what mainstream media won't." The group counted 713,110 followers when we first saw the post. The post shows what appeared to be a screenshot of a CNN appearance by Waters with host Anderson Cooper. The chyron at the bottom of the screen said, "Maxine Waters 2020," and the meme offered the following dialogue: Anderson: "If elected what would your first act as President be?" Waters: "Well Anderson, I would impeach Donald Trump." The group shared the image by saying, "And we pay her a salary!" The problem: Waters never said anything of the sort. The image appears to be from a real newscast on April 19, 2017, when Cooper interviewed Waters about Bill O’Reilly’s departure from Fox News. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But the chyron "Maxine Waters 2020" is fake. The original chyron said, "Bill O’Reilly Out at Fox News." The meme aims to make it look like Waters actually said that she would impeach Trump if elected president, which would be nonsensical. Obviously, there would be no need to impeach Trump if she either defeated him or succeeded him after he left office. Also, it’s up to Congress to impeach the president. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Waters has called for investigations that could lead to Trump’s impeachment, but on several occasions — including an interview with the platform Cheddar and a rally at the U.S. Capitol — she called for Trump’s impeachment directly. When she denied on MSNBC in April 2017 that she had called for Trump’s impeachment, we rated her claim Pants on Fire. We found no evidence that Waters is seriously considering a run for president. While she has occasionally joked about it, she shot down the idea during an appearance on The View in August 2017. (Her office did not respond to an inquiry for this article; nor did the administrator for the Pirro fan site) Snopes.com noted that the meme appeared elsewhere before the Pirro fan site picked it up. The faked dialogue seems to have initially started as a joke in a May 11 tweet, and a version with the Cooper-Waters visual was retweeted May 14 by Fox News host Brian Kilmeade (he added: "genius"), earning more than 900 retweets and more than 3,000 likes. Our ruling Viral social media posts said Maxine Waters told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that her first act as president would be to "impeach Donald Trump." This exchange never happened; it appears to have emerged as a joke that was eventually attached to a screenshot of an unrelated interview. In any case, the comments are nonsensical and may have more to do with making Waters look unintelligent than with the actual impeachment process. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-04853	Says Texas GOP platform calls for end to teaching "critical thinking" in public schools.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/11/gail-collins/gail-collins-says-texas-gop-platform-calls-schools/	New York Times columnist Gail Collins’ latest book, "As Texas Goes," takes the state to task for, well, being Texas. And her Aug. 1, 2012, column did pretty much the same. Casting the nomination of Ted Cruz for U.S. Senate as a harbinger of doom, Collins wrote that Texas "does tend to treasure the extreme" in politics, saying, "The current Republican state platform calls for an end to the teaching of ‘critical thinking’ in public schools." Collins is actually a bit late to this party: Major liberal websites launched assaults on this part of the 2012 platform (adopted June 8) as early as June 26, and Comedy Central’s "Colbert Report" satirized it July 17. Mainstream media weighed in, too. A July 9 Washington Post blog entry was headlined "Texas GOP rejects ‘critical thinking’ skills. Really." Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts wrote July 21: "The Texas GOP has set itself explicitly against teaching children to be critical thinkers." Austin American-Statesman opinion columnist Ken Herman reported July 21 that the party’s deputy executive director, Chris Elam, told him the platform subcommittee did not intend to indicate that the party opposed critical thinking skills. We began our research by trying to contact Collins but did not hear from her. Her column gives no information about her claim beyond that single sentence. We pulled the complete wording of the "Knowledge-Based Education" plank from the 2012 platform: We oppose the teaching of Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) (values clarification), critical thinking skills and similar programs that are simply a relabeling of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) (mastery learning) which focus on behavior modification and have the purpose of challenging the student’s fixed beliefs and undermining parental authority. Next, we contacted Elam, who told us by email that party chairman Steve Munisteri had given a good explanation in a July 24 interview with Austin’s KVUE-TV. Munisteri told KVUE, "The platform plank is against a specific type of teaching called 'outcome-based education.' "The reason why critical thinking is mentioned is some places try to disguise the program of outcome-based education and just re-label it as 'critical thinking.' " That’s supported by the wording in the platform. Following the lead of a July 6, 2012, Chronicle of Higher Education blog post on the Texas platform fracas, we looked back to the 2010 platform. Its "Knowledge-Based Education" plank said, "The primary purpose of public schools is to teach critical thinking skills, reading, writing, arithmetic, phonics, history, science, and character … We oppose Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and similar programs." Both platforms support critical thinking when it comes to "controversial theories" such as evolution, which "should be taught as challengeable scientific theories ... Teachers and students should be able to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these theories openly and without fear of retribution or discrimination of any kind." Next, we set out to see if we could determine whether opposing outcome-based education is also, de facto, opposing critical thinking in the larger sense. The debate over outcome-based education caught fire in the 1990s as outcome-based curricula were installed in U.S. school districts. In the Lexis newspaper archive and on the web, we saw a dozen news stories and opinion pieces from as many states -- Texas included -- describing public concern about the new approach. Opponents said the outcome-based approach was antithetical to critical thinking. They claimed it "dumbed down" curricula and influenced students to adopt liberal attitudes because the "outcome" of their studies was predetermined by academia. Supporters claimed it encouraged -- in fact, taught -- critical thinking. Rather than testing students on facts learned by rote memorization, they said, it required children to demonstrate that they had learned to analyze the material. So what the heck is it? The news stories we read indicate outcome-based education takes different forms nearly everywhere it’s applied. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram gave a description in an Oct. 30, 1996, news story about opposition to OBE-like elements in the state’s planned education overhaul: Under outcome-based education, academic and personal goals are set for students before they can graduate. The program stresses that children are not allowed to fail, so they might be given the same test or report over and over until they do the work satisfactorily. It also may eliminate traditional grades, competitive student assessments and distinct subjects and grade levels. Methods of implementing outcome-based education include awarding group grades instead of individual grades and eliminating honors programs. The "founding father" of OBE, education reformer William Spady, gave an example in an interview for the December 1992/January 1993 issue of Educational Leadership magazine, published by ASCD (formerly the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development). Asked whether an outcome might be "The student will be able to list the five causes of the Civil War," Spady replied: "No, sorry; that is not an exit outcome. But, ‘Identify and explain the fundamental causes and consequences of the Civil War’ would be an enabling outcome worth pursuing en route to some larger exit outcome." Today, a divide remains between the "OBE teaches kids to think" side and the "OBE suppresses thinking" side. We didn’t find allusions to "critical thinking skills" being used as a code phrase for OBE, but did note that a Feb. 15, 1994, news story in the Dallas Morning News said some educators were avoiding the name "outcomes-based education": Because of the controversy, many educators are going to great lengths to avoid being associated with outcomes-based education. "We've always had outcomes," said state school board member Diane Patrick. But "we'd be foolish to call it outcomes-based education right now. That would be very unwise." Our ruling As Collins says, the Texas GOP platform does state that the party opposes "critical thinking." But Collins leaves out some important context. The platform makes it clear that its opposition is centered on one type of education model: outcome-based education. That’s just the kind of situation addressed in PolitiFact’s definition of Half True: "The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context." By those lights, Collins’ statement is Half True.	None	Gail Collins	None	None	None	2012-08-11T06:00:00	2012-08-01	['None']
pomt-06786	Says that he did "not exactly" say that communities have the right to ban mosques.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/17/herman-cain/cain-says-he-did-not-exactly-say-communities-have-/	Just when we thought metro Atlanta’s Herman Cain had moved past the controversy over his opinions on Islam, he tumbled right back into the fray. The GOP candidate and former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza generated headlines in March when he said he would not hire a Muslim for his Cabinet. Cain later denied he made that statement, a claim we rated Pants on Fire. In July, Cain ignited another controversy after he told anchor Chris Wallace on "Fox News Sunday" that he thinks communities have the right to ban mosques. Wallace brought up the issue when he moderated Thursday’s GOP debate in Ames, Iowa. "You said that communities have the right to ban Muslims from building mosques, before you later apologized. ... How do you reassure people that you know enough to be president of the United States, sir?" Wallace asked. After some back and forth, Cain replied with this: "The first point that you raised, about saying that communities have a right to ban mosques, no, that's not exactly what I said. Unfortunately, the people who helped you put that together have misquoted me. I have gone on record, and I put it in a press release that's available at my office that simply says that if anyone misunderstood my intent, I apologize for that. But never will I apologize for saying that Sharia law does not belong in the courts of the United States of America." That’s "not exactly" what Cain said? Then what did he say? We contacted a campaign spokeswoman for comment but did not receive a response. Undeterred, we looked at a transcript and video of the July 17 "Fox News Sunday" episode where Cain supposedly said communities have the right to ban mosques. Cain’s remarks came as Wallace pressured him to explain his opposition to a mosque proposed for Murfreesboro, Tenn., southeast of Nashville. He had recently said it was an attempt to "sneak" Shariah law into the U.S. legal system. WALLACE: Don't Americans have a right of whatever religion under the Constitution, which you speak so much about, to free speech and freedom to worship? CAIN: To the people in Murfreesboro, it is hallowed ground. They are objecting to the intentions of trying to get Sharia law. [...] WALLACE: But couldn't any community then say we don't want a mosque in our community? CAIN: They could say that. So in this exchange, Cain agreed that any community can "say" that they don’t want a mosque in their community. But did Cain mean that they have a right to ban a mosque? A few seconds later, Cain expanded on his position: WALLACE: So, you're saying that any community, if they want to ban a mosque ... CAIN: Yes, they have the right to do that. That's not discriminating based upon religion -- against that particular religion. There is an aspect of them building that mosque that doesn't get talked about. And the people in the community know what it is and they are talking about it. So not only can a community "say" they oppose a mosque in their town. Cain told Wallace that if a community wants to block a mosque because they oppose Sharia law becoming part of the U.S. legal system, they have "the right" to do so. He even specified that this doesn’t count as religious discrimination. Now, Cain mentioned during Thursday’s debate that he issued an apology on his "Fox News Sunday" comments, so we took a look at it. We thought it might say that the media misinterpreted him or that he really didn’t think that a community has a right to ban a mosque. It did not. The closest he came was this: "I am truly sorry for any comments that may have betrayed my commitment to the U.S. Constitution and the freedom of religion guaranteed by it. Muslims, like all Americans, have the right to practice their faith freely and peacefully." So where does this leave us? While Cain did not "exactly" say that "communities have the right to ban mosques," he made this same point. Then he drove it home by adding that this does not count as religious discrimination. Cain comes awfully close to earning a Pants on Fire. In fact, if he said that he "never said" that communities have the right to ban a mosque, his trousers may well have burst into flames. But Cain was careful. He said it was not "exactly" what he said. This inched his statement ever so slightly away from patent absurdity. As a result, his claim is merely False.

pomt-04995	Says federal debt "doubled during the Bush administration."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/jul/19/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-national-debt-doubled-under-georg/	Former Texas state Rep. Paul Sadler answered a debate question June 26, 2012, with a call to stop expanding government programs until the federal debt is under control. Squaring off in Dallas with retired teacher Grady Yarbrough, his opponent in the July 31, 2012, runoff for the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination, Sadler said, "Until we get our financial house in order, we cannot continue to spend money. We just can’t." The U.S. has "never seen national debt like this," Sadler said. "It doubled during the Bush administration." We decided to see if Sadler’s claim about debt under President George W. Bush holds up. Sadler sent us an email with several presidents’ names linked to numbers, such as "Bill Clinton 1.4," and told us the numbers’ sources were the U.S. Treasury, Financial Management Service, Bureau of the Public Debt, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Office of Management and Budget. The same figures and sources, listed in the same order, appear on a July 28, 2011, New York Times chart illustrating how much of the federal debt accumulated under each president since 1981. According to the chart, the Bush administration began with a $5.8 trillion gross federal debt, which grew by $6.1 trillion to reach $11.9 trillion -- an increase of 105 percent, or slightly more than double. The Times ascribed the increase in debt to "tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, (the) economic downturn in 2001 and recession starting in 2007." Following a suggestion from Treasury spokesman Matthew Anderson, we found that plugging the fiscal years of Bush’s presidency -- October 2001 through September 2009 -- into the Treasury’s online calculator gives debt figures that tally with the Times graphic. While that period begins nearly nine months into Bush’s presidency, it also aligns with the years over which he held budgetary sway. Gross federal debt, though, is only one measure of how much the government owes. Because Sadler’s numbers match the Times chart, we started with that statistic, which includes money the federal government owes itself, including for programs such as Social Security and Medicare, in addition to public debt. Public debt itself is another commonly used measure. Debt held by the public is money borrowed from investors outside the federal government, in the form of Treasury notes and other securities. Which to use? We consulted Oregon State University political scientist Robert Sahr, who studies U.S. debt, policy, presidents and inflation. Sahr suggested we use public debt, and emailed us part of a textbook’s explanation of why net public debt, rather than gross debt, is seen as a better measure of how much government is borrowing: "To understand why, suppose you decided to lend yourself $1,000 this year — you take money from your left pocket and lend it to your right pocket. Clearly this has no effect on your overall wealth. Similarly, one branch of the government borrowing from another creates an asset (a trust fund) as well as a debt, and these exactly offset. Net debt held outside the government is the relevant measure." We returned to the Treasury calculator and found that during Bush’s fiscal years, public debt rose from $3.3 trillion to $7.6 trillion -- up 130 percent, clearly more than double. Also, we asked Sahr whether he agreed that debt doubled under Bush. Adjusted for inflation, he said, public debt did not double, though it came close. Sahr produced a spreadsheet for us with fiscal year-end debt numbers from the federal Office of Management and Budget. Among the results: As with the Treasury calculator, 2001-2009 public debt in non-inflation-adjusted dollars went up 130 percent. Adjusted for inflation (to 2011 dollars), though, the increase was 88 percent. Returning to gross federal debt, which was Sadler’s basis: Sahr’s spreadsheet showed the same 105-percent increase in non-inflation-adjusted dollars as the New York Times chart. In 2011 dollars, though, the increase was 70 percent. Some news analyses have compared changes in debt using inauguration dates. We checked those with the Treasury calculator, finding that from Bush’s first inauguration, January 20, 2001, to the day President Barack Obama took office, January 20, 2009, gross federal debt in non-inflation-adjusted dollars rose from $5.7 trillion to $10.6 trillion, up 86 percent. The calculator didn’t have an amount for public debt January 20, 2001, but says the non-adjusted figure was $6.3 trillion January 20, 2009. When we checked back in with Sadler, he objected to adjusting the debt changes for inflation, saying by email: "I seriously doubt any holder of the debt or your bank would allow you to adjust your debt for inflation. The amount owed is the amount owed - you don't get to adjust it for inflation." Sahr said later: "Sure, you’re paying in current dollars. But if you’re looking at the change in debt over eight years, part of the change is the change in the value of the dollar over those years." A final note: Such accounting and tallies can be read as blaming Bush alone for the increases. As PolitiFact has noted numerous times, such assumptions are overly sweeping. Many factors are at play, including Congress, which votes on many spending decisions affecting the debt. Our ruling We see how Sadler reached his conclusion. In raw terms, both the public debt and gross federal debt more than doubled during the fiscal years corresponding to Bush’s presidency. However, adjusting for inflation, gross debt increased 70 percent over those years, while public debt increased 88 percent. That’s not quite doubling. We rate Sadler’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-00557	Ninety-seven percent of Americans do not receive subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jun/15/austin-scott/scott-correct-majority-dont-receive-premium-subsid/	(Editor's note: An earlier version of this fact-check included an incorrect number for the $1.7 billion in monthly tax credits potentially at risk for 6.4 million people in Georgia and 33 other states in the lawsuit King v. Burwell.) The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule later this month in a lawsuit that could wipe out premium subsidies for millions of Americans under President Barack Obama’s healthcare law. About 6.4 million people in Georgia and 33 other states who use the federal marketplace could be at risk of losing a total of $1.7 billion in monthly tax credits and face net premium increases of 287 percent, according to a state-by-state analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Many in the GOP, particularly Tea Party Republicans, are likely to resist extending the subsidies, even temporarily, The Washington Times reported June 5. Those Republicans are much more worried about angering their base by appearing to concede on Obamacare than they are about having a handful of constituents lose their subsidies, the newspaper said.. "Ninety-seven percent of Americans aren't receiving those subsidies," Georgia Congressman Austin Scott told reporters. That statistic caught the eye of a PolitiFact reader who asked us to do some checking. "Is that claim accurate?" the reader wrote. . We promised to do some checking. First a little background about the closely watched lawsuit, King v. Burwell. The plaintiff, King, argues that because the health care law refers to "an exchange established by the state," individuals in states with federally run exchanges are not eligible for subsidies. Others contend that the clear intent of the ACA -- the most significant overhaul of U.S.healthcare since passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 -- is to allow individuals to obtain subsidized insurance regardless of whether they obtain it through a state or federal exchange. Currently, 34 states rely on the federal exchange and could lose subsidies if the Supreme Court rules in favor of King. Florida could be the most affected, with 1.3 million residents losing monthly subsidies worth a combined $206 million a month, according to forecasts. In Georgia, 412,385 people could lose subsidies, with a total monthly value of $113 million, the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis showed. States such California and New York, which set up their own exchanges, would be untouched by the ruling. So what about Scott’s statement that 97 percent of Americans aren’t receiving ACA insurance subsidies. We reached out to Ryann DuRant, Scott’s communications director. She told us Scott’s statement was based on calculations that were done using data from the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, reports in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and population information from the U.S. Census. This includes: about 6.4 million people who receive federal subsidies to buy insurance;, estimates of all insurance subsidies, state and federal combined,totalling about nine million; the national population estimate of about 318 million. (We calculated 2.83 percent or just shy or 3 percent with subsidies, leaving about 97 percent of Americans without subsidies) We asked the Kaiser Family Foundation in D.C.to independently run the numbers for us. Chris Lee, a communications officer with the foundation, said about 2.7 percent of Americans receive ACA tax credits. His calculation is based on information that slightly more than 8.6 million of the nation’s 321 million residents have received advance premium tax credits, or subsidies, to buy their insurance, Lee said. That would mean about 97.3 percent of Americans aren’t receiving subsidies to buy insurance. DuRant told us Scott is co-sponsoring a bill, introduced June 4, to repeal ObamaCare and "address healthcare for all Americans. "So in no way was this to discount the 3 percent or the 97 percent," she said. ‘We are concerned with 100 percent of Americans and with lowering health insurance premiums for 100 percent of Americans." The GOP-controlled Congress has repeatedly expressed interest in passing legislation to fully repeal and replace ObamaCare, and Scott’s bill is one of several options that is available. .Our ruling U.S. Rep. Austin Scott said 97 percent of Americans don’t receive subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act. His numbers are close. We rate his statement True.

pomt-06051	"Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and Newt Gingrich all say they would cut foreign aid to Israel — and every other country — to zero."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/11/barack-obama/barack-obama-campaign-says-romney-perry-gingrich-w/	On an outreach page on its website, the Barack Obama-Joe Biden re-election campaign takes aim at three Republican presidential candidates for their stances on aid to Israel -- a hot-button topic for members of both parties. "Stand against ‘zeroing out’ aid to Israel," the web page says. "Republican candidates for president Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and Newt Gingrich all say they would cut foreign aid to Israel — and every other country — to zero. Stand up to this extreme isolationism and join the call to reject the Romney-Perry-Gingrich plan." A reader asked us to check out the claim, so we did. We began by asking for backup materials from the Obama campaign. The campaign sent us a series of links to debate transcripts and news articles. All flow from a series of statements made at a Nov. 12, 2011, foreign-policy themed debate among the Republican presidential candidates. Let’s first review what the candidates said during the debate, which was moderated by CBS News’ Scott Pelley and National Journal’s Major Garrett. The issue came up at four different points. First, Perry answered a question from Pelley about Pakistan. Perry: "Listen, I think we're having an interesting conversation here, but the deeper one (is about) foreign aid. And we need a president of the United States working with a Congress that sends a clear message to every country. It doesn't make any difference whether it's Pakistan or whether it's Afghanistan or whether it's India. "The foreign aid budget in my administration for every country is going to start at zero dollars. Zero dollars. And then we'll have a conversation. Then we'll have a conversation in this country about whether or not a penny of our taxpayer dollar needs to go into those countries. And Pakistan is clearly sending us messages, Mitt. It's clearly sending us messages that they -- they don't deserve our foreign aid that we're getting, because they're not being honest with us. American soldiers' lives are being put at jeopardy because of that country. … It's time for us as a country to say no to foreign aid to countries that don't support the United States of America." Later, Garrett posed a question to Gingrich: Garrett: "Speaker Gingrich, you presided as speaker over several foreign aid budgets for the United States. … You have seen, at times, the proper role of the United States through foreign aid and other interventions. I want to know if you agree with -- Governor Perry about starting at zero?" Gingrich: "What he said made absolutely perfect sense. … Consider the alternative. You're giving some country $7 billion a year .... or in the case of Egypt, $3 billion a year. So you start off every year and say, ‘Here's your $3 billion, now I'll start thinking’? You ought to start off at zero and say, ‘Explain to me why I should give you a penny.’... "The Pakistanis hid Bin Laden for at least six years in a military city within a mile of their national defense university. And then they got mad at the people who turned him over to us? And we think those are the acts of allies? I think that's a pretty good idea to start at zero and sometimes stay there." Then, later on, Pelley read a question from a viewer submitted by Twitter: "Does Gov. Perry's foreign aid starts-at-zero (policy) include Israel?" Perry: "Absolutely. Every country would start at zero. Obviously, Israel is a special ally. And my bet is that we would be funding them at some substantial level. But it makes sense for everyone to come in at zero and make your case. As a matter of fact, we ought to try that … with some of those agencies that I was trying to think the name of the other night. Starting at zero, zero-based budgeting … we've got to go there. And everyone has to come in and make (their) case." Finally, Romney expressed agreement with this approach during a subsequent exchange about Pakistan. Romney: "One of the things we have to do with our foreign aid commitments, the ongoing foreign aid commitments -- I agree with Gov. Perry. You start everything at zero." So each of the three Republican candidates cited on the Obama campaign website did express agreement with this approach to handing out foreign aid. And the candidates’ comments immediately set off a bipartisan tempest within Israel policy circles. The Republican Jewish Coalition tweeted its displeasure with Romney’s proposal, while the Democratic National Committee had former Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida hold a conference call to blast the idea, according to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. Still, we find several problems with the way the Obama campaign translated this policy proposal into the claim we’re checking. It ignores nuances the candidates expressed during the debate The Obama campaign’s claim said the proposal outlined by Perry, and seconded by Gingrich and Romney, would "cut foreign aid to Israel — and every other country — to zero." It’s true that the proposal would reduce aid to zero, but only temporarily (and theoretically) as a starting point for discussions about what the final level should be. As Perry put it, "And then we'll have a conversation." It’s worth noting that handling foreign aid this way would have potentially problematic policy consequences, even if Israel’s aid package ultimately remained exactly the same size as previously. In August 2007, the Bush administration signed a "memorandum of understanding" that outlined a 10-year framework for U.S. military assistance to Israel. So implementing the Perry proposal without allowing a waiver for Israel would require reneging on the amounts of aid specified in that agreement, which diplomatically is not a trivial issue. Still, even during the debate itself, the candidates said only that they would use zero as a starting point for funding to Israel, not an end point. There would be nothing stopping negotiators from reducing funding to zero but then immediately deferring to the terms of the memorandum and leaving Israel’s promised funding level as is. They could even increase the levels beyond what the memorandum provides. Perry himself made this point during the debate, saying, "Obviously, Israel is a special ally. And my bet is that we would be funding them at some substantial level." It ignores statements the candidates made after the debate to explain their positions After critics seized on Perry’s proposal, a Perry aide e-mailed POLITICO columnist Ben Smith to say, "Perry believes Israel's an extraordinary friend and our greatest ally. … Under Rick Perry, Israel will set the bar for judging foreign aid to any country. Perry's Start at Zero is exactly the right policy -- no country stands to benefit more than Israel from merit-based foreign aid." Meanwhile, JTA reported that immediately following the debate, a Romney spokesman clarified that "he would exempt Israel from the policy." And Gingrich -- who in general has taken strong pro-Israel positions -- reiterated his support for the idea in an interview with the Jewish Channel but added that the memorandum of understanding would prevent Israel from being sent back to zero funding, even temporarily. "We have a 10-year commitment that we have to live out," Gingrich said. "So I think because we’ve made this long-term commitment, you wouldn’t be able to go back to zero." The Obama claim misuses the term "zeroing out" Budget experts we contacted agreed that that the Obama camp erred in using the term "zeroing out" to describe what Perry was proposing. "Zeroing out" means that funding will be terminated. The actual term for what Perry suggests is "zero-based budgeting." "Nothing the candidates said indicated that Israel would get a cut," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that analyzes federal spending. "Zero-based budgeting just means funding levels must be justified year-to-year, rather than starting from a baseline. Funding for a particular program, in this case aid to Israel, could well end up being more than the previous year, or it could be less. The campaign is taking advantage of the word ‘zero’ without putting it in the proper budget context." Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist and budget expert at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, agreed. "The Obama campaign statement is misleading, to say the least," Meyers said. Our ruling The Obama campaign said, "Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and Newt Gingrich all say they would cut foreign aid to Israel — and every other country — to zero." We find that a ridiculous distortion of their positions on this extremely sensitive issue. First, the plan discussed in the foreign policy debate means only that future aid levels for Israel would be subject to negotiations, starting from a baseline of zero rather than the current level. A funding level of zero would be only a theoretical starting point, not an end point, just as easily leaving Israel with higher funding rather than lower. Second, to varying degrees, the candidates pledged that they personally would either advocate "substantial" funding for Israel (Perry), an exemption from the policy for Israel (Romney), or an automatic waiver due to agreements already in force (Gingrich). None of the candidates actually said they supported making Israel’s funding level zero. Finally, the Obama campaign misleadingly used the term "zeroing out" instead of accurately describing it as "zero-based" budgeting, making the three-sentence statement wrong in three different ways.

pomt-05464	Georgia’s HOPE scholarship is "still the richest scholarship program in America."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/23/michael-adams/politifact-calling-hope-richest-program-goes-too-f/	The HOPE scholarship program may be shrinking, but the financial aid it gives Georgia’s best students is second to none, the head of this state’s flagship university said recently. Legislators cut HOPE in 2011 to rein in spending that was growing faster than the state could afford. The scholarship, which helps pay for in-state college tuition, began providing less money to all but the highest-performing students in August. Adams thinks HOPE needs a long-term fix, but it’s still generous, he said in an April 15 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. HOPE is "still the richest scholarship program in America," Adams said. Still? Despite all of the changes? HOPE now pays full tuition for only about 10 percent of recipients. The rest receive scholarships that cover 90 percent of tuition at 2010-11 academic year rates. That percentage will shrink over time. Tuition rose this school year and will climb again in August. A University of Georgia spokeswoman said that Adams based his statement on data from the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, which PolitiFact used to assess a March 2011 statement by Gov. Nathan Deal: "Georgia still has one of the richest programs in terms of scholarships for students to go to college," Deal said then. We rated his claim True. Georgia was near or at the top, depending on what measure you considered. For the past four decades, NASSGAP has kept track of how much money each state awards in postsecondary education scholarships and grants. When Deal made his statement, the most recent data available covered the 2008-09 school year. Back then, Georgia awarded nearly $567 million in total grant aid. We ranked fourth in the nation behind California, New York and Florida, according to the association. Divide that total by the number of students enrolled in undergraduate programs, and Georgia was second only to South Carolina. Georgia’s HOPE program was also the largest of its kind. NASSGAP classifies HOPE as a "non-needs-based" scholarship, which means it awards money on factors aside from a student’s financial need. Georgia awarded some $565 million in non-needs-based money, NASSGAP reported. This amount included funds for other non-needs-based scholarships, but HOPE spending accounted for a vast majority of it. Florida, which ranked second, gave out about $100 million less. But that was three years ago. Is HOPE "still" the richest scholarship in America, as Adams said? It’s tough to say with certainty. NASSGAP numbers have been updated, but its latest data dates from about two years ago. It does not reflect the HOPE cuts passed in the spring session of 2011. However, this data does hint at how HOPE currently compares to other programs. Georgia awarded about $672 million in non-needs-based scholarships such as HOPE during the 2009-2010 academic year. Once again, Florida came in second. But the gap between it and Georgia grew to nearly $250 million. Tennessee, South Carolina and Louisiana round out the top five with amounts between $135 million and $262 million. Georgia came in second on a per-capita basis as well. Other states give away larger pots of money, but not many of them. Nationally, about three-quarters of state grants are awarded based on financial need, said Frank Ballmann, a NASSGAP official. California gave away more than $1 billion in needs-based financial aid in the 2009-2010 school year. New York placed second at about $900 million. Still, Georgia’s program dwarfed almost all other state efforts that year. Pennsylvania, which was third place in needs-based aid, gave away about $413 million in needs-based aid. Now, let’s take a look at HOPE awards after the cuts. Totals for 2011-2012 are not yet available. The Georgia Student Finance Commission, which administers HOPE and other state scholarship and aid programs, is still giving out money, a commission official said. But projected amounts are available. After HOPE was cut, the Finance Commission’s budget was trimmed to reflect the changes. This updated budget allocates some $590 million for the HOPE grant, GED and scholarship programs. At this funding level, Georgia’s ranking may fall this school year. NASSGAP’s data shows that over the past 10 years, states have doubled the amount of money they give out, not cut it. But the numbers also suggest that HOPE will remain one of the nation’s most generous programs. This $590 million budget would have qualified HOPE for a slot somewhere in NASSGAP’s top five two years ago, all other things being equal. For Georgia to drop out of the top 10 this year, total grant aid awarded by lower-ranked states would have to grow by hundreds of millions of dollars. That’s unlikely in these austere times. Adams’ assertion that HOPE is "still the richest scholarship program in America" needs some context. Georgia’s program was the richest of its kind two school years ago, and it ranked high in other measures, although this state’s pot of money wasn’t the biggest overall. HOPE is likely to remain near the top this school year. Even with the cuts, other states are probably too far behind to catch up, for now. Adams earns a Half True.

pomt-13450	Says Ted Strickland supported giving $150 billion to Iranian regime that persecutes women, Christians and gays.	false	/ohio/statements/2016/sep/15/american-unity-pac/pac-blames-ted-strickland-iran-deal-he-didnt-vote/	A conservative group that supports gay rights accused Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland of supporting the Iran deal despite the country’s cruelty to women, Christians and gays. As the video flashes images of women wearing hijabs and children in distress, the words "Ted Strickland: $150 billion for Iran" appear. The script says, "In Iran, a woman’s life is worth half her husband’s. Christians, persecuted. It’s illegal to be gay. People stoned, beaten and hanged for what they believe, how they were born, and who they love." Then the ad pivots to Strickland, and says that he "supported giving billions to that regime -- without concessions for human rights violations -- when we had leverage." The kicker: "Ted Strickland didn’t stand up for the vulnerable. That’s why we can’t trust him to stand up for us." The digital ad is paid for by American Unity PAC, a group that describes itself as "focused exclusively on protecting and promoting candidates for U.S. Congress who support freedom for all Americans, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity." Considering that Strickland was not in an elected office when Congress voted to approve the Iran nuclear deal in September 2015, it seems like an odd jab. We took a closer look at Strickland’s role. American Unity PAC did not respond to our inquiry. Strickland favored Iran deal The purpose of the Iran nuclear agreement was to reduce the likelihood and ability of Iran to develop weapons-grade nuclear material, and to prevent development of nuclear weapons. In exchange, the U.S. agreed to end its freeze on Iranian assets. What did Strickland have to do with the agreement? He was not in office at the time, having served as governor from 2007 to 2011. In August 2015, his Senate campaign released a statement in favor of the deal. "Everyone agrees we must prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and there is no question that this strong, enforceable agreement with the support of the UN Security Council is a far better way to achieve that goal than war," Strickland said. But the ad goes further to say Strickland supported $150 billion to Iran. PolitiFact visited this topic in August 2015, after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said Iran gets "$150 billion" in the deal. PolitiFact rated that claim Half True. Much of the money Iran gets in the deal was Iran’s to begin with, but it was inaccessible due to international sanctions, said Tom Sutton, political science professor at Baldwin Wallace University. And the commonly repeated $150-billion figure is too high of an estimate. Sutton told PolitiFact Ohio, "The U.S. agreed to end the freeze on Iranian assets that was imposed after the 1979 Iranian revolution and hostage crisis. It totals, at most, $100 billion, not $150 billion." Leverage The ad says that the Iran nuclear deal gave the country billions "without concessions for human rights violations, when we had leverage." But there are separate, existing sanctions in place with regard to Iran’s human rights abuses. As the White House clarified, after the deal, "U.S. statutory sanctions focused on Iran’s support for terrorism, human rights abuses, and missile activities will remain in effect and continue to be enforced." The National Iranian American Council reported that even after the lifting of sanctions in the nuclear deal, "Iran will remain one of the most sanctioned jurisdictions in the world." The concessions that were made in exchange for constraints on Iran’s nuclear program "in no shape or form" diminish the U.S. ability to confront human rights violations in Iran, they said. "Supporting this agreement does not imply that Strickland supports all of the egregious, unjust practices of Iran highlighted in the ad," Sutton said. "By comparison, the United States under all presidents has maintained an alliance with Saudi Arabia, including weapons sales, but that does not imply sanctioning or support for gender segregation and the harsh punishments used in Saudi Arabia, like stoning adulterers." Sutton pointed out that several countries that have political and diplomatic relationships with the United States -- such as like Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nigeria -- and are places where female genital mutilation has been documented. Maintaining those ties does not equate to a nod in support of female genital mutilation. Our ruling An American Unity PAC digital ad claims that Strickland supported giving $150 billion to Iran without a commitment from that regime to stop its harsh treatment of Christians, gays and women. Strickland said he supported the Iran nuclear deal last year during his campaign, but he didn't hold federal office when the deal was completed and he didn't vote in favor of it. There are other problems with the ad. For one, the $150 billion estimate is too high, experts say. Also, separate U.S. sanctions for human rights violations remain in place and continue to be enforced. And Strickland’s symbolic support of the deal wasn’t tacit approval of Iran’s persecution of women, non-Muslims, and homosexuality.

pomt-08390	Says "John Loughlin voted to let people accused of domestic violence keep their guns."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/24/david-cicilline/says-loughlin-voted-let-people-accused-domestic-vi/	The new spate of political ads that have flooded the airwaves seem better suited to Halloween than the Election Day that follows it. With haunting music and ominous narration, they sound more like ads for horror movies than political commercials. One example is a radio advertisement from David Cicilline's campaign that begins with the narrator's somber warning: "State Representative John Loughlin is running for Congress." A worried-sounding woman chimes in: "I heard his ideas are really out there." "How extreme is he?" asks a second elderly voice, full of alarm. "So extreme that John Loughlin voted to let people accused of domestic violence keep their guns." Pause. "Doesn't he know how dangerous that is?" a third frightened voice wants to know. We here at PolitiFact aren't easily spooked; we just like to know the truth. So we tuned out the dramatic flourish and got to work checking out the claim. The vote Cicilline's ad talks about was on a 2005 bill in the Rhode Island General Assembly -- now a law -- that allows judges to require those subject to permanent domestic violence restraining orders to surrender their firearms. Rhode Island was the 41st state to enact this law, as part of a push by domestic violence advocates to protect victims. After multiple amendments that carved out exemptions for police officers and active duty military personnel to keep their service weapons while on duty, the Rhode Island bill made it to the floor in June 2005. Once there, it underwent several more changes, one of them spearheaded by Loughlin, a representative from Tiverton, who successfully advocated to exempt on-duty National Guard members from the provision as well. The House bill passed in a 46-20 vote on June 22, 2005, with Loughlin voting no. The Senate approved the same legislation days later and the bill was signed into law in early July. The problem with the Cicilline advertisement's claim is that it incorrectly says the bill applies to those "accused of domestic violence." A restraining order is actually a civil document that can be obtained without accusing the subject of a specific crime. "It may be to prevent something from happening," explained Deb DeBare, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence. "[The victim] may have been threatened or in fear of abuse, but no crime has been committed." Nowhere does the 2005 bill suggest one must be accused of a crime to have the statute apply. Cicilline overstates the scope of the bill that Loughlin voted against. But he is correct to suggest that if Loughlin's side had prevailed, those subject to domestic violence restraining orders would be allowed to keep their guns. We asked Loughlin's campaign manager to explain why he voted against the 2005 bill. Her answer: "John is a supporter of the Second Amendment and he voted against this bill because it was too broad and he was concerned that there was no distinction made between handguns and antique collectibles or family heirlooms." That may be true, but it doesn't change the accuracy of Cicilline's statement. We rate it Mostly True.	None	David Cicilline	None	None	None	2010-10-24T00:01:00	2010-10-19	['None']
pomt-07266	Says that several times in the last 15 years, Austin City Council candidates have won seats after trailing by more than 4,000 votes in the election prompting the runoff.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/may/26/randi-shade/randi-shade-says-several-council-candidates-last-1/	Austin City Council Member Randi Shade, suggesting history’s on her side, says past elections show she can rebound in her June runoff against Kathie Tovo, who nearly unseated her May 14. Five days after initial balloting that gave Tovo 46 percent and Shade nearly 33 percent, Shade told reporters "the margin between me and my opponent on Election Day was just over 4,000 votes... there have been several examples over the last 15 years where candidates have made up larger vote deficits than mine to win in a run-off." Several? In the four-person Place 3 race, Shade trailed Tovo by 4,316 votes,. After leaving a message with Shade’s camp, we hunted for comparable comebacks over the 15 years Shade referenced. In those years, according to the city’s online database summarizing City Council election results, five second-place finishers in general elections won their runoffs: Beverly Griffith (1996); Bill Spelman and Willie Lewis (1997); Raul Alvarez (2000); and Jennifer Kim (2005). However, only two closed a first-round gap of more than 4,000 votes. Spelman bested Manuel Zuniga after trailing by 8,813 votes in their initial race. Kim overtook Margot Clarke after Clarke ran 7,771 votes ahead in the general election. The other runoff victors earlier ran behind by about 1,100 to nearly 2,100 votes. Austin consultant Mark Littlefield, a Shade supporter, agreed that just the two candidates rebounded after lagging by more than 4,000 votes. He said Spelman is the sole council hopeful in the period who bounced back from a greater percentage deficit than the nearly 13.5 points separating Shade and Tovo in this year’s general election, though Kim was behind about 13 points in her first round. Shade spokeswoman Lynda Rife told us: "The meaty part (of Shade’s statement) is there’s precedent for coming back." Littlefield also noted that three of the comeback candidates drew a greater number of votes in the second round than they got facing crowded fields in their general elections--though turnout was diminished. Kim’s vote haul increased 21 percent, Spelman’s runoff total bumped up 41 percent and Griffith enjoyed a 71 percent improvement. Anything could happen in the Tovo-Shade runoff; we’re not making predictions. Per recent history, though, Shade’s claim is off. Two comparable comebacks do not amount to "several." And by percentage of votes cast, only one candidate in the last 15 years made up a deficit as large as Shade’s. We rate her statement Half True.

pomt-05509	"It's the first time in the nation this many members have been drawn (by a Legislature) into the same districts where it wasn't a court order."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/apr/13/will-weatherford/florida-holds-record-redistricting-incumbents-toge/	Florida isn’t alone in its push to cut gerrymandering out of the once-in-a-decade process that determines districts for elected officials. Yet the "fair districts" reforms in Florida’s Constitution are unique — more than is widely known. We at PolitiFact Florida realized this while checking out a claim from incoming House Speaker Will Weatherford, who oversaw the House’s redistricting effort. "It’s the first time in the nation this many members have been drawn into the same districts where it wasn’t a court order," Weatherford told the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald on March 27, 2012, speaking of the House map. (The Senate’s maps are a different story.) "From my understanding, this is the largest amount of incumbents that were pitted against each other based off the Legislature voluntarily doing that in the history in the United States," he added. His assertion about the Legislature’s unparalleled feat of forcing sitting House members to run against each other resonated with us. What a bold (and specific) claim! Other states, like California and Arizona, have adopted independent commissions to handle redistricting instead of letting legislators draw the lines. In Florida, that power remains with lawmakers, who redrew the lines for the first time this year under orders from voters not to protect incumbents when crafting districts. The truth behind his claim is more complicated than we thought it would be. A lot of that has to do with a lack of nationwide data, and the fact that the dust from Florida’s redistricting battle isn’t settled. Susan MacManus, a University of South Florida political science professor, told us the true test of Florida’s "fair districts" experiment will be decided by the courts. "Nonetheless, I think the idea behind it was rather path-breaking, definitely," she said. • • • Weatherford told us he learned about his claim from House redistricting committee staffers and attorneys. "There are other states that have a committee or a commission that does it for them," Weatherford said, "but as far as the Legislature doing it to themselves, we just couldn’t find anything." A little background first: Many states have considered varying approaches to redistricting over widespread concerns of gerrymandering and incumbency protection. Some states, including California and Arizona, adopted special commissions to tackle the process. Florida went with "fair districts" requirements, which keep lawmakers at the wheel but say they can no longer draw federal or state districts to favor a political party or an incumbent, among other things. Voters approved the standards in 2010 over objections from legislators who said the requirements would be impossible to follow. The new maps sent several members moving across town or modifying political ambitions to avoid matchups with colleagues. In its mandatory review of the Legislature’s plans, the Florida Supreme Court accepted the House plan and rejected the state Senate’s, saying it failed to adhere to "fair districts." The Legislature’s map for congressional districts and its second attempt at a state Senate map await separate judicial reviews beginning this week. Another point of caution: Just because the House map hasn’t been challenged doesn’t mean it won’t. • • • So how many members does the House map affect? It’s not so easy to nail down. A Times/Herald report pinpointed 35 member vs. member (and in a couple cases, member vs. member vs. member) races. It did not count incumbents facing term limits, since they can’t run again anyway. But the Times/Herald relied on members’ home addresses as listed on voter registration forms, which leaves open the possibility that some members’ primary residences are in their new districts. Other estimates are higher. The Florida Democratic Party put the count as high as 58 — roughly half the chamber — in a court filing. The Florida House said it found 40 incumbent pairings through various news sources, or one-third of House members. • • • We consulted the country’s top redistricting experts, and none knew of a single source that tracks how many legislators had been drawn into the same district for different states after a redistricting cycle. "It’s a great project for a grad student somewhere," said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Law School associate professor who keeps tabs on redistricting efforts at the All About Redistricting website. As for Florida’s rules, Levitt said, no other state forces the Legislature to draw boundaries with a prohibition on favoring incumbents embedded in its Constitution. Other states have these limits in their statutes, or as nonbinding guidelines, but lawmakers can easily override those, he said. "Florida is the only one that lets its Legislature draw the lines that also has constitutional constraints against legislators helping themselves," he said. A couple of experts advised us to compare Florida’s results with those in Iowa and California. Still, they cautioned, we weren’t going to get an apples-to-apples comparison. No one does it quite like Florida, which may give Weatherford’s claim more merit. In Iowa, the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency designs the maps and presents them to the Legislature for a vote. Lawmakers can approve or reject up to two maps from the agency and are allowed to amend a third map. They’ve never amended a map — "a restraint that’s rare to find anywhere in elected politics," Levitt said. The standards that staffers use to design their map are similar to what Florida adopted in 2010, said Ed Cook, Iowa Legislative Services Agency senior counsel. The agency kept tabs of the number of incumbent races created from redistricting cycles since 1981, the first that used the agency process. The results are close to our estimates for Florida. According to Cook, 27 members were drawn into districts with other incumbents in 2011; 39 in 2001; 40 in 1991; and 36 in 1981. With 100 members in the Iowa House versus Florida’s 120, Iowa has had a higher rate of incumbents pitted against each other as a result of redistricting than Florida. But Iowa’s experience doesn’t satisfy an important caveat of Weatherford’s claim — that lawmakers are the ones drawing the lines. They could draw the lines, but they don’t. There are no term limits in Iowa. "Florida moved much closer to the Iowa system with the amendments and the way they approached it," said Tim Storey, the National Conference of State Legislatures redistricting analyst. California is different, relying like five other states on an independent commission, not an agency, to draw its districts in effort to reduce gerrymandering. California’s latest redistricting cycle pitted a combined 32 incumbents from the state Assembly and Senate in districts against other members, according to redistricting consultant Paul Mitchell. Nine districts were in the House. So, not as many as our best estimates in Florida. But not exactly a great comparison either. Our experts said Weatherford’s claim seems more accurate than not. Florida is "pioneering" the world of forbidding legislators from drawing incumbent-friendly seats, Storey said. "He may be right," he said. "With the exception of Iowa, nothing else jumps to mind." Mitchell wasn’t familiar with Florida’s incumbent pairings but said, "That would be definitely unique, and it’s a strong point to be made." "Legislatures normally don’t do that," Mitchell said. "I don’t think the California Legislature would be able to pull that off." There may be more data on incumbent vs. incumbent races — at least for states with the most dramatic changes, California and Florida, when the election storm calms next year. "When the process winds down and elections get held in the new maps, the redistricting crowd will really turn its attention to what happened in California and Florida," Storey said. Our ruling Weatherford’s claim is reasonable to believe, according to our experts. We could not find direct evidence to contradict his claim, partly because Florida’s redistricting process is unique across the country. Even with data for incumbent matchups, as in Iowa and California, Florida doesn’t lend itself for an apples-to-apples comparison. Still, none of our experts expressed absolute certainty. A rigorous 50-state study has never been conducted. Given that element of doubt, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Will Weatherford	None	None	None	2012-04-13T14:37:52	2012-03-28	['None']
pomt-13302	"Right now we are at 90 percent health insurance covered. That's the highest we've ever been in our country."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/09/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-90-percent-health/	During the second presidential debate in St. Louis, a member of the audience asked a question about the shortcomings of Obamacare, as the Affordable Care Act -- President Barack Obama’s signature health care law -- is sometimes called. In her answer, Hillary Clinton defended the law, citing its provisions to end barriers to obtaining insurance for those who have preexisting conditions, and ending lifetime limits on coverage. "If we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody -- not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange," she said. "And then we would have to start all over again." She went on to say that the practical consequences of the law have been strong. "Now we're at 90 percent health insurance coverage," she said. "That's the highest we've ever been in our country." Is she correct? Yes. The most widely cited data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau, which tabulates statistics annually on what percentage of Americans are covered by health insurance. The most recent report came out in September 2016, covering the year 2015. The Census Bureau found that 90.9 percent of Americans had some type of health coverage, whether it was provided by their employer, purchased independently or through a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The remainder -- 9.1 percent of Americans -- were uninsured. Here’s the key table from the report: That was an improvement over the 89.6 percent in 2014, 86.7 percent in 2013, 84.6 percent in 2012, 84.3 percent in 2011, and 83.7 percent in 2010 -- the year the Affordable Care Act was passed, although the law didn’t start having a major impact for another few years. Meanwhile, between 1999 and 2009, the insured rate bounced from a low of 83.9 percent to a high of 86.9 percent, the furthest back the Census Bureau offers the statistic online. And at the time the 2015 data was released, it was framed as a record high for insurance coverage. Looking at it the opposite way, the uninsured rate fell from 16.3 percent in 2010 to 9.1 percent in 2015 -- a decline of nearly half over five years. Our ruling Clinton said, "Right now we are at 90 percent health insurance covered. That's the highest we've ever been in our country." According to Census Bureau data, that’s correct; it was just shy of 91 percent in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available.

pomt-08560	"Pepper ... kicked off a jock tax, imposing a levy on the sports and entertainment industry."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/29/dave-yost/gop-auditor-candidate-dave-yost-says-opponent-davi/	When LeBron James returns to Cleveland as a member of the Miami Heat during the upcoming NBA season, a small slice of his game-day check will be carved out and handed over to the city of Cleveland. Taxing the income of visiting professional athletes – the "jock tax," as some derisively call it – is a common practice around the country that was incorporated into Ohio law in 2000. Ohio’s cities with major professional sports franchises have been collecting the tax for years, but recently the jock tax has become an issue in the state auditor’s race, a closely watched election because the winner will sit on the five-member Apportionment Board that will redraw Ohio’s legislative districts next year. Republican Dave Yost, in his quest to paint Democratic opponent David Pepper as a serial taxer, has blamed Pepper for instituting a jock tax when he was a Cincinnati city councilman. (To be clear, the state auditor cannot levy taxes.) "Pepper also kicked off a jock tax, imposing a levy on the sports and entertainment industry," according to a video Yost’s campaign produced in August. PolitiFact Ohio asked Yost’s campaign to back up the claim. It pointed to legislation Pepper sponsored as a city councilman in 2002 that called on Cincinnati to begin collecting income taxes from visiting professional athletes and entertainers. The motion passed and Cincinnati began collecting the tax. Pepper, now a county commissioner in Cincinnati’s Hamilton County, denies responsibility for imposing the tax. Pepper instead blamed state lawmakers who included the jock tax in a comprehensive municipal tax bill passed in 2000. Pepper said that bill, HB 483, forced cities to tax those athletes’ earnings. We took a closer look at HB 483 and found a provision that prohibits cities from taxing the income of anyone who works in a city for 12 or fewer days in a calendar year. An exception to that rule, however, is "a professional entertainer or professional athlete … as may be reasonably defined by the municipal corporation," the bill reads. That means an Ohio city can tax a professional athlete’s pay, no matter how many days he works there. (The provision originally was part of another bill that passed in 2000, HB 477, but was thrown into HB 483 for technical reasons.) While Pepper argued state law requires Cincinnati to collect the jock tax, experts we talked to said the 2000 state law placed Cincinnati under no obligation to do so. "It’s up the city," said John Mahoney, deputy director of the nonpartisan Ohio Municipal League, which represents the collective interests of the state’s municipalities. Cities, under home rule powers, generally have the final say when deciding whose income to tax. State lawmakers can only limit this authority, Mahoney said. The Ohio Municipal League, he noted, worked with lawmakers on the issue during the legislative process. Don Mottley, a former Republican state representative who sponsored both HB 483 and HB 477 and chaired the House Ways and Means committee hearings on each bill, agreed with Mahoney. "There’s nothing in there that requires them to tax athletes and entertainers," Mottley said. "It just permits them to." Mottley left the General Assembly at the end of 2000 and began practicing law. He also is a former chairman of the Ohio State Bar Association’s taxation committee. He represented the Cincinnati Bengals before the Cincinnati City Council in 2002 in opposition of Pepper’s legislation. The Bengals feared Cincinnati’s tax on opposing players would prompt more NFL cities to pass similar laws, Mottley said. But Cincinnati was far from the first city to collect a jock tax. Cleveland has been collecting the tax for more than three decades, and Columbus, home to an NHL team and a Major League Soccer team, has been doing so since the mid-1990s. In his defense, Pepper said the video makes it seem as if he created a never-before-seen tax. Pepper said he wanted Cincinnati to be in step with state law that allowed it to tax visiting athletes’ income. He said city law mandates taxing all qualifying wage earners. It is true that Pepper did not create the jock tax: It was collected in other cities before he pushed for it in Cincinnati. And a claim in the video that "CNN called it one of the strangest taxes in America" is an overstatement. The jock tax was included in a 2005 CNNmoney.com article that described, in general terms, how athletes’ income is taxed in different states. The story did not mention Pepper or the city of Cincinnati. However, Pepper’s legislation, while beneficial to the city budget, did institute the tax collection in Cincinnati. And the experts we talked to said collecting the tax was the city’s prerogative. Pepper can’t duck responsibility for starting the tax in Cincinnati. We find the statement True.

pomt-04353	Says Mitt Romney "just gave a speech a few weeks ago" and said "we should still have troops in Iraq."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/23/barack-obama/obama-romney-said-troops-should-still-be-iraq/	President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney sparred during the third presidential debate over how Obama ended the Iraq war, a decision he announced about a year ahead of their final matchup. The candidates at one point saw eye-to-eye on an exit strategy, Romney said, though they now disagree over Obama’s call to withdraw all troops by the end of 2011. "With regards to Iraq, you and I agreed, I believe, that there should be a status of forces agreement," Romney said during the Lynn University debate in Boca Raton, Fla. Obama cut in, saying, "That’s not true," prompting more cross-talk about the number of troops each wanted to remain and the lack of a status of forces agreement with the Iraqi government. Obama criticized Romney for saying in a speech "just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq." "No, I didn’t, I’m sorry -- I indicated that you failed to put in place a status of forces agreement at the end of the conflict --" Romney said before Obama jumped in again. "Governor, here’s one thing … I’ve learned as commander in chief. You’ve got to be clear, both to our allies and our enemies, about where you stand and what you mean," Obama said. "Now, you just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq. That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East." We were interested in Obama’s claim that Romney recently said troops should still be in place in Iraq. First, we’ll note Romney’s point about how both candidates wanted some troops to remain as part of an agreement with the Iraqi government is fair. Before President George W. Bush left office in 2008, the Iraqi Parliament ratified a pact, or a status of forces agreement, with the U.S. that put the complete withdrawal of troops by the end of 2011. Still, officials on both sides expected some American troops to remain to help protect and train the Iraqis with security threats to their border, waterways and airspace, the New York Times reported. Over the course of 2011, Obama scaled down the number of troops he thought should be in place to between 3,000 and 5,000. In the end, the breaking point was not over the size of a remaining force, but over Iraqi officials not wanting to grant American soldiers immunity under Iraqi law. The result: No combat troops remained in Iraq. About 200 people in the military are there now, and they report to the U.S. ambassador, a U.S. Defense Department spokesman said. This does not include security contractors, for which the spokesman had no estimate. Some U.S. military officers saw Obama’s Oct. 21, 2011, announcement of a complete withdrawal as him "putting best face on a breakdown in tortured negotiations with the Iraqis," the New York Times reported. This brings us back to our check: Did Romney say the U.S. should have troops in Iraq to this day? He has not used those words, but it’s a reasonable inference of his public positions on the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. The Obama campaign directed us to Romney’s remarks on foreign policy at the Virginia Military Institute on Oct. 8, 2012. In that speech, like many times before, Romney criticized Obama for pursuing a total withdrawal from the country instead of securing a residual force. "In Iraq the costly gains made by our troops are being eroded by rising violence, a resurgent al-Qaida, the weakening of democracy in Baghdad and the rising influence of Iran," he said. "And yet America’s ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence. The president’s tried, he tried, but he also failed to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains." Romney did not specify in his foreign policy speech what he thought a reasonable residual force would be. But in a December 2011 interview with Fox News, he said "we should have left 10-, 20-, 30,000 personnel there to help transition to the Iraqi's own military capabilities." We could not find an instance in which Romney said how long troops should have been in place. The main takeaway from the debate exchange, a Romney spokesman said, is Obama did not fulfill his own plan to leave a residual force in Iraq after 2012. The Obama campaign says it is reasonable to say thousands of troops would still be in place had Romney has his way. "So those comments -- and with no clear plan forward on Iraq – mean troops would be there right now," wrote Kara Carscaden, Obama campaign spokeswoman, in an email. Our ruling According to Obama, Romney said in a recent speech "we should still have troops in Iraq." In a speech at the Virginia Military Institute, Romney said the United States has been "undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence" and that Obama "failed to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown." So Romney wanted a sizeable presence of U.S. troops in Iraq past 2011 as part of a status of forces agreement, which the Obama administration sought but did not get with the Iraqi government. The agreement would have been part of an overall drawdown. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-10-23T17:34:57	2012-10-22	['Iraq']

pomt-06500	Says "any attempt to try to compare" the Massachusetts health care law with the federal health care law is "completely, intellectually dishonest. Governor Romney did not raise one tax in doing what he did."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/13/chris-christie/chris-christie-calls-comparisons-between-health-ca/	Standing beside Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Gov. Chris Christie had three strong words to describe any comparisons between Romney’s health care reform in Massachusetts and the national health care reform law: "Completely, intellectually dishonest." A week after ruling out his own candidacy, Christie on Tuesday traveled to New Hampshire to endorse Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. During a press conference, the discussion turned to the two health care reform measures. "Any attempt to try to compare what happened in Massachusetts and what the president has done to the United States of America with his plan is completely, intellectually dishonest," Christie said. "Governor Romney did not raise one tax in doing what he did in trying to improve the health care system in Massachusetts." Here’s what PolitiFact New Jersey found: Christie is right that Romney’s plan did not raise taxes, but there are too many similarities between the two reforms to dismiss any comparisons as "completely, intellectually dishonest." First, let’s talk taxes. Enacted in March 2010, the federal law imposed taxes on drug manufacturers, health insurers, medical devices and indoor tanning services, among other tax increases. The Massachusetts law signed by Romney in 2006 did not enact taxes, but was primarily financed through federal dollars. "It’s a lot easier to not raise taxes if you have the federal government paying a large share of the tab when you’re a state," said Alan Weil, the executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy. Also, in 2008 -- after Romney left office -- Massachusetts raised the cigarette tax and imposed additional fees on private companies to help finance health-care costs. Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, said though the tax increases weren’t part of the initial health care law, they did help fund it. So, he said, "it’s not fair to say there’s no taxes raised." Like the federal law, the Massachusetts law imposes a fine on individuals who do not purchase health insurance. Some experts argued that such a penalty is a tax. "It’s government collecting money that you owe through your taxes," said Michael Doonan, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Policy Forum. "I would consider this a tax." But Ed Haislmaier, a senior research fellow in health policy studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said, "In both the Massachusetts reform and Obamacare, the individual mandate is not a tax, but a penalty enforced through the tax system." Still, the national health care reform was based on the Massachusetts plan, and the two have much in common. The core elements of the Massachusetts law include the "same essential design" as the national health care reform, according to John McDonough, a professor of public health practice at the Harvard University School of Public Health. "Regardless of the tax issue, to suggest then that there is no basis to compare the two sets of reforms is not valid," McDonough, who was involved in the passage and implementation of the Massachusetts law, said in an email. Here are a few examples of the similarities between the two reforms: Individual mandate: At the heart of both measures is the requirement that residents have health insurance, with exemptions for certain individuals. Otherwise, residents could face a tax penalty. Employer requirements: The Massachusetts law requires employers with at least 11 full-time workers to contribute toward health insurance coverage, or pay a penalty per employee. Under the federal law, if employers with at least 50 full-time employees don’t provide coverage, they must pay a fee to cover the cost of tax credits used by their workers to purchase insurance. Medicaid expansion: Both measures expand Medicaid in different ways. The national health care reform expands Medicaid to all non-Medicare eligible individuals under 65 years old who meet certain income requirements. In Massachusetts, the state’s Medicaid program was expanded to cover children with family incomes up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level. Insurance exchanges: Both measures establish insurance exchanges where individuals and small businesses can purchase insurance. "All of the basic elements are really, frankly quite similar," said Sarah Iselin, president of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation. Our ruling Christie dismissed comparisons between the federal health care law and the Massachusetts health insurance reform as "completely, intellectually dishonest," saying the state plan "did not raise one tax." The state reform did not include tax increases, but it includes several core elements similar to those in the national reform. To deny that those similarities exist would be dishonest.

pomt-03825	Says Virginia, Florida and Georgia are the three states that are the principal source for gun trafficking.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/mar/20/jim-moran/congressman-says-3-states-lead-nation-gun-traffick/	The gun-debate rhetoric has been constant in the months since the Newtown shooting in Connecticut in December. Elected officials at every level have pitched gun control proposals, including President Barack Obama, whose $500 million package of gun legislation includes an assault weapons ban and universal background checks for gun buyers. Last month, U.S. Rep. Jim Moran talked about Newtown and gun proposals during floor debate about gun violence. In discussing background checks and gun trafficking, Moran urged his fellow lawmakers to "act responsibly" and approve some of the gun control measures. "In Virginia, we are one of the three states that are the principal source for trafficking of guns. Florida and Georgia are the other two," Moran said during a floor discussion of the issues. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if the Peach State, and the other two states, actually held this unfortunate distinction. And what about Texas? With its close proximity to Mexico and that country’s history of illegal gun activity, surely the Lone Star State was high on the gun trafficking list. Moran made his comments alongside fellow Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif. Speier was shot five times in 1978, while serving as a staff member to then-U.S. Rep. Leo Ryan. The two officials were part of a rescue attempt of constituents from the People’s Temple compound in Jonestown, Guyana. Ryan was killed by gunfire on the mission. Moran’s office pointed us to a September 2010 "Trace the Guns" report by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a self-described coalition of more than 900 U.S. mayors that works to help law enforcement target illegal guns. The study is based on "crime gun trace data" from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. According to the report, for the years 2007 through 2009, the states of Florida and Virginia ranked second or third among all states as the source for recovered firearms used in crimes in other states. Georgia ranked first each of those years, as well as in 2006, when Texas held the third position, beating out Florida. During those four years, nine of the top 10 source states for the trafficked guns -- Georgia, Florida, Virginia, Texas, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and California -- remained the same. In 2009, the top 10 states supplied 49 percent of the crime guns that crossed state lines. The study authors note that states with larger populations, like those in the top 10, can be expected to be a source of more crime guns. Controlling for population produces a crime gun "export rate," the number of recovered crime guns purchased in states other than the purchase state, per 100,000 people. Using the export rate calculations, state rankings on the trafficking list change. Virginia and Georgia dropped to Nos. 7 and 10, respectively, in 2009, the data year included in the report. Florida ranked 29th, just above the national average. Topping the per capita list were Mississippi, West Virginia and Kentucky, which occupied the top three positions. The three states of Virginia, Florida and Georgia, mentioned by Moran, have similarities that influence their gun trafficking rankings, said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. "Not all gun sales in these states are regulated, the states don’t tend to have any type of regulatory oversight of gun dealers and they are all along the I-95 corridor," he said. That interstate corridor, running along the eastern seaboard from Maine to Florida, is seen as a pipeline for illegal goods. Webster’s center recently completed a book, "Reducing Gun Violence in America," examining the relationship of gun sales regulations and the rate at which guns cross borders into the hands of criminals. "There is a lot of profit to be made in the far Northeastern states where the laws are much stricter," Webster said. "A gun that can be bought in these three states at a retail price of $100 can be sold for $400 in New York City," he said. PolitiFact Georgia also found a 2011 study conducted by Brown University economist Brian Knight that explored the state-to-state flow of illegal firearms in the country and examined the role of state gun regulations. That study, also based on ATF crime gun data, found that guns flow from states with less restrictive gun laws into states with restrictive laws. For example, the report found that the largest firearm suppliers to New York are Florida, Georgia and Virginia. Gun control organizations have given the three states that Moran mentions low ratings for their gun laws. On the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence’s 2011 scorecard, Virginia received a 12; Georgia received an 8; Florida got a 3 on a scale to 100 on the strength of the states’ gun laws. Similarly, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave all three states D’s in its 2012 "Gun Laws Matter" report grading state gun laws. Earlier this month, a U.S. Senate committee passed a bill that makes gun trafficking a federal crime with up to 25 years in prison for people who legally buy guns but give them to others who use them in crimes. And last month, members of both parties in the U.S. House introduced a gun proposal that would increase penalties on the illegal purchase and transportation of guns. So what’s the draw? U.S. Rep. Jim Moran said that the states of Virginia, Florida and Georgia are the principal source for gun trafficking, and urged his congressional colleagues to pass some of the proposed gun control measures. Based on crime gun data recorded by the ATF and cited in several studies and publications, those three states hold the top three spots from 2007 to 2009 for crime guns that are trafficked to other states. In 2006, Texas overtook Florida for the third spot, but Georgia held the top position throughout the four-year period. Adjusting for population, Virginia and Georgia still rank in the top 10 gun-exporting states, but Florida drops to No. 29. Moran’s statement is accurate but lacks that important detail. Ultimately, the data and experts tie the gun trafficking to states’ gun laws, and these three states have laws that are less restrictive than others surrounding them. We rated Moran’s statement Mostly True.	None	Jim Moran	None	None	None	2013-03-20T06:00:00	2013-02-27	['Georgia_(U.S._state)', 'Virginia']

pomt-11646	"The Legionella bacteria is in most water systems in Illinois."	half-true	/illinois/statements/2018/jan/16/bruce-rauner/rauner-says-legionella-bacteria-most-water-systems/	In 2015, during Bruce Rauner’s first year as governor, a virulent outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease at the state-run Illinois Veterans’ Home in downstate Quincy killed 12 residents and sickened dozens of others. Since then, according to recent news reports, the facility has been plagued by more illness and deaths from Legionnaires’, which experts say is usually linked to the inhaling of a bacteria that thrives in poorly maintained water systems. It was also reported by WBEZ that Rauner administration officials delayed public disclosure of the 2015 outbreak for nearly a week after discovering it. Critics claim the governor’s failure to act quickly to safeguard the water at Quincy after the initial incident displayed an indifference to the fate of the elderly military veterans who live there. Family members of victims have filed suit against the state over their deaths. Meanwhile, one potential Democratic challenger to Rauner’s re-election, J.B. Pritzker, began running TV spots attacking the Republican incumbent’s handling of the Quincy situation. Rauner insists his administration did not drop the ball, and recently spent seven days living at the home to make a public show that it was safe. He also took aim at the media for casting blame his way without telling the whole story. In an interview with the editorial board of the Joliet Herald-News, Rauner said news reports failed to explain that the source of the disease is basically everywhere. "The reality is, and this is what’s not getting into the reports, the Legionella bacteria is in most water systems in Illinois," Rauner told the paper. "There were just two infections of Legionnaires at Northwestern Hospital, which is not even an old facility and I think is regarded as a really well-run facility. These things happen." We wondered if the governor is right. Are bacteria that can cause Legionnaires’ disease lurking in most building water systems? And, if so, what public health danger does that pose? Dangerous, but largely preventable Legionnaires’ disease is a severe and sometimes deadly form of pneumonia that derives its name from its first recognized outbreak in 1976 at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia. Most at risk are the elderly and those with compromised immune systems, cited by state officials as one reason why the outbreaks at the Quincy facility proved so serious. Legionnaires is spread through aerosolized water drops inhaled into the lungs, with showers, faucets, hot tubs and mist from large building air-conditioning units serving as common sources for spreading the infection. The disease is unlikely to be spread from drinking contaminated water. Rachel Bold, a spokeswoman for Rauner, cited explanations from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and the scientific journal PLOS One to reinforce his claim that bacteria that can cause the disease are widespread. However, none of those sources contained information confirming that a majority of Illinois building water systems contained the bacteria, known as Legionella. Erik Olson, health program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Legionella likely can be found in many water systems. Even so, Olson said it was "misleading" for Rauner to attempt to frame the danger so broadly. Trace amounts of the bacteria don’t pose a threat unless allowed to grow due to poor building maintenance, Olson explained. He likened the phenomenon to that of coliform bacteria, which are also widespread in the environment. Many forms of coliform bacteria are harmless, he said, while some can lead to potentially deadly E. coli in food if proper sanitation procedures are not followed. The CDC also stresses that poor building maintenance — rather than the widespread presence of low-level bacteria — is the main culprit in Legionnaires’ outbreaks. Legionella is naturally occurring and is present at low levels in water sources such as lakes and rivers. Therefore, it’s assumed by government officials that the bacteria makes its way into building systems. However, there’s no quantifiable data. "We don’t actually have an exact number or even proportion," CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said in an interview. State health departments report annual incidents of Legionnaires’ cases to the CDC. There were 6,000 cases reported nationwide in 2015. An estimated 9 to 10 percent of all cases result in death, Nordlund said, though the agency doesn’t ask states to report numbers of deaths from the disease. In 2015, the city of Chicago advised building owners to check and clean water supply systems to guard against the spread of Legionnaires. "Legionella bacteria are present at low levels in many water systems," the city letter stated. "Background levels of Legionella are not known to be a significant risk when associated with proper water quality management of water systems." Northwestern Memorial Hospital spokesman Christopher King confirmed Rauner’s claim that two patients treated at the hospital within the past six months tested positive for Legionella. The hospital is working with state health officials and conducting its own review "to determine if these two cases are related," he said, declining to comment further. Our ruling Rauner says news reports about his administration’s response to recurring incidents of Legionnaires’ disease at the Illinois Veterans’ Home in Quincy leave out a key part of the story: "The Legionella bacteria is in most water systems in Illinois." The governor’s statement glosses over the reality that any such contamination is likely present at low and non-threatening levels. The use of the word "most" is also questionable since there’s no real quantifiable evidence. The CDC avoids quantifying the presence of the bacteria, which thrives on slime in poorly maintained internal water systems. The governor has a point that the bacteria lurks in a number of water systems. But his statement makes an unprovable claim about the extent of the contamination. The governor’s claim is overbroad and lacking in context. We rate it Half True.	None	Bruce Rauner	None	None	None	2018-01-16T12:00:00	2018-01-03	['Illinois']
pomt-11505	"Here in Florida, despite 14 school shootings in eight years, we still have some of the weakest gun laws in the nation."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/feb/23/philip-levine/14-schools-shootings-2010-florida-not-really/	In the wake of the Parkland, Fla. shooting, Democratic candidate for governor Philip Levine released a TV ad promoting tighter gun restrictions and documenting an alarming number of school shootings in the state. Levine, the former mayor for Miami Beach released the 30-second ad after the Feb. 14 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that killed 17 people. Levine will face several other Democratic challengers in the primary on Aug. 28. "When we send our children off to school, we want to know they're safe," Levine says as he steps off a school bus. "But here in Florida, despite 14 school shootings in eight years, we still have some of the weakest gun laws in the nation." Have there really been 14 school shootings in Florida since 2010, and does Florida have some of the weakest gun laws in the nation? ‘14 school shootings in eight years’ There isn’t one uniform way to track school shootings in the United States. Methodologies and definitions vary with each group collecting data, offering a range of numbers on the prevalence of school shootings in recent years. To back up Levine’s claim, spokesman Christian Ulvert sent PolitiFact Florida a list of 14 events that he described as school shootings. Ulvert said he compiled the list after vetting news articles about shootings. Wikipedia also lists 14 school shootings in Florida over the past eight years. Ulvert also sent along a tweet from WFTV investigative and political reporter Christopher Heath who reiterated the statistic. The list indeed includes 14 incidents in the last eight years (actually since 2012). But the descriptions and circumstances of many of the events are quite different than what occurred in Parkland. Date Location Details March 6, 2012 Episcopal School of Jacksonville Shane Schumerth, a Spanish teacher who had been fired, went to the Episcopal School of Jacksonville armed with an AK-47. Schumerth shot and killed the Head of the School, Dale Regan. Schumerth then killed himself in the office. Jan. 7, 2013 Apostolic Revival Center Christian School, Fort Myers, Florida Kristopher Smith, 27, was killed by gunshots fired at the school. Police believed it to be a retaliation killing, possibly for speaking with police about a previous event. A news report does not mention who killed Smith, including if that person was a student. March 18, 2013 University of Central Florida James Oliver Seevakumaran, 30-year-old student, pulled a fire alarm at the Tower One dormitory to attract a crowd. After threatening to shoot his roommate; he released the roommate, who ran out and called 9-1-1. Seevakumaran then fatally shot himself in the head. Oct. 4, 2013 Outside Agape Christian Academy A 16-year-old student was shot in the hip outside of the academy after a fight broke out. An innocent bystander was hit by a stray bullet or shrapnel. Two victims were treated for minor injuries. Dec. 4, 2013 Near a soccer field on the campus of West Orange High School A 17-year-old student shot and injured a 15-year-old student near a soccer field on campus. Jan. 30, 2014 Parking lot of Eastern Florida State College A student and two others were fighting in a parking lot when the student pulled out a gun and shot one of the men in the chest. March 12, 2014 Behind the Academy of Knowledge Preschool An elementary school teacher was shot and killed by her husband. Sept. 9, 2014 Parking lot of Stellar Leadership Academy in northwest Miami-Dade After a fight broke out, someone fired a gun. One person was injured. Nov. 20, 2014 Near the Strozier Library at Florida State University A gunman opened fire on FSU’s campus, leaving three students injured before he was killed by campus police. Nov. 20, 2014 Miami Carol City High School Two teenagers were shot during a fight. One boy died. Jan. 16, 2015 Parking lot of Vanguard High School in Ocala, Fla. A gunman opened fired in the parking lot, injuring one 14-year-old girl and a 19-year-old woman. (Woman was cut by glass) Feb. 23, 2015 Music building at Bethune-Cookman University Two students were arguing and one pulled out a gun. Three students were injured. May 12, 2015 Jacksonville (a school bus on 118th Street) A 16-year-old student was accused of firing five bullets at a school bus. Two students were injured. Feb. 14, 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting A 19-year-old former student began shooting students and staff members with a semi-automatic rifle, killing 17 people and leaving 14 more injured. So there are 14 documented incidents in which a gun was fired inside a school or on or near school property since 2012. Of those shootings shootings: Seven involved no deaths; Four occurred during a fight between specific people or students; Three of the seven incidents that resulted in deaths did not involve students; One was an incident between a wife and her husband. We presented the list from Levine’s office to Jaclyn Schildkraut, an assistant professor in the Department of Public Justice at the State University of New York at Oswego. Schildkraut said she only considered two of the incidents "school shootings" — the Feb. 14 shooting at Stoneman Douglas and the Nov. 20, 2014, shooting at Florida State University. She said the shooters at Stoneman Douglas and FSU had similar motivations, unlike the other incidents on the list that happened after or during an altercation. "He goes into a place that he knows is populated and randomly starts shooting," she said. "It’s not targeted violence like the fights and the case where a woman was shot by her husband." Florida has ‘some of the weakest gun laws in the nation’ To back this point up, Ulvert sent PolitiFact Florida a link to an NBC News article that cited a 2016 report from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that supports more restrictive gun regulation. Florida does have weak gun laws based on this analysis, but saying it has some of the weakest requires context. According to the report, Florida received an F for its gun laws, the lowest grade a state can receive. But so did 24 other states. Grades are assigned based on how many "points" a state earns. The more points, the better the grade. For example, states can earn points if they require a background check for every firearm sale and lose points for laws that allow people to carry concealed, loaded guns in public without a permit, among other things. In a news release, Giffords Law Center also notes that in 2016 Florida had "the nation’s 26th highest gun death rate … and was ranked the 26th worst state for firearm laws." Giffords said Mississippi received the worst score in 2016. While Mississippi received an F last year, its ranking dropped from 49 to 50 because it enacted a law that allows people to carry hidden, loaded guns in public without a license. Following the shooting, Giffords Law wrote a news brief pointing out some of Florida’s permissive laws, which included the state’s pre-emption law that sought to prevent local governments from passing new gun restrictions on their own. The organization claims the law was "designed to severely restrict local authority to regulate firearms." It also said that Florida’s "stand your ground" law was amended recently to make it "even more dangerous." Our ruling Levine said that "despite 14 school shootings in eight years (in Florida), we still have some of the weakest gun laws in the nation." Levine can count 14 instances in the past eight years where guns were discharged on school grounds. But describing those 14 instances as school shootings is misleading, an expert told us, particularly when compared with, and in the context of, the shooting in Parkland. A group that supports tighter gun restrictions, meanwhile, says that Florida does have weak gun laws. But two dozen states share that same description. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-00210	A letter to President Donald Trump from 22 senators "is a way of saying to the president, ‘You are now under an affirmative requirement, legal requirement, to investigate' " journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance and suspected murder.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2018/oct/16/andrea-mitchell/can-congress-force-donald-trump-investigate-missin/	A group of senators is pressuring President Donald Trump to respond more aggressively to Saudi Arabia’s suspected disappearance and murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi nearly two weeks ago at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul. The lawmakers have invoked a novel legal mechanism from the Global Magnitsky Act to try to compel the Trump administration to investigate the fate of Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident who had been living in the United States. The bipartisan slate of 22 senators penned a letter requesting that Trump order an investigation and report back its findings within 120 days. "The Magnitsky letter," Mitchell said, "is a way of saying to the president, ‘You are now under an affirmative requirement, legal requirement, to investigate this,’ which the administration did not want to do, investigate it with a time limit." Mitchell, who is NBC News’ chief foreign affairs correspondent, was explaining the issue on the Oct. 14 broadcast of Meet the Press. We were curious if she was right, so we decided to fact-check her. Mitchell is correct that lawmakers are attempting to use the 2016 Global Magnitsky Act to signal that Trump is obligated to look into Khashoggi’s disappearance, and it’s the first time lawmakers have invoked that provision. Here, we’ll explore how the law works, as well as some of its possible limits. Global Magnitsky Act investigation The "Magnitsky letter" that Mitchell referred to arrived at the White House Oct. 10, about a week after Khashoggi’s disappearance. The letter was a request from Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who are, respectively, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. They were joined by 20 other senators, including Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee. "The recent disappearance of Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi suggests that he could be a victim of a gross violation of internationally recognized human rights," the senators wrote. "Therefore, we request that you make a determination on the imposition of sanctions pursuant to the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act with respect to any foreign person responsible for such a violation related to Mr. Khashoggi." Sergei Magnitsky was a Russian accountant who was tortured and died in 2009 in a Moscow jail after exposing Russian corruption, according to Human Rights Watch. In 2012, Congress passed a law bearing his name that sanctioned high-ranking Russian officials who were believed to have committed serious human rights violations. A second law — known as the Global Magnitsky Act — cleared Congress in December 2016. It extended the first law’s accountability mission beyond Russia’s borders by authorizing the executive branch to impose visa bans and other sanctions on human rights violators anywhere in the world. Congress also has a role to play. The process begins with the chairman and ranking member of an appropriate congressional committee sending the president a written request. They can ask the president to investigate if a human rights violation — like extrajudicial killing or torture — has been committed. The target of abuse must be someone who was either working to expose illegal activity of government officials, or was engaged in some other kind of protected activity, like free expression, as in the case of a dissident journalist. Under the law, the president has up to 120 days, from the time of the request, to determine if a human rights violation occurred. The law also states "the president shall submit a classified or unclassified report" to the committee’s top members. That report should say whether the president will impose sanctions, and what they entail. Limits of Global Magnitsky Act According to some experts, despite the law’s clear language, the president may not have to comply with the request, after all. A statement President Barack Obama made in 2016 when he signed the Global Magnitsky Act into law made clear that he believed this provision violated the separation of congressional and presidential power. "(The provision) purports to require me to determine whether a foreign person has committed a sanctionable human rights violation when I receive a request to do so from certain members of Congress," Obama wrote in a signing statement. "Consistent with the constitutional separation of powers, which limit the Congress's ability to dictate how the executive branch executes the law, I will maintain my discretion to decline to act on such requests when appropriate." Rob Berschinski, a senior vice president at the advocacy group Human Rights First and a former official in Obama’s State Department, said Trump could use Obama’s signing statement as an out. "Theoretically, the Trump administration could point to that signing statement and say this is an infringement on executive branch prerogative," Berschinski said. "At the end of the day, the Magnitsky Act is an executive authority that was passed into law. But it’s purely elective." Ultimately, it would be up to the courts to decide whether the provision authorizing Congress to request the White House to conduct human rights investigations is constitutional or not. Even if the courts were to strike down the provision, Congress would not be powerless, though. It could legislate sanctions, or take actions related to U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Still, Berschinski said the senators’ message in their letter to Trump was unmistakable. "It was a very strong signal of congressional intent," he said. Our ruling Mitchell said a letter to Trump from 22 senators "is a way of saying to the president, ‘You are now under an affirmative requirement, legal requirement, to investigate’ " Khashoggi’s suspected murder. Mitchell is correct that the Global Magnitsky Act contains a provision that allows certain members of congress to ask the president to carry out investigations of suspected human rights violations. Experts agreed the letter sent to the White House by 22 senators was a clear signal of congressional intent to oblige Trump to look into the circumstances surrounding Khashoggi’s disappearance. That said, Obama said upon signing the law in 2016 that he believes the provision violates the separation of powers — and at least some legal experts agree. We rate this Mostly True.

abbc-00007	The plight of South Africa's farmers caught the attention of local politicians recently when Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton suggested white farmers were being persecuted and deserved "special attention" under Australia's humanitarian immigration program.	in-the-red	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-05/fact-check-were-400-white-south-african-farmers-murdered-year/9591724	Mr Abbott's claim is baseless. There are no official statistics available for the past 12 months. The most recent police statistics show that 74 people were murdered on farms in the year to March 2017. That figure is well below the 400 claimed by Mr Abbott. Moreover, it includes all farmers, workers, families and visitors and all races. More recent figures, which identify white farmers, are available from the Transvaal Agricultural Union, a group representing the interests of farmers. According to their figures, there were 84 farm murders in the 2017 calendar year. Of these, 59 victims were white farmers. A further 15 people, including 8 white farmers, were killed on farms in the first three months of 2018. That means fewer than 70 white farmers were killed in the last 15 months. The police's latest data does reveal a rise in farm murders compared with the previous year, as does the union's data. However, experts told Fact Check that these changes reflected a general increase in murders across the entire South African population since 2012.

pomt-01767	Twenty percent of single adults, ages 21 to 25 with no kids, "are not working or even in school trying to find a job."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jul/30/paul-ryan/one-five-single-childless-adults-their-early-20s-n/	Many of us know people in their early 20s, single with no kids, no longer in school. And not working. But just how common is that these days? On July 25, 2014, the day after he unveiled a new anti-poverty agenda, U.S. House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan did an interview with conservative talk show host Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM (620) in Milwaukee. Sykes asked the Wisconsin Republican why conservatives shouldn’t be skeptical of one proposal in the plan, an expansion of the federal earned income tax credit, which allows lower- and moderate-wage workers to keep more of what they earn. Sykes said the credit can be viewed as "income redistribution." Ryan responded by saying the credit helps address "these high disincentives of losing benefits on welfare if you go to work. The EITC helps pull people into work. It actually rewards work." He added: "When you look at society today, where we have probably the biggest problem with people going to work, it’s young, childless adults. It’s young people without kids, who are single, from 21 to 25 years old. Twenty percent of them in America are not working or even in school trying to find a job. And that is a real problem for society." We figured the 20 percent figure might seem high to some readers, low to others. It turns out that, for a different, broader group of young people, that figure is in the ballpark. But there are no national statistics specifically for the group Ryan cited. "Disconnected youths" Concerns about Americans in their late teens and early 20s have been raised since at least 2007, when Congress held hearings on how they become detached from work and school. Two years later, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service did a report on "disconnected youths." It observed that those ages 16 to 24 who are not working nor in school "may have difficulty gaining the skills and knowledge needed to attain self-sufficiency." Since then, the concerns may have deepened. In 2013, the Congressional Research Service reported that from 2000 through 2010, people 16 to 24 "experienced the steepest declines in employment." And in a May 2014 report, the liberal Economic Policy Institute said that even as the unemployment rate for people under 25 was about double the overall rate, there was little evidence they have been able to "shelter in school," given that college enrollment rates have dropped substantially since 2012. Ryan’s claim When we asked Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert about Ryan’s 20 percent claim, he cited President Barack Obama’s own proposal, made in March 2014, to expand the earned income tax credit. A chart included in Obama’s proposal indicates that 19 percent of 21- to 24-year-olds are neither working nor in school. That appears to be close to the percentage Ryan cited -- except for two things. Ryan referred to 21- to 25-year-olds, while the Obama proposal referred to people ages 21 to 24. More importantly, Ryan spoke only of single and childless adults. Obama’s figure was for everyone in that age group, including those who are married. When we pointed out the differences to Seifert, he told us Ryan "misspoke in relaying the specific statistic from the White House's report, but the larger point made in his remarks remains accurate -- that young Americans, the vast majority of which are single, are either unemployed or not in school and that's a problem." The White House report didn’t cite a source for its 19 percent figure. But we found that according to the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, 19 percent of adults ages 20 to 24 -- a slightly different age group than was cited in the White House report -- were not enrolled in school and were not working in 2013. That figure includes all adults in that age group -- single and married, with or without kids. Both the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics told us there are no federal statistics for the group Ryan cited in terms of the percentage not in school and not working. Our rating Ryan said 20 percent of single adults without kids, ages 21 to 25, "are not working or even in school trying to find a job." The latest federal figures show that 19 percent of adults ages 20 to 24 weren’t in school and weren’t working in 2013. But that statistic is for a slightly different age range than what Ryan cited. And it includes everyone in that range, not just the single adults without kids that Ryan cited. Since Ryan acknowledges he misstated the statistic, and there are no federal figures for the group he cited, we rate his claim False.

pomt-13038	"Wisconsin uses voting machines that are outlawed, they are illegal."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/29/jill-stein/seeking-recount-donald-trump-win-jill-stein-says-w/	Capitalizing on voter discontent and perhaps looking to broaden her political base, Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein raised millions of dollars over the Thanksgiving holiday to pay for presidential election recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. On Nov. 26, 2016, a Saturday evening, Stein explained the effort on her weekly broadcast on Facebook -- and made a provocative claim about Wisconsin and the election here. "Hello, good evening, Facebook friends, revolutionaries, citizens of the planet and of America," the Massachusetts activist and physician began on the video. Later, she declared: "Wisconsin uses voting machines that have been outlawed. They are illegal to use them because they are so prone to tampering and hacking. They are an invitation, really, for malfeasance. Those are used in the state of Wisconsin." It seems like something more serious than a recount would be under way if outlawed voting machines had been used to help Republican Donald Trump win, if not in a landslide, the White House. Stein’s campaign told us the candidate was actually referring to California banning electronic, touch-screen voting machines, but acknowledged that the machines are not banned in Wisconsin. Hmmm. Legal in Wisconsin In 2004, California’s secretary of state banned the use of a particular brand of electronic voting machines because of security and reliability concerns and decertified others until steps could be taken to upgrade their security. Part of the concern was the touch-screen machines didn’t provide a paper trail at the time of voting. In Wisconsin, the vast majority of voting machines are optical readers. Voters fill out a paper ballot and feed it into the machine, which then electronically records the vote. A small percentage of votes in Wisconsin are cast on touch-screen machines -- but those in use here do generate a paper record for each ballot cast. All voting equipment in Wisconsin has been approved by the Wisconsin Election Commission (or one of its predecessors), Kevin Kennedy, Wisconsin’s former elections director, told us. And in order to be approved, the equipment had to first pass national testing standards. Before 2006, the equipment was tested under the auspices of the National Association of Election Directors (NASED). Since 2006, testing has been done under the auspices of the U.S Elections Assistance Commission, a federal agency. There are no federal requirements that states must use certain machines, said Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. In other words, each state decides what’s legal. Our rating Stein said: "Wisconsin uses voting machines that are outlawed, they are illegal." California banned electronic, touch-screen machines. But the touch-screen machines that are used by a distinct minority of voters in Wisconsin are approved by the Wisconsin Election Commission. They’re legal. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, we rate Stein’s claim Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ac38ea9a-665f-447d-9e20-91c6282b9994 More factchecks on the voting process ➤ Trump said: "Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake." Our rating: True. As long as you meet the deadline, several days before election day, you can "spoil" your original ballot and cast a new one. ➤ Did an election clerk in Green Bay refuse to allow early voting on the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay campus because she "was afraid it would help Democrats," showing "outrageous partisan bias"? Half True. Yes, she was concerned about favoring Democrats, but there were other reasons, too, for not opening an early voting site. ➤ Also Half True was a claim by comedian Amy Schumer that "anyone who knows you can just" look it up to "see if you voted." Generally speaking, an individual’s voting history is a public record, though how easy it is to access can vary.	None	Jill Stein	None	None	None	2016-11-29T16:08:54	2016-11-26	['None']

pomt-03933	"There’s more murders with hammers last year than...shotguns and pistols and AK-47s."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/21/bill-jackson/gun-claim-goes-awry/	(Update: Those pesky, yet observant, PolitiFact Georgia readers. Several took note of our recent fact-check of state Sen. Bill Jackson. We looked at this precise statement: "More murders were committed last year with hammers than with shotguns, rifles or AK-47s." That statement, which appeared in news stories, is accurate, according to FBI homicide statistics. Trouble is there is a video of Jackson’s statement. And in that video he uses the word "pistols" instead of "rifles." That changes the entire thrust of his statement. We called the reporter who wrote the initial news story. He checked his notes and agrees he got the quote wrong. Our readers were correct. And we dedicate the following revised fact-check to their keen observation skills.) Some gun control critics are using a similar talking point in the national debate over this issue. "There’s more with hammers than with shotguns and pistols and AK-47s," said state Sen. Bill Jackson, a Republican from Appling. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Jackson’s remarks were accurate, or was he attempting to make a political point with a bogus claim? We quickly discovered our partners at other PolitiFact operations have examined similar claims before. Here’s what they found: In January, some Facebook posts began to circulate that were critical of the White House’s proposal to restrict the availability of some weapons. "Facts gun-control advocates don’t want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?" it read. The FBI figures also showed that 356 people were killed with shotguns. PolitiFact reviewed 2011 FBI data on the types of weapons used to commit murders. The numbers posted on Facebook nearly matched the FBI data. The Facebook post of how many people were killed with hands or feet was two below the FBI total of 728. A few weeks later, our partners at PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim from that state’s attorney general, Greg Abbott. "FBI: More people killed with hammers & clubs each year than rifles," Abbott said in a Twitter post. He supplied a link to a Jan. 3, 2013, Fox News commentary piece that originated on the conservative website Breitbart.com and referred to FBI murder statistics from 2005 through 2011. PolitiFact Texas noted Abbott used selective data to base his claim. That said, PolitiFact Texas noted, it is correct that FBI data indicates that in 2011, more people were killed with "clubs and hammers" than with any type of rifle. They rated his claim True. At first hearing, Jackson’s claim sounds similar. But when you note that he includes pistols, or handguns, in his comparison, the similarities begin to fade. Here are the 2011 FBI totals (the most recent year available) for the types of weapons used in homicides: Handguns: 6,220 Rifles: 323 Shotguns: 356 Blunt Objects: 496 As you can see, there’s a big difference between the handgun total and the rifles total and the total for shotguns. Webster's defines a pistol as a handgun. U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, an Athens Republicans, made a similar claim to Jackson, which we rated Pants on Fire. To sum up, Jackson said there were more people killed with hammers than shotguns and pistols and AK-47s. There were actually 12 times as many people killed with handguns in 2011 than with blunt objects like hammers. Jackson’s claim is way off. Mark Twain once said the difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter - it’s the difference between a lightning bug and the lightning. And where there’s lightning, things are bound to get hot -- we said that. We rate Jackson’s claim Pants on Fire.	None	Bill Jackson	None	None	None	2013-02-21T11:31:46	2013-02-11	['None']

pomt-00241	"Every single Democrat in the U.S. Senate has signed up for the open borders, and it's a bill, it's called the ‘open borders bill.’"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-claims-theres-open-borders-bi/	President Donald Trump went to Kansas to rally for Republicans seeking election in November and in the process made false claims about Democrats signing on to a purported "open borders bill." "Every single Democrat in the U.S. Senate has signed up for the open borders, and it's a bill, it's called the ‘open borders bill.’ What's going on? And it's written by, guess who? Dianne Feinstein," Trump said Oct. 6 in Topeka. Overall, Trump portrayed Democrats as too extreme and radical for public office and cast fear that if the alleged Democratic bill ever became law, "a tidal wave of drugs and crime would pour into our nation like never, ever before." There are layers of falsehoods to what Trump said. A main one? There’s no "open borders bill." Trump on the campaign trail: His 3 reasons to fear Democrats, fact-checked Trump is misrepresenting a bill introduced in June by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called the Keep Families Together Act. The intention of that bill isn’t to create open borders, but to prevent the separation of immigrant families arriving at U.S. borders. We’ve fact-checked other Republican attacks on this bill and its companion in the U.S. House of Representatives. A False claim in Missouri said the bill "would give a free pass to any illegal immigrant who brings a child to the border." Similarly, a False claim in Arizona about the House bill said it was "essentially encouraging child trafficking." Here are the facts. Keep Families Together Act is not ‘Open Borders bill’ Feinstein introduced the Keep Families Together Act at the height of family separations caused by Trump’s "zero-tolerance" immigration policy. The bill sought to prohibit federal agents and officers from separating a child from a parent or legal guardian at or near a port of entry or within 100 miles of U.S. borders. Separations would be allowed under specific circumstances: if the child is a victim of trafficking or at significant risk of it; if there's a strong likelihood that the adult is not the parent; or if the child is in danger of abuse or neglect. State courts and state or county child welfare agencies could also separate a child from a parent if it's in the child's best interest. The point of Feinstein’s bill is to prohibit separations as a policy to deter immigrants from coming to the United States, "or for the policy goal of promoting compliance with civil immigration laws." "The bill would not grant illegal immigrants a ‘pass’ — free or otherwise — to enter or live legally or illegally in the United States," David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute think tank told us for a similar Missouri fact-check. Immigration experts have also told us that the Senate and House versions of Keep Families Together Act don’t prohibit the removal or detention of adults and families. The proposals also don’t supersede immigration laws. Immigrants would still have to go through proceedings to proof any claims for asylum or other relief. Feinstein’s bill also calls for annual reports on family separations. Such reports would include whether an adult was charged with a crime, the type of crime, if the adult was prosecuted, and the outcome. Trump routinely claims Democrats want "open borders." He bases this attack line on Democrats' general opposition to Trump’s promised U.S.-Mexico border wall. Democrats favor other border security measures and argue that the wall would be too expensive, especially since Mexico refuses to pay for it. Our ruling Trump said, "Every single Democrat in the U.S. Senate has signed up for the open borders, and it's a bill, it's called the ‘open borders bill’," written by Feinstein. There is no such bill. The bill introduced by Feinstein, and supported by all Senate Democrats, is meant to stop family separations at the border. The measure does not eliminate the enforcement of immigration laws. Trump gave an inaccurate and misleading description of the bill. We rate his statement False.

pomt-13277	Says "I’ve been proven right" about "Hillary Clinton's radical call for open borders, meaning anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/12/donald-trump/trump-ive-been-proven-right-about-clinton-wanting-/	Donald Trump repeated his claim that Hillary Clinton supports open borders, pointing to an excerpt of a leaked speech as new evidence. Wikileaks released more than 2,600 hacked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, including an email with brief sections of Clinton’s paid remarks to Wall Street banks. (The Clinton campaign hasn’t confirmed or disputed the authenticity of the emails.) According to Trump, these speeches show "she wants the United States to surrender to global governance with no controls over trade or immigration." "Hillary Clinton's radical call for open borders, meaning anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all, would end the United States as we know it today," he said at an Oct. 10 rally in Pennsylvania. "By the way, weeks ago, I called out Hillary Clinton for supporting open borders and the media said I was wrong. Now, I've been proven right," he continued. "Where is the media rushing to correct these false stories? Because in the Wikileaks, it was all about open borders, free trade for everybody." Is Trump right that Clinton really does want open borders? The leaked excerpt does contain the words "open borders," but that alone doesn't make Trump's claim correct. Experts suggested Clinton could have been talking about free travel or open trade, or immigration policy. It's just not clear. What's more, Clinton's official immigration position does not contain a proposal for an open border. Clinton’s immigration plan As evidence for Trump's claim, the Trump campaign referred us to Clinton's pledge to offer immigration legislation within her first 100 days in office as well as her support for sanctuary cities. We've looked into this before, and concluded that equating Clinton's immigration plan with "open borders" is not accurate. Clinton supported 2013 legislation (which never passed) that included a path to citizenship with conditions and billions for border enforcement for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. As a candidate, she has said she would focus on deportations for violent criminals or those who pose threats. Clinton, however, does want to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to obtain a legal status. That’s not the same as getting rid of enforcement, of course, and it’s a far cry from Trump’s characterization: "Anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all." Clinton’s paid speech comment on open borders According to Trump, the Wikileaks hack vindicates his earlier charge. The speech excerpt is more ambiguous than he’s suggesting, but she does use the words "open borders." On Jan. 25, Clinton campaign research director Tony Carrk sent an email to Podesta that contained excerpts of Clinton’s paid speeches to Wall Street banks. (For months Clinton has faced calls to release the speech transcripts but hasn’t done so.) She mentioned open borders in her remarks on May 16, 2013, to the Brazilian bank Banco Itau. The excerpt, in its entirety, reads: "My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere." It’s difficult to discern exactly what she was referring to here, because we don’t have more context. The Clinton campaign didn’t respond to our request for the full speech. But a campaign spokesman pointed to statements by Podesta and Clinton’s campaign manager Robby Mook on Oct. 9. Both said the context of that sentence related to green energy -- and wasn’t about people immigrating to the United States. On Face the Nation, Mook said she was talking about integrating green energy between north and south America. "But if the question is does Hillary Clinton support throwing open our borders, absolutely not. And she is going to do everything she can to fight to protect the interest of workers in this country. That is actually why she voted against the Central American free trade agreement when she was a senator," Mook said. On Fox News Sunday, Podesta also said she was referring to clean energy. "When she was secretary of state, she talked about creating a hemispheric effort to bring clean energy across the continent from the tip of South America to Canada, to invest in clean and renewable energy, to invest in the transmission that would clean up our energy system," Podesta said. "And I think when you look at what she said about immigration, she's for comprehensive immigration reform that takes people out of the shadows, emphasizes family unity, but also has -- modernizes our border security. Are her remarks a call for open borders for immigrants? We interviewed three immigration experts and asked them if they thought she was calling for open borders for immigrants and whether it was in conflict with her campaign immigration plan. The experts said Clinton’s remarks were not a clear-cut call for open borders. They also said that her statement sounded aspirational and contained no timeline or explanation as to how she would make it happen politically. "I would note her emphasis on a ‘hemispheric’ common market, an idea that became more concrete in 1994 when her husband, Bill Clinton, hosted the first Summit of the Americas meeting in Miami," said Stephen Kelly, a Duke University public policy professor. That summit involved 34 democracies, and "open markets, hemispheric integration, and free trade" were all cited as a means of increasing prosperity at the meeting, Kelly said. Those summits have continued, and Clinton attended one in 2012 as secretary of state. "My guess would be that Clinton's Brazil speech reflects this broader call for greater hemispheric cooperation on a variety of issues, including trade," Kelly said. "Given this context, and without seeing the rest of her speech, I would also guess that the ‘open borders’ she mentions relate to the movement of goods and capital, but not people." Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a policy institute focused on foreign policy and national security, said that Clinton seemed to refer to something related to travel such as the Schengen Agreement, which abolished many of the European Union’s internal borders. For example, if the United States and Canada had such an agreement, that would not mean an open border for free immigration, but rather for free travel. "I don't think she is calling for open immigration, but the context of her remarks shows that when she says ‘open borders,’ she doesn't just mean open trade," he said. Jacob Vigdor, professor of public policy and governance University of Washington, said Clinton appeared to be talking about both trade and immigration. "I would read the remark as calling for open borders with regard to both trade and immigration. Otherwise the term ‘open trade and open borders’ would be redundant," he said. However, he said he saw no timetable in her remarks beyond "some time in the future," or discussion about how to make it happen. "I don't necessarily see a contradiction between a statement of ideals and a more pragmatic policy agenda for reality," he said. "One can dream of a crime-free world where there is need for neither police nor prisons while still supporting those things in reality." Our ruling Trump said, "I’ve been proven right" about "Hillary Clinton's radical call for open borders, meaning anyone in the world can enter the United States without any limit at all." Trump is referring to a leaked speech excerpt in which Clinton purportedly says, "My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere." We don’t have more context about what Clinton meant by "open borders" because she has not released the full speech. Her campaign has said she was talking about clean energy across the hemisphere. Trump argues that it directly applies to her current immigration policy. She has not called for open borders in this campaign.

pomt-05304	"Jimmy Langevin is having a fundraiser . . . to retire the debt from his campaign for secretary of state, which was 12 years ago."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/may/20/john-matson/ri-congressional-candidate-john-matson-says-us-rep/	Political campaigns cost a lot of money. But is Rep. James Langevin, who has been a congressman since 2001, really still trying to pay off debt from campaigns for his previous job, Rhode Island secretary of state? That’s what John O. Matson, who is running against Langevin in the Sept. 11 Democratic primary, contended during the April 26 taping of "State of the State," a public access television program that aired May 5 and 6. "Jimmy Langevin is having a fundraiser on the 3rd to retire the debt from his campaign for secretary of state, which was 12 years ago. How can anybody not pay his debts from 12 years ago? Because the Ethics Committee has no power," Matson said. "They need to be in power to make people pay up, you know, when they do something wrong. Here we are 12 years later. I got the invitation today. He's holding it to retire the debt from his secretary of state's run. Now, why wasn't it paid? The Ethics Commission would take care of that." We're not sure why the Ethics Commission -- which has nothing to do with campaign financing -- could resolve that issue. But we were curious whether a six-term congressman is still paying off debts for campaigns he ran when Bill Clinton was president, Regis was with Kathie Lee, and America Online was the big dog of the Internet. When we called Matson, he sent us a copy of the invitation for "a reception in honor of Congressman Jim Langevin to retire debt from his Secretary of State Campaign." (Matson got the date wrong. It was April 30 at Luigi's Restaurant in Johnston.) We called Langevin's office, where spokesman Jonathon Dworkin confirmed that the congressman is still raising money to cover his secretary of state campaign. Here's why. When he first ran for secretary of state, in 1994, Langevin loaned his campaign $280,000. Candidates commonly loan money to their campaigns. He held the office until 2000, when he was elected to Congress. In 2006, Langevin decided to recover his money. He asked some of his congressional colleagues to donate. They did, over five years, giving a total of $63,500. The congressman had a 2006 letter from the Rhode Island Board of Elections' chief auditor at the time, Henry Johnson, saying such contributions were legal. But the board itself, when it learned in 2011 how the contributions were being handled, said Johnson wasn't authorized to make that determination and, more importantly, Johnson was wrong. Rhode Island law says that only campaign committees legally recognized in Rhode Island can make contributions to a Rhode Island candidate. Later that year, Langevin agreed to pay the board $127,000 -- forfeiting the $63,500 and paying a penalty in the same amount of $63,500. It was the largest judgment in the board’s history. Richard Thornton, director of campaign finance at the Rhode Island Board of Elections, said that as of the end of March, Langevin's state campaign fund still owes Langevin $107,600. As for the $127,000, Langevin has been paying it off in installments, Thornton said. Currently, $47,625 remains and payments of $15,875 are due on June 30, Sept. 30 and Dec. 31. The money must come from Langevin personally, not his campaign. Finally, it should be noted, to avoid confusion, that this fundraising is separate from the fundraising Langevin is doing to get reelected to Congress. His most recent federal report shows that he raised $609,000 during the current election cycle and his campaign had $276,251 cash on hand. Our ruling Congressional candidate John O. Matson said Rep. James Langevin is still trying to raise money to cover the costs of the campaign he ran for secretary of state 12 years ago. That statement, by itself, makes Langevin sound like a deadbeat, especially when Matson refers to "debts," which suggests that more than one person is owed money. In fact, the money Langevin’s campaign owes is not to other people, but to one individual -- Langevin himself. Eighteen years ago, the candidate loaned $280,000 to his campaign. In 2006, he tried to get that money back, running afoul of state election laws. There's a big difference between owing money to others and trying to recoup funds you loaned to your own campaign, especially when Langevin is under no obligation to ever pay himself back in the first place. So Matson is correct in saying that Langevin is still trying to pay off debt racked up while running for secretary of state, but his statement leaves out important facts that might give voters a very different impression. So we'll give him a Half True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-12038	Says "the latest polls show us tied neck-and-neck" with Sen. Ted Cruz.	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/sep/14/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-says-latest-polls-show-hes-running-ev/	A West Texas Democrat seeking to represent the state in the U.S. Senate asserts that he’s already running even with incumbent Ted Cruz, who won the seat with 57 percent of the vote in 2012 before later running for president. In an August 2017 Facebook post, El Paso U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s campaign said: "Beto O’Rourke out-raised Senator Ted Cruz in the second financial quarter without taking a DIME from PACs, and the latest polls show us tied neck-and-neck." O’Rourke indeed raised more money than Cruz from April through June 2017 though Cruz, a Republican, ended the quarter with a balance of $5.7 million in campaign cash compared to O’Rourke’s $1.9 million. Also, we’ve previously noted that O’Rourke no longer takes PAC contributions. Let’s focus the Truth-O-Meter this time on whether the latest polls show O’Rourke "tied neck-and-neck" with Cruz. To our inquiry, Jody Casey of O’Rourke’s campaign emailed us a web link to an April 2017 USA Today Network news story headlined "O’Rourke, Castro running even with Cruz, poll shows," Castro being U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro of San Antonio, who later said he wouldn’t be challenging Cruz. According to the USA Today Network story, a statewide poll of 1,000 adults commissioned by the Texas Lyceum, a leadership group, found 30 percent of respondents favoring Cruz, 30 percent backing O’Rourke. That’s neck and neck--albeit with 40 percent of the respondents not accounted for. Texas Lyceum poll For the full skinny, we turned to the Lyceum’s post about the poll, which specifies that the poll was conducted statewide April 3-9, 2017, and that 890 respondents who self-identified as registered voters answered this question: "If the 2018 election for Senate were held today, would you vote for the Republican Ted Cruz, the Democrat Beto O’Rourke, or haven’t you thought enough about it?" Each time, the order of the names was randomized, according to the results. SOURCE: Documents showing topline results and crosstabs, 2017 Texas Lyceum Poll, April 18, 2017 (accessed Sept. 11, 2017) Beyond the 30 percent-30 percent split between O’Rourke and Cruz, the results indicate, 37 percent of respondents said they hadn’t thought enough about it with 3 percent refusing to reply or saying they didn’t know. By phone, Josh Blank the Texas Lyceum’s research director, told us that an observer could read the results as indicative of a neck-and-neck race; he said he thinks it’s too soon to reach that conclusion. "The electorate isn’t knowledgeable enough yet," Blank said. The April poll "is mainly a reflection of name identification and voter attitudes about" Cruz, he said. By email, Blank noted that among the 37 percent of respondents who did not choose between Cruz and O’Rourke, 36 percent identified as moderates, 33 percent identified as conservatives, and 19 percent identified as liberals. That is, Blank said, "a larger share of voters who admitted to not yet having a preference identify as conservative as opposed to liberal. When they choose to tune into the race, they are going to be predisposed towards supporting Cruz over O'Rourke." Republicans underrepresented? We asked Mike Baselice of Austin, a pollster for Republican clients who’s not working for Cruz, to assess the April poll results. By email, Baselice suggested that the poll showed Cruz and O’Rourke with identical levels of support because it surveyed too few Republicans considering the actual Texas electorate. In the poll, 27 percent of adults identified as Republican, 32 percent as Democratic and 40 percent as Independent. Thirty-seven percent self-identified as conservative, 34 percent as moderate, 21 percent as liberal. Baselice wrote: "Our surveys have shown an 8-10" percentage "point Republican advantage over Democrats in terms of partisan vote behavior. "You can look at the down-ballot races where the vast majority of the candidates are unknown to the voters, and yet we see that Republicans defeated Democrats statewide by an average of 15 points in 2016," Baselice said. That margin, by our calculation, averaged 14.8 percentage points across seven races, one for the Texas Railroad Commission and six for judicial posts. Blank, asked about Baselice’s comment, said by email that the April poll intentionally gathered the opinions of more people than likely voters. Blank said future polls, closer to the November 2018 election, will be filtered to "make the measurement of the electorate more conservative, and more in-line with the ultimate outcome " Texas Tribune survey Blank noted that more recently, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune survey of 1,200 Texas adults taken from June 2-11, 2017, found few people familiar with O’Rourke, who’s making his first bid for statewide office. That poll didn’t ask people to pick between Cruz and O’Rourke. Rather, 18 percent of respondents held a favorable view of O’Rourke, 15 percent neither favorable or unfavorable and 13 percent felt unfavorable--with 55 percent not knowing or having no opinion. In contrast, the poll found 37 percent of respondents with a favorable view of Cruz, 12 percent neither favorable or unfavorable and 45 percent unfavorable--with 6 percent not knowing or having no opinion. We otherwise heard back from Jim Williams of North Carolina-based Public Policy Polling, which serves Democratic clients. By phone, Williams said the firm last polled Texans about the 2018 U.S. Senate race in August 2016. That poll suggested Cruz would lead Democrat Wendy Davis or Julián Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and Housing and Urban Development secretary; it didn’t test Cruz versus O’Rourke. Our ruling O’Rourke said "the latest polls show us tied neck-and-neck" with Cruz. An April 2017 poll showed a 30 percent-30 percent race though a plurality of registered voters indicated they didn’t know enough to commit either way and the poll folded in too many Democrats. O’Rourke didn’t identify any other poll of the match-up nor did we find one. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-09462	"Washington cannot hide from the fact that Congress hiked the national debt ceiling to $14.3 trillion. They cannot hide from the fact . . . that the budget that they’re going forward with has more than a $5 trillion in debt in it over the next five years."	true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/04/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-congress-hiked-debt-limit-14-t/	After winning the 2010 Republican nomination for governor, Gov. Rick Perry told supporters Tuesday that energized voters are upset at congressional spending. In a wide-ranging speech, Perry specified two factors, saying: "Washington cannot hide from the fact that Congress hiked the national debt ceiling to $14.3 trillion. They cannot hide from the fact . . . that the budget that they’re going forward with has more than $5 trillion in debt in it over the next five years." Do those debt numbers hold up? Perry's campaign pointed us to news accounts of the U.S. House and Senate voting in January to raise the federal government’s debt limit to $14.3 trillion, a historic high adopted solely with Democratic votes in the Democrat-majority bodies. Proponents noted that the increase was needed to allow the government to continue borrowing and avoid default. On Perry's reference to the federal debt increasing by $5 trillion over five years, his campaign pointed to a Feb. 1 article on President Barack Obama's proposed 2011 federal budget. The story says Obama's proposal would result in deficits of $5.08 trillion over five years. Separately, Obama's proposed budget shows the nation's public debt increasing from $7.5 trillion in 2009, reflecting actions taken under President George W. Bush and the Congress that made budget decisions in 2008, to $13.1 trillion in 2014—potentially increasing $5.6 trillion. The debt increase from 2010 to 2015 is projected at $4.7 trillion. Josh Gordon of The Concord Coalition, which advocates long-term fiscal responsibilty, cautioned that much of the current and immediately expected deficits are due to economic troubles and not White House or congressional actions. Gordon said it's typical for government to run a deficit during an economic downturn. In the end, Obama’s proposed budget won’t sail through Congress; presidents (and governors) propose, lawmakers dispose. Still, Obama's proposal seems a reasonable basis for Perry’s debt claim. The governor also is correct on the size of the increased federal debt limit. We rate Perry's statement as True.

pomt-04209	Says in January 1992, George H. W. Bush "probably had a 90 percent or even higher approval rating after the first Gulf War."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/dec/02/john-wisniewski/democratic-leader-offers-cautionary-tale-gov-chris/	If Gov. Chris Christie is anything like President George H. W. Bush, the governor could go from soaring in public opinion polls to losing at the voting booth next year. That’s at least what New Jersey Democratic Party Chairman John Wisniewski suggested last week in response to polls showing rising support for the Republican governor. Christie has announced plans to seek re-election, and Wisniewski has been mentioned as a possible challenger. "No one’s unbeatable," Wisniewski, a state assemblyman from Middlesex County, said in a Nov. 27 interview on NJToday. Of Christie’s rising poll numbers, Wisniewski later added: "It’s interesting. For him, it’s great news, but it’s not dispositive on the outcome of the election at any means. "I mean, we all remember George Bush. January of 1992, (he) probably had a 90 percent or even higher approval rating after the first Gulf War, and in late November of 1992, we were calling Bill Clinton president-elect." But the Democratic leader’s history lesson is off. Soon after the Gulf War ended in February 1991, Bush had an approval rating hovering around 90 percent. However, by January 1992, the 41st president’s approval rating had dropped to less than 50 percent. Alicia D’Alessandro, a spokeswoman for Wisniewski, told us the party chairman meant to reference March 1991, when a Washington Post/ABC News poll gave Bush a 90 percent approval rating. "It seems that Chairman Wisniewski incorrectly identified the date of the poll, which can happen when you're discussing events from about two decades ago," D’Alessandro said in an e-mail. "Still, the chairman was making a point about poll numbers representing a snapshot in time, and that point still stands." To evaluate Wisniewski’s claim, we turned to presidential approval data from Gallup, which is considered one of the leading assessments of presidential performance. Gallup has measured presidential job approval ratings since Franklin D. Roosevelt was commander-in-chief. As the Gulf War ended, Bush garnered an approval rating of 89 percent, according to a Gallup poll conducted in late February and early March of 1991. That figure would turn out to be the highest approval rating of Bush’s presidency, as measured by Gallup. Then, driven in part by a staggering economy, Bush’s numbers nose-dived. The president’s approval rating gradually went down throughout the rest of 1991 before landing at 46 percent in January 1992, according to Gallup. Other polls around the same time turned up similar results for the president. A Washington Post/ABC News poll gave Bush a 45 percent approval rating, and in a New York Times/CBS News Poll, 43 percent said they approved of his performance as president. A few weeks before losing his re-election bid to Clinton, Bush’s approval rating stood at 34 percent, according to Gallup. While Bush’s approval ratings showed a sharp drop in support, the latest poll numbers for Christie demonstrate an upswing at a time when the governor has been widely praised for his leadership during Hurricane Sandy. A Quinnipiac University poll released on Tuesday put Christie's approval rating at 72 percent, marking a 16-point increase over his 56 percent approval rating in a Quinnipiac poll from October. In a poll released Tuesday by Rutgers University’s Eagleton Institute of Politics, Christie was viewed favorably by 67 percent of respondents, compared to 48 percent in a Rutgers-Eagleton poll released in early October. "The realities of governing – including the budget and a host of other contentious issues – are likely to cool the governor’s red-hot numbers over time," David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Poll and a political science professor, said in a news release. Our ruling Comparing Christie with the 41st president, Wisniewski claimed in a TV interview that in January 1992, Bush "probably had a 90 percent or even higher approval rating after the first Gulf War." The assemblyman is correct that Bush once had near-unanimous support, but he's wrong about the timing. The president's approval rating was around 90 percent in March 1991, but by January 1992, it had fallen below 50 percent. We rate the statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01627	Says he holds the record for "most appearances on 'Meet the Press'."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/27/john-mccain/john-mccain-says-he-holds-record-meet-press-appear/	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has a few pointers for Chuck Todd, who takes the helm of NBC’s Meet the Press on Sept. 7. On Aug. 27, McCain appeared on MSNBC’s the Daily Rundown as part of Todd’s weeklong send-off. "I called to congratulate you and as the person who has the most appearances on Meet the Press, I’d be glad to give you a lot of advice and counseling, including the best gotcha questions of the week," McCain said. "And I have one other suggestion, we should change the name from Meet the Press to Meet the World’s Foremost Political Junkie, And Guests. How ‘bout that?" "69 times," Todd quantified. He then rolled a montage of McCain on the show, including a 2008 interview with Tim Russert, who said that Republican Bob Dole had clocked the most appearances but "there’s still time for (McCain) to catch up." We wondered, has McCain caught up, meeting the press more times than any other guest? We’ve met before We reached out to McCain’s office and a spokesperson told us they don’t keep track of those numbers but said McCain surpassed Dole in 2012. Meet the Press’ fact page, which needs an update, still lists Dole as the most frequent guest, with 63 appearances. McCain is next with 53 appearances, and Vice President Joe Biden trails McCain by 10 appearances. McCain’s 54th appearance came on March 29, 2009, according to recently ousted host David Gregory. Dole still had the record among guests, but Gregory had encouraging words for McCain. "We've been doing the calculations here. We think we can make this up, maybe within a year's time," he said. Three years later, McCain broke Dole’s record on March 18, 2012, his 64th appearance. "You've been on this show more than I have," Gregory joked. Based on Meet the Press transcripts, McCain appeared on the show twice more in 2012. He hasn’t made an appearance this year, but went on three times in 2013, which brings his grand total to 69, according to our count. For the record, McCain has appeared on the Sunday shows 11 times so far in 2014, but not on Meet the Press. It's worth noting that NBC and McCain are using a slightly non-traditional definition of guest. Namely, it excludes journalists who appear on the show to debate the week's big stories. Again, according to NBC's out-dated fact page, the Washington Post’s David Broder clocked 401 Meet appearances, while Chicago Sun Times’ Robert Novak appeared on the show 248 times. Novak and Broder are both deceased. Our ruling McCain said that he’s "the person who has the most appearances on Meet the Press." Technically, multiple people who represent the press side of the meet have McCain beat. Of officeholders, we count McCain as the current leader -- with 69 appearances. With that caveat, we rate McCain’s claim Mostly True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2014-08-27T16:51:22	2014-08-27	['None']
